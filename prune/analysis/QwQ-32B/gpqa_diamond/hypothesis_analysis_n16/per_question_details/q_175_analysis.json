The dipole radiation power per solid angle is proportional to (sin\u03b8)^2, and the total power is proportional to (E_0/(c))^2 times some factors, but the dependence on wavelength comes from the frequency. Since for dipole radiation, the power P_total is proportional to (e^2 \u03c9^4)/(3c^3), where e is the dipole moment. Since \u03c9 is 2\u03c0f and \u03bb = c/f, so \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb. Therefore \u03c9^4 is proportional to (c/\u03bb)^4, so P_total ~ (1/\u03bb^4). Therefore the power per unit solid angle should also have that \u03bb^-4 dependence. So the f function would have a \u03bb^-4 term. \n\nLooking at the options, the possible forms of f are given, and the exponents: option C says \u03bb^-4, which would fit if it's dipole. Option A also has \u03bb^-4. \n\nNow the angle part. The question says the maximum power is A. The maximum occurs where sin^2\u03b8 is maximum, which is at \u03b8=90 degrees (sin\u03b8=1).",

The dipole radiation power per solid angle is proportional to (sin\u03b8)^2, and the total power is proportional to (E_0/(c))^2 times some factors, but the dependence on wavelength comes from the frequency. Since for dipole radiation, the power P_total is proportional to (e^2 \u03c9^4)/(3c^3), where e is the dipole moment. Since \u03c9 is 2\u03c0f and \u03bb = c/f, so \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb.
