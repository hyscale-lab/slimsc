The ratio of M to M+2 should be approximately (natural abundance of Cl-37)/(Cl-35) which is about 25/75 = 1/3. So the M+2 peak should be about 1/3 the height of M. But here the M is 100%, so M+2 should be around 33%, which matches the given 32%. That suggests the presence of one Cl atom.

Let me recalculate precisely: Cl is 35.45, so 35.45 + (12*7)= 84 +35.45 = 119.45; H6 is 6 (but maybe I'm missing some H?), wait: benzaldehyde has the formula C6H5-CHO. So benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and an -OH (so replacing a H with -OH) would give C7H6O2Cl. So molecular weight would be (7*12)+(6*1)+(2*16)+35.45 = 84 +6 +32 +35.45 = 84+6 is 90, plus 32 is 122, plus 35.45 is 157.45. The molecular ion is at 156, which is a bit off. So maybe that's not the correct option. Hmm, so perhaps that's not the right one. \n\nOption B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2.

So the molecular ion peak would be around 156, which matches the given m/z 156. The M+2 would be 156 +2=158 (since Cl-37 is present), and the ratio would be roughly 3:1 (since Cl-35 is about 75%, so the M+2 is about 25% of M). Here, the M+2 is 32% of M, which is close to that (since 25% is roughly 1/4, so the ratio would be 3:1, so 32% is close enough).
