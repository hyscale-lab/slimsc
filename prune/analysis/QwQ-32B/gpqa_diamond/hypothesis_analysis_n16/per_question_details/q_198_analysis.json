So the LHS at y=0.095 is \u22480.1027, which is 0.0027 over.

The difference between y=0.09 and 0.095 is 0.005 in y, leading to an increase of 0.00552 in LHS (0.10268-0.09716 =0.00552).\n\nWe need to reach an increase of 0.1 -0.09716 =0.00284 from the y=0.09 value.\n\nSo the fraction would be 0.00284 /0.00552 \u22480.514 of the 0.005 interval.

Solving this would be complicated, but perhaps we can approximate. \n\nAssuming that y \u22480.1 (since SCN is in excess), let's plug y=0.1 into the first equation and solve for x, then use that x to compute y via the second equation and see how much it differs. \n\nFirst equation with y=0.1:\n\nx = 1e-2 / (1 + 9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 )\n\nWhich is what I did before, giving x\u22480.004228. \n\nNow plug x and y=0.1 into the second equation to find the actual y: \n\ny + 9*(0.004228)*y + 2*40*(0.004228)*y\u00b2 + 3*63*(0.004228)*y\u00b3 +4*16*(0.004228)*y\u2074 =0.1 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: y \n\nSecond term: 9 *0.004228*y \u22480.03805*y \n\nThird term: 2*40*0.004228*y\u00b2 = 2*40*0.004228 = 0.33824 * y\u00b2 \n\nFourth term:3*63*0.004228*y\u00b3 \u22483*63*0.004228=0.800 * y\u00b3 \n\nFifth term:4*16*0.004228*y\u2074=4*16*0.004228\u22480.2693 * y\u2074 \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\ny +0.03805 y +0.33824 y\u00b2 +0.800 y\u00b3 +0.2693 y\u2074 =0.1 \n\nCombine the first two terms: (1 +0.03805)y =1.03805 y \n\nSo:\n\n1.03805 y +0.33824 y\u00b2 +0.8 y\u00b3 +0.2693 y\u2074 =0.1 \n\nNow, if we assume y is close to 0.1, let's plug y=0.1 into the left side:\n\n1.03805*0.1=0.1038 \n\n0.33824*(0.01)=0.00338 \n\n0.8*(0.001)=0.0008 \n\n0.2693*(0.0001)=0.0000269 \n\nAdding these up: 0.1038 +0.00338=0.10718 +0.0008=0.10798 +0.0000269\u22480.108. \n\nWhich is slightly higher than 0.1, so y must be a bit less than 0.1.

Close to 0.1. \n\nSo y\u22480.093. \n\nThus, the free SCN concentration is about 0.093 M. \n\nNow let's re-calculate [Co\u00b2+] with this y. \n\nThe first equation:\n\nTotal Co =x*[1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074 ] =1e-2 \n\nCompute denominator:\n\n1 +9*(0.093)+40*(0.093)^2 +63*(0.093)^3 +16*(0.093)^4 \n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1:1 \n\nTerm2:9*0.093=0.837 \n\nTerm3:40*(0.008649)=40*0.008649\u22480.34596 \n\nTerm4:63*(0.093)^3. 0.093^3\u22480.0008043 \u219263*0.0008043\u22480.05067 \n\nTerm5:16*(0.093)^4. 0.093^4\u22480.0000748 \u219216*0.0000748\u22480.001197 \n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 +0.837=1.837 \n\n+0.34596=2.18296 \n\n+0.05067\u22482.2336 \n\n+0.001197\u22482.2348 \n\nThus denominator \u22482.2348 \n\nTherefore, x =1e-2 /2.2348 \u22480.004474 M \n\nThen the concentration of [Co(SCN)\u2082] is \u03b22 *x*y\u00b2 =40 *0.004474*(0.093)^2 \n\nCompute y\u00b2:0.093\u00b2=0.008649 \n\nThus:\n\n40 *0.004474 =0.17896 \n\nMultiply by 0.008649:0.17896 *0.008649\u22480.001548 \n\nThus, [Co(SCN)\u2082] \u22480.001548 M \n\nTotal Co is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.001548 /0.01)*100\u224815.48%, which is approximately 15.5%, closer to D (16.9%) but not exactly. \n\nHmm, so considering the free SCN concentration as 0.093 gives a slightly lower percentage. The initial approximation gave 16.9%, the corrected one gives ~15.5%. \n\nBut the difference between the two is about 1.4%, which is within the options given? The options are 16.9 (D), 25.6 (B), etc. \n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use the initial approximation, given that the SCN is in sufficient excess that its concentration doesn't change much. Since the given SCN is 0.1 M and the Co is 0.01 M, the consumption is about 4*0.01=0.04 M maximum, but in reality it's less, so using 0.1 M is acceptable for an approximate calculation, especially since the options are spaced by several percent.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

So our assumption that y=0.1 gives a total SCN- of ~0.1073 M which is higher than 0.1, meaning that our initial assumption of y=0.1 is wrong.

That might simplify things.\n\nThe stability constants \u03b2n are given by:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^n)\n\nSo rearranged, each complex concentration is \u03b2n * [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n. \n\nLet me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Since c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, let me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nTerm1: 1 (the first term is 1)\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 *0.01 =0.4\nTerm4: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 =63*(0.1)^3 =63*0.001=0.063\nTerm5: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16*(0.1)^4 =16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding all terms together: 1 +0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646. \n\nSo the total denominator is approximately 2.3646. \n\nThus, x = c(Co) / (sum) = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 let's calculate that. \n\n0.01 divided by 2.3646.

So y\u22480.09257 is a good approximation.\n\nSo, we can take y\u22480.0926 (rounded).\n\nNow, with this y, we can compute S(y)=2.2273 approximately.\n\nThen, x =1e-2 / S(y) \u22481e-2 /2.2273 \u22480.004493 M.\n\nNow, to find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2):\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2 =40 *0.004493*(0.0926)^2.\n\nFirst compute y\u00b2: 0.0926\u00b2\u22480.008575.\n\nSo:\n\n40 *0.004493 *0.008575 \u224840 *0.0000385 \u22480.00154 M.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, so the fraction is 0.00154 / 0.01 =0.154 \u2192 15.4%.\n\nHmm, but this is close to 16.9% (option D) but not exactly.",

Close to 0.1. \n\nSo y\u22480.093. \n\nThus, the free SCN concentration is about 0.093 M. \n\nNow let's re-calculate [Co\u00b2+] with this y. \n\nThe first equation:\n\nTotal Co =x*[1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074 ] =1e-2 \n\nCompute denominator:\n\n1 +9*(0.093)+40*(0.093)^2 +63*(0.093)^3 +16*(0.093)^4 \n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1:1 \n\nTerm2:9*0.093=0.837 \n\nTerm3:40*(0.008649)=40*0.008649\u22480.34596 \n\nTerm4:63*(0.093)^3. 0.093^3\u22480.0008043 \u219263*0.0008043\u22480.05067 \n\nTerm5:16*(0.093)^4. 0.093^4\u22480.0000748 \u219216*0.0000748\u22480.001197 \n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 +0.837=1.837 \n\n+0.34596=2.18296 \n\n+0.05067\u22482.2336 \n\n+0.001197\u22482.2348 \n\nThus denominator \u22482.2348 \n\nTherefore, x =1e-2 /2.2348 \u22480.004474 M \n\nThen the concentration of [Co(SCN)\u2082] is \u03b22 *x*y\u00b2 =40 *0.004474*(0.093)^2 \n\nCompute y\u00b2:0.093\u00b2=0.008649 \n\nThus:\n\n40 *0.004474 =0.17896 \n\nMultiply by 0.008649:0.17896 *0.008649\u22480.001548 \n\nThus, [Co(SCN)\u2082] \u22480.001548 M \n\nTotal Co is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.001548 /0.01)*100\u224815.48%, which is approximately 15.5%, closer to D (16.9%) but not exactly. \n\nHmm, so considering the free SCN concentration as 0.093 gives a slightly lower percentage. The initial approximation gave 16.9%, the corrected one gives ~15.5%. \n\nBut the difference between the two is about 1.4%, which is within the options given? The options are 16.9 (D), 25.6 (B), etc. \n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use the initial approximation, given that the SCN is in sufficient excess that its concentration doesn't change much. Since the given SCN is 0.1 M and the Co is 0.01 M, the consumption is about 4*0.01=0.04 M maximum, but in reality it's less, so using 0.1 M is acceptable for an approximate calculation, especially since the options are spaced by several percent.",

Let me rederive it. \n\nThe total Co is:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y^4 ] = 1e-2.\n\nThe fraction for the second complex is [Co(SCN)2] / total Co = (\u03b22 x y\u00b2 ) / (1e-2).\n\nSo substituting x = 1e-2 / D, where D is the denominator:\n\nSo ( \u03b22 y\u00b2 * (1e-2 / D ) ) / (1e-2) ) = \u03b22 y\u00b2 / D \u2192 same as before.\n\nTherefore, if y is the free SCN- concentration, then the fraction is ( \u03b22 y\u00b2 ) / D. \n\nBut if we have to find y, this requires solving the two equations. Let me see if we can approximate it.\n\nSuppose that the free SCN- is not too much lower than 0.1, so let's try plugging in y=0.1 and see how close the total SCN- would be.\n\nUsing y=0.1, then compute total SCN-:\n\nTotal SCN- = y + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y^3 +4 \u03b24 x y^4.\n\nFrom before, with y=0.1, x = 1e-2 / D where D was ~2.3646 \u2192 x\u22481e-2 /2.3646\u22480.004227 M.\n\nThen compute each term:\n\nFirst term (y):0.1\n\nSecond term: \u03b21 x y =9*(0.004227)*(0.1)=9*0.0004227\u22480.0038\n\nThird term:2\u03b22 x y\u00b2=2*40*(0.004227)*(0.01)=2*40*0.004227*0.01 \u2248 2*40*0.00004227 \u2248 0.00338\n\nFourth term:3\u03b23 x y\u00b3=3*63*(0.004227)*(0.001)=3*63*0.000004227 \u2248 3*63*0.000004227\u2248 0.0000805\n\nFifth term:4\u03b24 x y^4=4*16*(0.004227)*(0.0001)=4*16*0.004227*0.0001 \u2248 negligible (\u22480.00000268)\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.1 +0.0038=0.1038 +0.00338=0.10718 +0.0000805\u22480.10726 +0.00000268\u22480.10726.\n\nThe total SCN- is then approximately 0.1073 M, but the given total is 0.1 M. So our assumption that y=0.1 gives a total SCN- of ~0.1073 M which is higher than 0.1, meaning that our initial assumption of y=0.1 is wrong. Since the total SCN- is supposed to be 0.1, then y must be less than 0.1. \n\nSo we need to decrease y until the total SCN- becomes 0.1. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nLet me denote variables again.

That might simplify things.\n\nThe stability constants \u03b2n are given by:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^n)\n\nSo rearranged, each complex concentration is \u03b2n * [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n. \n\nLet me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Since c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, let me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nTerm1: 1 (the first term is 1)\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 *0.01 =0.4\nTerm4: \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 =63*(0.1)^3 =63*0.001=0.063\nTerm5: \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16*(0.1)^4 =16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding all terms together: 1 +0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646. \n\nSo the total denominator is approximately 2.3646. \n\nThus, x = c(Co) / (sum) = (1e-2) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 let's calculate that. \n\n0.01 divided by 2.3646.
