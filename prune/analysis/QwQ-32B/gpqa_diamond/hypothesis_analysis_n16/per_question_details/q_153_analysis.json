The acrylate's \u03b2-carbon (which had the p-tolyl and the double bond) is now connected to the malonate's central carbon. The resulting product would have a four-carbon chain? Let's see:\n\nOriginal acrylate: the structure was CH2=CH(C6H4-p-CH3)-COOCH3. The Michael addition would add the malonate's enolate (central carbon) to the \u03b2-carbon (the CH that's part of the double bond). The enolate's carbon (from the malonate) would form a bond to that CH, breaking the double bond. The result would be a new carbon chain: the malonate's central carbon (originally between two carbonyls) is now connected to the \u03b2-carbon (now single bond), and the rest of the acrylate's structure is attached. \n\nThe product would have the structure:\n\nThe malonate's central carbon (originally CH2) is now part of a new chain. The enolate's attack leads to the formation of a new bond between the central carbon of the malonate and the \u03b2-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting structure would have the malonate's two original ester groups, the acrylate's methyl ester, and the new p-tolyl group.\n\nPutting this together, the product (A) is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. The propane part suggests three carbons. The 2-position has the p-tolyl. The 1 and 3 positions have carboxylate groups, which are all methyl esters (trimethyl). That seems to fit. So option A's first part is correct. \n\nNow moving to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B). \n\nThe Michael addition here uses acidic conditions (H3O+), so the nucleophile here would be the enolate formed from one of the reactants.

So the attack would be on the CH of the double bond (since that's the beta carbon). \n\nThe malonate's enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the \u03b2 carbon (C2) of the acrylate, forming a new bond. The malonate's structure is OOCR-CH2-COOR', so when it forms an enolate, the central CH2 becomes a carbon with a negative charge (enolate). Attacking the \u03b2 carbon (position 2) of the acrylate's double bond would form a new bond there, leading to the addition. The product would then have the malonate's two ester groups connected through the addition. \n\nSo the product A would be a combined structure. Let me try to draw it mentally. The methyl group from the acrylate (the COOCH3) stays, and the malonate's two esters (dimethyl, so both OCH3) would be attached to the central part after addition. The p-tolyl is on the \u03b2 carbon (the one being attacked?), so perhaps the overall structure would be a tricarboxylate? Let me think. The malonate has two COOCH3 groups. The acrylate has a COOCH3 as well. After the addition, the combined molecule would have three ester groups.
