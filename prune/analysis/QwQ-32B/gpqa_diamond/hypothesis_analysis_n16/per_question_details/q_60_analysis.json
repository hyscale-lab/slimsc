From what I remember, the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that. Oh right, the distance is about 160,000 light-years, maybe 163,000. I think that's the approximate number. Let's say roughly 163,000 light-years away. \n\nThe spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies. I recall that the distance to the LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years. Let me confirm that.

The astronaut's age is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 solar years, so that's a hint maybe?

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2.\n\nLet me compute it as follows: (1 - delta)^2 = 1 - 2 delta + delta\u00b2, where delta =1.3e-7. Thus 1 - (v/c)^2 = 2 delta - delta\u00b2 = 2*(1.3e-7) - (1.3e-7)^2. The delta squared term is (1.69e-14), which is negligible. So it's 2.6e-7. So the square root of (1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7). sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 \u2248 5.099e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 \u2248 1961.5. \n\nSo, using gamma of ~1961.5, then 163,000 /1961.5 \u2248 let me compute that. Let me do 163000 divided by 2000 is 81.5. Since 1961.5 is 2000 minus 38.5, so the denominator is 1961.5 = 2000*(1 - 0.01925). So 1/(1961.5) \u2248 (1/2000)*(1 + 0.01925). So total is 81.5 * (1 + 0.01925) \u2248 81.5 + (81.5 *0.01925). Let's see, 81.5 *0.02 = 1.63, so subtract a bit: 1.63 - 81.5*(0.00075) \u2248 1.63 - 0.061 \u2248 1.569. So total is 81.5 +1.569 \u2248 83.07 years. \n\nHmm, so that's around 83.

Thus gamma \u2248 1/sqrt(2*1.3e-7) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that denominator:\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 \u2248 1.612 * 3.162e-4 = ~5.1e-4, so the same as before.

So indeed, the square root is ~0.00051. Therefore 1 divided by that is about 1960.8. So gamma is approximately 1961. \n\nSo gamma is around 1960. That's a huge factor. \n\nNow, the proper time \u03c4 is the astronaut's time. The time measured in Earth's frame is t = distance / speed. The distance from LMC to Earth is 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time taken is t = D / v = 163000 ly / (0.99999987c). Since the speed is in terms of c, dividing by c gives the time in years. Since v/c is ~1, this is approximately 163000 / ~1, so roughly 163,000 years. But the exact value would be a bit less, since 0.99999987 is slightly less than 1. Let me compute that exactly. \n\nLet me calculate t = 163000 / 0.99999987. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, the difference is 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.3e-7.

The 1.3e-7 term is negligible for the purposes of calculating the proper time, because when multiplied by 163000, it would be 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 0.021 years, so less than a month. Therefore, the Earth time is approximately 163,000 years. \n\nThe astronaut's proper time is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Since gamma is ~1960, \u03c4 \u2248 163000 / 1960 \u2248 let's compute that.

          "text1": "Wait, no, sorry. Let me think in terms of exponents:\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * (1e-3.5) = 1.612 * 3.162e-4 \u2248 1.612 * 0.0003162 \u2248 0.00051. So indeed, the square root is ~0.00051. Therefore 1 divided by that is about 1960.8. So gamma is approximately 1961. \n\nSo gamma is around 1960. That's a huge factor. \n\nNow, the proper time \u03c4 is the astronaut's time. The time measured in Earth's frame is t = distance / speed. The distance from LMC to Earth is 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time taken is t = D / v = 163000 ly / (0.99999987c). Since the speed is in terms of c, dividing by c gives the time in years. Since v/c is ~1, this is approximately 163000 / ~1, so roughly 163,000 years. But the exact value would be a bit less, since 0.99999987 is slightly less than 1. Let me compute that exactly. \n\nLet me calculate t = 163000 / 0.99999987. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, the difference is 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.3e-7. Therefore, 1/0.99999987 \u2248 1 + 1.3e-7 (using the approximation 1/(1 - \u03b5) \u2248 1 + \u03b5 for small \u03b5). So t \u2248 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). The 1.3e-7 term is negligible for the purposes of calculating the proper time, because when multiplied by 163000, it would be 163000 * 1.3e-7 \u2248 0.021 years, so less than a month. Therefore, the Earth time is approximately 163,000 years. \n\nThe astronaut's proper time is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Since gamma is ~1960, \u03c4 \u2248 163000 / 1960 \u2248 let's compute that. Let me see:\n\n163000 divided by 1960. Let me do the division step by step.\n\n1960 * 80 = 156,800. \n\n163,000 - 156,800 = 6,200. \n\n6200 / 1960 \u2248 3.16. So total is 80 + 3.16 \u2248 83.16. \n\nSo approximately 83 years. Hmm, but the options are 72, 81, 77.",

Since 1e-3.5 is 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) \u2248 0.001 * 0.3162 \u2248 0.0003162. So 1.612 * 0.0003162 \u2248 0.00051. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.00051. Therefore, the gamma factor is 1 / 0.00051 \u2248 approximately 1960.78. \n\nSo gamma is roughly 1960.78. \n\nNow, the time as measured in Earth's frame (t) is distance divided by speed. The distance is 163,000 light-years. So t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 approximately 163,000 years. Because the speed is so close to c, dividing by a number just under 1 doesn't change much.
