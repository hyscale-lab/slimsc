Since they are on the same carbon as two H's, their coupling might be different. \n\nThe 5.5 ppm peak is a dq (doublet of quartet?), perhaps the CH on C3 (allylic to the double bond and near the methyl group). \n\nThe methyl at 1.6 (d) is the CH3 on C3, coupled with the CH proton on C3. \n\nThe acetate's methyl is at 2.1. \n\nThis structure would give:\n\n- Vinyl protons at ~7 ppm (the one on C2),\n\n- The two H's on C1 would be another peak (maybe around 5.5? But that's already taken by the 5.5 dq),",
          "text2": "Wait the peaks given are:\n\n7.0 (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d). The 3H at 1.6 must be from a methyl group attached to a CH, because a methyl group as a singlet is usually in OAc, but this is a doublet. So that suggests a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbon that's coupled to another proton. The 3H doublet at 1.6 would be a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH, so the methyl is adjacent to a carbon with a proton. \n\nNow, let's consider the structure. The acetate is OAc (O-CH3, which is the 2.1 ppm singlet). So the other groups must form the rest.\n\nLooking at the 7.0 ppm peak, which is a doublet with J=16. That's likely a vinyl proton. The 16 Hz coupling is typical for vinyl protons (since the coupling between the two protons on the double bond is usually around 16 Hz).",
