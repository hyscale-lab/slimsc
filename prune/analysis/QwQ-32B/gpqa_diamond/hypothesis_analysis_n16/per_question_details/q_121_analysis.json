The other carbon (the one that gets the leaving group?) would have retention? Or maybe the inversion is only at the carbon being attacked. Let me recall the mechanism. The organocuprate attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to opening of the ring. The oxygen will have a negative charge, which then picks up a proton, forming the alcohol product. \n\nThe key points are: location of the Nu attack (less hindered carbon), inversion at the attacked carbon. \n\nSo first, I need to figure out where the epoxide oxygen is in the given compound. The compound is a bicyclic system with the formula given. The oxygen is part of the 7-oxabicyclo ring. The name is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The numbers 1,3,4 refer to the positions of the methyl groups, and the oxygen is at position 7. \n\nLet me try to sketch the structure.
