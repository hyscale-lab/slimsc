The options A, B, and C all have intermediate states with l=1, so that's good.\n\nNow, the possible m transitions: for a dipole transition, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. The first transition in A is m=0 \u2192 m=0. That's allowed (\u0394m=0). B is m=0\u21921 (\u0394m=+1 allowed), and C is m=0\u2192-1 (\u0394m=-1 allowed). So all three are possible for the first step.\n\nNow the second transition from the intermediate to the final. The second transition from |2,1,m\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9. For that, let's see. The initial l=1, final l=0. \u0394l must be \u00b11, so that's okay. The m must go from the intermediate's m to 0. Let's take each option:\n\nA's second step is from m=0 (since intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9) to m=0. So \u0394m=0, which is allowed. \n\nB's second transition is from |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The m goes from 1 to 0. \u0394m = -1, allowed.\n\nC's is from m=-1 to 0, \u0394m=+1, allowed. So all three second steps are allowed.\n\nSo all three paths are possible? But the question states \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". The options have different probabilities. The question is which one is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the probability depends on the allowed transitions' selection rules and the angular momentum factors. The probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element. For dipole transitions, the matrix element involves the integral of the product of the wavefunctions with the dipole operator, which has angular parts depending on the angular momentum changes.\n\nThe total probability (or transition rate) for a two-step process would be the product of the probabilities of each individual transition, but maybe there's a specific calculation here.",

The correct answer must have both the correct path and the correct probability.\n\nFirst, let's check possible paths. All paths where the intermediate is 2,1,m (with m 0, \u00b11) are allowed, because each step follows \u0394l=\u00b11 and \u0394m 0, \u00b11.\n\nSo all three paths (A, B, C's paths) are allowed. Then why are they different probabilities?\n\nThe probability for each path would depend on the matrix elements. The total probability is the sum over all possible paths (i.e., all possible intermediate states) of the probabilities of each path. So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities for each of the three possible intermediate states (m=0,1,-1). However, the problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions. So the question might be considering the possible paths and their probabilities, but the answer is one of the options. So perhaps the question is considering that only transitions through m=0 are allowed for some reason? Or maybe the probabilities are different because of the selection rules' phase or other factors.",

So the decay must proceed through an intermediate state. \n\nTherefore, the first step must be from 3,0,0\u27e9 to an intermediate state with n=2 and l=1. That satisfies \u0394l = +1 (since initial l=0). The m value can stay at 0 (since \u0394m=0 is allowed). So the first transition would be to |2,1,0\u27e9.
