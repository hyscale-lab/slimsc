That means we're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. \n\nAlright, so first part is pH at 25% titration. Second part is pH at equivalence.\n\nLet me start with the equivalence point first, maybe that's simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH here should be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Since it's the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will react with water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The pH should be greater than 7, which matches some of the options. Let's see the options. Option A says 8.52, D says 6.92. Hmm, so probably one of those. I need to calculate.\n\nFirst, let's do the equivalence point calculation. The moles of sodium acetate formed will be equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The total volume is 50 cm\u00b3 (40 + 10). So the concentration of sodium acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nThe acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:\n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH^-\n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, then Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10.\n\nThe concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the expression. Let x be the concentration of OH-.\n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] = x^2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x^2 /0.02 (since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02). \n\nSo x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 \u2192 x = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5.5?",
          "text2": "Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 40 mL. So the total volume at equivalence point would be 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL. But maybe I need that later for the pH calculation.\n\nNow, the question asks for pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH. \n\nSo at 25% titration, we have added 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol. \n\nThe original moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. The NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio, so the remaining moles of acetic acid would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be equal to the moles of NaOH added, so 0.00025 mol. \n\nThis is now a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nThe pKa is calculated from Ka: pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. \n\nCalculating pKa: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733, so pKa is 4.733. \n\nNow, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. The log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. \n\nSo pH = 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. Rounding to two decimal places, that's about 4.26. Hmm, which matches option A's first value.",

But maybe that's not needed yet.\n\nAt equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The acetate is the conjugate base. The pH here will depend on the hydrolysis of acetate. The formula for the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log C?), wait no, let's think properly.\n\nThe acetate ion concentration at equivalence point is (0.001 moles) / (total volume). The total volume at equivalence is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL.

Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10. \n\nSo, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-] \u2248 x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x).

Let me calculate the moles of NaOH here: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles. \n\nThe reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1, so the moles of acetic acid remaining will be initial (0.001) minus 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed will be equal to the moles of NaOH added, so 0.00025 mol. \n\nSo at 25% titration, the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base. To find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nFirst, calculate pKa from Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. pKa = -log(1.85e-5) \u2248 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). Hmm, actually, let me compute that more accurately.

So that's probably correct. \n\nNow the equivalence point. At equivalence, all acetic acid has been converted to acetate. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) plus 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH (since equivalence is at 10 cm\u00b3), so total volume 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L. \n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. \n\nNow, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: \n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH here should be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Since it's the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will react with water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The pH should be greater than 7, which matches some of the options.

So 25% titration would be (0.25)*10 cm3 = 2.5 cm3 of NaOH added.\n\nSo for the 25% point, we need to calculate the pH of the solution after adding 2.5 cm3 of NaOH. \n\nFirst, let's compute the moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles (as above). The moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. \n\nThe reaction between NaOH and acetic acid is: \n\nCH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO-Na+ + H2O\n\nSo each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, producing one mole of acetate ion. \n\nSo the moles of acetic acid left will be initial moles minus moles of NaOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. \n\nThe moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed will be equal to the moles of NaOH added, so 0.00025 moles. \n\nNow, the solution's total volume after adding 2.5 cm3 is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm3 = 0.0425 L. \n\nSo the concentrations are:\n\n[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 let's see, 0.00075 / 0.0425. Let me calculate that: 0.00075 divided by 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.\n\n[Acetate ion] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M. \n\nSo this is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nThe pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5).

The volume of NaOH required would be moles divided by concentration, so 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So equivalence point is when we add 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH. \n\nNow, the 25% titration point would be adding 25% of that equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. \n\nSo first, let's handle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's compute the moles remaining. \n\nOriginal moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles. \n\nMoles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L (since 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 0.0025 L) = 0.00025 moles. \n\nSo the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO^- + H2O. \n\nThe moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. \n\nThe moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 moles. \n\nThe total volume now is the initial 40 cm\u00b3 plus 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH here should be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

The pH here will depend on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will react with water: \n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThus, the solution will be basic. To find the pH, we can calculate the concentration of acetate, then find the Kb for acetate, then find [OH-], and then pH. \n\nFirst, the concentration of acetate at equivalence is (0.001 mol)/0.05 L = 0.02 M. \n\nThe Kb for acetate can be found by Kw / Ka. \n\nKw is 1e-14 (since 25\u00b0C). \n\nSo Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) \u2248 5.405e-10. \n\nThen, the Kb expression is: \n\nKb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] \n\nLet x be [OH-]. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so the change is -x, but since Kb is very small, x will be small.

So the first part is around 4.25, which aligns with option A (4.26) or D (4.57). Hmm, so that's close to A's first value.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The solution now contains acetate ions (CH3COO-), which is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form OH- ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe concentration of acetate at equivalence can be calculated. The total volume at equivalence is the initial 40 mL plus the 10 mL of NaOH, so 50 mL total. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid was converted). Concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.\n\nTo find the pH here, we need to calculate the Kb of the acetate ion. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25\u00b0C, Kw is 1e-14.

The volume of NaOH required would be moles divided by concentration, so 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm\u00b3. So equivalence point is when we add 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH. \n\nNow, the 25% titration point would be adding 25% of that equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added. \n\nSo first, let's handle the pH at 25% titration.

Second part is pH at equivalence.\n\nLet me start with the equivalence point first, maybe that's simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH here should be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Since it's the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will react with water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. The pH should be greater than 7, which matches some of the options.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid.

The total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 (original solution) plus 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH (since equivalence is at 10 cm\u00b3), so total volume 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L. \n\nThe concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. \n\nNow, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: \n\nCH3COO^- + H2O \u2194 CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka.
