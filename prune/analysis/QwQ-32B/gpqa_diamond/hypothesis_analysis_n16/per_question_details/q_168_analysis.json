But let me think of examples. For instance, if two files have different chromosome naming, merging them could result in lost data or incorrect overlaps. That's a common problem. The reference assembly is also a big one because different builds have different coordinates. \n\nID conversion errors are definitely a thing. Like, if you map gene symbols to Ensembl IDs using an old mapping, some genes might have new symbols or IDs, leading to wrong annotations. \n\nIncompatible formats: Suppose you have a file that's supposed to be BED but uses a different delimiter or missing columns.
