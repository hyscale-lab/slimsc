The product would have a styryl group (which is vinyl benzene) connected to another double bond. That would give a conjugated diene with a benzene ring. The 13C NMR would show aromatic carbons and the two double bonds. Let's see if that matches the given data.\n\nThe 13C data has a 197.7, which might be a carbonyl. Hmm, but if it's a diene, there's no carbonyl. So that's conflicting. Unless the carbonyl is part of the product, which would mean the reaction added an oxygen, but that doesn't fit ring opening.\n\nOption C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The epoxide has a methyl on the 2-carbon and styryl on the 3. Ring opening would form a double bond between 2 and 3. The product would have the styryl as part of a conjugated system with the methyl.
