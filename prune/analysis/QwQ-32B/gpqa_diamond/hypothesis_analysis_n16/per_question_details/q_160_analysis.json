The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.

The formula for the angle \u03b8 is given by sin\u03b8 = (3.8318\u03bb)/d, where d is the diameter. But since the angle is small, sin\u03b8 \u2248 tan\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 (in radians).

The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1.

Let me check my notes. \n\nThe formula comes from the condition that the path difference between light from the edge of the aperture and the center is such that the destructive interference occurs when the angle corresponds to a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, but adjusted for the circular geometry. The factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the Bessel function J1. Since J1's first zero is at 3.83, so the formula is (3.83) * (\u03bb/(\u03c0 D)), but since sin\u03b8 = (3.83 \u03bb)/(\u03c0 D), and for small angles, sin\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.22 \u03bb/D (since 3.83 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.22). \n\nSo \u03b8 = 1.22 \u03bb/D.
