So, gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV, gamma = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, so 27 - 23.87 is 3.13, so maybe around 7.9? Let me compute it exactly. 27 / 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7.9 = 3*7.9 =23.7 plus 0.41*7.9\u22483.239, total \u224826.939.

Let me do this division. 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, so 27 divided by 3.41 is a bit less than 8. Let me see: 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*(8 -0.1) =27.28 -0.341= 26.939. Close to 27. So \u03b3 is approximately 7.9. Let me compute it precisely. 27/3.41. Let's see: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13/3.41 is approx 0.918. So total \u03b3 \u22487.918.

So more precisely, 27 divided by 3.41: 3.41 into 27. Let's do 3.41 *7 =23.87, subtract that from 27: 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.918. So yes, \u03b3 \u22487.918. \n\nSo 1/\u03b3 is ~0.12626.
