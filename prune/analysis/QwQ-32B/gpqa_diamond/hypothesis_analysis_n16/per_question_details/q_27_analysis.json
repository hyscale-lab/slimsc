The \"sugar\" is a clue. Glycosylation occurs in the ER and Golgi. The chain is going to the ER first. So the meeting point is the ribosome (since that's where the SRP and ribosome meet). The chain is then going into the ER. Since the options don't have ER as a destination, perhaps the answer is that the chain is going to the Golgi, but that would be after the ER.",
