The observed peak wavelength for Star1 is lambda1_obs = lambda_max1 * (1 + v1/c). But v1 is 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda_max1.

Because if a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed \u03bb_max would be longer than the actual \u03bb_max. So to get the intrinsic temperature, we need to correct for that. Since the problem states that the observed \u03bb_max are the same, but their radial velocities are different, their actual \u03bb_max (and hence their temperatures) might not be the same. So the initial assumption that their temperatures are equal is incorrect.\n\nOkay, so I need to account for the Doppler shift here. Let me think through that.\n\nThe observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c) for a star moving away, where v is the radial velocity.

Therefore, the actual \u03bb_max of Star_2 must be shorter than the observed one, which equals the observed (and intrinsic) \u03bb_max of Star_1. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nFor Star_1: \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_rest1, since v1=0.\n\nFor Star_2: \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2 (given), then:\n\n\u03bb_rest1 = \u03bb_rest2*(1 + v2/c)\n\nBut since Wien's law says \u03bb_rest*T = constant (Wien's displacement constant b), so \u03bb_rest \u221d 1/T. \n\nTherefore, T1 = b / \u03bb_rest1 and T2 = b / \u03bb_rest2.\n\nLet me express T2 in terms of T1.\n\nFrom the above equation:\n\n\u03bb_rest2 = \u03bb_rest1 / (1 + v2/c)\n\nSo T2 = b/(\u03bb_rest2) = b/( (\u03bb_rest1)/(1 + v2/c) ) ) = (b/\u03bb_rest1) * (1 + v2/c) ) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c).",

But because of their radial velocity, the actual \u03bb_max (in the rest frame of the star) would be different. So to get the intrinsic temperature, we have to correct for the Doppler shift.\n\nOh right! Because if a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed \u03bb_max would be longer than the actual \u03bb_max. So to get the intrinsic temperature, we need to correct for that. Since the problem states that the observed \u03bb_max are the same, but their radial velocities are different, their actual \u03bb_max (and hence their temperatures) might not be the same. So the initial assumption that their temperatures are equal is incorrect.\n\nOkay, so I need to account for the Doppler shift here. Let me think through that.\n\nThe observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c) for a star moving away, where v is the radial velocity. But since the velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s, let's see. Star_1 has v=0, so its observed \u03bb_max is the same as its rest frame \u03bb_max. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed \u03bb_max would be longer than its actual \u03bb_max. But the problem states that the observed \u03bb_max for both are the same. Therefore, the actual \u03bb_max of Star_2 must be shorter than the observed one, which equals the observed (and intrinsic) \u03bb_max of Star_1. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nFor Star_1: \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_rest1, since v1=0.\n\nFor Star_2: \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2 (given), then:\n\n\u03bb_rest1 = \u03bb_rest2*(1 + v2/c)\n\nBut since Wien's law says \u03bb_rest*T = constant (Wien's displacement constant b), so \u03bb_rest \u221d 1/T. \n\nTherefore, T1 = b / \u03bb_rest1 and T2 = b / \u03bb_rest2.\n\nLet me express T2 in terms of T1.\n\nFrom the above equation:\n\n\u03bb_rest2 = \u03bb_rest1 / (1 + v2/c)\n\nSo T2 = b/(\u03bb_rest2) = b/( (\u03bb_rest1)/(1 + v2/c) ) ) = (b/\u03bb_rest1) * (1 + v2/c) ) = T1 * (1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c).",
