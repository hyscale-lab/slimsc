Let me re-examine the basicity of ethanethiolate and hydroxide.\n\nEarlier, I thought that hydroxide (OH-) is stronger base than ethanethiolate (RS-). \n\nBecause:\n\nEthanethiol (RSH) has a pKa around 10. So its conjugate base (RS-) is weaker than OH- (since water has higher pKa, so OH- is stronger base). \n\nTherefore, the basicity order between hydroxide (OH-) and ethanethiolate (RS-) is OH- is stronger base. \n\nThus, in terms of nucleophilicity in water, the weaker base (RS-) would be more nucleophilic than OH-?",
          "text2": "Wait, the pKa of water is 15.74, so the conjugate base (OH-) has a pKa of around 15.7. The pKa of ethanol is ~16, so its conjugate base (ethoxide) is weaker than hydroxide. But thiol (ethanethiol) has a pKa around 10, so ethanethiolate is stronger base than hydroxide. So ethanethiolate (option5) is a stronger base than hydroxide (option2). \n\nSo in terms of basicity, the order would have ethanethiolate (5) > hydroxide (2) > maybe others? But how does that translate into nucleophilicity in aqueous (polar protic) solution?\n\nIn polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity is influenced by solvation. The more the anion is solvated, the lower its nucleophilicity. So larger, more polarizable anions are solvated more, thus less nucleophilic. \n\nSo comparing hydroxide (OH-) and ethanethiolate (S-CH2CH3^-):\n\nThe ethanethiolate is larger (sulfur is bigger than oxygen), so it would be more solvated, so less nucleophilic in polar protic. So even though it's a stronger base, its nucleophilicity in water might be less than hydroxide.",
