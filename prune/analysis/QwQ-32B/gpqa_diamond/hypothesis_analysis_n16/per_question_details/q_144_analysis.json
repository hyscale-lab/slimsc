          "text2": "Wait, let me recalculate the numbers step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nFirst, \u0393_X is 320 MeV. So \u03c4\u2080 = \u0127/\u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-22 MeV*s. So 6.582e-22 / 320 = (6.582 / 320) * 1e-22. 6.582 divided by 320: 320 into 6.582. Let's see, 320*0.02=6.4. So 0.02 would give 6.4. The difference is 0.182. 0.182 /320= ~0.00056875. So total \u03c4\u2080 is 0.02056875e-22 seconds. Which is 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nThen, the gamma factor: E is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666..., exactly 20/3. So \u03b3 is exactly 20/3.\n\nSo \u03c4 (lab frame) is \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s. Let's compute that:\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.666666...\n\n6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24\n\n0.666666... *2.056875e-24 = ?\n\n0.666666 is 2/3, so 2/3 of 2.056875e-24 is (2*2.056875)/3 =4.11375 /3 \u22481.37125e-24\n\nAdding together: 12.34125e-24 +1.37125e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s. Which is 1.37125e-23 seconds. Correct.\n\nVelocity: v = \u03b2c, where \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). So \u03b3 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = ?\n\nWell, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, since 0.98^2 is 0.9604. sqrt(0.9775) is a bit higher. Let me see: Let me consider that sqrt(0.9775) can be approximated as sqrt(1 - 0.0225). Using the Taylor expansion sqrt(1 - x) \u22481 - x/2 - x\u00b2/8. \n\nx is 0.0225, so:\n\nsqrt(1-0.0225) \u2248 1 - 0.01125 - (0.0225)^2 /8 \u2248 1 -0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 \u2248 1 -0.01125 -0.00006328 \u2248 0.9886867. So approximately 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nThus, \u03b2 =0.9887, so v =0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let's compute that:\n\n0.9887 *3e8 = (0.9887 *3)*1e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s. \n\nSo, decay length L = v * \u03c4 = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nMultiplying these numbers:\n\nFirst, multiply 2.9661 and 1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 2.9661 * 1.37125:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n2.9661 *1 =2.9661\n\n2.9661 *0.3 =0.88983\n\n2.9661 *0.07 =0.207627\n\n2.9661 *0.00125=0.003707625\n\nAdding all together: \n\n2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593\n\n+0.207627 =4.063557\n\n+0.003707625 \u22484.0672646\n\nSo total is approximately 4.0672646. \n\nThus, the product is 4.0672646e8 *1e-23?",

          "text2": "Wait, let me recalculate the numbers step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nFirst, \u0393_X is 320 MeV. So \u03c4\u2080 = \u0127/\u0393. \u0127 is 6.582e-22 MeV*s. So 6.582e-22 / 320 = (6.582 / 320) * 1e-22. 6.582 divided by 320: 320 into 6.582. Let's see, 320*0.02=6.4. So 0.02 would give 6.4. The difference is 0.182. 0.182 /320= ~0.00056875. So total \u03c4\u2080 is 0.02056875e-22 seconds. Which is 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.\n\nThen, the gamma factor: E is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 /1.2 = 6.666666..., exactly 20/3. So \u03b3 is exactly 20/3.\n\nSo \u03c4 (lab frame) is \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s. Let's compute that:\n\n20/3 is approximately 6.666666...\n\n6.666666 * 2.056875e-24 = ?\n\nLet me compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24\n\n0.666666... *2.056875e-24 = ?\n\n0.666666 is 2/3, so 2/3 of 2.056875e-24 is (2*2.056875)/3 =4.11375 /3 \u22481.37125e-24\n\nAdding together: 12.34125e-24 +1.37125e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s. Which is 1.37125e-23 seconds. Correct.\n\nVelocity: v = \u03b2c, where \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). So \u03b3 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 \u224844.4444. So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.9775) = ?\n\nWell, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, since 0.98^2 is 0.9604. sqrt(0.9775) is a bit higher. Let me see: Let me consider that sqrt(0.9775) can be approximated as sqrt(1 - 0.0225). Using the Taylor expansion sqrt(1 - x) \u22481 - x/2 - x\u00b2/8. \n\nx is 0.0225, so:\n\nsqrt(1-0.0225) \u2248 1 - 0.01125 - (0.0225)^2 /8 \u2248 1 -0.01125 - (0.00050625)/8 \u2248 1 -0.01125 -0.00006328 \u2248 0.9886867. So approximately 0.9887. So that's correct.\n\nThus, \u03b2 =0.9887, so v =0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let's compute that:\n\n0.9887 *3e8 = (0.9887 *3)*1e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s. \n\nSo, decay length L = v * \u03c4 = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.\n\nMultiplying these numbers:\n\nFirst, multiply 2.9661 and 1.37125.\n\nLet me compute 2.9661 * 1.37125:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n2.9661 *1 =2.9661\n\n2.9661 *0.3 =0.88983\n\n2.9661 *0.07 =0.207627\n\n2.9661 *0.00125=0.003707625\n\nAdding all together: \n\n2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593\n\n+0.207627 =4.063557\n\n+0.003707625 \u22484.0672646\n\nSo total is approximately 4.0672646. \n\nThus, the product is 4.0672646e8 *1e-23?",
