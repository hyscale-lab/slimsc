The ethoxy group is also activating and ortho/para directing, but since it's an ether, maybe similar to alkyl in directing.\n\nBut the key here is the order of the reactions. Since we start with benzene, we need to add substituents step by step. Each reaction step will add a substituent, and the order matters because each new substituent will affect the direction of the next substituent.\n\nThe target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The tert-butyl group is a bulky alkyl group. Since alkyl groups are ortho/para directing, but when adding multiple groups, the order of addition is crucial.\n\nLet me think of the steps involved.

          "text1": "Wait, maybe I'm getting the terminology wrong. In benzene, ortho is adjacent (separated by 1 carbon), meta is two apart (separated by two carbons), and para is opposite (three apart). So positions 1 and 2 are ortho, 1 and 3 meta, 1 and 4 para, etc. So in the target, the nitro (position 3) is meta to the ethoxy (position 1), but the tert-butyl is at position 2, adjacent to both. The presence of the tert-butyl (activating) at position 2 would influence where the nitro and ethoxy are placed.\n\nThe ethoxy is an ether group, which is formed via Williamson ether synthesis. The ethoxy group would require a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps using NaOH/EtBr (step vii in some options). The nitro group is introduced via nitration.\n\nThe tert-butyl is added first via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Since Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a tertiary alkyl (like tert-butyl chloride) can be tricky because the carbocation is tertiary and may not rearrange, but perhaps it's assumed to work here.\n\nThe key is the order of adding the groups so that each is directed correctly by the existing groups.\n\nLet me consider the correct order:\n\nFirst, the tert-butyl group is added first. Since it's an activating group, it directs ortho/para. Then, the next group added must be placed in a position relative to it. The nitro group is a strong deactivating meta-director, so if it's added after the tert-butyl, it would have to be placed in a position that's meta to some existing group. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to the tert-butyl (position 2). So that would work if the nitro is added after the tert-butyl. \n\nHowever, the ethoxy group is an activating group (like an alkyl), so if added after the nitro, it would have to be placed in a position directed by the nitro. But nitro is a meta-director, so the ethoxy would go meta to the nitro. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the sequence is:\n\n1. Add tert-butyl (position 2)\n2. Add nitro (position 3, meta to tert-butyl)\n3. Add ethoxy. Since the nitro is a meta-director, the ethoxy would have to go ortho/para to the nitro?",

The ethoxy group is also activating and ortho/para directing, but since it's an ether, maybe similar to alkyl in directing.\n\nBut the key here is the order of the reactions. Since we start with benzene, we need to add substituents step by step. Each reaction step will add a substituent, and the order matters because each new substituent will affect the direction of the next substituent.\n\nThe target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The tert-butyl group is a bulky alkyl group. Since alkyl groups are ortho/para directing, but when adding multiple groups, the order of addition is crucial.\n\nLet me think of the steps involved. The synthesis steps involve reactions like nitration, sulfonation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, acylation, nucleophilic substitution (like for the ethoxy group), and maybe some other steps.\n\nThe target has nitro at position 3, tert-butyl at 2, and ethoxy at 1. Let me see the positions: let's assume the nitro is in position 3. Then the tert-butyl is at 2, and the ethoxy at 1 (which would be meta to nitro, since 1 and 3 are separated by two positions.",

The existing groups are the tert-butyl (position 2) and nitro (position 3). The ethoxy needs to go to position 1. Position 1 is ortho to the tert-butyl (position 2) and meta to the nitro (position 3). Since the tert-butyl is activating, it would direct the ethoxy to ortho (position 1 or 4). The nitro is meta-directing, so it would direct the ethoxy to meta positions relative to itself, which would be positions 1 and 5. So position 1 is compatible with both the tert-butyl's ortho direction and the nitro's meta direction. So that works. \n\nTherefore the order should be:\n\nAdd tert-butyl first (position 2), then nitrate to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl), then add ethoxy to position 1 (directed by both groups). \n\nNow, the question is how to achieve each step via reactions.\n\nThe ethoxy group would be added via Williamson ether synthesis, which involves a phenol (OH group) undergoing SN2 with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in basic conditions (NaOH). But to get the OH group, you might need to first form a phenol, but that would require a deprotection.",

The nitro is meta-directing, so it would direct the ethoxy to positions meta to itself, which would be positions 1 and 5 (since nitro is at 3, meta would be 1 and 5). The tert-butyl at 2 is an ortho/para director, so ortho would be 1 and 3, para would be 6. \n\nSo the position 1 is both meta to nitro and ortho to tert-butyl. So that's a good spot. Therefore, when adding the ethoxy (as an activating group), the position 1 would be directed by both groups (since it's ortho to tert-butyl and meta to nitro). \n\nSo, the ethoxy can be added there. To add an ethoxy group, we can do an alkoxylation, which is typically done via the Williamson synthesis: first, diazotization of a substituted phenol, but maybe in this case, after nitration and alkyl group, we need to perform a sulfonation, then a diazonium salt, then substitution with ethoxide?",
