The standard problem is when you have a point charge q outside a grounded sphere of radius a. The image charge q' is placed along the line connecting the center and the charge, at a distance b from the center, where b = (a\u00b2)/d, where d is the distance from the center to the original charge. The magnitude of the image charge is q' = - (a q)/d. \n\nAh, so in this case, R is the radius, so the image charge would be q' = - (R q)/d, and the position is R\u00b2/d from the center. So that part is correct. \n\nSo the separation between them is d - (R\u00b2/d) as before. \n\nSo then, the potential energy would be:\n\nU = k * q * q' / (distance between them)\n\nPlugging in q' = - R q /d, distance = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d (since d - R\u00b2/d = (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d )\n\nSo U = [ k * q * (- R q /d) ] / [ (d\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/d ]\n\nThe denominators: the d in the denominator of R q /d cancels with the d in the denominator of the distance.

So the energy would be the interaction between them.\n\nBut in that case, the potential energy U would be (k * q * q') / r.
