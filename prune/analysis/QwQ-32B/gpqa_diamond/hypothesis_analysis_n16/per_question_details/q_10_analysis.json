          "text1": "Wait, but the problem says \"same composition as Earth\". Hmm, maybe composition here refers to the bulk composition, so that the overall density is same as Earth's. But maybe when you increase mass with same composition, the internal pressure would cause higher compression, leading to higher density? Because in reality, Earth's density is higher than the average of its materials because of compression. For example, Earth's core is more dense because of pressure. So perhaps if you have a more massive planet with same composition, the core would be compressed more, leading to higher overall density. But I'm not sure. The question says \"same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive\". Maybe the assumption here is that the composition (so, the average density) is the same, so that the density would still be 5.5? Or maybe the question is treating composition as the same proportion of elements, but allowing for compression, so the density would actually be higher? This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following similar logic, if composition is same, then mass and radius would scale as mass^(1/3). Half the mass would mean radius is cube root of 0.5, so smaller. So volume is (0.5)^(1/3)^3 = 0.5. So density: mass/volume. Mass is 0.5 Earth masses, volume is 0.5 Earth volumes. So density would be same (0.5 / 0.5 =1, so same as Earth's density). But again, maybe compression? A less massive planet might be less compressed, so lower density. Like, maybe if it's smaller, the pressure inside is less, so the same composition would have lower density because not compressed as much. So in that case, d would have lower density than Earth, and c would have higher? That would make sense. So if that's the case, then c's density is higher than Earth's, and d is lower.\n\nSo let me re-express:\n\nOption a is Earth's density (5.5).\n\nOption b is explicitly stated as 5.5.\n\nOption c: same composition, but more mass. If the planet's higher mass causes it to be more compressed, so even though the composition is same (same elements), the actual density would be higher. So maybe 5.5 or higher? Let's think of Earth vs. a more massive planet. For example, the Earth's density is higher than the uncompressed density of its materials because of compression. So a more massive planet would have more compression, so higher density. Therefore, c would have higher density than Earth. But then how much higher?",
          "text2": "Wait, the problem states \"same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive\". If the composition is the same, the density (mass/volume) would require that the volume scales with mass, so density remains the same. However, in reality, more massive planets with same composition might have higher densities due to gravitational compression, but the question says \"same composition\", which might imply same average density? Or maybe the question is expecting to ignore such effects. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The question might be assuming that composition being the same means the same density. For example, if Earth's composition leads to a certain density, then a planet made of the same materials but scaled up in mass would have the same density. So then, the density would remain 5.5.

But maybe when you increase mass with same composition, the internal pressure would cause higher compression, leading to higher density? Because in reality, Earth's density is higher than the average of its materials because of compression. For example, Earth's core is more dense because of pressure. So perhaps if you have a more massive planet with same composition, the core would be compressed more, leading to higher overall density. But I'm not sure. The question says \"same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive\". Maybe the assumption here is that the composition (so, the average density) is the same, so that the density would still be 5.5? Or maybe the question is treating composition as the same proportion of elements, but allowing for compression, so the density would actually be higher? This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following similar logic, if composition is same, then mass and radius would scale as mass^(1/3). Half the mass would mean radius is cube root of 0.5, so smaller. So volume is (0.5)^(1/3)^3 = 0.5. So density: mass/volume. Mass is 0.5 Earth masses, volume is 0.5 Earth volumes. So density would be same (0.5 / 0.5 =1, so same as Earth's density). But again, maybe compression? A less massive planet might be less compressed, so lower density. Like, maybe if it's smaller, the pressure inside is less, so the same composition would have lower density because not compressed as much. So in that case, d would have lower density than Earth, and c would have higher? That would make sense. So if that's the case, then c's density is higher than Earth's, and d is lower.\n\nSo let me re-express:\n\nOption a is Earth's density (5.5).\n\nOption b is explicitly stated as 5.5.\n\nOption c: same composition, but more mass. If the planet's higher mass causes it to be more compressed, so even though the composition is same (same elements), the actual density would be higher. So maybe 5.5 or higher? Let's think of Earth vs. a more massive planet. For example, the Earth's density is higher than the uncompressed density of its materials because of compression. So a more massive planet would have more compression, so higher density. Therefore, c would have higher density than Earth. But then how much higher?",

For example, if Earth's composition leads to a certain density, then a planet made of the same materials but scaled up in mass would have the same density. So then, the density would remain 5.5.

But maybe when you increase mass with same composition, the internal pressure would cause higher compression, leading to higher density? Because in reality, Earth's density is higher than the average of its materials because of compression. For example, Earth's core is more dense because of pressure. So perhaps if you have a more massive planet with same composition, the core would be compressed more, leading to higher overall density. But I'm not sure. The question says \"same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive\". Maybe the assumption here is that the composition (so, the average density) is the same, so that the density would still be 5.5? Or maybe the question is treating composition as the same proportion of elements, but allowing for compression, so the density would actually be higher? This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following similar logic, if composition is same, then mass and radius would scale as mass^(1/3). Half the mass would mean radius is cube root of 0.5, so smaller. So volume is (0.5)^(1/3)^3 = 0.5. So density: mass/volume. Mass is 0.5 Earth masses, volume is 0.5 Earth volumes. So density would be same (0.5 / 0.5 =1, so same as Earth's density). But again, maybe compression? A less massive planet might be less compressed, so lower density. Like, maybe if it's smaller, the pressure inside is less, so the same composition would have lower density because not compressed as much. So in that case, d would have lower density than Earth, and c would have higher? That would make sense. So if that's the case, then c's density is higher than Earth's, and d is lower.\n\nSo let me re-express:\n\nOption a is Earth's density (5.5).\n\nOption b is explicitly stated as 5.5.\n\nOption c: same composition, but more mass. If the planet's higher mass causes it to be more compressed, so even though the composition is same (same elements), the actual density would be higher. So maybe 5.5 or higher? Let's think of Earth vs. a more massive planet. For example, the Earth's density is higher than the uncompressed density of its materials because of compression.

Or maybe the question is expecting to ignore such effects. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The question might be assuming that composition being the same means the same density. For example, if Earth's composition leads to a certain density, then a planet made of the same materials but scaled up in mass would have the same density. So then, the density would remain 5.5.

But maybe when you increase mass with same composition, the internal pressure would cause higher compression, leading to higher density? Because in reality, Earth's density is higher than the average of its materials because of compression. For example, Earth's core is more dense because of pressure. So perhaps if you have a more massive planet with same composition, the core would be compressed more, leading to higher overall density. But I'm not sure. The question says \"same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive\". Maybe the assumption here is that the composition (so, the average density) is the same, so that the density would still be 5.5? Or maybe the question is treating composition as the same proportion of elements, but allowing for compression, so the density would actually be higher? This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following similar logic, if composition is same, then mass and radius would scale as mass^(1/3). Half the mass would mean radius is cube root of 0.5, so smaller. So volume is (0.5)^(1/3)^3 = 0.5. So density: mass/volume. Mass is 0.5 Earth masses, volume is 0.5 Earth volumes. So density would be same (0.5 / 0.5 =1, so same as Earth's density). But again, maybe compression? A less massive planet might be less compressed, so lower density. Like, maybe if it's smaller, the pressure inside is less, so the same composition would have lower density because not compressed as much. So in that case, d would have lower density than Earth, and c would have higher? That would make sense. So if that's the case, then c's density is higher than Earth's, and d is lower.\n\nSo let me re-express:\n\nOption a is Earth's density (5.5).\n\nOption b is explicitly stated as 5.5.\n\nOption c: same composition, but more mass. If the planet's higher mass causes it to be more compressed, so even though the composition is same (same elements), the actual density would be higher. So maybe 5.5 or higher? Let's think of Earth vs. a more massive planet. For example, the Earth's density is higher than the uncompressed density of its materials because of compression.

For example, if Earth's composition leads to a certain density, then a planet made of the same materials but scaled up in mass would have the same density. So then, the density would remain 5.5.

If the composition is same, but the mass is higher, then if the planet is compressed, its radius would be smaller, leading to higher density. For example, if the radius is the same as Earth but mass 5x, then density would be 5x higher. But that's not possible because gravity would compress the planet to be smaller.",

Let me re-read the options again.\n\nOption c says: \"A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\" If the composition is the same, but it's more massive, then the density must be higher. Because when you have more mass, the gravitational compression is higher, so the planet's radius is smaller than if it were just scaled up with the same density.
