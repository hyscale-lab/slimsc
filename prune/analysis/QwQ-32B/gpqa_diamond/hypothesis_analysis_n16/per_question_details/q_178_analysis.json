          "text1": "Wait, the coupling's mass dimension must be such that the terms are renormalizable. The rule is: in 4D, the interaction terms must have mass dimension of each term equal to 4. Since the Lagrangian's terms are built as operators with dimension 4. So for each term, the dimension of the coupling plus the sum of the dimensions of the fields must equal 4. \n\nIn our case, the interaction term here has the coupling \u03ba, multiplied by \u03c8\u0304, \u03c3 terms (dimensionless), \u03c8, and F. So the total dimension is [\u03ba] + (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = [\u03ba] +5. To get that equal to 4, [\u03ba] must be -1. So that's correct. \n\nBut the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. Since the coupling has negative mass dimension, that suggests that the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because in renormalizable interactions, the coupling constants typically have non-negative mass dimensions. For example, in QED, the coupling e has dimension 1 (since the term is e A \u03bc \u03c8 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\u0304, which has (1) + (3/2 + 3/2) = 1 +3 =4, so e must have dimension 1, so that term is okay. So the coupling's dimension is positive here. \n\nIn our case, \u03ba has dimension -1. So that means that the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Hence the theory is not renormalizable.
