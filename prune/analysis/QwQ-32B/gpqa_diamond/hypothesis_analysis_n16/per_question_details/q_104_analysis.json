Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe Doppler shift corresponds to the star's radial velocity. The maximum velocity shift (K) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The key is that the shift (in wavelength) is proportional to K (the velocity), since the Doppler shift formula is (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) \u2248 v/c, where v is the velocity. \n\nSo, the problem states that the spectral line shifts by 5 and 7 miliangstroms. Let's denote the shifts as \u0394\u03bb\u2081 =5 mA and \u0394\u03bb\u2082=7 mA. Since the wavelength shift is proportional to the velocity, then the velocities K\u2081 and K\u2082 are proportional to \u0394\u03bb\u2081 and \u0394\u03bb\u2082 respectively. \n\nSo K\u2082 / K\u2081 = 7/5. \n\nNow, the question is to find the ratio of the orbital periods P\u2082/P\u2081. \n\nWe need to relate the velocities K to the orbital periods. \n\nAssuming both stars have the same mass (M_s), and the planets have similar masses (M_p), so M_p1 \u2248 M_p2. \n\nLet's denote the planets as having masses M_p, and the stars as M_s. \n\nThe formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( ( a^3 (M_s + M_p)^2 )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(G (M_s + M_p))) ) ?",

Let me denote K1 for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2. The question states that the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom, but the actual Doppler shift in terms of velocity would be related to K. \n\nThe Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity causing the shift, and c is the speed of light. But since the problem gives the shifts in the same spectral line's wavelength, the ratio of the velocities would be the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts (assuming the central wavelength is the same, and that the shifts are small so that delta lambda/lambda \u2248 v/c). \n\nTherefore, the ratio K2/K1 = (7 /5). \n\nSince we need to relate K and P. From the expression I derived earlier, perhaps:\n\nK is proportional to (M_p / M_s^{2/3}) * (1/P^{1/3}) \n\nAssuming that M_p and M_s are the same for both planets (since \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" and stars same mass), so the ratio of K's would be (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^{1/3}",

Let me write Kepler's law again: \n\n(M_s + M_p) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nAgain, since M_p << M_s, this simplifies to M_s P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \u2192 a\u00b3 \u2248 (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \u2192 a = [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^{1/3}\n\nPlugging this into the expression for K: \n\nK = (2 \u03c0 M_p / (M_s P)) * [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. \n\nFirst, substitute a into the equation for K:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 M_p a) / (M_s P) \n\nReplace a with the expression from Kepler's law:\n\na = [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^{1/3}\n\nSo plugging that in:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 M_p / (M_s P)) * [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step.\n\nFirst, the a term raised to the 1/3 power:\n\nInside the brackets, the term inside the cube root is (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). Taking the cube root gives (G M_s)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nMultiply all terms:\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\nK = [ 2\u03c0 M_p / (M_s P) ] * [ (G)^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nMultiply the constants first. The 2\u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} can be written as 2\u03c0 / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) = 2 / (4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0 / \u03c0^{2/3} ) \n\nSimplify \u03c0 terms: \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nSo constants become (2 / 4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there is a better way to relate K and P.",

Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe Doppler shift corresponds to the star's radial velocity. The maximum velocity shift (K) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Let's denote the shifts as \u0394\u03bb\u2081 =5 mA and \u0394\u03bb\u2082=7 mA. Since the wavelength shift is proportional to the velocity, then the velocities K\u2081 and K\u2082 are proportional to \u0394\u03bb\u2081 and \u0394\u03bb\u2082 respectively. \n\nSo K\u2082 / K\u2081 = 7/5. \n\nNow, the question is to find the ratio of the orbital periods P\u2082/P\u2081. \n\nWe need to relate the velocities K to the orbital periods. \n\nAssuming both stars have the same mass (M_s), and the planets have similar masses (M_p), so M_p1 \u2248 M_p2. \n\nLet's denote the planets as having masses M_p, and the stars as M_s. \n\nThe formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( ( a^3 (M_s + M_p)^2 )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(G (M_s + M_p))) ) ?",

Let me denote K1 for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2. The question states that the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom, but the actual Doppler shift in terms of velocity would be related to K. \n\nThe Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity causing the shift, and c is the speed of light. But since the problem gives the shifts in the same spectral line's wavelength, the ratio of the velocities would be the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts (assuming the central wavelength is the same, and that the shifts are small so that delta lambda/lambda \u2248 v/c). \n\nTherefore, the ratio K2/K1 = (7 /5). \n\nSince we need to relate K and P.

Let me write Kepler's law again: \n\n(M_s + M_p) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nAgain, since M_p << M_s, this simplifies to M_s P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \u2192 a\u00b3 \u2248 (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \u2192 a = [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^{1/3}\n\nPlugging this into the expression for K: \n\nK = (2 \u03c0 M_p / (M_s P)) * [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. \n\nFirst, substitute a into the equation for K:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 M_p a) / (M_s P) \n\nReplace a with the expression from Kepler's law:\n\na = [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^{1/3}\n\nSo plugging that in:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 M_p / (M_s P)) * [ (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step.\n\nFirst, the a term raised to the 1/3 power:\n\nInside the brackets, the term inside the cube root is (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). Taking the cube root gives (G M_s)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nMultiply all terms:\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\nK = [ 2\u03c0 M_p / (M_s P) ] * [ (G)^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nMultiply the constants first. The 2\u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} can be written as 2\u03c0 / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) = 2 / (4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0 / \u03c0^{2/3} ) \n\nSimplify \u03c0 terms: \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nSo constants become (2 / 4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there is a better way to relate K and P.",

Let's see:\n\nThe P terms: (1/P) * (P^(2/3)) ) = P^( -1 + 2/3 ) = P^(-1/3).\n\nThe constants: 2\u03c0 divided by (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3). Let's compute that.\n\nLet me compute constants step by step:\n\n2\u03c0 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nLet me write 4\u03c0\u00b2 as (2\u00b2)(\u03c0\u00b2). So (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = (2^(2) \u03c0^(2))^(1/3) = 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3). \n\nThus:\n\n2\u03c0 / (2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3).\n\nSo overall constants become 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nK \u2248 [2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_* ) ) * sin i ] * P^(-1/3)\n\nLet me simplify terms:\n\n( G M_* )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_* ) = (G)^(1/3) * M_*^(1/3) * M_p / M_* \n\n= G^(1/3) M_p / M_*^(2/3)\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nK \u2248 [ 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) * G^(1/3) M_p / M_*^(2/3) * sin i ] * P^(-1/3)\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nK = C * ( M_p / (M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) * sin i \n\nWhere C is a constant involving 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) G^(1/3).\n\nThus, rearranged:\n\nK \u221d ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, and sin i is the same (assuming the same inclination), the proportionality simplifies to K \u221d 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n\nWhich is the same result as before. So that holds. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.\n\nPlugging in K1=5 and K2=7:\n\n(5/7)^3 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364.

Taking the cube root gives (G M_s)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nMultiply all terms:\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\nK = [ 2\u03c0 M_p / (M_s P) ] * [ (G)^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nMultiply the constants first. The 2\u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} can be written as 2\u03c0 / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) = 2 / (4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0 / \u03c0^{2/3} ) \n\nSimplify \u03c0 terms: \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nSo constants become (2 / 4^{1/3}) ) * \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.
