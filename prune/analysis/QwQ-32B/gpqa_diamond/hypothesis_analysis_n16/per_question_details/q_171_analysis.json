Let me think again of each substituent's directing effect and whether they favor ortho/para or meta, and thus the para isomer's yield.\n\nLet me list each substance with their directing effect and the expected major product's position:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go ortho or para. The para isomer would be a significant fraction. The ratio between ortho and para may vary, but both are possible.\n\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5): ester group. Ester is a deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance), and meta directing.

Ethylbenzene (C2H5): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is activating (electron-donating), ortho/para directing. The bromine would go to ortho or para. The para isomer's yield would be high, similar to toluene. But maybe ethyl is more activating than methyl? Not sure, but the directing effect is same.
