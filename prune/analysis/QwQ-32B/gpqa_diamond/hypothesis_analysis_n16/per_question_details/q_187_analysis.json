For instance, the ESPRESSO's technical specs mention that it requires a minimum V magnitude of 12 to achieve S/N of 100 in 10 minutes. Let's try with that.\n\nIf the reference is m_ref=12, S/N_ref=100 in t_ref=600s.\n\nThen for S/N_target=10 in t_target=3600s:\n\n10 = 100 * sqrt(3600/600) * 10^(-0.2*(m -12))\n\nAgain sqrt(6) \u22482.449\n\n10 = 100 *2.449 * 10^(-0.2*(m-12))\n\nDivide both sides by 100*2.449: 10/(244.9) \u22480.0408 = 10^(-0.2*(m-12))\n\nlog10(0.0408) \u2248-1.39 = -0.2(m-12)\n\nSo m-12 = (1.39)/0.2 \u22486.95 \u2192 m\u224818.95.\n\nSo m\u224819. \n\nThus, a star with apparent magnitude 19 would give S/N of 10 in 1 hour. \n\nTherefore, any star with apparent magnitude less than or equal to ~19 would be acceptable.",

Let's start with each option:\n\nOption a) Canopus: That's a real star. Let me recall Canopus's apparent magnitude. Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, so its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. So that's way brighter than anything else here. Definitely detectable. So a) is detectable.\n\nOption b) Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 2.0. Also very bright, so detectable. So b) is okay.\n\nOptions c to f are all stars with absolute V magnitude 15, at various distances. Let's compute their apparent magnitudes. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10 pc). Since M is 15, and d varies.\n\nFor option c: d = 10 pc. Then m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 = 15. So apparent magnitude 15.\n\nOption d: d = 200 pc. m = 15 +5*log10(200/10) =15 +5*log10(20). log10(20) is approx 1.3010, so 5*1.301=6.505. So 15+6.505=21.505. So m\u224821.5.\n\nOption e: d=5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5/10) = 15 +5*(log10(0.5)) \u2192 log10(0.5) is -0.3010. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

The other options (a and b) are named stars, so I need to find their apparent magnitudes. \n\nStarting with the named stars first:\n\na) Canopus: I recall that Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. Definitely way above any limit, so it's detectable. \n\nb) Polaris: The North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0. Also very bright, so detectable. \n\nNow for the others. Let's compute their apparent magnitudes:\n\nOption c: Absolute V mag 15, distance 10 pc.\nm = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) \u2192 log10(1) =0 \u2192 m=15 +0 =15. So apparent magnitude 15.\n\nOption e: Distance 5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5/10) \u2192 log10(0.5) is about -0.301. So 5*(-0.301)= -1.505 \u2192 m=15-1.505\u224813.5.\n\nOption f: 50 pc. So 50/10 =5. log10(5)= ~0.69897. 5*0.69897\u22483.495. m=15+3.495\u224818.495 \u2192 ~18.5.\n\nOption d: 200 pc \u2192 200/10=20 \u2192 log10(20)\u22481.301 \u2192 5*1.301 \u22486.505 \u2192 m=15+6.505=21.505 \u2192 ~21.5.\n\nSo the apparent magnitudes are:\n\nc) 15\n\ne) ~13.5\n\nf) ~18.5\n\nd) ~21.5\n\nNow, what is the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO for S/N of 10 in 1 hour?\n\nI need to check the ESPRESSO's specs.
