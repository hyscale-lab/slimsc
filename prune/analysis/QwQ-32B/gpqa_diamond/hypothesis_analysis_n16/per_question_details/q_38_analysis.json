The N-methyl part is one substituent on the nitrogen, and the other group is the pentan-2-ylidene. \n\nSo in the enamine, the nitrogen is part of the double bond. The structure would be: \n\nThe enamine's double bond is between the nitrogen and the former carbonyl carbon (the second carbon of the pentan-2-one). The nitrogen has two substituents: methyl (the N-methyl) and the ethyl group from the ethanamine?",
          "text2": "Wait, the starting enamine's name is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The -ylidene group usually refers to a double bond. So the pentan-2-ylidene is a group attached to the nitrogen. So the structure would be:\n\nThe ethylamine (ethanamine) has two substituents on the nitrogen: a methyl group and the pentan-2-ylidene group. The \"ylidene\" suggests that the pentan-2-yl group is connected via a double bond. So the structure would be something like:\n\nThe nitrogen is connected to a methyl, an ethyl (since it's ethanamine), and through a double bond to the pentan-2-yl group.",
