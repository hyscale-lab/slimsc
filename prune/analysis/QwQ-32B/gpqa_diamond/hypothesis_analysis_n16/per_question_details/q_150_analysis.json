Then, adding H2O might just be to wash or neutralize, but maybe the next step is the important part: KOH, heat. \n\nIn the final step, heating with aqueous KOH. That sounds like a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to give phenols. For example, the diazonium salt of aniline (Ar-NH2) would hydrolyze to Ar-OH when treated with water or base. But here, the second step is H2O, then KOH and heat. So perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated with base and heat, leading to formation of a phenol group where the amine was.\n\nTherefore, the original compound had an amino group, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis becomes a hydroxy group. \n\nNow, let's get back to the structure.
