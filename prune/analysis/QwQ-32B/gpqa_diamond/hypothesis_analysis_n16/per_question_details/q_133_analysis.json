Hmm, actually, since HPO4^2- can lose another proton to form PO4^3-, but the amount of PO4^3- formed is very small compared to HPO4^2-, so the approximation [HPO4^2-] \u2248 0.02808 M is valid.\n\n[H+] is 8.05e-8 M.\n\nSo:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.05e-8)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 \u2248 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 = 5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.05e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 / 8.05e-8 \u2248 (5.0544 /8.05) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.6278 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.278e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.28e-7, which is close to option A) 6.24e-7, or perhaps there's some rounding differences here.

Is there any contribution from the first dissociation (H3PO4/H2PO4^-)? \n\nThe first dissociation (H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^-) has a Ka1 of 7.5e-3, which is much larger than Ka2 and Ka3. However, in our solution, we don't have H3PO4, but KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nThe H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But since there's no H3PO4 added, the main equilibria are between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (since the HPO4^2- can also lose a proton, but that's third dissociation with very low Ka). \n\nThe presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would mean that the solution's pH is buffered around the pKa2. The first dissociation's Ka1 is much larger, but since we don't have H3PO4 in solution (except perhaps a tiny amount from H2PO4^- acting as an acid?), but the main contribution to pH comes from the second dissociation. Hence, the pH calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7).

Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- comes from the second dissociation). The pKa2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 8 -0.79= 7.21). \n\nSo the pH of the solution should be close to the pKa2, because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. \n\nBut to find PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation, which is HPO4^2- <-> H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation. \n\nThe idea is that even though the solution is buffered around pKa2, the third dissociation will contribute a small amount of PO4^3-. \n\nLet me think of the approach here. Since we can consider the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of H+ can be approximated by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nThe concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are given by the amounts of the salts. The Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-), and KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- (since K+ is the counterion). \n\nSo the concentrations of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M (from Na2HPO4) and H2PO4^- is 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4). \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764. Taking log(0.764) is about log(0.76) is around -0.118, so pH \u2248 7.21 -0.118 \u2248 7.092. \n\nSo the pH is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find PO4^3-, we need to consider the third dissociation: \n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12 \n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028085 M (from the salt), but wait, actually, in the solution, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium.

So [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the equation for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.12e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544e-12, so 5.0544e-14. \n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8. \n\nSo 5.0544e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0544 /8.12) * 1e-6. \n\nCalculating 5.0544 divided by 8.12. Let's see, 8.12 \u00d7 0.622 = approx 5.05 (since 8*0.622=4.976, 0.12*0.622\u22480.0746, total ~5.05). So approximately 0.622. \n\nSo 0.622 \u00d7 1e-6 = 6.22e-7?",

However, in our solution, we don't have H3PO4, but KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nThe H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But since there's no H3PO4 added, the main equilibria are between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (since the HPO4^2- can also lose a proton, but that's third dissociation with very low Ka). \n\nThe presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would mean that the solution's pH is buffered around the pKa2. The first dissociation's Ka1 is much larger, but since we don't have H3PO4 in solution (except perhaps a tiny amount from H2PO4^- acting as an acid?), but the main contribution to pH comes from the second dissociation.

The pKa2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 8 -0.79= 7.21). \n\nSo the pH of the solution should be close to the pKa2, because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. \n\nBut to find PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation, which is HPO4^2- <-> H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation. \n\nThe idea is that even though the solution is buffered around pKa2, the third dissociation will contribute a small amount of PO4^3-. \n\nLet me think of the approach here. Since we can consider the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of H+ can be approximated by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nThe concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are given by the amounts of the salts. The Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-), and KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- (since K+ is the counterion). \n\nSo the concentrations of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M (from Na2HPO4) and H2PO4^- is 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4). \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764. Taking log(0.764) is about log(0.76) is around -0.118, so pH \u2248 7.21 -0.118 \u2248 7.092. \n\nSo the pH is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find PO4^3-, we need to consider the third dissociation: \n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12 \n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028085 M (from the salt), but wait, actually, in the solution, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium.

Since log(0.76) is around -0.118, and 0.764 is a bit higher. Maybe approximately -0.118? Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me think, log(0.764) = log(7.64\u00d710^-1) = log(7.64) -1. Log(7.64) is about 0.883 (since log(7.5)=0.875, so maybe 0.883). So 0.883 -1 = -0.117.

Since pH = 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09. Let me compute that. \n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.812 (since 10^0.09 \u2248 1.23, so reciprocal is ~0.812). So [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the equation for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.12e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544e-12, so 5.0544e-14. \n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8. \n\nSo 5.0544e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0544 /8.12) * 1e-6. \n\nCalculating 5.0544 divided by 8.12.

Is there any contribution from the first dissociation (H3PO4/H2PO4^-)? \n\nThe first dissociation (H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^-) has a Ka1 of 7.5e-3, which is much larger than Ka2 and Ka3. However, in our solution, we don't have H3PO4, but KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. \n\nThe H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But since there's no H3PO4 added, the main equilibria are between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (since the HPO4^2- can also lose a proton, but that's third dissociation with very low Ka). \n\nThe presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would mean that the solution's pH is buffered around the pKa2. The first dissociation's Ka1 is much larger, but since we don't have H3PO4 in solution (except perhaps a tiny amount from H2PO4^- acting as an acid?), but the main contribution to pH comes from the second dissociation. Hence, the pH calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7).

Since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- comes from the second dissociation). The pKa2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21 (since log(6.2)=0.79, so 8 -0.79= 7.21). \n\nSo the pH of the solution should be close to the pKa2, because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. \n\nBut to find PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation, which is HPO4^2- <-> H+ + PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation. \n\nThe idea is that even though the solution is buffered around pKa2, the third dissociation will contribute a small amount of PO4^3-. \n\nLet me think of the approach here. Since we can consider the solution as a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of H+ can be approximated by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nThe concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are given by the amounts of the salts. The Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates to give HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-), and KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- (since K+ is the counterion). \n\nSo the concentrations of HPO4^2- is 0.028085 M (from Na2HPO4) and H2PO4^- is 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4). \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764. Taking log(0.764) is about log(0.76) is around -0.118, so pH \u2248 7.21 -0.118 \u2248 7.092. \n\nSo the pH is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find PO4^3-, we need to consider the third dissociation: \n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12 \n\nWe can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028085 M (from the salt), but wait, actually, in the solution, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium.

The third dissociation is separate and involves HPO4^2- turning into PO4^3-.\n\nSo I think the approach is correct, but let me recheck the numbers.\n\nFirst, the pH calculation:\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03674.\n\npKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) \u2192 log(1.6129e7) \u2192 log(1.6e7) is about 7.206 (since 1e7 is 7, so 1.6e7 is 7.204). Let me compute it precisely: pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is log(1.6129e7). \n\nlog(1.6129e7) = log(1.6129) +7 \u2248 0.2076 +7 =7.2076. So pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).\n\n[base is HPO4^2- (0.02808), acid is H2PO4^- (0.03674)]\n\nlog(0.02808 /0.03674) = log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117. \n\nSo pH is 7.2076 - 0.117 \u22487.0906. So that's accurate. \n\nThen, pH is ~7.09. \n\nThen, for the third dissociation's HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+.\n\nThe pKa3 is 11.74, so pH is much lower (7.09 vs 11.74). Therefore, the ratio of PO4^3- to HPO4^2- is 10^(pH - pKa3) = 10^(7.09 -11.74) =10^(-4.65)= approx 2.24 x10^-5. \n\nThus, [PO4^3-] = (2.24e-5) * [HPO4^2-] \n\nSince [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808, then:\n\n0.02808 * 2.24e-5 = ?\n\nLet me compute again:\n\n0.02808 * 2.24e-5:\n\nMultiply 0.02808 * 2.24 first, then multiply by 1e-5.\n\n0.02808 *2.24 = ?\n\n0.028 *2=0.056\n\n0.028*0.24=0.00672\n\n0.00008*2.24=0.0001792",

The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH should be around the pKa2. Let's confirm.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])\n\nHere, for the second dissociation (H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2-), the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWe know the moles of each. The total volume is 200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L. So concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = moles / 0.2 = 0.007346 / 0.2 \u2248 0.03673 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 \u2248 0.028085 M\n\nSo the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.7645\n\nTaking the log of that: log(0.7645) \u2248 -0.117 (since log(0.7)= -0.155, and 0.76 is closer to 0.76, which is about -0.117).\n\npKa2 is the -log(Ka2).

Let me calculate that. \n\n6.2e-8: log(6.2) is about 0.792, so pKa2 \u2248 7.208. \n\nSo pH = 7.208 + log(0.764). \n\nCalculating log(0.764). Since log(0.76) is around -0.118, and 0.764 is a bit higher. Maybe approximately -0.118? Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let me think, log(0.764) = log(7.64\u00d710^-1) = log(7.64) -1. Log(7.64) is about 0.883 (since log(7.5)=0.875, so maybe 0.883). So 0.883 -1 = -0.117.

Since pH = 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09. Let me compute that. \n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.812 (since 10^0.09 \u2248 1.23, so reciprocal is ~0.812). So [H+] \u2248 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the equation for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.12e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544e-12, so 5.0544e-14. \n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8. \n\nSo 5.0544e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0544 /8.12) * 1e-6. \n\nCalculating 5.0544 divided by 8.12.

Let's compute that:\n\n1 / 136.09 = 0.007346 mol (exactly 1 divided by 136.09: 136.09 *0.0073 = 0.993, so 0.007346 gives 136.09 *0.007346 \u22481. So that's correct).\n\nSimilarly for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol. 1 /177.99 =0.005619 mol.\n\nThen concentrations divided by 0.2 L:\n\nKH2PO4: 0.007346 /0.2 =0.03673 M.\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.005619 /0.2 =0.028095 M.\n\nSo [HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M.\n\nCalculating pH:\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8).
