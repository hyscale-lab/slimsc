The high variability would be due to the presence of many different B cells each with their own V(D)J rearrangement. This is the primary antibody diversity. Therefore, the process that caused this variability is VDJ recombination. The fact that they are in the secondary lymphoid organ (where they are exposed to antigen) leads to activation of those B cells that have a high affinity, but the variability itself is due to the initial VDJ. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) VDJ recombination.",
          "text2": "Wait, but let me think again. The options are A and D. So what's the difference between the two? VDJ recombination is the initial rearrangement of the genes to make the variable regions. Somatic hypermutation is the later process that introduces mutations. \n\nThe question says that the variable heavy chain genes have high variability. If the cells are proliferating in response to antigen, then the variability is likely due to somatic hypermutation. \n\nSo the answer should be A.",
