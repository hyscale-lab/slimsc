To atomize them into gaseous C atoms, the energy is 7 \u00d7 1000 kJ/mol = 7000 kJ/mol.\n\n- The hydrogen atoms needed: each H comes from H2. Since the molecule has 19 H atoms, we need 19/2 moles of H2 (since each H2 has 2 H). The number of moles of H2 is (19/2) mol. The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol per bond. So the energy to break H-H bonds is (19/2) \u00d7 100 = 9.5 \u00d7100 = 950 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy to break bonds in reactants: 7000 + 950 = 7950 kJ/mol.\n\nThen, the energy released when forming the bonds in the product (the molecule):\n\nThe bonds formed are:\n\n- The C-C bonds: including single and double.\n\nDouble bonds: two C=C bonds (each 300 kJ/mol, but since bond energy is the energy required to break, the energy released when forming is also 300 per bond).",

For every mole of H2, you get 2 H atoms, so per H atom, you need 0.5 H2 bonds broken. So total H2 bonds to break for 22 H atoms is 11 moles (since 22 H atoms /2 =11 H2 moles).\n\nThus, energy to break H2 bonds: 11 \u00d7100 kJ =1100 kJ/mol.\n\nTotal energy for reactants (bonds broken):7\u00d71000 +11\u00d7100 =7000 +1100=8100.\n\nEnergy from forming bonds in the product (the molecule): sum of all bond energies in the molecule (C-C, C=C, C-H).\n\nWhich we calculated as 11200.\n\nSo \u0394Hf = 8100 - 11200 = -3100 kJ/mol.\n\nBut the options don't have this.

But C1 is also part of the double bond with C2. Since it's a double bond (C=C?), so how many bonds does C1 have? The C1 has two single bonds to the CH3 groups (each CH3 is a single bond to C1), then the double bond to C2. So total bonds from C1: 2 (CH3) + 2 (double bond) = 4. That's correct. So no extra H on C1 itself beyond the CH3 groups. \n\nC2: part of the =CH- group. The C2 is double-bonded to C1, and has a single bond to C3 (the next CH2 group). The remaining bonds on C2: since it's a double bond (counts as 2), plus single bond to C3 (1), so there's one more bond. That's a single H attached to C2. So C2 has one H.\n\nC3: part of the CH2 group. So connected to C2 and C4, and has two H's (since CH2 has two H's). \n\nC4: the CH(CH3) part. Connected to C3 and C5, and has a CH3 group (so one single bond to that CH3), and one more H.",

So:\n\nThe energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is:\n\n- Energy to atomize carbon: each mole of C (as graphite) to gaseous C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol. Since there are 12 carbons in the molecule, this term is 12 \u00d7 1000 kJ.\n\n- Energy to break H2 bonds: since each H atom comes from H2, the number of H atoms is 23. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, so the number of H2 molecules needed is 23/2. Each H2 bond requires 100 kJ/mol to break. So energy is (23/2)*100 kJ.\n\nThe energy released from forming the bonds in the compound:\n\nThe compound has various bonds:\n\n- C-C single bonds,\n\n- C=C double bonds,\n\n- C-H bonds.\n\nWe need to count each type.\n\nFirst, count the number of each bond type in the compound.\n\nLet's count bonds step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the structure again to count the bonds properly.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nWe need to count all the bonds:\n\nSingle bonds (C-C) and double bonds (C=C), and C-H bonds.\n\nLet me approach this by counting each bond type.\n\nFirst, C-H bonds. Each H in the molecule is bonded to a C, so the total number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms, which is 23.\n\nSo C-H bonds:23.\n\nNext, count the C=C double bonds. From the structure, there are two double bonds: one in the first segment (between the (CH3)2C and CH part), and one in the last segment (between the CH and the C(CH3)2 part).\n\nSo two C=C double bonds.\n\nNow, the remaining C-C bonds are single bonds.\n\nTotal C-C bonds: Let's calculate total valence bonds and subtract the double bonds.\n\nEach C atom has four bonds. Total bonds in the molecule (each bond connects two atoms):\n\nTotal bonds = (sum of all bonds)/2.\n\nThe total number of bonds is sum over all atoms of their valence bonds divided by 2.\n\nEach C has 4 bonds, each H has 1 bond.\n\nTotal bonds:\n\nTotal C atoms:12 \u2192 12\u00d74 =48,\n\nTotal H atoms:23 \u00d71 =23,\n\nTotal bonds (counted from each atom's perspective): (48 +23)/2 = 71/2= 35.5 \u2192 which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake here.",

Since each mole of C (graphite) becomes 1 mole of C atoms, so per mole of the compound, which has 12 C atoms, we need 12 * 1000 kJ. \n\nFor hydrogen: each mole of H2 gas must be broken into H atoms. Each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. Since each H2 molecule produces 2 H atoms, the energy needed per mole of H atoms is (100 kJ/mol H2) / 2. \n\nThe total H atoms needed are 22.

So:\n\nThe energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is:\n\n- Energy to atomize carbon: each mole of C (as graphite) to gaseous C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol. Since there are 12 carbons in the molecule, this term is 12 \u00d7 1000 kJ.\n\n- Energy to break H2 bonds: since each H atom comes from H2, the number of H atoms is 23. Each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, so the number of H2 molecules needed is 23/2. Each H2 bond requires 100 kJ/mol to break. So energy is (23/2)*100 kJ.\n\nThe energy released from forming the bonds in the compound:\n\nThe compound has various bonds:\n\n- C-C single bonds,\n\n- C=C double bonds,\n\n- C-H bonds.\n\nWe need to count each type.\n\nFirst, count the number of each bond type in the compound.\n\nLet's count bonds step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the structure again to count the bonds properly.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\nWe need to count all the bonds:\n\nSingle bonds (C-C) and double bonds (C=C), and C-H bonds.\n\nLet me approach this by counting each bond type.\n\nFirst, C-H bonds. Each H in the molecule is bonded to a C, so the total number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms, which is 23.\n\nSo C-H bonds:23.\n\nNext, count the C=C double bonds. From the structure, there are two double bonds: one in the first segment (between the (CH3)2C and CH part), and one in the last segment (between the CH and the C(CH3)2 part).\n\nSo two C=C double bonds.\n\nNow, the remaining C-C bonds are single bonds.\n\nTotal C-C bonds: Let's calculate total valence bonds and subtract the double bonds.\n\nEach C atom has four bonds. Total bonds in the molecule (each bond connects two atoms):\n\nTotal bonds = (sum of all bonds)/2.\n\nThe total number of bonds is sum over all atoms of their valence bonds divided by 2.\n\nEach C has 4 bonds, each H has 1 bond.\n\nTotal bonds:\n\nTotal C atoms:12 \u2192 12\u00d74 =48,\n\nTotal H atoms:23 \u00d71 =23,\n\nTotal bonds (counted from each atom's perspective): (48 +23)/2 = 71/2= 35.5 \u2192 which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake here.",

Since each mole of C (graphite) becomes 1 mole of C atoms, so per mole of the compound, which has 12 C atoms, we need 12 * 1000 kJ. \n\nFor hydrogen: each mole of H2 gas must be broken into H atoms. Each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. Since each H2 molecule produces 2 H atoms, the energy needed per mole of H atoms is (100 kJ/mol H2) / 2. \n\nThe total H atoms needed are 22.

So that's 12\u00d71000.\n\nFor H2: each mole of H2 has bond energy 100 kJ, so to break into H atoms, for each H atom, it's 100/2 per H. 22 H atoms \u2192 22*(100/2)=1100.\n\nTotal energy broken: 12,000+1,100=13,100.\n\nBonds formed in the compound: all the bonds in the compound (C-C, C=C, C-H), which we calculated as 11,200.\n\nThus, \u0394Hf = 13,100 -11,200=1,900 kJ/mol. \n\nSince the options have this as D but per gram, but the standard unit is per mole.

For each mole of C in the molecule (12 moles), that's 12*1000 =12,000 kJ.\n\nBreaking H2 into H atoms requires breaking H-H bonds. The molecule has 22 H atoms, so 11 moles of H2 (since each H2 gives 2 H atoms). The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so 11 mol *100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal energy required to break bonds in reactants: 12,000 + 1,100 = 13,100 kJ (same as before).\n\nThen, forming the bonds in the molecule releases energy equal to the sum of all bond energies in the molecule (the 11,200 kJ we calculated).\n\nThus, \u0394Hf = (energy to break bonds) - (energy released forming bonds) = 13,100 - 11,200 =1,900 kJ/mol.
