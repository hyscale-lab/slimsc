For example, in regions where DSG crosslinks other proteins to IKAROS, making the epitope inaccessible. \n\nIf that's the case, then the regions where this happens would be where IKAROS is part of a larger protein complex that's more crosslinked with DSG. Those regions might be active promoters or enhancers, where the transcription factors are part of big complexes. So when DSG is added, the crosslinking is so thorough that the antibody can't reach the epitope, leading to loss of signal. Thus, the peaks that disappear are at the true binding sites (active promoters/enhancers, D option). \n\nBut that would mean the PFA fixation didn't crosslink as much, so the antibody could still bind.
