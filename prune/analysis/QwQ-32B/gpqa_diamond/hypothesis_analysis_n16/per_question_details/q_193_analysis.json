Parallax decreases as distance increases. The given variation is N \u221d 1/plx^5. But how does that translate to a function of distance?\n\nLet me set up variables. Let\u2019s let N(plx) dplx be the number of stars in the parallax interval from plx to plx + dplx. We are told that N(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N(plx) = k/(plx)^5 where k is a constant. We need to find how the number of stars varies with distance, so we need to express this in terms of r. Since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. Therefore, substituting into N(plx), we get N(r) = k/( (1/r)^5 ) = k*r^5. But that's the number per unit parallax, but when changing variables from plx to r, we have to consider how the intervals transform. \n\nAh right! The key point here is that when changing variables, the differential also changes. So, if I want to find the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., dN/dr), I need to compute the transformation properly. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me define N(plx) dplx as the number of stars in the parallax interval dplx. The question states N(plx) \u221d 1/plx^5, so N(plx) = C / plx^5, where C is a constant. Now, we need to find the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. To do this, we need to express the number in terms of the distance variable instead of parallax. \n\nFirst, since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. The differential dplx can be expressed in terms of dr. Taking derivative, d(plx) = d(1/r) = -1/r\u00b2 dr. Therefore, dplx = - dr / r\u00b2. The negative sign indicates that as r increases, plx decreases, which makes sense. However, since we are dealing with magnitudes (the number of stars in a range), the absolute value would be considered. So, |dplx| = dr / r\u00b2. \n\nThe number of stars in the distance interval dr would then be N(plx) * |dplx|. Substituting N(plx) = C/(plx)^5 and plx = 1/r:\n\nNumber per dr = [C/( (1/r)^5 ) ] * (dr / r\u00b2 ) = C * r^5 * (dr / r\u00b2) = C * r^3 dr. \n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^3.",

Parallax decreases as distance increases. The given variation is N \u221d 1/plx^5. But how does that translate to a function of distance?\n\nLet me set up variables. Let\u2019s let N(plx) dplx be the number of stars in the parallax interval from plx to plx + dplx. We are told that N(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N(plx) = k/(plx)^5 where k is a constant. We need to find how the number of stars varies with distance, so we need to express this in terms of r. Since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. Therefore, substituting into N(plx), we get N(r) = k/( (1/r)^5 ) = k*r^5. But that's the number per unit parallax, but when changing variables from plx to r, we have to consider how the intervals transform. \n\nAh right! The key point here is that when changing variables, the differential also changes. So, if I want to find the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., dN/dr), I need to compute the transformation properly. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me define N(plx) dplx as the number of stars in the parallax interval dplx. The question states N(plx) \u221d 1/plx^5, so N(plx) = C / plx^5, where C is a constant. Now, we need to find the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. To do this, we need to express the number in terms of the distance variable instead of parallax. \n\nFirst, since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. The differential dplx can be expressed in terms of dr. Taking derivative, d(plx) = d(1/r) = -1/r\u00b2 dr. Therefore, dplx = - dr / r\u00b2. The negative sign indicates that as r increases, plx decreases, which makes sense. However, since we are dealing with magnitudes (the number of stars in a range), the absolute value would be considered. So, |dplx| = dr / r\u00b2. \n\nThe number of stars in the distance interval dr would then be N(plx) * |dplx|. Substituting N(plx) = C/(plx)^5 and plx = 1/r:\n\nNumber per dr = [C/( (1/r)^5 ) ] * (dr / r\u00b2 ) = C * r^5 * (dr / r\u00b2) = C * r^3 dr. \n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^3.",

So if you have a certain parallax range, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/plx^5. But how does that translate when considering distance?\n\nLet me recall that when changing variables from parallax to distance, you have to consider the differential. Because when you change variables, the density (number per unit distance) requires considering how the variable transforms. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote N(plx) dplx as the number of stars in a parallax interval from plx to plx + dplx. According to the problem, N(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N(plx) dplx = C / plx^5 dplx, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of stars per unit distance. Let's see. Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. Let's express everything in terms of r. The differential dplx can be expressed in terms of dr. Let's compute dr/dplx. \n\nStarting with plx = 1/r, so differentiating both sides with respect to plx:\n\nd(plx)/dr = -1/r\u00b2. Therefore, dr/dplx = - r\u00b2. But since we are dealing with absolute values for the interval, the negative sign can be ignored. So dr = r\u00b2 dplx. \n\nTherefore, dplx = dr / r\u00b2. \n\nSo substituting back into N(plx) dplx:\n\nN(plx) dplx = C/(plx^5) * (dr / r\u00b2).
