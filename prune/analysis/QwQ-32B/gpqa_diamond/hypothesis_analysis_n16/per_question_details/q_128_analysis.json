Let me recall: The mRNA is complementary to the template strand, so the mRNA sequence is the same as the coding strand, except T becomes U. Therefore, the DNA coding strand can be translated directly by replacing T with U, then using the standard codon chart. \n\nTherefore, to get the protein sequence from the DNA, we can split the DNA into triplets starting from the first nucleotide (assuming it's in frame), and then translate each triplet into the corresponding amino acid using the genetic code. \n\nThe given amino acid sequence starts with M (methionine), which is the start codon AUG.

That means the first seven amino acids are M E E P A V Q. But according to the given sequence, the fifth amino acid should be Q. This is a mismatch. \n\nTherefore, the DNA sequence of option A produces an amino acid sequence where the fifth residue is A (Ala), sixth is V (Val), and seventh is Q (Gln). But the given sequence has Q as the fifth residue. Hence, option A's DNA is incorrect.\n\nLooking at option B's DNA sequence at this point:\n\nThe first few codons of option B are the same up to position 6:\n\n1. ATG \u2192 M\n\n2. GAG \u2192 E\n\n3.

The total length is shorter than the others. Option C's DNA might be incomplete, so it's likely not correct.\n\nOption D's DNA seems to be longer and matches the required length.\n\nNow, back to the first approach: the key difference between options A and D is in the middle part where option A has \"CCCCGCAT\" and D has \"CCCAGAAT\".\n\nLet me see what the corresponding amino acids would be.\n\nTaking the DNA from that region in A:\n\nStarting after GAAGCT:\n\n\"CCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTG...\"\n\nSplitting into codons:\n\n- C C C \u2192 Pro\n- C G C \u2192 Arg\n- A T G \u2192 Met\n- C C A \u2192 Pro\n- G A G \u2192 Glu\n- G C T \u2192 Ala\n- G C T \u2192 Ala\n- C C C \u2192 Pro\n- etc.\n\nIn option D's DNA for the same region:\n\n\"CCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTG...\"\n\nCodons:\n\n- C C C \u2192 Pro\n- A G A \u2192 Arg\n- A T G \u2192 Met\n- C C A \u2192 Pro\n- G A G \u2192 Glu\n- G C T \u2192 Ala\n- etc.\n\nSo the first differences in amino acids are between the second codon (C G C vs A G A). Both codons encode Arg, so the amino acid is the same. The next codons are the same. So this difference doesn't affect the amino acid sequence.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the difference is further along. Let me look at another part.\n\nLooking at the very end of the DNA sequences, perhaps there's an extra or missing codon. Let me check the last few triplets before the stop codon.\n\nThe DNA sequences end with \"...ACTGA\", which is the stop codon TGA. So the last codon is TGA (stop). The previous codons would be ACTGA, so the stop is TGA.\n\nLooking at option A's DNA:\n\nThe last part is \"...ACTGA\"\n\nOption D's DNA ends similarly.\n\nHmm.",
