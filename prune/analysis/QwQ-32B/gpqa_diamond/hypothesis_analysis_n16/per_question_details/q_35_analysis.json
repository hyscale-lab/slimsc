So B is wrong too.\n\nOption C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2, but not of the Z-component, Az.\n\nHmm. Angular momentum operators satisfy commutation relations. Specifically, [Ay, Az] is not zero, so they don't commute. Therefore, a common eigenfunction of Ay and Az would require that they commute, which they don't. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. However, A\u00b2 (the square of the total angular momentum operator) commutes with each component, right? Like, A\u00b2 commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. Therefore, eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. So this statement C seems correct. Let me confirm that. Since A\u00b2 and Ay commute, they have simultaneous eigenfunctions. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2, but not of Az (since Ay and Az don't commute). So C looks correct. But let me check the other options before deciding.\n\nOption D) The eigenfunctions \u03c6 of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.\n\nHmm.

These are real numbers because h is Planck's constant and the constants are real. So the eigenvalues of Ay are purely real. Therefore, any option that mentions an imaginary part in the eigenvalues is wrong. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A says the imaginary parts are \u00b12\u03c0h. But if the eigenvalues are real, then their imaginary parts are zero.

Option C states that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2 (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of Az. \n\nHmm. In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S_y (since Ay is proportional to S_y here) are not eigenstates of S_z, because the operators S_y and S_z don't commute (their commutator is non-zero). But they do commute with S\u00b2 (the square of the total angular momentum operator). Since S\u00b2 commutes with all the components, then yes, the eigenfunctions of S_y should also be eigenfunctions of S\u00b2. Therefore, since Ay is a component of the angular momentum (like S here), the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) would also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2 (which would be S\u00b2 scaled by c\u00b2, perhaps). But the question is about Ay and A\u00b2. So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Well, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are different. So an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az unless it's a common eigenstate, which generally they don't have except for certain cases. So that part is also correct.

The basis functions here\u2014since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions are two-dimensional vectors. The matrix is in some basis, like the usual basis vectors.

Option C states that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A\u00b2 (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of Az. \n\nHmm. In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of S_y (since Ay is proportional to S_y here) are not eigenstates of S_z, because the operators S_y and S_z don't commute (their commutator is non-zero). But they do commute with S\u00b2 (the square of the total angular momentum operator). Since S\u00b2 commutes with all the components, then yes, the eigenfunctions of S_y should also be eigenfunctions of S\u00b2.

Therefore, the eigenvalues should indeed be \u00b1\u0127/2, which in terms of h would be \u00b1(h/(4\u03c0)) * 1, so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1h/(4\u03c0). \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \u00b12\u03c0h and real parts \u00b1h/(4\u03c0).

So the first part of option C is correct. \n\nNow, does it not have to be an eigenfunction of Az? Since Ay and Az do not commute (they satisfy the commutation relation [A_y, A_z] = i\u0127 A_x), their eigenvectors are not shared unless in special cases. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az unless the state is also an eigenstate of both, which isn't generally the case. So C's statement is correct. \n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions \u03c6 of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are typically the eigenvectors, but in the standard basis, unless the operator is diagonal. The matrix Ay here is not diagonal in the standard basis (since it has off-diagonal elements). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are specific vectors. The basis functions (like the standard basis vectors e1 and e2) are not the same as the eigenvectors unless the matrix is diagonal. So D's statement might not be correct. The question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. The basis functions here might refer to the standard basis, but the eigenvectors of Ay are different. Let's see. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y are known. Let me compute them to check.\n\nLet me compute eigenvectors for S (the \u03c3_y matrix). Let's take eigenvalue +1 first. \n\nWe have (\u03c3_y - I) v =0. \n\n\u03c3_y - I is:\n\n[ -1   -i ]\n\n[ i   -1 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n-1*v1 -i*v2 =0 \n\ni*v1 -1*v2 =0\n\nLet's write equations:\n\nFirst equation: -v1 -i v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = -i v2 \n\nSecond equation: i v1 - v2 =0. Substitute v1 from first equation into second: i*(-i v2) - v2 = ( -i\u00b2 v2 ) -v2 \u2192 ( -(-1)v2 ) -v2 = v2 -v2 =0. So consistent. \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v = (v1, v2) = (-i v2, v2). Let v2 =1, then v1 =-i. So eigenvector is (-i, 1).

Since Ay and Az do not commute (they satisfy the commutation relation [A_y, A_z] = i\u0127 A_x), their eigenvectors are not shared unless in special cases.

So C's statement is correct. \n\nOption D: The eigenfunctions \u03c6 of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are typically the eigenvectors, but in the standard basis, unless the operator is diagonal. The matrix Ay here is not diagonal in the standard basis (since it has off-diagonal elements). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are specific vectors. The basis functions (like the standard basis vectors e1 and e2) are not the same as the eigenvectors unless the matrix is diagonal. So D's statement might not be correct. The question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. The basis functions here might refer to the standard basis, but the eigenvectors of Ay are different. Let's see. For example, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_y are known. Let me compute them to check.\n\nLet me compute eigenvectors for S (the \u03c3_y matrix). Let's take eigenvalue +1 first. \n\nWe have (\u03c3_y - I) v =0. \n\n\u03c3_y - I is:\n\n[ -1   -i ]\n\n[ i   -1 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n-1*v1 -i*v2 =0 \n\ni*v1 -1*v2 =0\n\nLet's write equations:\n\nFirst equation: -v1 -i v2 =0 \u2192 v1 = -i v2 \n\nSecond equation: i v1 - v2 =0.

Let me think again about option C: \"The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A\u00b2, but not of the Z-component, Az.\"\n\nSince A\u00b2 is the total angular momentum squared, which commutes with any component, so yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A\u00b2. Therefore, C's first part is correct. The second part says \"but not of the Z-component, Az.\" Since Ay and Az do not commute, their eigenfunctions are different, so an eigenfunction of Ay is not an eigenfunction of Az. So the statement in C is correct. So both C and D might be correct?",

Since A\u00b2 = A_x\u00b2 + A_y\u00b2 + A_z\u00b2, and the components of angular momentum satisfy [A\u00b2, A_y] =0, so they share eigenfunctions. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A\u00b2. However, Ay and Az do not commute, so they cannot have simultaneous eigenfunctions.
