The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. So the total spotted area is 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. \n\nNow, the brightness variation from spots is calculated by the difference in flux between the spots and the surrounding photosphere. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The amplitude of the light curve variation (delta F / F) would be the change in flux when the spots rotate in and out of view. \n\nThe formula for the flux from a star is F = \u03c3 T^4 * A, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and A is the area. \n\nSo the total flux without spots would be F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2. But with spots, part of the area has a lower temperature. The spotted area (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2) has temperature Teff - 1000K, which is 5000K here. The rest (4\u03c0R\u00b2 - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2) has Teff = 6000K.",

The maximum variation in brightness would occur when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us (so all the spots are visible) versus when the opposite hemisphere (without spots) is facing us. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the two cases.\n\nThe effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

The other case is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so the entire visible hemisphere has no spots. \n\nTherefore, the difference in flux between these two cases is the amplitude of the variation. \n\nThe amplitude of the variation (delta F / F) would be the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when the unspotted side is facing us, divided by the average flux. \n\nLet me compute the flux in both cases. \n\nFirst, let's denote the normal flux per unit area as F0 = \u03c3 T_eff^4, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we are comparing ratios, we can ignore constants. \n\nLet me compute the total flux of the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. \n\nThe visible hemisphere has area 2\u03c0R\u00b2. 20% is covered in spots (so 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 area), which have temperature T_spot = 5000 K.

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation.\"\n\nAh, so the spots are fixed on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots will rotate in and out of the observer's view. But the star is a sphere, so the visible hemisphere changes as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the observer sees the spots, leading to a lower flux. When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing, flux is higher. So the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when it's not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nCalculating those two fluxes:\n\nLet me denote F_max as when non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when spotted is visible.\n\nF_max = flux from the non-spotted hemisphere (which is the entire non-spotted side, which is the other hemisphere which is not covered by spots at all) plus the non-spotted part of the other hemisphere?",

The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

The other case is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so the entire visible hemisphere has no spots. \n\nTherefore, the difference in flux between these two cases is the amplitude of the variation. \n\nThe amplitude of the variation (delta F / F) would be the difference between the flux when the spotted side is facing us and when the unspotted side is facing us, divided by the average flux. \n\nLet me compute the flux in both cases. \n\nFirst, let's denote the normal flux per unit area as F0 = \u03c3 T_eff^4, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we are comparing ratios, we can ignore constants. \n\nLet me compute the total flux of the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. \n\nThe visible hemisphere has area 2\u03c0R\u00b2. 20% is covered in spots (so 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 area), which have temperature T_spot = 5000 K.

Hmm, maybe the entire star's surface has spots, but only on one hemisphere? Or the spots are only on one hemisphere, and the filling factor there is 20% of that hemisphere's area? The wording says \"one hemisphere... with a filling factor of 20%\". So the spots cover 20% of the area of that one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is without spots. So the total area of spots on the entire star is 20% of one hemisphere's area. \n\nSo, the total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Each hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2.

The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The amplitude of the light curve variation (delta F / F) would be the change in flux when the spots rotate in and out of view. \n\nThe formula for the flux from a star is F = \u03c3 T^4 * A, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and A is the area. \n\nSo the total flux without spots would be F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2.
