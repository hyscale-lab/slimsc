So, the original X's components undergo some reaction (disproportionation) to form two different saturated compounds?\n\nAlso, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Let's see, mass fraction H is (mass H)/(mass compound) = 14.28% = 0.1428. Let me denote the molecular formula of Z as CnHm. The mass of hydrogen is (m * 1)/(n*12 + m*1) = 0.1428. Let's rearrange this equation.

The mass fraction of H is (mass of H)/(total mass) = (y * 1.008)/( (x*12.01) + (y*1.008) ) = 0.1428. Let's approximate the atomic masses: H as 1, C as 12.

Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen.\"\n\nAh! So Z is part of Y. So Y contains Z and another substance, which when hydrogenated also gives Z. Therefore, the other component of Y must be a compound that can hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane). Since Y's components do not decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. If one of them is Z (cyclohexane, which is already saturated), then the other must also be a saturated compound that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane.",
