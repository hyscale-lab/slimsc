However, since in the problem we are given the radial velocities (the observed ones), their amplitudes are K1 = v1 sin i and K2 = v2 sin i. \n\nBut when taking ratios, the sin i terms cancel.

However, since in the problem we are given the radial velocities (the observed ones), their amplitudes are K1 = v1 sin i and K2 = v2 sin i. \n\nBut when taking ratios, the sin i terms cancel.

So in this case, we can actually calculate the masses without needing the inclination, because sin i is 1. Therefore, the mass of the system can be determined using the observed radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital period.\n\nThe formula for the total mass of the system (M1 + M2) can be derived using Kepler's third law. Let me see. Let me consider the relation between the velocities and the masses.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are inversely proportional to the masses of the respective stars. Because each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass (since the total momentum is conserved, so m1*v1 = m2*v2, so v1/v2 = m2/m1). Since K1 and K2 are the velocities, K1/K2 = M2/M1.\n\nSo, M2 = M1*(K1/K2). Therefore, the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + M1*(K1/K2) = M1*(1 + K1/K2). Hmm, but maybe that's not directly helpful yet.",

Let's express m1 = (K2/K1) m2. So substitute into M:\n\nM = m1 + m2 = ( (K2/K1) + 1 ) m2 \n\nNow, let's take the expression for K1:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a m2 ) / ( P M )\n\nWe can solve for a:\n\na = ( K1 P M ) / ( 2\u03c0 m2 )\n\nBut then we can plug into Kepler's third law. Let's try that. \n\nKepler's third law says:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G )^{-1} ( a^3 / P\u00b2 )\n\nSo plug a into this equation:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G )^{-1} * [ ( ( K1 P M ) / (2 \u03c0 m2 ) )^3 ) / P\u00b2 ]\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps simplifying.",

Let me see. Let me consider the relation between the velocities and the masses.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are inversely proportional to the masses of the respective stars. Because each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass (since the total momentum is conserved, so m1*v1 = m2*v2, so v1/v2 = m2/m1). Since K1 and K2 are the velocities, K1/K2 = M2/M1.\n\nSo, M2 = M1*(K1/K2). Therefore, the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + M1*(K1/K2) = M1*(1 + K1/K2).
