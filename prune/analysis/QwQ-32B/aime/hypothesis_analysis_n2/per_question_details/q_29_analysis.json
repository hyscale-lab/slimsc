Let's assume that side DC is along the x-axis. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is parallel to DC, and AD is parallel to BC. Since BC is 16, that would be the vertical side. So if D is (0,0), then C would be (AB, 0) because DC = AB. Since AB is 107, then DC is 107, so point C is (107,0). Then point B would be (107, 16), since BC is 16.",

So AB is length 107, BC is 16, so that would make the rectangle have length 107 and height 16. So coordinates: Let me fix coordinate system with point D at (0,0). Then, since AD is vertical (assuming standard orientation), so point A is (0,16). Then moving along AB to point B, which would be (107,16). Then point C, which is the last corner, would be at (107, 0).",
