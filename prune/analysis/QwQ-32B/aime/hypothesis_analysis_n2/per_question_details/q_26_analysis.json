          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry? Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me set coordinates for triangle ABC. Since AC is given as 10, maybe place point A at (0,0) and point C at (10,0), so that AC is along the x-axis. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of B using the given lengths AB=5 and BC=9.\n\nLet me denote coordinates: Let\u2019s let A be (0,0), C be (10,0). Let B be (x,y). Then AB distance is 5: so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=5, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25. The distance from B to C is 9: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y\u00b2 ) = 9, so (x-10)^2 + y\u00b2 =81. Subtract the first equation from the second: (x-10)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =81-25 => x\u00b2 -20x +100 -x\u00b2 =56 => -20x +100=56 => -20x= -44 => x= 44/20 = 11/5 = 2.2. Then x=11/5. Then plug back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25: (121/25) + y\u00b2 =25, so y\u00b2 =25 - 121/25 = (625 -121)/25 = 504/25, so y= sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504)=sqrt(4*126)=2*sqrt(126)=2*sqrt(9*14)=6*sqrt(14).",

Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set coordinates with C at (0,0), A at (10,0). Then point B is (x,y). Then AB =5, BC=9, AC=10. So, coordinates:\n\nCoordinates of C: (0,0)\n\nCoordinates of A: (10,0)\n\nCoordinates of B: (x,y)\n\nWe can write equations based on distances:\n\nAB distance: sqrt[(x -10)^2 + y^2] = 5,\n\nBC distance: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] = 9,\n\nSo, from BC: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 81,\n\nFrom AB: (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25,\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(x -10)^2 + y^2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 -81,\n\nExpanding (x\u00b2 -20x +100) -x\u00b2 = -56,\n\n-20x +100 = -56,\n\n-20x = -156,\n\nx = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8\n\nThen, substitute x into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\n(39/5)^2 + y\u00b2 =81,\n\n(1521/25) + y\u00b2 = 81,\n\ny\u00b2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25,\n\nThus y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5 = (2*sqrt(126))/5 = (2*3*sqrt(14))/5 = 6*sqrt(14)/5 \u2248 6*3.7417/5 \u2248 4.4899, which matches the Asymptote code's coordinates (B was at (7.8,4.4899)). So coordinates are consistent.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nA: (10,0)\n\nB: (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, we need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since points A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) are on the circle.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle equation. Let me denote the general equation of a circle as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nSince point C(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in A(10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 + D*10 + E*0 =0 \u21d2 100 +10D =0 \u21d2 D= -10.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in B(39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n( (39/5)^2 + ( (6\u221a14)/5)^2 ) -10*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25,\n\n(6\u221a14 /5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25,\n\nSo sum is (1521 +504)/25 = 2025/25 =81.\n\nThen the first part is 81.\n\nThen -10*(39/5) = -78,\n\nSo equation becomes 81 -78 + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 E= -3*(5)/(6\u221a14) = -15/(6\u221a14) = -5/(2\u221a14).
