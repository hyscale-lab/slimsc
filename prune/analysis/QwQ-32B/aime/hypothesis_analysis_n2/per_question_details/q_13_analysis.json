The walking time is (240 - t) minutes. \n\nThe time taken to walk 9 km at speed s km/h is equal to (distance / speed) * 60 minutes. Because speed is km per hour, so time in hours is 9/s, so in minutes it's (9/s)*60.\n\nSo, walking time in minutes is (9/s)*60. \n\nTherefore, according to the first scenario:\n\n(9/s)*60 + t = 240. \n\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, the speed is s + 2 km/h, so the walking time in minutes is (9/(s+2))*60. The total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. So:\n\n(9/(s + 2))*60 + t = 144.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) (9/s)*60 + t = 240\n\n2) (9/(s + 2))*60 + t = 144\n\nI can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t:\n\n[ (9/s)*60 + t ] - [ (9/(s + 2))*60 + t ] = 240 - 144\n\nSimplifying:\n\n60*(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) = 96\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n60*9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 96\n\nDivide both sides by 60*9:\n\n(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 96 / (60*9)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n96 divided by (60*9). Let's see, 60*9 is 540, so 96/540. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 12: 8/45. \n\nSo:\n\n1/s - 1/(s + 2) = 8/45\n\nLet me combine the left side fractions:\n\n[(s + 2) - s]/[s(s + 2)] = 8/45\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2/[s(s + 2)] = 8/45\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2 * 45 = 8 * s(s + 2)\n\n90 = 8s(s + 2)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n45 = 4s(s + 2)",
