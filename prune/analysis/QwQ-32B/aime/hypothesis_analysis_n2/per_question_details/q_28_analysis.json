Yes, a disphenoid has three pairs of equal opposite edges, so that's exactly the case here. So this is a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron with congruent opposite edges. I remember that in a disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, but actually, no, maybe not necessarily.",

For example, all faces are congruent triangles, but in this case, let me check: Are all the faces congruent?",
