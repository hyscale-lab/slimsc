          "text1": "Wait, yes. So, the expression is of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, where A = 324 and B = -432. The maximum value is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). So in this case, the maximum would be sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's see, 300\u00b2 = 90000, 24\u00b2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300 + 24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 + 24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976. So 324^2 = 104,976.\n\nThen 432 squared: 432^2. Let's compute 400\u00b2 = 160,000, 32\u00b2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. So 432^2 is 186,624.\n\nTherefore, the sum of squares is 104,976 + 186,624 = let's see: 100,000 + 180,000 is 280,000, then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600, so total is 291,600. Therefore sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let's see, 540 squared is 291,600 because 54 squared is 2916, so 540 squared is (54*10)^2 = 54\u00b2 * 100 = 2916 * 100 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore the maximum value of the real part is 540?",
