Yes, that adds up. \n\nSo the binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000. Let me check:\n\nBreaking down:\n\n2^10 (1024) is the 11th bit (since starting at 0). Let me list the bits:\n\nPosition: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nBits:        1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0",
          "text2": "Wait, that's my mistake! Oh no, I thought 2024 -1024 was 900, but that's incorrect. 2024 -1000 is 1024, so subtract 1024 from 2024 gives 1000. So my previous steps were wrong because of this miscalculation.\n\nOkay, starting over:\n\n2024 divided by 1024 (2^10) is 1 with remainder 2024 - 1024 = 1000.\n\n1000 divided by 512 (2^9) is 1, remainder 1000 -512 = 488.\n\n488 divided by 256 (2^8) is 1, remainder 488 -256 = 232.\n\n232 divided by 128 (2^7) is 1, remainder 232 -128 = 104.\n\n104 divided by 64 (2^6) is 1, remainder 104 -64 = 40.\n\n40 divided by 32 (2^5) is 1, remainder 40 -32 = 8.\n\n8 divided by 8 (2^3) is 1, remainder 0.\n\nSo the exponents here are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.\n\nLet me verify the sum:\n\n2^10=1024, 2^9=512, 2^8=256, 2^7=128, 2^6=64, 2^5=32, 2^3=8.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1024 + 512 = 1536\n\n1536 +256 = 1792\n\n1792 +128 = 1920\n\n1920 +64 = 1984\n\n1984 +32 = 2016\n\n2016 +8 = 2024. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo, the binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000. Let's confirm that:\n\nBreaking down the exponents:\n\nFrom the exponents 10 down to 0:\n\nPosition 10: 1\n\n9:1\n\n8:1\n\n7:1\n\n6:1\n\n5:1\n\n4:0\n\n3:1\n\n2:0\n\n1:0\n\n0:0",
