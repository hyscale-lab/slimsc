          "text2": "Wait, let me consider the polynomial Q(x) = x^13 - 1, whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity. Then the product we are looking for is the product over all roots z of Q(x) of f(z) = z\u00b2 - 2 z + 2. So that would be the same as the product of f(z) for each root z of Q(x). \n\nThere is a theorem that says that if Q(x) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (x - z_i), then the product over i of f(z_i) is equal to the resultant of Q and f, but I might need to check.",
