          "text1": "Alternatively, let me think for our specific case, n=8, and we need exactly 4 direction changes, so 5 runs. Since the path must start with either R or U, so two cases:\n\nCase 1: Start with R. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So total R runs: 3, U runs: 2. So the total R steps are sum of three positive integers (each run's length) equal to 8, and similarly U steps sum of two positive integers equal to 8.\n\nThe number of ways to partition the R steps into 3 runs is C(8-1, 3-1)=C(7,2). Similarly for U steps, C(7,1). So total for this case: C(7,2)*C(7,1).\n\nCase 2: Start with U. Then the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So U runs: 3, R runs: 2. Then the same logic: C(7,2)*C(7,1). So total for both cases is 2*C(7,2)*C(7,1).\n\nCalculating this gives 2*(21)*(7) = 294. Hmm. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check with a smaller grid.\n\nSuppose instead of 8x8, let's take a 2x2 grid, so moving from (0,0) to (2,2). Let's see how many paths with exactly 2 direction changes. Since in a 2x2 grid, the path length is 4, and direction changes would be, for example, R, R, U, U has 1 change. R, U, R, U has 3 changes.",
          "text2": "Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm the logic here. \n\nEach direction starting with R or U gives us a certain number of runs. Since the path must have exactly four direction changes, so five runs. Depending on starting direction, the number of R and U runs differ. \n\nStarting with R: 3 R runs and 2 U runs. \n\nThe number of ways is the product of the combinations for R runs and U runs. \n\nYes, so for the R runs, since they have to sum to 8 in 3 parts, the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. \n\nSimilarly, the U runs sum to 8 in 2 parts: C(7,1)=7. \n\nMultiply those, 21*7=147. \n\nSame for starting with U, so another 147, so total 294. \n\nHmm, but let me see with an example. For instance, if the grid was smaller, like 2x2 grid, going from (0,0) to (2,2). \n\nSuppose we want paths with exactly 2 direction changes. Then the number of runs is 3. \n\nSo starting with R: runs R, U, R. The R runs sum to 2, so two R runs (each at least 1). So R1 + R2 =2. That has C(1,1)=1 solution (1+1). The U run is 2, so U1=2. So 1*1=1. Similarly starting with U: U, R, U. Similarly 1 way. So total 2. \n\nBut in a 2x2 grid, the total paths with 2 direction changes would be 2 (the two paths that go RURU or URUR).",
