But how?\n\nIf they are all the same radius, they must be in a straight line, but in a corner between two sides. The only way for multiple circles of the same radius to be tangent to two sides and each other is if the angle between the sides is 180 degrees, which is a line. Not possible in a triangle.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect. Maybe the problem is referring to a different configuration.",
