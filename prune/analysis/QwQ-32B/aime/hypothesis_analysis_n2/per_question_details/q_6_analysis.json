          "text1": "Wait, no, let's think step by step.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x):\n\nFor x \u22650, f(x) = |x - 1/2|. Because |x| =x, so |x| -1/2 is x -1/2. So taking absolute value of that, so for x between 0 and 1/2, x -1/2 is negative, so absolute value makes it 1/2 -x. For x \u22651/2, it's x -1/2. So the right half of the graph (for x \u22650) is a V-shape with vertex at (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x <0, it's symmetric, so the left half is a V-shape with vertex at (-1/2, 0). So overall, the graph of f(x) has two V's pointing upwards, each with their vertices at (\u00b11/2, 0), and going upwards to the left and right.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = ||x| -1/4|. So following the same logic, the function g(x) will have vertices at |x|=1/4, so x=\u00b11/4, and the minimum value 0 there, and increasing elsewhere. So the right half (x\u22650) is |x -1/4|, so for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 -x, and for x \u22651/4, it's x -1/4. So again, similar to f(x) but with vertices at \u00b11/4.\n\nNow, the problem involves composing these functions with sin and cos functions, then scaling by 4. Let me parse the functions step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider y = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). Let me break down the inside first:\n\nStart with sin(2\u03c0x). That's a sine wave with period 1 (since the period of sin(kx) is 2\u03c0/k, so here 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0)=1). So sin(2\u03c0x) oscillates between -1 and 1 with period 1.\n\nThen, apply f to that. So f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |. Let me think about the range here. Since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 0 and 1, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/2 will range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value of that gives us between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is between 0 and 1/2. Then, multiplying by 4g(...) but actually, wait, the function is 4 times g of f(sin(...)).",
          "text2": "Wait, actually, since it's built from absolute values, it's symmetric about the y-axis. So the graph is a piecewise linear function with vertices at x = \u00b11/2, where it reaches zero, and peaks at x=0 at 1/2. So between -1/2 and 1/2, it's a downward V, and outside that interval, upward V.\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis.\n\ng(x) is the absolute value of (|x| - 1/4). \n\nSo when |x| \u2264 1/4, then |x| -1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. \n\nWhen |x| \u22651/4, then it's |x| -1/4. \n\nTherefore, the graph of g(x) is similar but with the \"valley\" at |x|=1/4, being zero there, peaking at x=0 with g(0)=1/4, then decreasing to zero at |x|=1/4, then increasing beyond that. So again, symmetric about the y-axis, with a minimum at x=0?",
