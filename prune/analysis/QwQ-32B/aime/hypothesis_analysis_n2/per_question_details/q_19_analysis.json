          "text1": "Wait, but maybe there are other relations. Let me think.\n\nWe also have the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius squared:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r. \n\nBut we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. Earlier, we used that OIA is right-angled at I, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Which gives us IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - (R\u00b2 - 2 R r) = 2 R r.",
          "text2": "Wait, that's the formula, right? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Is that correct? Let me see. Let me recall the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. Hmm, actually, I think that formula is correct. Let me verify with an equilateral triangle. Suppose in an equilateral triangle, the inradius is (a\u221a3)/6 and circumradius is (a\u221a3)/3, so R = 2r. Then OI should be zero because both centers coincide. Plugging into the formula, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = (4r\u00b2) - 2*(2r)*r = 4r\u00b2 -4r\u00b2 =0, which works. So that formula is correct. Okay, so OI squared is equal to R squared minus 2Rr. \n\nBut in this problem, there's an additional condition: IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe I need to use some vector approach or coordinate geometry here?",

          "text1": "Wait, OI is from O(0,0) to I(1, I_y), so the vector OI is (1, I_y). \n\nThe vector IA is from I(1, I_y) to A(13, 0), so it's (13 -1, 0 - I_y) = (12, -I_y). \n\nTherefore, the dot product of OI and IA is (1)(12) + (I_y)(-I_y) = 12 - (I_y)^2. \n\nSince they are perpendicular, this must equal zero:\n\n12 - (I_y)^2 = 0 \u21d2 (I_y)^2 = 12 \u21d2 I_y = \u00b12*sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the incenter I are (1, 2\u221a3) or (1, -2\u221a3). Since the triangle can be oriented either way, but we can assume it's in the upper half-plane, so let's take I_y = 2\u221a3. \n\nTherefore, coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3). \n\nNow, let's see if we can use this to find the sides. \n\nFirst, the inradius r is 6, which is the distance from I to any side. For example, the distance from I to side BC should be 6. Let me see if we can compute that.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is at (0,0), and A is at (13,0), then the vector OI is from O(0,0) to I(h,k), so the vector is (h,k). The vector IA is from I(h,k) to A(13,0), so the vector is (13 - h, -k). The dot product of OI and IA should be zero because they are perpendicular. \n\nSo, (h, k) \u2022 (13 - h, -k) = 0 \u21d2 h(13 - h) + k*(-k) = 0 \u21d2 13h - h\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = 0 \u21d2 13h = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2. \n\nBut OI squared is h\u00b2 + k\u00b2, which we know is 13 (since OI\u00b2 = 13). So substituting h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 into the equation gives 13h =13 \u21d2 h =1. \n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the incenter I is 1. Therefore, I is at (1, k), where k is such that h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 =13 \u21d2 1 + k\u00b2 =13 \u21d2 k\u00b2=12 \u21d2 k=\u00b12\u221a3. \n\nTherefore, the incenter I has coordinates (1, 2\u221a3) or (1, -2\u221a3). Since the triangle can be oriented either way, but the inradius is positive, so probably the y-coordinate can be positive or negative. However, perhaps the specific position doesn't matter, but let's pick (1, 2\u221a3) for simplicity. \n\nSo, coordinates of I are (1, 2\u221a3). \n\nNow, the incenter coordinates can also be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. \n\nIn general, the incenter coordinates (if we have the triangle with vertices at coordinates A(x_A, y_A), B(x_B, y_B), C(x_C, y_C)) is given by:\n\nI_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c),\n\nI_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B, C respectively.",
