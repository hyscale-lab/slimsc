          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that N mod7 must satisfy four different congruences:\n\nLet me denote N mod7 as x.\n\nThen:\n\nFrom changing A to1: (N - 1000(A -1)) mod7 =0 \u21d2 (x - 1000(A-1) mod7) mod7 =0 \u21d2 x \u22611000(A-1) mod7.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nChanging B to1: (N - 100(B -1)) mod7 =0 \u21d2 x \u2261100(B -1) mod7.\n\nChanging C to1: x \u226110(C -1) mod7,\n\nChanging D to1: x \u2261 (D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, all four expressions must be equal mod7 to x. Therefore, they must be equal to each other mod7.\n\nTherefore, in order for all these to hold, we must have:\n\n1000(A -1) \u2261100(B -1) \u226110(C -1) \u2261(D -1) mod7.\n\nTherefore, these four expressions must all be congruent mod7. So they have to form a chain of congruences.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the key is to choose A, B, C, D digits (each 0-9 except A\u22600) such that:\n\n(1) 1000(A -1) \u2261100(B -1) mod7,\n\n(2) 100(B -1) \u226110(C -1) mod7,\n\n(3) 10(C -1) \u2261(D -1) mod7,\n\nand also, since N is the original number, we need to ensure that when any digit is changed to1, the result is divisible by7, so N must satisfy the above congruences. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the way to proceed is to first set up equations (1), (2), (3) as before, but then also ensure that the digits B, C, D are chosen such that these congruences hold, and also that N itself mod7 is congruent to all those expressions.",
