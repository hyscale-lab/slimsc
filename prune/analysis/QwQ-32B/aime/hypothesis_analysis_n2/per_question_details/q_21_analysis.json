          "text2": "Wait, let me think again. Let me restate the equation:\n\nWe have d1 + d2 = s,\n\nand d1*b + d2 = s^2.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\nd1*b + d2 - (d1 + d2) = s^2 - s,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s,\n\nso d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nTherefore, for each s, if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), then d1 is an integer. So the key is that (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1). So, (s^2 - s) mod (b-1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, for a given b, the number of s (in the appropriate range) where (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and the corresponding d1 and d2 are valid digits (d1 between 1 and b-1, d2 between 0 and b-1, as per base b's digits).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each b, count the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that:\n\n1. (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1).\n\n2. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) must be between 1 and b-1.\n\n3. d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, given that d1 is already between 1 and b-1 (from the first condition), and d2 = s - d1. Since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and d1 is between 1 and b-1, then d2 could be between s - (b-1) and s -1. But since d2 must be non-negative, that requires that d1 \u2264 s, so s - d1 \u2265 0. Since d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1), this would require that (s^2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 s. Let's see:\n\n(s^2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 s\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1) (assuming b >1 which it is):\n\ns^2 - s \u2264 s(b -1)\n\ns^2 - s - s(b -1) \u22640\n\ns^2 - s - s b + s \u22640",

So n is a perfect square. So the two-digit number in base b must correspond to a perfect square. Therefore, the problem is to find all two-digit numbers in base b which are perfect squares, and the sum of their digits equals the square root.\n\nTherefore, let me rephrase the problem again: For a given base b, how many two-digit numbers in base b (so numbers from b to b\u00b2 - 1) are perfect squares, and such that the sum of their digits is equal to the square root of the number.\n\nWe need to find the minimal base b where the count of such numbers exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, okay.
