Let's see. First check mod7. Since 7 is prime. Let's see n^4 mod7. The possible residues mod7: n from 0 to 6.\n\n0^4=0; 1^4=1; 2^4=16\u22612 mod7; 3^4=81\u22614 mod7 (since 81-11*7=81-77=4); 4^4=256 mod7. 256 divided by7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4 mod7. 4^4\u22614; 5^4\u2261(5 mod7)^4. 5^2=25\u22614 mod7, so 5^4=(4)^2=16\u22612 mod7. 6^4\u2261(6 mod7)^4. 6\u2261-1 mod7, so (-1)^4=1 mod7.

Thus p=7 can't work.\n\nNext prime is p=11. Let me check mod121 (since p\u00b2 is 121). But first check if possible mod11. Let's see n^4 mod11.

Let me think.\n\nWe need n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. That implies that n^4 \u2261-1 mod p. So first, for such a prime p to exist, there must be a solution to x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p. So first, the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p must have a solution.\n\nWhat primes satisfy that?\n\nThe equation x^4 \u2261 -1 mod p is possible only if -1 is a quartic residue mod p. For that, certain conditions on p must hold. Let's recall that -1 is a quartic residue mod p if and only if p \u2261 1 mod 8. Because:\n\nThe multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. For -1 to be a fourth power, the equation x^4 = -1 must have a solution. Since -1 has order 2 in the multiplicative group, we need that 2 divides the order of the element, so that 4 divides the order of the group?",
