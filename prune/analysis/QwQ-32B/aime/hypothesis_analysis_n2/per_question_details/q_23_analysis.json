          "text1": "Wait, actually, no, the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if M were greater than the infimum, then there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than M, which would violate the condition. Therefore, the answer is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD squared is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, we need to minimize 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) given that (x2,y2) lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, and also that x1x2 + y1y2 =0, where (x1,y1) is another point on the hyperbola.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, if the infimum is the greatest lower bound, then yes, that's exactly it. So the question is asking for the infimum of BD squared over all such rhombi. Therefore, I need to find the minimal possible value of BD squared, and the answer is that minimal value, but since the question says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" it's exactly the infimum, which might be the minimal value if it's attainable. Hmm, maybe I need to confirm whether BD squared can actually attain its minimum, or if it just approaches a limit.\n\nAlright, let me start thinking about how to approach this problem.\n\nFirst, the hyperbola equation is given as x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and all sides are equal in length.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. Also, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of points symmetric about the origin.\n\nLet me denote the four vertices as A, B, C, D. Since diagonals intersect at the origin, then if A is (p, q), then C must be (-p, -q). Similarly, if B is (r, s), then D must be (-r, -s). So the four vertices are (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s). Since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.",

However, since BD\u00b2 never actually reaches 480, but can approach it, so the infimum is 480. In real numbers, the infimum is the greatest lower bound, so 480 is the infimum, so the answer is 480. So I think the answer is 480. Let me check if there is a possible case where BD squared can be smaller?",
