          "text1": "Alternatively, let me think of the problem as follows: since everyone owns the candy hearts, the four items are D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, the problem is equivalent to dealing with three sets (D, G, S) over the universe of 900, and then considering the counts of people in terms of how many of these three they own. The problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four, which would mean exactly one of D, G, S (since they all have C). Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, meaning exactly two of D, G, S (since C is already counted). The number who own all four would be those who own all three of D, G, S (since they also have C). The total number of people is 900. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s consider the three sets D, G, S. The total number of people is 900. Let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly 0 of D, G, S (so only C).\n\n- b = number who own exactly 1 of D, G, S.\n\n- c = number who own exactly 2 of D, G, S.\n\n- d = number who own all 3 of D, G, S.\n\nWe know that a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the number of people owning exactly two of the four items (which is exactly one of D, G, S plus C) is 437, so that is b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number owning exactly three of the four (i.e., exactly two of D, G, S plus C) is 234, so c = 234.\n\nThe number owning all four (all three of D, G, S plus C) is d, which is what we need to find.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the total:\n\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900 \u21d2 a + d = 900 - (437 + 234) = 900 - 671 = 229. So a + d = 229.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate a and d. Let's recall that the total number of people in set D is 195, similarly G is 367, S is 562. These counts include those who have D plus any combination of the other items. So, using the standard inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets:\n\nTotal in D \u222a G \u222a S = a' where a' is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But since a is the number who own none of D, G, S, then Total in D \u222a G \u222a S = 900 - a.\n\nBut also, the formula for the union of D, G, S:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe know that |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let x = |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = d (since those who are in all three are exactly the d people).\n\nThen, the pairwise intersections:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let |D \u2229 G| = a + b + d, but maybe not.",
