Therefore, the product over all \u03b6 of (\u03b6 - (1+i))*(\u03b6 - (1 -i)) is equal to [product_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1+i))] * [product_{\u03b6} (\u03b6 - (1 -i))]. Since the product over (\u03b6 - c) for all roots \u03b6 of x^13 -1 is equal to (c)^13 -1, because if P(x)=x^13 -1, then P(c) = product_{\u03b6} (c - \u03b6) but with a sign?",

Since product_{z} (z - a) = product_{z} ( -(a - z) ) = (-1)^{13} product_{z} (a - z) = (-1)^{13} P(a). \n\nTherefore, when I said earlier that product_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} -1), that's correct because P(a) = a^{13} -1. Therefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, in our case, when we computed the product over z of (z - (1 +i)) is equal to (-1)^{13}*( (1 +i)^{13} -1 ). Since (-1)^13 is -1, so it's - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSimilarly for the other term. So the product becomes [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] with the two negatives cancelling.",

Because reversing the terms, (z - a) = - (a - z). So actually, the product over (z - a) is (-1)^13 times product over (a - z) which is (-1)^13 * P(a). Since 13 is odd, that would be -P(a). So I think I made a mistake here.\n\nOh no! This is critical. Let me retrace this step. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose P(x) = x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 = product_{z} (x - z), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity. Then, product_{z} (x - z) = x\u00b9\u00b3 -1. Therefore, if I set x = a, then product_{z} (a - z) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. However, in the problem, the product over z of (z - a) is equal to product_{z} (z - a) = product_{z} -(a - z) = (-1)^13 product_{z} (a - z) = - product_{z} (a - z) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1). Since 13 is odd, so the product over (z - a) is -(a\u00b9\u00b3 -1).\n\nTherefore, my previous calculation was wrong here. The product over z of (z - a) is actually equal to - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1). So going back, the product over all z of (z - a)(z - b) is [product over (z - a)] * [product over (z - b)] which is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ). Because the two negatives multiply to a positive.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was actually correct! Because in the previous steps, even though I thought I might have made a mistake, actually, because I had two terms, each product over (z - a) and (z - b) each had a negative sign, so their product would be [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 -1). So that part is correct. Therefore, the rest of the calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the total product is indeed 8321. Then, mod 1000 is 321. However, let me just confirm once more the computation of (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nLet me recast (1 + i)^13 calculation again. Let me compute (1 + i)^2 first. (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i. Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. Then (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = 16*(-4)*(1 + i) = -64*(1 + i). Which gives -64 -64i. That's the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i. Then (1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4. (1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, same as above. (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^8 * (1 - i)^4 * (1 - i)^1 = 16*(-4)*(1 - i) = -64*(1 - i) = -64 +64i. So that's also correct. Then subtract 1 gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i. Multiply them gives 8321. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder mod 1000 is 8321 mod 1000. Since 8000 is 8*1000, subtract 8000 from 8321, gives 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.",

So first, I need to factor f(z) = z\u00b2 -2 z +2. Let me find its roots.\n\nThe roots of z\u00b2 -2 z +2 are [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 -8)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So a = 1 + i and b =1 -i.

Since 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4.\n\nSo (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i (13 \u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i (13 \u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first.

Let me see if that approach works.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Let me recall that (1 + i)^n can be expressed using De Moivre's theorem. Since 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle \u03c0/4.\n\nSo (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i (13 \u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i (13 \u03c0/4)}.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2))^{13} first. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).",

Since product_{z} (z - a) = product_{z} ( -(a - z) ) = (-1)^{13} product_{z} (a - z) = (-1)^{13} P(a). \n\nTherefore, when I said earlier that product_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} -1), that's correct because P(a) = a^{13} -1. Therefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, in our case, when we computed the product over z of (z - (1 +i)) is equal to (-1)^{13}*( (1 +i)^{13} -1 ). Since (-1)^13 is -1, so it's - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ]\n\nSimilarly for the other term. So the product becomes [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] with the two negatives cancelling.",

Because reversing the terms, (z - a) = - (a - z). So actually, the product over (z - a) is (-1)^13 times product over (a - z) which is (-1)^13 * P(a). Since 13 is odd, that would be -P(a). So I think I made a mistake here.\n\nOh no! This is critical. Let me retrace this step. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose P(x) = x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 = product_{z} (x - z), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity. Then, product_{z} (x - z) = x\u00b9\u00b3 -1. Therefore, if I set x = a, then product_{z} (a - z) = a\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. However, in the problem, the product over z of (z - a) is equal to product_{z} (z - a) = product_{z} -(a - z) = (-1)^13 product_{z} (a - z) = - product_{z} (a - z) = - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1). Since 13 is odd, so the product over (z - a) is -(a\u00b9\u00b3 -1).\n\nTherefore, my previous calculation was wrong here. The product over z of (z - a) is actually equal to - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1). So going back, the product over all z of (z - a)(z - b) is [product over (z - a)] * [product over (z - b)] which is [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 -1 ). Because the two negatives multiply to a positive.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was actually correct! Because in the previous steps, even though I thought I might have made a mistake, actually, because I had two terms, each product over (z - a) and (z - b) each had a negative sign, so their product would be [ - (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] * [ - (b\u00b9\u00b3 -1) ] = (a\u00b9\u00b3 -1)(b\u00b9\u00b3 -1). So that part is correct. Therefore, the rest of the calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the total product is indeed 8321. Then, mod 1000 is 321. However, let me just confirm once more the computation of (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.\n\nLet me recast (1 + i)^13 calculation again. Let me compute (1 + i)^2 first. (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i. Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. Then (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = 16*(-4)*(1 + i) = -64*(1 + i). Which gives -64 -64i. That's the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i. Then (1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4. (1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, same as above. (1 - i)^13 = (1 - i)^8 * (1 - i)^4 * (1 - i)^1 = 16*(-4)*(1 - i) = -64*(1 - i) = -64 +64i. So that's also correct. Then subtract 1 gives -65 -64i and -65 +64i. Multiply them gives 8321. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the remainder mod 1000 is 8321 mod 1000. Since 8000 is 8*1000, subtract 8000 from 8321, gives 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.",

Since a and b are roots of the quadratic, so the quadratic factors as (z -a)(z -b). Therefore, the product over all z would be [product_{z} (z -a)] * [product_{z} (z -b)]. Each of those products is the product over all 13th roots of (z - c) for c =a and c =b. Then, as per the polynomial Q(x) =x^13 -1, the product over (z -c) for all roots z is equal to (-1)^13 times product over (c - z) which is (-1)^13 * Q(c). Since Q(c) = c^13 -1. Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1. Therefore, product (z - c) = - (c^13 -1). So yes, then multiplying those two gives (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321.
