So both moves lead to opponent can win. So yes, n=22 is L. Correct.\n\nSimilarly n=23: take1 leaves22 (L), so n=23 is W.\n\nn=24: take1 leaves23 (W). take4 leaves20 (L). So taking4 wins, so n=24 is W. Hmm, but 24 mod5=4, which is okay, since it's a winning position.\n\nSo seems the pattern holds. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, we need to count numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Because those are the losing positions for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nTherefore, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers from 1 to 2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, total numbers from 1 to N (here N=2024). The numbers congruent to 0 mod5: floor(N/5). But actually, it's floor(N/5) or floor(N/5) +1 depending on division.\n\nSimilarly for numbers congruent to 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute the count for each residue:\n\nFor residue 0 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe last term is 2020 since 2020=5\u00d7404, and 2025 would be next but that's over. So the number of terms is 2020 /5 = 404.\n\nSimilarly for residue 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nFind the largest number \u22642024 congruent to 2 mod5.\n\n2024 divided by 5: 5\u00d7404=2020, so 2020 +2=2022, which is 2 mod5 (2022 mod5=2022-5*404=2022-2020=2). So the last term is 2022.\n\nThe sequence starts at 2, with difference 5. So the number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405.",
          "text2": "Wait, let's check n=0? Well, n=0 isn't a positive integer, but the pattern seems to hold for the numbers we have. Let me check n=20: 20 mod5 is 0, so that would be a losing position, which would be correct. n=21 would be 1 mod5, so a winning position. Let me verify n=21:\n\nn=21: Alice can take 1 to 20 (L) or 4 to 17 (L). So she can choose either, leaving Bob at L. So n=21 is W, which is consistent with mod5=1. \n\nn=18: 18 mod5=3. Let's see if it's a winning position. Alice can take 1 to 17 (L). So yes, so n=18 is W. 3 mod5 is okay.\n\nn=19: mod5=4. Alice can take 4 to get to 15 (L). So n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: mod5=0, so L. Correct.\n\nTherefore, it seems the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Let me confirm with n=22: mod5=2, so should be L. Let's see n=22:\n\nAlice can take 1 to 21 (W) or 4 to 18 (W). Either way Bob can win. So yes, n=22 is L.\n\nOkay, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position for the current player. Since Alice starts, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win no matter what Alice does. So the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (mod5=0 or 2). \n\nTherefore, we need to compute the numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2. Let me calculate how many numbers up to 2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nFirst, total numbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024: floor(2024/5). Let me compute 2024 divided by 5. 5*404=2020, so 2024=5*404 +4. So numbers divisible by5 up to 2024: 404 (since 5*404=2020). \n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024: the sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number \u22642024. Let me see what the last term is. The last term would be the largest number \u22642024 which is 2 mod5. Since 2024 mod5 is 4 (since 2020 is 0 mod5, so 2020+4=2024). So the previous term would be 2024 -2 = 2022?",

Let me verify n=21:\n\nn=21: Alice can take 1 to 20 (L) or 4 to 17 (L). So she can choose either, leaving Bob at L. So n=21 is W, which is consistent with mod5=1. \n\nn=18: 18 mod5=3. Let's see if it's a winning position. Alice can take 1 to 17 (L). So yes, so n=18 is W. 3 mod5 is okay.\n\nn=19: mod5=4. Alice can take 4 to get to 15 (L). So n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: mod5=0, so L. Correct.\n\nTherefore, it seems the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Let me confirm with n=22: mod5=2, so should be L. Let's see n=22:\n\nAlice can take 1 to 21 (W) or 4 to 18 (W).

So the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (mod5=0 or 2). \n\nTherefore, we need to compute the numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Let me verify n=21:\n\nn=21: Alice can take 1 to 20 (L) or 4 to 17 (L). So she can choose either, leaving Bob at L. So n=21 is W, which is consistent with mod5=1. \n\nn=18: 18 mod5=3. Let's see if it's a winning position. Alice can take 1 to 17 (L). So yes, so n=18 is W. 3 mod5 is okay.\n\nn=19: mod5=4. Alice can take 4 to get to 15 (L). So n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: mod5=0, so L. Correct.\n\nTherefore, it seems the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Let me confirm with n=22: mod5=2, so should be L. Let's see n=22:\n\nAlice can take 1 to 21 (W) or 4 to 18 (W).

So the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (mod5=0 or 2). \n\nTherefore, we need to compute the numbers \u22642024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.
