          "text1": "Wait, no, in 3D, the formula for the inradius is similar to 2D. In 2D, the inradius is A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. In 3D, I believe the formula is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, Volume divided by the surface area gives something, but multiplied by 3? Because in 2D, area is 1/2 * perimeter * inradius. So in 3D, Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area * inradius. Therefore, rearranged, inradius r = 3V / S. Yeah, that sounds right. So I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute 3V/S.\n\nSo first step, compute the volume V. But to compute the volume, given the edge lengths, I might need to use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since all edges are given, that's probably the way to go.\n\nGiven the edge lengths: AB = \u221a41, AC = \u221a80, AD = \u221a89; similarly, BC = \u221a89, BD = \u221a80, CD = \u221a41.",

Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is:\n\nr = 3V / A_total,\n\nwhere A_total is the sum of the areas of all four faces. So that's the formula I need. Therefore, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A_total.\n\nSo first step: compute the volume. The problem is that the edges are given in a way that might hint at some symmetry. Let me see the edges:\n\nAB = CD = \u221a41,\n\nAC = BD = \u221a80,\n\nBC = AD = \u221a89.\n\nHmm, so each pair of opposite edges are equal.

          "text2": "Wait, if I do that, then the edges between these points would have lengths calculated as follows:\n\nLet me compute AB, where A is (a, b, c) and B is (-a, -b, c).

So we have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 9.75,\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 22.25.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2c\u00b2 = 32 \u21d2 c\u00b2 = 16 \u21d2 c = 4.\n\nThen substituting back into equation 3: b\u00b2 + 16 = 22.25 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = 6.25 \u21d2 b = 2.5.\n\nThen from equation 1: a\u00b2 + (6.25) = 10.25 \u21d2 a\u00b2 = 4 \u21d2 a = 2.\n\nSo a = 2, b = 2.5, c =4.

Similarly, CD is between (-a, b, -c) and (a,-b,-c): same as AB, which is 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So AB=CD. Similarly, AC is between (a,b,c) and (-a,b,-c): distance squared is (-2a)^2 +0 + (-2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2, so AC length is 2\u221a(a\u00b2 +c\u00b2).

Let me check if this setup can satisfy the given edge lengths.\n\nSo let's compute AB, AC, AD, etc.\n\nFirst, AB is between A(a, b, c) and B(-a, -b, c). The distance squared is:\n\n( (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 + (c - c)^2 ) = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, CD is between C(-a, b, -c) and D(a, -b, -c). The distance squared is:\n\n( ( -a -a )^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + ( -c - (-c) )^2 ) = (-2a)^2 + (2b)^2 +0 = 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2. So AB and CD have same length, which matches given.\n\nSimilarly, AC is between A(a,b,c) and C(-a,b,-c). Distance squared:\n\n( (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2 ) = (2a)^2 +0 + (2c)^2 = 4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly BD is between B(-a,-b,c) and D(a,-b,-c). Distance squared:\n\n( (-a -a)^2 + (-b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2 ) = (-2a)^2 +0 + (2c)^2 = 4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2. So AC and BD have same length. Good.\n\nSimilarly, AD is between A(a,b,c) and D(a,-b,-c). Distance squared:\n\n( (a - a)^2 + (b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2 ) = 0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly BC is between B(-a,-b,c) and C(-a,b,-c). Distance squared:\n\n( (-a - (-a))^2 + (-b -b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2 ) =0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2. So AD and BC have same length. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, with this coordinate system, the edges AB=CD= sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2), AC=BD= sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2), and AD=BC= sqrt(4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2).\n\nGiven the problem's edge lengths:\n\nAB=CD= sqrt(41). Therefore sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2)=sqrt(41) \u21d2 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2=41 \u21d2 a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=41/4.\n\nSimilarly, AC=BD= sqrt(80). So sqrt(4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2)=sqrt(80) \u21d24a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=80 \u21d2a\u00b2 +c\u00b2=20.\n\nAD=BC= sqrt(89). So sqrt(4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2)=sqrt(89) \u21d24b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=89 \u21d2b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=89/4.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20,\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nWe can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2.\n\nThen,\n\nEquation 1: x + y = 41/4,\n\nEquation 2: x + z = 20,\n\nEquation 3: y + z = 89/4.\n\nWe can solve this system.\n\nFirst, subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (x + z) - (x + y) = 20 - 41/4 \u21d2 z - y = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nEquation 3 says y + z =89/4.\n\nSo we have z - y =39/4,\n\nand z + y =89/4.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2z = (39 +89)/4 =128/4=32 \u21d2 z=16.\n\nThen from equation 3, y = 89/4 - z =89/4 -16=89/4 -64/4=25/4.\n\nThen from equation 1, x=41/4 - y=41/4 -25/4=16/4=4.\n\nTherefore, x=4, y=25/4, z=16.\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2=4 \u21d2a=2,\n\nb\u00b2=25/4 \u21d2b=5/2,\n\nc\u00b2=16 \u21d2c=4.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates can be set as:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4)",

Let me confirm the cross product and scalar triple product again.\n\nEarlier, I had vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8). Cross product AC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then the dot product with AB is (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 +0 = 320. Then Volume is 1/6 * |320| = 320/6 = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSurface area: Each face is 6\u221a21, so total 24\u221a21. Let me confirm the area of triangle ABC. The cross product AB \u00d7 AC was (40, -32, -20). Its magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024). Let me compute sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 divided by 144 is 21, since 144*21 = 3024. Therefore sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12\u221a21. Then area is half that, so 6\u221a21. Correct. So total surface area is indeed 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, inradius is 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21 = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) * \u221a21/\u221a21 = 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. So yes, that's correct.\n\n20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors into 2^2 *5, 63 is 3^2 *7. No common factors. So yes, reduced fraction. And 21 is square-free. So m=20, n=21, p=63. So m + n + p = 20 +21 +63 = 104. Hmm, so the answer is 104?",

Hmm, that's going to be tedious, but let me see:\n\nFirst, 12.3905 *5.9875 \u224812.3905*6\u224874.343 minus 12.3905*0.0125\u22480.1549, so approx 74.343-0.1549\u224874.188.\n\nThen 2.9565*3.4465\u22483*3.4465\u224810.3395 minus (0.0435*3.4465\u22480.15), so approx 10.3395-0.15\u224810.1895.\n\nMultiply 74.188 *10.1895 \u2248approx 74*10=740, 74*0.1895\u224814.063, so total\u2248740+14.063\u2248754.063, plus 0.188*10.1895\u22481.916, so total\u2248754.063+1.916\u2248756. Hmm, that's exactly 756. Which is 36*21, so sqrt(756)=sqrt(36*21)=6\u221a21. So that matches! So Heron's formula gives the same result. So that checks out. Therefore, the area is indeed 6\u221a21. So my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is 20\u221a21/63, so the answer is 20+21+63=104. Hmm, I think that's solid. Let me just check once more the formula for inradius. \n\nYes, inradius r = 3V/A_total.

In 3D, I believe the formula is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, Volume divided by the surface area gives something, but multiplied by 3? Because in 2D, area is 1/2 * perimeter * inradius. So in 3D, Volume = (1/3)*Surface Area * inradius. Therefore, rearranged, inradius r = 3V / S. Yeah, that sounds right. So I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute 3V/S.\n\nSo first step, compute the volume V.

Let me solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\nEquation 2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20,\n\nEquation 3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nLet me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4,\n\nWhich gives c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.\n\nSimilarly, Equation 3 is b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4,\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nFrom above, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4,\n\nand c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2c\u00b2 = (39/4 + 89/4) = 128/4 = 32 \u2192 c\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 c = 4 (since we can take positive roots for coordinates).\n\nThen, c\u00b2 = 16, so from Equation 2: a\u00b2 + 16 = 20 \u2192 a\u00b2 = 4 \u2192 a = 2.\n\nThen, from Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 4 + b\u00b2 = 41/4 \u2192 b\u00b2 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 \u2192 b = 5/2.\n\nSo, a = 2, b = 5/2, c = 4. So the coordinates can be set as follows:\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the four vertices:\n\nLet\u2019s take vertex A as (a, b, c) = (2, 2.5, 4).\n\nVertex B is (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -2.5, 4).\n\nVertex C is (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 2.5, -4).\n\nVertex D is (a, -b, -c) = (2, -2.5, -4).\n\nHmm, let me check the edge lengths to confirm.\n\nAB: distance between (2, 2.5,4) and (-2, -2.5,4):\n\nsqrt[(-4)^2 + (-5)^2 + 0] = sqrt(16 +25)=sqrt(41). Good.\n\nAC: between (2,2.5,4) and (-2,2.5,-4):\n\nsqrt[(-4)^2 +0 + (-8)^2] = sqrt(16 +64)=sqrt(80). Good.\n\nAD: between (2,2.5,4) and (2,-2.5,-4):\n\nsqrt[0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2] = sqrt(25+64)=sqrt(89). Perfect.\n\nSimilarly, the other edges should hold as well.

Similarly, CD is between (-a, b, -c) and (a,-b,-c): same as AB, which is 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So AB=CD. Similarly, AC is between (a,b,c) and (-a,b,-c): distance squared is (-2a)^2 +0 + (-2c)^2 =4a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2, so AC length is 2\u221a(a\u00b2 +c\u00b2). BD is between (-a,-b,c) and (a,-b,-c): distance squared is (2a)^2 +0 + (-2c)^2, same as AC. So AC=BD. Similarly, BC is between (-a,-b,c) and (-a,b,-c): distance squared is 0 + (2b)^2 + (-2c)^2 =4b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2, so BC length is 2\u221a(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2). AD is between (a,b,c) and (a,-b,-c): same as BC. So BC=AD. Perfect. Therefore, with this coordinate system, the edge lengths are:\n\nAB = CD = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a41,\n\nAC = BD = 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a80,\n\nBC = AD = 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations:\n\n1. 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a41 \u21d2 \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a41 / 2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\n2. 2\u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a80 \u21d2 \u221a(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a80 / 2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80/4 = 20,\n\n3. 2\u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89 \u21d2 \u221a(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = \u221a89 / 2 \u21d2 b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\nEquation1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\nEquation2: a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20,\n\nEquation3: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nWe can solve these equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2.

Let me confirm the cross product and scalar triple product again.\n\nEarlier, I had vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8). Cross product AC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then the dot product with AB is (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 +0 = 320. Then Volume is 1/6 * |320| = 320/6 = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSurface area: Each face is 6\u221a21, so total 24\u221a21. Let me confirm the area of triangle ABC. The cross product AB \u00d7 AC was (40, -32, -20). Its magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024). Let me compute sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 divided by 144 is 21, since 144*21 = 3024. Therefore sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12\u221a21. Then area is half that, so 6\u221a21. Correct. So total surface area is indeed 4*6\u221a21 =24\u221a21. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, inradius is 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21 = 160/(24\u221a21) = 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) * \u221a21/\u221a21 = 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 / 63. So yes, that's correct.\n\n20 and 63 are coprime? 20 factors into 2^2 *5, 63 is 3^2 *7. No common factors. So yes, reduced fraction. And 21 is square-free. So m=20, n=21, p=63. So m + n + p = 20 +21 +63 = 104. Hmm, so the answer is 104?",
