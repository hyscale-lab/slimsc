The centers of the circles lie along the angle bisector of angle B. Let\u2019s denote the distance from B to the center of the first circle (radius r1) as d1, and to the center of the second circle (radius r2) as d2. The distance between the centers is d2 - d1, which must equal r1 + r2 (since the circles are tangent). \n\nAdditionally, the centers are located such that the distance from each center to the sides AB and BC is equal to their respective radii. Since they are along the angle bisector, the distance from each center to the sides is equal to their radius. \n\nThe distance from the center to the vertex can be related to the radius via trigonometry. For any circle with radius r, the distance from B to its center along the bisector is d = r / sin(\u03b8/2). Because the perpendicular distance from the center to each side is r, and the angle between the bisector and the side is \u03b8/2, so sin(\u03b8/2) = r / d => d = r / sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nTherefore, the distance between centers of the first two circles is d2 - d1 = (r2 / sin(\u03b8/2)) - (r1 / sin(\u03b8/2)) = (r2 - r1)/sin(\u03b8/2).
