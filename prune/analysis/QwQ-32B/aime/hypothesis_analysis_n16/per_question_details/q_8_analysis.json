So -27,000,000.\n\nFourth term: +3*300(ab + bc + ca) = +900(ab + bc + ca).\n\nFifth term: -3abc.\n\nSo combining:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 + (-600 + 900)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe first two terms cancel out: 27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.\n\nThen, (-600 + 900) = 300, so 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to make it simpler:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.

So total is 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Correct. Similarly for the other permutations. So these are valid solutions. So that gives 6 triples where one variable is zero.\n\nCase 2: Suppose two variables are zero. Let's say b = c = 0. Then a = 300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + ... all terms will be zero except a\u00b2b etc. but since two variables are zero, all terms are zero. So 0 \u2260 6,000,000. So no solutions here.\n\nCase 3: All variables non-zero. So now we need to consider triples where a, b, c are all positive integers adding to 300, and satisfying the equations.\n\nSo the remaining cases are when all three variables are positive, so we can't have any zeros.\n\nHmm, so now we need to find triples where a, b, c \u22651 and a + b + c =300, and also satisfying the second equation.\n\nHmm, perhaps there are symmetric solutions where a = b = c?\n\nLet me check that. If a = b = c, then each is 100, since 3*100 = 300.\n\nThen let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + ... each term would be a\u00b2 * a = a\u00b3, but actually, each term is a\u00b2b. Since all are 100, each term is 100\u00b2 * 100 = 1,000,000. But there are six terms (since all permutations), so 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Therefore,\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = 300*90,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca).\n\nThen, subtract the a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 term:\n\n- [ (300)^3 - 3*300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand the negative sign:\n\n- (300)^3 + 3*300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire left-hand side becomes:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) =\n\n[300*90,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca)] + [ - (300)^3 + 3*300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 300*90,000 is 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.\n\nSecond term: -600(ab + bc + ca).\n\nThird term: - (300)^3. 300^3 is 27,000,000. So -27,000,000.\n\nFourth term: +3*300(ab + bc + ca) = +900(ab + bc + ca).\n\nFifth term: -3abc.\n\nSo combining:\n\n27,000,000 - 27,000,000 + (-600 + 900)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe first two terms cancel out: 27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.\n\nThen, (-600 + 900) = 300, so 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to make it simpler:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can rearrange terms:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor something here. Let me think differently.",

Since two variables can be arranged in 2 ways, so for each of the three variables being zero, there are two triples, so total of 3*2 = 6 triples where one variable is zero.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\nWhen c=0, the other two variables a and b must be 200 and 100. So two possibilities: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, when a=0, then (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). When b=0, (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So indeed, 6 triples.

Let me see if I can factor it or find integer roots.\n\nLet me try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., up to \u00b11,000,000. But since x must be a nonnegative integer and a = x, and c = 300 - 2x must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2x \u2265 0 \u21d2 x \u2264 150. So x can be from 0 to 150.\n\nLet me try x = 100 first, because that was part of the symmetric solution.\n\nPlugging x = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Oh, so x=100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (x - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nLet me write the cubic as (x - 100)(x\u00b2 + ax + b). Let's find a and b.\n\nExpanding (x - 100)(x\u00b2 + ax + b) = x\u00b3 + (a - 100)x\u00b2 + (b - 100a)x - 100b.\n\nSet equal to original cubic: x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000.\n\nSo equate coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of x\u00b3: 1 = 1, okay.\n\n2. Coefficient of x\u00b2: (a - 100) = -300 \u21d2 a = -200.\n\n3. Coefficient of x: (b - 100a) = 30,000.\n\nPlugging a = -200:\n\nb - 100*(-200) = b + 20,000 = 30,000 \u21d2 b = 10,000.\n\n4. Constant term: -100b = -1,000,000 \u21d2 b = 10,000, which matches.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000).\n\nNow, set equal to zero:\n\n(x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000) = 0.\n\nWe already have x = 100, so the other roots come from x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000 = 0.\n\nSolve this quadratic equation:\n\nx = [200 \u00b1 \u221a(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 \u221a(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.",

So for d from 1 to 100, all elements are distinct, so each such triplet has 6 permutations.

Let's suppose that a, b, c are all distinct and non-zero. Let me see if such triples exist.",

Then x + y + z =0.\n\nThe second equation is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000.\n\nExpressing everything in terms of x,y,z:\n\nFirst, a=100 +x, b=100 +y, c=100 +z.\n\nThen ab = (100 +x)(100 +y) =100^2 +100(y +x) +xy,\n\nSimilarly for bc and ca. Then:\n\nab + bc + ca =3\u00d7100\u00b2 + 100*(2x + 2y + 2z) + (xy + yz + zx). But since x+y+z=0, the middle term is 100*(2\u00d70)=0. So:\n\nab + bc + ca = 3\u00d710,000 + (xy + yz + zx)=30,000 + (xy + yz + zx).\n\nThen abc = (100 +x)(100 +y)(100 +z). Expand this:\n\n100^3 + 100^2(x + y + z) + 100(xy + yz + zx) + xyz. Again, x + y + z =0, so middle terms drop out:\n\nabc =1,000,000 +100*(xy + yz + zx) +xyz.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n100*(30,000 + (xy + yz + zx)) - [1,000,000 +100*(xy + yz + zx) +xyz] =2,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3,000,000 +100*(xy + yz +zx) -1,000,000 -100*(xy + yz +zx) -xyz =2,000,000.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(3,000,000 -1,000,000) -xyz =2,000,000 \u21d2 2,000,000 -xyz =2,000,000 \u21d2 xyz =0.\n\nTherefore, the condition reduces to xyz=0. So at least one of x,y,z must be zero.\n\nSince x = a-100, y= b-100, z =c -100, this implies that at least one of the variables a,b,c must equal 100. Which matches the substitution approach.\n\nTherefore, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, and the other two variables adding to 200, and their product with the other variables must satisfy the equation. But given that xyz=0, so if x=0 (i.e., a=100), then the other two variables must satisfy y + z =-x=0, but since x+y+z=0, so if x=0, then y + z=0 \u21d2 z = -y. So variables b and c must satisfy b=100 + y, c=100 + z=100 - y. So indeed, the other two variables are 100 \u00b1 y, so the substitution approach holds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is indeed 301. So the answer should be 301.

So that's a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, when we set a = b, the only solution is a = b = c =100. But since the problem is symmetric, this solution is also the case when all three variables are equal. So that's one solution. But are there other solutions where variables are unequal?\n\nHmm, since we considered only the case where two variables are equal (a = b), but there might be solutions where all three are different. So perhaps there are other triples where a, b, c are not all equal. So maybe we need to consider other cases.",
