The difference between these two radii is what we need.\n\nTo model the torus, maybe I need equations for both the torus and the sphere, then find the circles of intersection where they are tangent.\n\nFirst, the equation of a torus can be written in standard form. Let me recall that a torus with major radius R (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and minor radius r (radius of the tube) has the equation:\n\n(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) \u2212 R)\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2",
