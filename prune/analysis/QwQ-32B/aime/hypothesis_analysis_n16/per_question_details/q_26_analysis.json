Let's find the circumcircle equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in B(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F=0 => F=0.\n\nPlugging in C(9,0): 81 +0 +9D +0 +0=0 => 9D = -81 => D= -9.\n\nPlugging in A(1/3,4\u221a14/3):\n\n(1/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(1/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) + F =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/9) + (16*14)/9 + (-9)*(1/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) +0=0.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/9 + 224/9 - 3 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0.\n\nSum the first two terms: (1 +224)/9 =225/9=25.\n\nSo 25 -3 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0 => 22 + (4\u221a14 E)/3 =0.\n\nThus, (4\u221a14 E)/3 = -22 => E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14)= (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator: (-33\u221a14)/(2*14)= (-33\u221a14)/28.",

Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11. Since it passes through point C(0,0), the equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo, tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo:\n\nx -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x = 9/2.\n\nThen substitute back x =9/2 into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, interesting. So coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). \n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, let me compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) \n\nCompute y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11) - (4\u221a14/3) \n\nLet me get a common denominator of 33:\n\n= (-27\u221a14/11)*(3/3) - (4\u221a14/3)*(11/11)\n\n= (-81\u221a14 -44\u221a14)/33 = (-125\u221a14)/33\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 -26/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 6:\n\n= (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = (-125\u221a14/33)/(-25/6) = (125\u221a14/33)*(6/25) = (125*6\u221a14)/(33*25) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 75:\n\n750 \u00f775=10, 825 \u00f775=11. So (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the slope of AD is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD can be written using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nWe can write this in parametric form as well, but perhaps it's easier to find the intersection point P with the circle \u03c9 again. Since we know points A and D are on line AD, and P is the other intersection point with the circle.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe to find the tangent at point B (9,0). The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The vector from center O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( (-33\u221a14/56) ) / (9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that. \n\nSlope of tangent at B is 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6*(\u221a14)/11. \n\nSo slope m1 = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at B is:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - 0 = m1(x - 9),\n\ny = (6\u221a14/11)(x - 9).\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC goes from center O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to point C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). So the slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56) / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: - (84)/(11\u221a14). \n\nSimplify that:\n\nSlope m2 = -84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is passing through point C (0,0), so the equation is y = m2 x = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo the tangent at B is y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet them equal to find x-coordinate:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nx -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, so now we have coordinates for point D. Next, we need to find the equation of line AD, since point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me write down coordinates in fractions for clarity.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the equation of line AD. Let me first find the slope.\n\nSlope m_AD = [ y_D - y_A ] / [ x_D - x_A ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-27*3 -4*11)/33 = \u221a14*(-81 -44)/33 = \u221a14*(-125)/33.\n\nDenominator:\n\n9/2 - 26/3 = (27 -52)/6 = (-25)/6.\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = [ (-125\u221a14)/33 ] / [ (-25)/6 ] = ( (-125\u221a14)/33 ) * ( -6/25 ) = ( (125*6\u221a14) ) / (33*25) ) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 75: 10\u221a14 / 11.",

So:\n\ny = (10\u221a14/11)x - (72\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the equation of AD is y = (10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11.\n\nNow, substitute this into the equation of the circle \u03c9, which was:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14 /28)y =0.\n\nHmm, this substitution might get messy, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me write down all terms.\n\nFirst, let me denote y from the line equation as:\n\ny = (10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11.\n\nLet me compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = [ (10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11 ]^2 = ( (\u221a14)^2 (10x -72)^2 ) / (11)^2 ) = (14*(10x -72)^2)/121.\n\nSimilarly, the term - (33\u221a14 /28)y:\n\n= - (33\u221a14 /28)*(10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11.\n\nLet me compute this term:\n\nFirst, note that \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14.\n\nSo:\n\n- (33\u221a14 /28)*(10\u221a14 x -72\u221a14)/11\n\n= - (33/28)*(10*(\u221a14)^2 x -72*(\u221a14)^2)/11\n\n= - (33/28)*(10*14 x -72*14)/11\n\n= - (33/28)*(140x -1008)/11\n\nFactor 14 from numerator inside:\n\n= - (33/28)*(14*(10x -72))/11\n\n= - (33/28)*(14/11)*(10x -72)\n\nSimplify 33 and 11: 33/11 =3,\n\n28 and 14: 14/28 =1/2,\n\nThus:\n\n= - 3 * (1/2) * (10x -72)\n\n= - (3/2)*(10x -72)\n\n= -15x + 108.\n\nOkay, so that term simplifies to -15x +108.\n\nNow, putting everything into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14 /28)y =0,\n\nWe can substitute y\u00b2 and the other term:\n\nx\u00b2 + [14*(10x -72)^2 /121] -9x + [ -15x +108 ] =0.",

So:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator: (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/(9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84. So slope of OB is -11\u221a14 /84. Therefore slope of tangent line at B is the negative reciprocal, which is 84/(11\u221a14). Then rationalizing:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, the equation of tangent at B is:\n\ny - 0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C(0,0). The tangent at point C: again, the radius is OC, from O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). The slope of OC is (0 - 33\u221a14/56)/(0 -9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(-9/2) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/504 = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of (11\u221a14)/84, so slope is -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11. Since it passes through point C(0,0), the equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo, tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo:\n\nx -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x = 9/2.\n\nThen substitute back x =9/2 into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, interesting. So coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). \n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, let me compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) \n\nCompute y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11) - (4\u221a14/3) \n\nLet me get a common denominator of 33:\n\n= (-27\u221a14/11)*(3/3) - (4\u221a14/3)*(11/11)\n\n= (-81\u221a14 -44\u221a14)/33 = (-125\u221a14)/33\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 -26/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 6:\n\n= (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = (-125\u221a14/33)/(-25/6) = (125\u221a14/33)*(6/25) = (125*6\u221a14)/(33*25) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 75:\n\n750 \u00f775=10, 825 \u00f775=11. So (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the slope of AD is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD can be written using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nWe can write this in parametric form as well, but perhaps it's easier to find the intersection point P with the circle \u03c9 again.

The vector from center O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( (-33\u221a14/56) ) / (9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that. \n\nSlope of tangent at B is 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6*(\u221a14)/11. \n\nSo slope m1 = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at B is:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - 0 = m1(x - 9),\n\ny = (6\u221a14/11)(x - 9).\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC goes from center O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to point C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). So the slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56) / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: - (84)/(11\u221a14). \n\nSimplify that:\n\nSlope m2 = -84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is passing through point C (0,0), so the equation is y = m2 x = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo the tangent at B is y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet them equal to find x-coordinate:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nx -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, so now we have coordinates for point D. Next, we need to find the equation of line AD, since point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).

Let me first find the slope.\n\nSlope m_AD = [ y_D - y_A ] / [ x_D - x_A ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-27*3 -4*11)/33 = \u221a14*(-81 -44)/33 = \u221a14*(-125)/33.\n\nDenominator:\n\n9/2 - 26/3 = (27 -52)/6 = (-25)/6.\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = [ (-125\u221a14)/33 ] / [ (-25)/6 ] = ( (-125\u221a14)/33 ) * ( -6/25 ) = ( (125*6\u221a14) ) / (33*25) ) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 75: 10\u221a14 / 11.",

Therefore slope of tangent line at B is the negative reciprocal, which is 84/(11\u221a14). Then rationalizing:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, the equation of tangent at B is:\n\ny - 0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C(0,0). The tangent at point C: again, the radius is OC, from O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). The slope of OC is (0 - 33\u221a14/56)/(0 -9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(-9/2) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/504 = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of (11\u221a14)/84, so slope is -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11.

Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, let me compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) \n\nCompute y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11) - (4\u221a14/3) \n\nLet me get a common denominator of 33:\n\n= (-27\u221a14/11)*(3/3) - (4\u221a14/3)*(11/11)\n\n= (-81\u221a14 -44\u221a14)/33 = (-125\u221a14)/33\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 -26/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 6:\n\n= (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = (-125\u221a14/33)/(-25/6) = (125\u221a14/33)*(6/25) = (125*6\u221a14)/(33*25) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 75:\n\n750 \u00f775=10, 825 \u00f775=11. So (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the slope of AD is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD can be written using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nWe can write this in parametric form as well, but perhaps it's easier to find the intersection point P with the circle \u03c9 again.

So the slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56) / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: - (84)/(11\u221a14). \n\nSimplify that:\n\nSlope m2 = -84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is passing through point C (0,0), so the equation is y = m2 x = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo the tangent at B is y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet them equal to find x-coordinate:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nx -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, so now we have coordinates for point D. Next, we need to find the equation of line AD, since point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me write down coordinates in fractions for clarity.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the equation of line AD. Let me first find the slope.\n\nSlope m_AD = [ y_D - y_A ] / [ x_D - x_A ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-27*3 -4*11)/33 = \u221a14*(-81 -44)/33 = \u221a14*(-125)/33.\n\nDenominator:\n\n9/2 - 26/3 = (27 -52)/6 = (-25)/6.\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = [ (-125\u221a14)/33 ] / [ (-25)/6 ] = ( (-125\u221a14)/33 ) * ( -6/25 ) = ( (125*6\u221a14) ) / (33*25) ) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 75: 10\u221a14 / 11.",

Now, to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.\n\nFirst, tangent at point B (9,0):\n\nThe tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14/56 ) * (2/9 ) = (-33\u221a14 * 2)/(56*9 ) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of that, so:\n\nm_tangent_B = 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify: 84/(11\u221a14) can be rationalized as 84\u221a14/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14/11.\n\nSo slope of tangent at B is 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at point C (0,0):\n\nThe radius OC is from O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). The slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, so:\n\nm_tangent_C = -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing, same as before: -84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equations of the two tangents:\n\nTangent at B: passing through (9,0) with slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nTangent at C: passing through (0,0) with slope -6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nThe point D is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nSo set equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x,\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nThus x -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, substitute back into tangent at C's equation to find y:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, interesting. So D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). Let me note that.\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, we need the equation of line AD. Since A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, compute the vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6),\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27*3 -4*11)/(33) = \u221a14*(-81 -44)/33 = \u221a14*(-125)/33.\n\nSo the direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14/33). Hmm, perhaps better to write parametric equations.\n\nLet me let parameter t go from 0 to 1 to go from A to D, but since P is beyond A on the line AD (since D is outside the circle and A is on the circle, so the line AD starts at D, goes through A, then exits the circle again at P.",

So:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator: (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/(9) = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84. So slope of OB is -11\u221a14 /84. Therefore slope of tangent line at B is the negative reciprocal, which is 84/(11\u221a14). Then rationalizing:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus, the equation of tangent at B is:\n\ny - 0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C(0,0). The tangent at point C: again, the radius is OC, from O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). The slope of OC is (0 - 33\u221a14/56)/(0 -9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(-9/2) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/504 = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of (11\u221a14)/84, so slope is -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11. Since it passes through point C(0,0), the equation is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo, tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo:\n\nx -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x = 9/2.\n\nThen substitute back x =9/2 into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, interesting. So coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14/11). \n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A(26/3, 4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me compute the parametric equations or the slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, let me compute the slope of AD.\n\nSlope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) \n\nCompute y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11) - (4\u221a14/3) \n\nLet me get a common denominator of 33:\n\n= (-27\u221a14/11)*(3/3) - (4\u221a14/3)*(11/11)\n\n= (-81\u221a14 -44\u221a14)/33 = (-125\u221a14)/33\n\nx_D - x_A = (9/2 -26/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 6:\n\n= (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6)\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = (-125\u221a14/33)/(-25/6) = (125\u221a14/33)*(6/25) = (125*6\u221a14)/(33*25) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifying numerator and denominator by 75:\n\n750 \u00f775=10, 825 \u00f775=11. So (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, the slope of AD is (10\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AD can be written using point A:\n\ny - (4\u221a14/3) = (10\u221a14/11)(x -26/3)\n\nWe can write this in parametric form as well, but perhaps it's easier to find the intersection point P with the circle \u03c9 again. Since we know points A and D are on line AD, and P is the other intersection point with the circle.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe to find the tangent at point B (9,0). The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The vector from center O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56). Therefore, the slope of OB is ( (-33\u221a14/56) ) / (9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14). Let me rationalize that. \n\nSlope of tangent at B is 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (84/14)*(\u221a14)/11 = 6*(\u221a14)/11. \n\nSo slope m1 = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at B is:\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - 0 = m1(x - 9),\n\ny = (6\u221a14/11)(x - 9).\n\nSimilarly, let's find the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC goes from center O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to point C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). So the slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56) / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: - (84)/(11\u221a14). \n\nSimplify that:\n\nSlope m2 = -84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is passing through point C (0,0), so the equation is y = m2 x = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo the tangent at B is y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C is y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet them equal to find x-coordinate:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nx -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nOkay, so now we have coordinates for point D. Next, we need to find the equation of line AD, since point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me write down coordinates in fractions for clarity.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute the equation of line AD. Let me first find the slope.\n\nSlope m_AD = [ y_D - y_A ] / [ x_D - x_A ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(-27*3 -4*11)/33 = \u221a14*(-81 -44)/33 = \u221a14*(-125)/33.\n\nDenominator:\n\n9/2 - 26/3 = (27 -52)/6 = (-25)/6.\n\nTherefore, slope m_AD = [ (-125\u221a14)/33 ] / [ (-25)/6 ] = ( (-125\u221a14)/33 ) * ( -6/25 ) = ( (125*6\u221a14) ) / (33*25) ) = (750\u221a14)/(825) = simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 75: 10\u221a14 / 11.",

The vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56).

The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56). The slope of OC is ( -33\u221a14/56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14/56)*(2/9) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, so:\n\nm_tangent_C = -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing, same as before: -84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equations of the two tangents:\n\nTangent at B: passing through (9,0) with slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9).\n\nTangent at C: passing through (0,0) with slope -6\u221a14/11.\n\nEquation: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nThe point D is the intersection of these two tangents.\n\nSo set equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x,\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nThus x -9 = -x,\n\n2x =9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen, substitute back into tangent at C's equation to find y:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, interesting.
