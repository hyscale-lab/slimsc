Hmm, but actually, if you start at lower left, which is (0,0), moving up would go towards (0,1), and moving right would go to (1,0). Since the upper right is (8,8), both directions are possible. However, in order to reach (8,8), you must have some combination of rights and ups. \n\nBut the key point here is that the number of direction changes is the number of times we switch from right to up or vice versa. For example, a path that goes all the way right first and then all the way up would have only 1 direction change. Similarly, going all up first then all right would also have 1 direction change. So in general, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches between right and up directions. \n\nNow, if there are exactly four direction changes, that means the path has five \"runs\" of consecutive steps in the same direction. Because each direction change switches the direction, starting with one direction, then each change adds another run. So for example: starting with right, then up, right, up, right would be four changes (after the first run, each change adds a new run).",
          "text2": "Wait, that might be a point. Let me clarify.\n\nIf it's an 8x8 grid of squares, then the number of steps required to go from the lower left corner (let's say (0,0)) to the upper right corner (8,8) would be 16 steps: 8 right and 8 up. So each path is made up of 16 moves, either right or up. The total number of paths without any restrictions would be C(16,8), which is 12870. But here we need paths that change direction exactly four times.\n\nChanging direction means that after moving in one direction (right or up), you switch to the other. For example, if you go right, then up, that's a direction change. So the number of direction changes is related to how the steps are grouped together. If you have a lot of consecutive steps in the same direction, you have fewer direction changes. The minimal number of direction changes is 2: go all the way right then all the way up, or vice versa. The maximum would be 14, alternating every step, but since we need exactly four changes, it's somewhere in between.\n\nLet me think: each time you change direction, you switch between horizontal and vertical moves. So starting with either right or up, each direction change toggles the direction. Since we need exactly four changes, that would mean the path has five segments (since each change starts a new segment). For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right: that's four changes and five segments.",

Yeah, that's probably it. So each path is 16 steps long, consisting of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order. The question is how many such paths change direction exactly four times.\n\nHmm. Changing direction here means that the path alternates between horizontal and vertical moves. So, for example, if you have a sequence like RRRUUURRRUUU..., each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. The problem wants exactly four such changes.\n\nFirst, let me think about how direction changes are counted. If a path starts with all Rs then switches to Us, that's one direction change. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches from R to U or U to R. So, in a path, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs of R's or U's minus 1). Because each run of the same direction is separated by a direction change. For example, if you have RRRUUURRRUUU, that's three runs of R and two runs of U?",
          "text2": "Wait, maybe the grid is considered as having 8x8 squares, so moving from one corner to the opposite would require moving 8 units right and 8 units up, making it 16 steps. So maybe the grid is 8x8 squares, so the coordinates go from (0,0) to (8,8), requiring 8 right and 8 up moves. That would make the total length 16. So maybe that's the case. Let me confirm that. The problem says \"from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8\u00d78 grid\". So probably the grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the number of steps would be 8 right and 8 up, totaling 16. So that makes sense. So the path is 16 steps long, moving only right or up, and we have to count those paths that change direction exactly four times.\n\nAlright, so first, the total number of paths without any restrictions would be the combination C(16,8) since you have to choose 8 steps to be right (or up) out of 16. But here, we need paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm. Let me think about how direction changes work here.\n\nA path is a sequence of moves, either right or up. A direction change occurs whenever two consecutive moves are different. For example, if you have R followed by U, that's a direction change. Similarly, U followed by R is also a direction change. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches between R and U.\n\nTo have exactly four direction changes, that means the path alternates between runs of R's and U's, with the total number of runs being five, since each direction change starts a new run. For instance, if you start with R, then change to U, then R, then U, then R: that's four changes and five runs. Similarly, starting with U would also give five runs. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such paths that have exactly five runs (since each direction change increases the number of runs by one). Since a path must start with either R or U, and alternate between runs of R and U, the number of runs must be either 5 or something else?",

So the total R steps would be the sum of the lengths of the R runs, and similarly for U. \n\nSimilarly, if starting with U, then the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. The last run would be U, so the total U steps would be the sum of the first, third, and fifth runs, and R would be the second and fourth. \n\nSo in both cases, the total number of runs is five, with alternating directions, starting with either R or U. \n\nTherefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes would be the number of such paths starting with R plus the number starting with U. \n\nNow, to compute each case, let's consider starting with R first. \n\nCase 1: Starting with R. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So there are three R runs and two U runs. The total right moves must be 8, so the sum of the lengths of the R runs must be 8, and the U runs must sum to 8 as well. Since there are two U runs, their lengths must add up to 8. Similarly, for the R runs, three runs adding to 8. \n\nSimilarly, in starting with U, it's symmetric. Let me formalize this. \n\nLet me handle Case 1: starting with R.\n\nLet the lengths of the R runs be a, c, e and the U runs be b, d. So:\n\na + c + e = 8 (total right moves)\nb + d = 8 (total up moves)\n\nAdditionally, each of these variables must be at least 1, since each run must have at least one step (otherwise, it wouldn't be a run). \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions for the R runs (a, c, e) is the number of positive integer solutions to a + c + e = 8. That's equivalent to C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, for the U runs (b, d), the number of solutions is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1). \n\nTherefore, the number of ways for the R runs is C(7,2) and for the U runs is C(7,1). Since these are independent, the total number for Case 1 is C(7,2)*C(7,1). \n\nSimilarly, for Case 2: starting with U, the same logic applies. The runs are U, R, U, R, U. So the U runs are a, c, e (three runs) and R runs are b, d (two runs). The equations are:\n\na + c + e = 8 (for U)\nb + d = 8 (for R)\n\nAgain, each variable at least 1, so the number of solutions for U runs is C(7,2) and for R runs is C(7,1).

Therefore, depending on whether the path starts with right or up, the number of runs in each direction will be different. \n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose the path starts with a right move. Then the runs alternate between right and up. Since there are 5 runs, the number of right runs and up runs would be 3 and 2 respectively. Because starting with right, the runs are R, U, R, U, R.

The total number of direction changes is four in both cases (since each alternation counts as a change, so 5 segments mean 4 changes).\n\nSo, for each case (starting with R or U), we can calculate the number of paths and then add them together.\n\nNow, let me think about how to compute the number of paths for each case.\n\nFirst, let's consider paths starting with a right segment. Then the segments are R, U, R, U, R. Each \"R\" segment must contribute some number of rights, and each \"U\" segment must contribute some number of ups. The total number of rights is 8, and the total number of ups is 8. \n\nSince we have three R segments and two U segments (since starting with R and alternating five times gives three R and two U?), wait, let me check again.",

However, in order to reach (8,8), you must have some combination of rights and ups. \n\nBut the key point here is that the number of direction changes is the number of times we switch from right to up or vice versa.

The problem wants exactly four such changes.\n\nFirst, let me think about how direction changes are counted. If a path starts with all Rs then switches to Us, that's one direction change.

So, in a path, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs of R's or U's minus 1). Because each run of the same direction is separated by a direction change.

For instance, if you start with R, then change to U, then R, then U, then R: that's four changes and five runs. Similarly, starting with U would also give five runs. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such paths that have exactly five runs (since each direction change increases the number of runs by one).

Yeah, that's probably it. So each path is 16 steps long, consisting of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order. The question is how many such paths change direction exactly four times.\n\nHmm. Changing direction here means that the path alternates between horizontal and vertical moves. So, for example, if you have a sequence like RRRUUURRRUUU..., each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. The problem wants exactly four such changes.\n\nFirst, let me think about how direction changes are counted. If a path starts with all Rs then switches to Us, that's one direction change. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches from R to U or U to R. So, in a path, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs of R's or U's minus 1). Because each run of the same direction is separated by a direction change. For example, if you have RRRUUURRRUUU, that's three runs of R and two runs of U?",

So maybe the grid is 8x8 squares, so the coordinates go from (0,0) to (8,8), requiring 8 right and 8 up moves. That would make the total length 16. So maybe that's the case. Let me confirm that. The problem says \"from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8\u00d78 grid\". So probably the grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the number of steps would be 8 right and 8 up, totaling 16. So that makes sense. So the path is 16 steps long, moving only right or up, and we have to count those paths that change direction exactly four times.\n\nAlright, so first, the total number of paths without any restrictions would be the combination C(16,8) since you have to choose 8 steps to be right (or up) out of 16. But here, we need paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm. Let me think about how direction changes work here.\n\nA path is a sequence of moves, either right or up. A direction change occurs whenever two consecutive moves are different. For example, if you have R followed by U, that's a direction change. Similarly, U followed by R is also a direction change. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches between R and U.\n\nTo have exactly four direction changes, that means the path alternates between runs of R's and U's, with the total number of runs being five, since each direction change starts a new run. For instance, if you start with R, then change to U, then R, then U, then R: that's four changes and five runs. Similarly, starting with U would also give five runs. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such paths that have exactly five runs (since each direction change increases the number of runs by one). Since a path must start with either R or U, and alternate between runs of R and U, the number of runs must be either 5 or something else?",

Let me formalize this.\n\nSuppose the path starts with a right move. Then the sequence of directions alternates between right and up. Similarly, if it starts with up, it alternates between up and right. Each time it switches direction, that's a direction change.

For example, if you start with right, then after the first direction change (to up), you have two runs.
