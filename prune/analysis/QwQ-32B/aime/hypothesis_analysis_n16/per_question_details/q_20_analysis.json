For example, if a row has both W and B chips, that's invalid. So each row is either W, B, or Empty, based on its chips.

The filled cells are exactly those where the row's color and column's color are the same and not U. To satisfy the maximality condition, every empty cell must have row and column colors that are different or at least one is U? But if one of them is U, then perhaps you can assign a color to the U one to match and place a chip there, so that would violate maximality. Therefore, to prevent that, for any empty cell (i,j), neither row i nor column j can be U. Because if either was U, you could set it to the other's color and place a chip there. Therefore, all rows and columns must be assigned a color (W or B), and every empty cell must be at the intersection of a row and column of different colors. Because if they were same color, you could place a chip there. So, in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every row and column must be assigned a color (W or B), and the filled cells are exactly where row and column colors match. The empty cells are where they differ. So that's a key insight!\n\nSo in this model, the entire grid is determined by the color assignments to the rows and columns. Each row is colored W or B, each column is colored W or B. The filled cells are exactly those where the row and column colors are the same.

The empty cells are precisely the intersections where row and column colors differ. \n\nFurthermore, since all rows and columns are assigned a color (because otherwise, if a row was unassigned, you could assign it a color and then fill some cells, which would violate maximality), so all rows and columns must be colored either W or B. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings (assigning each row and column a color) such that:\n\n- The total number of white chips is \u226425 and black chips \u226425.",

If the row is W, that means there's a W chip in that row, but since the cell is empty, there must be no chips in that row. Contradiction. \n\nAh! Here's the key: if a row is colored W, it must have at least one W chip. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the row and column colors cannot be set independently; they must be consistent with the chips placed. \n\nSo in the conflicting case (row W and column B), that would require the row to have a W chip somewhere (but in a different column), and the column to have a B chip somewhere (in a different row). But in a 1x1 grid, this is impossible. Therefore, the only maximal configurations are:\n\n- W chip (row and column W).\n\n- B chip (row and column B).\n\n- The empty cell, but only if it's not possible to place a chip. However, in the empty cell, since the row and column are both Empty, you can place a chip of any color, so it's not maximal. \n\nTherefore, there are only two maximal configurations for 1x1: W and B. But according to the previous model where assignments give 3^2=9, which was wrong because of inconsistent assignments.\n\nThis indicates that the initial model is incorrect because row and column colors must be consistent with the placed chips. Hence we need a different approach.\n\nLet me think again:\n\nEach maximal configuration is determined by a subset of the grid's cells, colored either W or B, such that:\n\n1. All cells in any row are either all W, all B, or all Empty.\n\n2. Similarly for columns.\n\n3. The configuration is maximal: no more cells can be added without violating 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, to count such configurations:\n\nFirst, note that the colors of the rows and columns are determined by the placed chips. For example, if a row has both W and B chips, that's invalid. So each row is either W, B, or Empty, based on its chips. Same for columns. \n\nThe maximality condition requires that for any empty cell (i,j), if you were to place a W there, it would either conflict with the current color of row i or column j. Similarly for B.\n\nTherefore, for an empty cell (i,j):\n\n- If row i is W or column j is B, you can't place a W there.\n\n- If row i is B or column j is W, you can't place a B there.\n\n- If both row i and column j are Empty, then you could place either W or B, which would set the row and column to that color. Hence, the configuration is not maximal unless there are no such cells.\n\nTherefore, to be maximal, every empty cell must have row i or column j already colored, and the colors must conflict.\n\nTherefore, for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- Row i is W and column j is B,\n\n- Row i is B and column j is W,\n\n- Row i is W and column j is Empty, but then you could place a W in column j's other cells, but since column j is Empty, placing a W here would set column j to W, allowing more chips.",
          "text2": "Wait, this is getting somewhere.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s suppose that each row is assigned a color (W, B) or is unassigned (U). Similarly for each column. The filled cells are exactly those where the row's color and column's color are the same and not U. To satisfy the maximality condition, every empty cell must have row and column colors that are different or at least one is U? But if one of them is U, then perhaps you can assign a color to the U one to match and place a chip there, so that would violate maximality. Therefore, to prevent that, for any empty cell (i,j), neither row i nor column j can be U. Because if either was U, you could set it to the other's color and place a chip there. Therefore, all rows and columns must be assigned a color (W or B), and every empty cell must be at the intersection of a row and column of different colors. Because if they were same color, you could place a chip there. So, in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every row and column must be assigned a color (W or B), and the filled cells are exactly where row and column colors match. The empty cells are where they differ. So that's a key insight!\n\nSo in this model, the entire grid is determined by the color assignments to the rows and columns. Each row is colored W or B, each column is colored W or B. The filled cells are exactly those where the row and column colors are the same. Therefore, in such an arrangement, the grid is filled in a checkerboard pattern where the color of each cell is the color of its row (or column, since they must agree). The empty cells are precisely the intersections where row and column colors differ. \n\nFurthermore, since all rows and columns are assigned a color (because otherwise, if a row was unassigned, you could assign it a color and then fill some cells, which would violate maximality), so all rows and columns must be colored either W or B. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings (assigning each row and column a color) such that:\n\n- The total number of white chips is \u226425 and black chips \u226425.",

So the constraints are automatically satisfied, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings of the rows and columns (each row is W or B, each column is W or B) such that the resulting arrangement is maximal (which it is, as per our earlier reasoning, because all rows and columns are colored).

If the row is W, that means there's a W chip in that row, but since the cell is empty, there must be no chips in that row. Contradiction. \n\nAh! Here's the key: if a row is colored W, it must have at least one W chip. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the row and column colors cannot be set independently; they must be consistent with the chips placed. \n\nSo in the conflicting case (row W and column B), that would require the row to have a W chip somewhere (but in a different column), and the column to have a B chip somewhere (in a different row). But in a 1x1 grid, this is impossible. Therefore, the only maximal configurations are:\n\n- W chip (row and column W).\n\n- B chip (row and column B).\n\n- The empty cell, but only if it's not possible to place a chip. However, in the empty cell, since the row and column are both Empty, you can place a chip of any color, so it's not maximal. \n\nTherefore, there are only two maximal configurations for 1x1: W and B. But according to the previous model where assignments give 3^2=9, which was wrong because of inconsistent assignments.\n\nThis indicates that the initial model is incorrect because row and column colors must be consistent with the placed chips. Hence we need a different approach.\n\nLet me think again:\n\nEach maximal configuration is determined by a subset of the grid's cells, colored either W or B, such that:\n\n1. All cells in any row are either all W, all B, or all Empty.\n\n2. Similarly for columns.\n\n3. The configuration is maximal: no more cells can be added without violating 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, to count such configurations:\n\nFirst, note that the colors of the rows and columns are determined by the placed chips. For example, if a row has both W and B chips, that's invalid. So each row is either W, B, or Empty, based on its chips. Same for columns. \n\nThe maximality condition requires that for any empty cell (i,j), if you were to place a W there, it would either conflict with the current color of row i or column j. Similarly for B.\n\nTherefore, for an empty cell (i,j):\n\n- If row i is W or column j is B, you can't place a W there.\n\n- If row i is B or column j is W, you can't place a B there.\n\n- If both row i and column j are Empty, then you could place either W or B, which would set the row and column to that color. Hence, the configuration is not maximal unless there are no such cells.\n\nTherefore, to be maximal, every empty cell must have row i or column j already colored, and the colors must conflict.\n\nTherefore, for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- Row i is W and column j is B,\n\n- Row i is B and column j is W,\n\n- Row i is W and column j is Empty, but then you could place a W in column j's other cells, but since column j is Empty, placing a W here would set column j to W, allowing more chips.",
          "text2": "Wait, this is getting somewhere.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s suppose that each row is assigned a color (W, B) or is unassigned (U). Similarly for each column. The filled cells are exactly those where the row's color and column's color are the same and not U. To satisfy the maximality condition, every empty cell must have row and column colors that are different or at least one is U? But if one of them is U, then perhaps you can assign a color to the U one to match and place a chip there, so that would violate maximality. Therefore, to prevent that, for any empty cell (i,j), neither row i nor column j can be U. Because if either was U, you could set it to the other's color and place a chip there. Therefore, all rows and columns must be assigned a color (W or B), and every empty cell must be at the intersection of a row and column of different colors. Because if they were same color, you could place a chip there. So, in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every row and column must be assigned a color (W or B), and the filled cells are exactly where row and column colors match. The empty cells are where they differ. So that's a key insight!\n\nSo in this model, the entire grid is determined by the color assignments to the rows and columns. Each row is colored W or B, each column is colored W or B. The filled cells are exactly those where the row and column colors are the same. Therefore, in such an arrangement, the grid is filled in a checkerboard pattern where the color of each cell is the color of its row (or column, since they must agree). The empty cells are precisely the intersections where row and column colors differ. \n\nFurthermore, since all rows and columns are assigned a color (because otherwise, if a row was unassigned, you could assign it a color and then fill some cells, which would violate maximality), so all rows and columns must be colored either W or B. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such colorings (assigning each row and column a color) such that:\n\n- The total number of white chips is \u226425 and black chips \u226425.",

That is, either:\n\n1. The row i is already colored with a color different from the column j's color. So, if you tried to put a chip there, it would have to be both the row's color and the column's color, which are different, so impossible.\n\n2. Or, if the row i is uncolored (i.e., all cells in the row are empty), but the column j is colored. Then, placing a chip there would require the row i to adopt the column's color. However, since the row was previously uncolored, this is possible, but would that conflict with anything? Since the row was empty before, there are no existing chips in the row, so the color can be set to the column's color. Therefore, in that case, you could actually place a chip there, which would mean the current configuration is not maximal. Hence, such a cell (i,j) must not exist in a maximal configuration. \n\nSimilarly, if the column j is uncolored but the row i is colored, then you could place a chip in (i,j) of the row's color. So, in a maximal configuration, this cannot happen. \n\nTherefore, the only way the configuration is maximal is that for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- Both the row i and column j are uncolored (so their intersection is empty, but then you could place a chip there of any color, which would require setting both row and column to that color.

Therefore, in such a case, every cell must be either filled or blocked by conflicting row and column colors.\n\nTherefore, for every cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The cell is filled with a chip of color C, which must equal the row's color and the column's color.\n\nOR\n\n- The cell is empty because the row's color and column's color conflict (one is W, the other B).\n\nAND, importantly, there cannot exist a cell (i,j) where both the row and column are unassigned, because then you could assign both to a color and place a chip there, violating maximality.\n\nTherefore, in a maximal configuration, every row must be assigned a color (W, B) or not, every column must be assigned a color (W,B) or not, such that:\n\n- For any row and column not assigned, their intersection cannot have a chip, but also, you cannot have both unassigned because that would allow adding a chip.",

Then the total chips are R_w*C_w + R_b*C_b, and this can be less than 25. However, to satisfy maximality, we just need that all allowed cells (matching row and column colors) are filled, which they are by construction. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all possible colorings of the rows and columns (each row white or black, each column white or black), such that:\n\n- The number of white chips used, R_w*C_w, does not exceed 25,\n\n- The number of black chips used, R_b*C_b, does not exceed 25,\n\n- And the color assignments are such that the arrangement is maximal (but since we already assumed all rows and columns are colored, and filled all allowed cells, this is satisfied).\n\nHowever, since we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, but the problem states \"place some of these chips\", so we can use any number up to 25 of each, as long as the counts don't exceed. Since R_w*C_w and R_b*C_b must each be \u226425. But since R_w and C_w are between 0 and5, their product can't exceed 25 anyway (since 5\u00d75=25). Similarly for black chips. So actually, the constraints are automatically satisfied. \n\nTherefore, the total number of such arrangements is the number of ways to choose R_w (number of white rows from 0-5), C_w (number of white columns from 0-5), and then for each such pair (R_w,C_w), the number of colorings is the combination of choosing which rows are white and which columns are white. \n\nHowever, we must also consider that the color assignments are independent: choosing R_w rows out of 5 to be white, and C_w columns out of 5 to be white, and the rest are black. \n\nTherefore, for each pair (R_w, C_w), the number of arrangements is:\n\nC(5, R_w) * C(5, C_w).\n\nThus, the total number is the sum over R_w from 0 to5 and C_w from 0 to5 of [C(5,R_w)*C(5,C_w)].",

The remaining cells are intersections of W rows with B columns and vice versa, which are empty. But since the problem allows using any number up to 25 for each, as long as the white chips count \u226425 and black chips count \u226425. However, since the white and black counts are (W_rows * W_columns) and (B_rows * B_columns), respectively, and since W_rows + B_rows =5, W_columns + B_columns =5, then the products can't exceed 25. The maximum for white is 25 (when all rows and columns are white), which is okay. Similarly for black.
