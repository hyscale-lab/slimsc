Therefore, since sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, we have that | -5/(6 sin\u03b8) | \u2264 1, so |5/(6 sin\u03b8)| \u22641, so |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6. Therefore, |sin\u03b8| \u2265 5/6, so sin\u03b8 \u22655/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264-5/6. \n\nTherefore, theta must be in regions where its sine is at least 5/6 or at most -5/6. \n\nNow, let's compute tan\u03c6 in terms of theta. Let me see. Since sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8). Let me also recall that tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6. To find tan\u03c6, we can use:\n\ncos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) or -sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6). Hmm, but the sign of cos\u03c6 depends on the quadrant of phi. However, perhaps since hyperbola parameters can be in any direction, but maybe it's better to proceed algebraically. Let me see.\n\nLet me compute tan\u00b2\u03c6:\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6) \n\nSince tan\u03c6 squared is sin squared over cos squared, which is 1 over (cot squared) but let's compute.\n\nGiven sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8), so sin\u00b2\u03c6 = 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8). Therefore,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [1 - 25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] \n\n= [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\n= 25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 25)\n\nTherefore, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nTherefore, substituting back into BD squared:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 * [25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) ]\n\nSo BD squared is equal to 80 + (176 *25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\n= 80 + 4400 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal value of BD squared, so we need to minimize this expression.

Then BD squared becomes:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36s -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this expression over s \u226525/36.\n\nLet me analyze the function f(s) = 80 + 4400/(36s -25) for s \u226525/36.\n\nFirst, note that as s increases, the denominator 36s -25 increases, so the fraction 4400/(36s -25) decreases.

Similarly, the same applies if we solve for sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8: |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 must be at least 5/6 in absolute value. So sin\u03c6 \u2208 (-\u221e, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, \u221e), but since sin\u03c6 is bounded between -1 and 1, so actually sin\u03c6 \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must be such that sin\u03c6 is in those ranges. Therefore, tan\u03c6 can be expressed in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me think. Since BD\u00b2 =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6, so to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6. Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6). Let me set s = sin\u03c6. Then tan\u00b2\u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). So BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut s must satisfy |s| \u22655/6, so s \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2) over s in those intervals. Let me consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is same for s and -s), so we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nLet me set f(s) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). Let's compute its minimum over s \u2208 [5/6,1). Since as s approaches 1, f(s) tends to infinity. At s=5/6, f(s)= (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.27. So the minimum of f(s) on [5/6,1) is at s=5/6, so the minimal value is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*(25/11). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 176*(25/11) =176/11 *25 =16*25=400. \n\nSo BD\u00b2_min =80 +400=480.",

          "text2": "Wait, but I need to confirm that BD squared can indeed approach 480. Let me see. Let me take theta approaching pi/2, so sin\u03b8 approaches 1. Let me set sin\u03b8 =1 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number approaching 0. Then sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8) = -5/(6(1 - \u03b5)) \u2248 -5/6 (1 + 6\u03b5) using a Taylor expansion, but perhaps that complicates. Let me instead take theta such that sin\u03b8 =1 - \u03b4, very close to 1, then s = sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 - \u03b4)^2 \u22481 - 2\u03b4. Then, BD squared =80 + 4400/(36*(1 - 2\u03b4) -25) =80 + 4400/(11 -72\u03b4). As \u03b4 approaches 0, the denominator approaches 11, so BD squared approaches 80 + 4400/11 =80 +400=480.

Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6). Let me set s = sin\u03c6. Then tan\u00b2\u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). So BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut s must satisfy |s| \u22655/6, so s \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2) over s in those intervals. Let me consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is same for s and -s), so we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nLet me set f(s) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). Let's compute its minimum over s \u2208 [5/6,1). Since as s approaches 1, f(s) tends to infinity. At s=5/6, f(s)= (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.27. So the minimum of f(s) on [5/6,1) is at s=5/6, so the minimal value is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*(25/11). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 176*(25/11) =176/11 *25 =16*25=400. \n\nSo BD\u00b2_min =80 +400=480.",

Therefore, to find the minimal BD squared, we need to minimize BD squared =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6, given that there exists \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. \n\nBut we can choose \u03b8 to satisfy that equation. Let me see. For BD squared to be minimal, we need tan\u00b2\u03c6 as small as possible, since the expression is 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is achieved when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is minimized. \n\nSo, to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, we need to see what constraints are on \u03c6. The equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 must hold for some \u03b8. Since sin\u03b8 is between -1 and 1, then sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 must be between -|sin\u03c6| and |sin\u03c6|. Therefore, the equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 requires that |sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6| \u22641, so |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6, because |sin\u03b8| \u22641. \n\nTherefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. So sin\u03c6 \u22655/6 or sin\u03c6 \u2264-5/6. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible |sin\u03c6| is 5/6, so the minimal |\u03c6| would be arcsin(5/6). Thus, to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, we need to take sin\u03c6=\u00b15/6 and cos\u03c6 as large as possible (since tan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6). Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6), and cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nGiven that sin\u00b2\u03c6 \u2265 (5/6)^2 =25/36,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 \u2265 (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.2727.",
          "text2": "Wait, but we need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me see. Since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, so sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6). Since sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, the right-hand side must also be in that interval. So |-5/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u22641 \u21d2 |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Similarly, the same applies if we solve for sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8: |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 must be at least 5/6 in absolute value. So sin\u03c6 \u2208 (-\u221e, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, \u221e), but since sin\u03c6 is bounded between -1 and 1, so actually sin\u03c6 \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must be such that sin\u03c6 is in those ranges. Therefore, tan\u03c6 can be expressed in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me think. Since BD\u00b2 =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6, so to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6. Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6). Let me set s = sin\u03c6. Then tan\u00b2\u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). So BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut s must satisfy |s| \u22655/6, so s \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2) over s in those intervals. Let me consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is same for s and -s), so we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nLet me set f(s) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). Let's compute its minimum over s \u2208 [5/6,1). Since as s approaches 1, f(s) tends to infinity. At s=5/6, f(s)= (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.27. So the minimum of f(s) on [5/6,1) is at s=5/6, so the minimal value is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*(25/11). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 176*(25/11) =176/11 *25 =16*25=400. \n\nSo BD\u00b2_min =80 +400=480.",

Let me see. For BD squared to be minimal, we need tan\u00b2\u03c6 as small as possible, since the expression is 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is achieved when tan\u00b2\u03c6 is minimized. \n\nSo, to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, we need to see what constraints are on \u03c6. The equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 must hold for some \u03b8. Since sin\u03b8 is between -1 and 1, then sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 must be between -|sin\u03c6| and |sin\u03c6|. Therefore, the equation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 requires that |sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6| \u22641, so |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6, because |sin\u03b8| \u22641. \n\nTherefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. So sin\u03c6 \u22655/6 or sin\u03c6 \u2264-5/6. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible |sin\u03c6| is 5/6, so the minimal |\u03c6| would be arcsin(5/6). Thus, to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, we need to take sin\u03c6=\u00b15/6 and cos\u03c6 as large as possible (since tan\u03c6=sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6). Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6), and cos\u00b2\u03c6=1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6, so:\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nGiven that sin\u00b2\u03c6 \u2265 (5/6)^2 =25/36,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 \u2265 (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.2727.",
          "text2": "Wait, but we need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me see. Since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, so sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6). Since sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, the right-hand side must also be in that interval. So |-5/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u22641 \u21d2 |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Similarly, the same applies if we solve for sin\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8: |sin\u03b8| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 must be at least 5/6 in absolute value. So sin\u03c6 \u2208 (-\u221e, -5/6] \u222a [5/6, \u221e), but since sin\u03c6 is bounded between -1 and 1, so actually sin\u03c6 \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must be such that sin\u03c6 is in those ranges. Therefore, tan\u03c6 can be expressed in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nLet me think. Since BD\u00b2 =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6, so to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6. Since tan\u00b2\u03c6 = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(cos\u00b2\u03c6) = (sin\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6). Let me set s = sin\u03c6. Then tan\u00b2\u03c6 = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). So BD\u00b2 =80 +176*(s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2)).\n\nBut s must satisfy |s| \u22655/6, so s \u2208 [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2) over s in those intervals. Let me consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is same for s and -s), so we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nLet me set f(s) = s\u00b2/(1 - s\u00b2). Let's compute its minimum over s \u2208 [5/6,1). Since as s approaches 1, f(s) tends to infinity. At s=5/6, f(s)= (25/36)/(1 -25/36)= (25/36)/(11/36)=25/11\u22482.27. So the minimum of f(s) on [5/6,1) is at s=5/6, so the minimal value is 25/11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*(25/11).
