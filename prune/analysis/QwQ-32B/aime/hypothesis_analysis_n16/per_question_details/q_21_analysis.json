Therefore, s is the square root, so s must be an integer. Therefore, s is a positive integer, and n = s\u00b2. \n\nSo, putting this all together, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must satisfy:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1,\n\n2. 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1,\n\n3. n = a*b + c,\n\n4. s = a + c,\n\n5. s\u00b2 = a*b + c.\n\nSo, combining equations 3 and 5, we have s\u00b2 = n = a*b + c, so that's consistent.\n\nAdditionally, since c = s - a (from equation 4), substituting into equation 3:\n\nn = a*b + (s - a) = a*(b - 1) + s\n\nTherefore, the equation s\u00b2 = a*(b - 1) + s\n\nSo, rearranged, this gives:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = a*(b - 1)\n\nTherefore, as before,\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSo, since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this equation must hold such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting a is within those bounds.

Because s and s-1 are coprime, so to have s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), since they are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or divide s-1. So either s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1). \n\nAh! That's a key insight. Since s and s-1 are coprime, their GCD is 1. Therefore, for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), it must divide either s or s-1. Therefore, either:\n\nCase 1: (b -1) divides s \u21d2 s \u22610 mod (b-1), or\n\nCase 2: (b -1) divides (s -1) \u21d2 s \u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, for a given b, the s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] must satisfy either s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, the possible s are those congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1), within the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nTherefore, the number of such s is equal to the number of integers in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] congruent to 0 or 1 mod (b-1). \n\nTherefore, the count becomes the number of s in that interval satisfying s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1). \n\nThis is a crucial realization. Therefore, instead of checking divisibility for every s, which can be tedious, we can compute it via these congruences.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, let me rephrase the problem: \n\nWe need to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] with s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1) is greater than 10.\n\nTherefore, to find this b, we can think of for each b, how many numbers between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 are \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nLet me think of how many numbers \u22610 mod (b-1) are in that interval. The numbers congruent to 0 mod (b-1) in that range are multiples of (b-1). The smallest such number is ceil(sqrt(b)) rounded up to the nearest multiple of (b-1), but since (b-1) is the modulus, the possible numbers are k*(b-1). The maximum s is b-1, so the only multiple of (b-1) in [1, b-1] is exactly (b-1) itself. Because (b-1)*1 = b-1, and next would be 2*(b-1) which is \u22652b-2, which is greater than b-1 for b\u22652. Therefore, the only number \u22610 mod (b-1) in [1, b-1] is s = b-1.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) are 1, (b), but since s is at most b-1, the only such number is s=1 mod (b-1). The numbers would be of the form k*(b-1) +1. The smallest such number \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)) would be ?\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) in [1, b-1] are 1 and (b-1 +1)=b?",
          "text2": "Wait, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then either (b-1) divides s, or (b-1) divides (s-1). Because since gcd(s, s-1)=1, the factors of (b-1) must be entirely in one of the terms.\n\nTherefore, the solutions s are those congruent to 0 or 1 mod (b-1). So s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1). But since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, how many such s are there?\n\nLet me think. Let m = b -1. So m is from 1 upwards. So s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), m], since b-1 = m, and s \u2264 m.\n\nWe need to count the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), m] such that s \u22610 mod m or s\u22611 mod m.\n\nBut since s \u22610 mod m would mean s=m (since s \u2264 m). Similarly, s\u22611 mod m can be s=1 or s= m+1, but s \u2264 m, so s=1. But 1 is less than ceil(sqrt(b)) unless b is very small.",
