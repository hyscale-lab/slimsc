So moving from F, which is at (e + 184, 0), moving upward (since FG is 17) to point G, which would be at (e + 184, 17). Then, from G, moving left 184 units to H, so H would be at (e,17), and back to E?",
          "text2": "Wait, but the problem also says that points A, D, H, G are on a circle. Hmm, so points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me note that A is (0,16), D is (0,0). So those two points are on the y-axis. H and G must be points from the other rectangle, EFGH. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nStarting with rectangle ABCD:\n\n- Let\u2019s place D at (0,0). Since AD = 16 (vertical side), A is at (0,16). AB is 107, so moving right along the x-axis from A, point B is at (107,16), and then C is at (107,0). So that's rectangle ABCD.\n\nNow rectangle EFGH. The points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), F are collinear on the x-axis. So E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis between D and C or beyond. Since EFGH is a rectangle, let's suppose that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the other way around? Let's see.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let E be at some point (e,0) and F at (f,0). Since they are collinear with D and C on the x-axis, and since D is (0,0), C is (107,0), so E and F can be anywhere along the x-axis. The rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG =17. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, and EF is between E and F on the x-axis, then the length of EF is |f - e| = 184. Since EF is a side, so the distance between E and F is 184. So depending on the direction, F could be to the right or left of E. But since C is at (107,0), perhaps F is beyond C? Let me think.\n\nBut also, the rectangle EFGH has sides FG =17. So from point F, moving perpendicularly to the x-axis (since EF is horizontal) to get to G. Since FG is 17, then G would be either (f,17) or (f,-17). Similarly, H would be the other corner. Let me assume that the rectangle is above the x-axis, so G is at (f,17), then H would be at (e,17).",

Same as before.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e + b*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +a e -17b =0.\n\nBut since b =-16, this becomes e\u00b2 +289 +a e -17*(-16) = e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 = e\u00b2 +a e + 561 =0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +a f + b*(-17)=0 \u21d2 same as H but with f instead of e:\n\nf\u00b2 +289 +a f +272 =f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0.\n\nTherefore, equations for e and f are:\n\nEquation 1: e\u00b2 +a e +561 =0,\n\nEquation 2: f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0.\n\nSo again, e and f are roots of x\u00b2 +a x +561 =0.\n\nThen similarly, the distance between E(e,0) and F(f,0) is |f -e|=184.\n\nSo, using the same approach as before:\n\nLet me denote that e and f satisfy:\n\ne + f = -a,\n\ne*f =561,\n\nand (f -e)^2 = (184)^2.\n\nThen,\n\n(f -e)^2 = (f +e)^2 -4ef = (-a)^2 -4*561 = a\u00b2 -2244 = 184\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 = 184\u00b2 +2244.\n\nCompute 184\u00b2 is 33856, so 33856 +2244 = 36100.",

So E is (e, 0), F is (e + 184, 0). Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, the next point G would be either up or down from F. Let's suppose that the rectangle is above the x-axis. So moving from F, which is at (e + 184, 0), moving upward (since FG is 17) to point G, which would be at (e + 184, 17).

So those two points are on the y-axis. H and G must be points from the other rectangle, EFGH. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nStarting with rectangle ABCD:\n\n- Let\u2019s place D at (0,0). Since AD = 16 (vertical side), A is at (0,16). AB is 107, so moving right along the x-axis from A, point B is at (107,16), and then C is at (107,0). So that's rectangle ABCD.\n\nNow rectangle EFGH. The points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), F are collinear on the x-axis. So E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis between D and C or beyond. Since EFGH is a rectangle, let's suppose that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the other way around? Let's see.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s let E be at some point (e,0) and F at (f,0). Since they are collinear with D and C on the x-axis, and since D is (0,0), C is (107,0), so E and F can be anywhere along the x-axis. The rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG =17. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, and EF is between E and F on the x-axis, then the length of EF is |f - e| = 184. Since EF is a side, so the distance between E and F is 184. So depending on the direction, F could be to the right or left of E. But since C is at (107,0), perhaps F is beyond C? Let me think.\n\nBut also, the rectangle EFGH has sides FG =17. So from point F, moving perpendicularly to the x-axis (since EF is horizontal) to get to G. Since FG is 17, then G would be either (f,17) or (f,-17). Similarly, H would be the other corner. Let me assume that the rectangle is above the x-axis, so G is at (f,17), then H would be at (e,17).",

Since FG is 17, then G would be at (f,17) or (f,-17). Since points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, G are on a circle, probably the rectangle is above the x-axis. So let's assume FG is upwards, so G is (f,17). Then H would be (e,17), because from G, moving back to H, which is connected to E. So H is (e,17), and E is (e,0). So the rectangle EFGH has coordinates E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f,17), H(e,17). That makes sense. So the rectangle EFGH is to the right of E, extending from x=e to x=f on the x-axis, and up to y=17.\n\nNow, given that EF=184, so the length from E(e,0) to F(f,0) is f - e = 184 (assuming f > e).

Let me first suppose that the rectangle EFGH is placed such that EF is along the x-axis from E(e,0) to F(f,0), so the length EF is |f - e| = 184. Since EF is a horizontal side, then FG is vertical. Since FG is 17, then from F(f,0), moving up 17 units, so G is at (f,17), and then H would be at (e,17). So the rectangle EFGH has coordinates E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).",

So coordinates:\n\nE: (e,0)\n\nF: (e + 184,0)\n\nG: (e + 184,17)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nSo that forms rectangle EFGH with sides 184 and 17.\n\nNow, the points A, D, H, G are on a circle. Let me recall the coordinates of A, D, H, G.\n\nPoint A is part of rectangle ABCD. Earlier, I set D at (0,0), so A is (0,16). D is (0,0). H is (e,17), and G is (e + 184,17). So these four points must lie on a circle.\n\nTherefore, the four points (0,16), (0,0), (e,17), and (e + 184,17) lie on a circle. The problem reduces to finding e such that these four points are concyclic, then CE can be found as the distance from C (which is at (107,0)) to E (which is at (e,0)), so CE = |107 - e|.\n\nSo I need to find e such that the four points lie on a circle, then compute CE = 107 - e (assuming e < 107, which is probably the case).\n\nSo let's write the equation for a circle passing through these four points, and solve for e.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, if it's below the x-axis, then G would be (f,-17) and H(e,-17). But since points A, D, H, G are on a circle, and A is (0,16), D is (0,0), so if H and G are below the x-axis, then points A and D would be on different sides, but maybe that's possible. But perhaps it's more straightforward to assume they are above. Let me proceed with that assumption first.\n\nSo let's say E is at (e, 0), F is at (f,0), G is at (f,17), H is at (e,17). So the rectangle is above the x-axis. Then the sides EF is horizontal with length |f - e| = 184, and FG is vertical with length 17. So that works. \n\nNow, the points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), and G(f,17) lie on a circle. So these four points must be concyclic. We have to use this condition to find e and f, and then CE would be the distance between C(107,0) and E(e,0), which is |107 - e|. So we need to find e, which would give us CE.\n\nSo the key here is to use the cyclic quadrilateral condition for points A, D, H, G. Let me recall that four points lie on a circle if the quadrilateral formed by them is cyclic, which can be checked by the condition that the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides?",

So EF = x + y = 184. Therefore, x + y = 184. \n\nBut also, FG is 17. Since FG is a vertical side (since EF is horizontal), then from F, moving up or down 17 units to point G.

Since E and F are on the x-axis, the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184. Since f > e, then f - e = 184. Therefore, f = e + 184.

Since E and F are on the x-axis, then the distance between E and F must be EF = 184. Therefore, if E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0). However, in the problem statement, the points D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, so D (0,0), E (e,0), C (107,0), F (e + 184,0). So the order must satisfy 0 < e < 107 < e + 184. Therefore, e must be less than 107, and e + 184 must be greater than 107. Therefore, e can be any value such that 107 - 184 < e < 107, but since e must be positive (since it's after D at 0), so e is between 0 and 107. \n\nBut also, since C is at 107,0, and F is at e + 184,0, so the point F is located at e + 184 along the x-axis, and since C is at 107,0, so the order D-E-C-F implies that E is between D and C, and F is after C. Therefore, e must be less than 107, and e + 184 must be greater than 107.

So if E is on the x-axis, and F is also on the x-axis, then the side EF is along the x-axis, so F is either to the right or left of E by 184 units. But since C is already at (107,0), and F comes after C in the collinear points? Hmm, the problem says D,E,C,F are collinear. So the order might be D, E, C, F along the line. So from D (0,0) to E, then to C (107,0), then to F. So F is beyond C on the x-axis. Therefore, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So E is to the left of C, and F is to the right of C.

That makes sense. So the rectangle EFGH is to the right of E, extending from x=e to x=f on the x-axis, and up to y=17.\n\nNow, given that EF=184, so the length from E(e,0) to F(f,0) is f - e = 184 (assuming f > e).

If the rectangle is below the x-axis, then H and G would have y-coordinate -17.\n\nSo H would be at (e, -17), G at (f, -17). Then the four points on the circle would be A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17). Let me see if that changes things.\n\nGoing back to the circle equation.

Rectangle EFGH with E(e,0), F(f,0), and since FG=17, which would be the vertical side downward, so G(f, -17) and H(e, -17). \n\nThen the four points on the circle are A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(f,-17).\n\nLet me plug these into the circle equation.\n\nAgain, general equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlug in D(0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + 256 +0 +16E +0 =0 \u21d2 256 +16E =0 \u21d2 E= -16.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -16y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + D e -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 + D e +272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + D e +561=0 (Equation 1)\n\nPlug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + D f -16*(-17)=0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +289 + D f +272=0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 + D f +561=0 (Equation 2)\n\nSo equations 1 and 2 give that e and f are roots of x\u00b2 + Dx +561=0. Therefore, e + f = -D, and e*f =561.\n\nAlso, the distance between E and F is |f - e|=184. So again, (f - e)^2 = (184)^2 \u21d2 (f + e)^2 -4ef = 184\u00b2 \u21d2 D\u00b2 -4*561 = 184\u00b2 \u21d2 D\u00b2 =184\u00b2 +4*561.\n\nCompute 4*561=2244, so D\u00b2 = 33856 +2244= 36100. \n\nAh! 36100 is 190 squared (since 190\u00b2=36100). Therefore, D=\u00b1190.\n\nTherefore, from e + f = -D \u21d2 e + f = \u2213190. But we also have e*f=561.\n\nSo now, we have two cases: D=190 or D=-190.\n\nLet me see:\n\nCase 1: D=190. Then e + f = -190. And e*f=561.\n\nCase 2: D= -190. Then e + f=190. And e*f=561.\n\nNow, let's see which case is possible given the distance between E and F is 184.\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: D=190 \u21d2 e + f = -190, e*f=561.\n\nThen, (f - e)^2 = (f + e)^2 -4ef = (-190)^2 -4*561 = 36100 -2244= 33856. Which is exactly 184\u00b2 (since 184\u00b2=33856). Perfect, so this works. So in this case, the difference f -e is sqrt(33856)=184. But since e + f =-190, the difference squared gives us that the distance is 184. So this case is valid.\n\nCase 2: D= -190 \u21d2 e + f=190, e*f=561.\n\nThen (f -e)^2 =190\u00b2 -4*561=36100 -2244=33856=184\u00b2. So also valid. So both cases are possible.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase1: e + f = -190, e*f=561, with |f - e|=184.\n\nCase2: e + f =190, e*f=561, with |f -e|=184.\n\nLet me analyze both cases.\n\nFirst, let's check Case1: e + f =-190, e*f=561.\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 +190x +561=0 (since D=190, so x\u00b2 +Dx +561=0)",

So EF = x + y = 184. Therefore, x + y = 184. \n\nBut also, FG is 17. Since FG is a vertical side (since EF is horizontal), then from F, moving up or down 17 units to point G.

Since E and F are on the x-axis, then the distance between E and F must be EF = 184. Therefore, if E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0).

Therefore, e must be less than 107, and e + 184 must be greater than 107. Therefore, e can be any value such that 107 - 184 < e < 107, but since e must be positive (since it's after D at 0), so e is between 0 and 107. \n\nBut also, since C is at 107,0, and F is at e + 184,0, so the point F is located at e + 184 along the x-axis, and since C is at 107,0, so the order D-E-C-F implies that E is between D and C, and F is after C.

But since C is already at (107,0), and F comes after C in the collinear points? Hmm, the problem says D,E,C,F are collinear. So the order might be D, E, C, F along the line.

Let me see if that could work. \n\nLet me try this scenario. So H is (e, -17), G is (f, -17). \n\nThen, using the same circle equation. Let me redo the circle equation with this assumption.\n\nThe four points are A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17). Let's plug these into the circle equation.\n\nAgain, general circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y + c =0.\n\nPlugging D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x + b y =0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d2 256 +16b =0 \u21d2 b = -16. Same as before.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e + b*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +a e -17b =0.\n\nBut since b =-16, this becomes e\u00b2 +289 +a e -17*(-16) = e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 = e\u00b2 +a e + 561 =0.\n\nSimilarly, plug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +a f + b*(-17)=0 \u21d2 same as H but with f instead of e:\n\nf\u00b2 +289 +a f +272 =f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0.\n\nTherefore, equations for e and f are:\n\nEquation 1: e\u00b2 +a e +561 =0,\n\nEquation 2: f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0.\n\nSo again, e and f are roots of x\u00b2 +a x +561 =0.\n\nThen similarly, the distance between E(e,0) and F(f,0) is |f -e|=184.\n\nSo, using the same approach as before:\n\nLet me denote that e and f satisfy:\n\ne + f = -a,\n\ne*f =561,\n\nand (f -e)^2 = (184)^2.\n\nThen,\n\n(f -e)^2 = (f +e)^2 -4ef = (-a)^2 -4*561 = a\u00b2 -2244 = 184\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 = 184\u00b2 +2244.\n\nCompute 184\u00b2 is 33856, so 33856 +2244 = 36100.",

As before:\n\nEquation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y + c =0\n\nPlug in D(0,0): c=0\n\nPlug in A(0,16): 0 + 256 + 0 +16b +0 =0 \u21d2 256 +16b=0 \u21d2 b= -16.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x -16 y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 + a e + 272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + a e + 561 =0 (Equation 1)\n\nPlug in G(e+184, -17):\n\n(e+184)^2 + (-17)^2 + a(e+184) -16*(-17)=0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (e + 184)^2 = e\u00b2 + 368e + 33856\n\nSecond term: (-17)^2 = 289\n\nThird term: a(e +184) = a e + 184a\n\nFourth term: -16*(-17) = +272\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n[e\u00b2 + 368e +33856] +289 + [a e +184a] +272 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e +33856 +289 + a e +184a +272 =0\n\nCombine constants:\n\n33856 +289 = 34145; 34145 +272=34417\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e +34417 + a e +184a =0\n\nGroup terms:\n\n[e\u00b2 + a e] +368e +34417 +184a =0\n\nAgain, from Equation1, e\u00b2 +a e = -561. Substitute that into above:\n\n-561 +368e +34417 +184a =0 \u21d2 368e + 34417 -561 +184a =0 \u21d2 368e + 33856 +184a =0\n\nSame as before! So this gives the same equation as before: 368e + 33856 +184a =0 \u21d2 2e +a = -184 \u21d2 a= -184 -2e\n\nThen plug into Equation1 (for this case):\n\ne\u00b2 +a e +561 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + (-184 -2e)e +561 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -184e -2e\u00b2 +561 =0 \u21d2 -e\u00b2 -184e +561=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184e -561=0\n\nSo quadratic equation here is e\u00b2 +184e -561 =0\n\nCompute discriminant D= (184)^2 +4*1*561=33856 +2244=36100\n\nAh! 36100 is a perfect square, since 190^2 = 36100. So sqrt(36100)=190.\n\nTherefore, solutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1190]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\ne = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3\n\ne = (-184 -190)/2 = -374/2 =-187\n\nNow, since in our assumption here, points are arranged such that E is on the x-axis between D (0,0) and C (107,0). So E must have coordinate e between 0 and107. The solutions are e=3 and e=-187. \n\nDiscarding e=-187 because that would place E far to the left of D (0,0), which may not align with the collinear points D,E,C,F unless the order is different. Let's check e=3.\n\nSo e=3. That is, point E is at (3,0). Then, since EF is length 184 along the x-axis, F is at (3 +184,0)= (187,0).",

Let me subtract that equation multiplied by 1 from the above equation:\n\n[e\u00b2 + (368 +a)e +33873 +184a] - [e\u00b2 +a e +17] =0 -0\n\nThis gives:\n\n368e +33873 -17 +184a =0 \u21d2 368e +184a + 33856 =0 \u21d2\n\nDivide both sides by 184:\n\n2e +a +184 =0 \u21d2 2e +a = -184 (same as equation 3 before).\n\nSo from here, a = -184 -2e.\n\nSubstituting back into equation from H:\n\ne\u00b2 + a e +17 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + (-184 -2e)e +17 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -184e -2e\u00b2 +17 =0 \u21d2 -e\u00b2 -184e +17 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSame quadratic as before.

Let me check 184\u00b2 is 33856, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68). That doesn't simplify. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup?",

Rectangle EFGH with E(e,0), F(f,0), and since FG=17, which would be the vertical side downward, so G(f, -17) and H(e, -17). \n\nThen the four points on the circle are A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,-17), G(f,-17).\n\nLet me plug these into the circle equation.\n\nAgain, general equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlug in D(0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 +F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + 256 +0 +16E +0 =0 \u21d2 256 +16E =0 \u21d2 E= -16.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -16y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + D e -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 + D e +272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + D e +561=0 (Equation 1)\n\nPlug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + D f -16*(-17)=0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +289 + D f +272=0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 + D f +561=0 (Equation 2)\n\nSo equations 1 and 2 give that e and f are roots of x\u00b2 + Dx +561=0. Therefore, e + f = -D, and e*f =561.\n\nAlso, the distance between E and F is |f - e|=184. So again, (f - e)^2 = (184)^2 \u21d2 (f + e)^2 -4ef = 184\u00b2 \u21d2 D\u00b2 -4*561 = 184\u00b2 \u21d2 D\u00b2 =184\u00b2 +4*561.\n\nCompute 4*561=2244, so D\u00b2 = 33856 +2244= 36100. \n\nAh! 36100 is 190 squared (since 190\u00b2=36100). Therefore, D=\u00b1190.\n\nTherefore, from e + f = -D \u21d2 e + f = \u2213190. But we also have e*f=561.\n\nSo now, we have two cases: D=190 or D=-190.\n\nLet me see:\n\nCase 1: D=190. Then e + f = -190. And e*f=561.\n\nCase 2: D= -190. Then e + f=190. And e*f=561.\n\nNow, let's see which case is possible given the distance between E and F is 184.\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: D=190 \u21d2 e + f = -190, e*f=561.\n\nThen, (f - e)^2 = (f + e)^2 -4ef = (-190)^2 -4*561 = 36100 -2244= 33856. Which is exactly 184\u00b2 (since 184\u00b2=33856). Perfect, so this works. So in this case, the difference f -e is sqrt(33856)=184. But since e + f =-190, the difference squared gives us that the distance is 184. So this case is valid.\n\nCase 2: D= -190 \u21d2 e + f=190, e*f=561.\n\nThen (f -e)^2 =190\u00b2 -4*561=36100 -2244=33856=184\u00b2. So also valid. So both cases are possible.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase1: e + f = -190, e*f=561, with |f - e|=184.\n\nCase2: e + f =190, e*f=561, with |f -e|=184.\n\nLet me analyze both cases.\n\nFirst, let's check Case1: e + f =-190, e*f=561.\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 +190x +561=0 (since D=190, so x\u00b2 +Dx +561=0)",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps I made an incorrect assumption in the orientation of the rectangle. Let me double-check that.\n\nI assumed that the rectangle EFGH is above the x-axis, with G at (f,17) and H at (e,17). But maybe it's below the x-axis? Let's try that.\n\nIf the rectangle is below the x-axis, then G would be (f, -17) and H would be (e, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17) lie on a circle. Let me see if that could work. \n\nLet me try this scenario. So H is (e, -17), G is (f, -17). \n\nThen, using the same circle equation. Let me redo the circle equation with this assumption.\n\nThe four points are A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17).
