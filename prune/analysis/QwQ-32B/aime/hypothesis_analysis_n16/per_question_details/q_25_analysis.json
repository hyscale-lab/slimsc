The problem gives numbers for exactly two, exactly three, and presumably exactly four, but maybe the rest have exactly one (i.e., only candy hearts). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234. Then the total population is a + b + c + d = 900. So a = 900 - 437 - 234 - d = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d. Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x = number of people with exactly C and D only (so part of the b group)\n- y = number with exactly C and G only\n- z = number with exactly C and S only\n\nThen x + y + z = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items (c = 234) can be broken down into three categories:\n\n- a = number with C, D, G only\n- b = number with C, D, S only\n- c = number with C, G, S only",

So a + b + c is the number of people with exactly two items. \n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items would be the sum of d + e + f. Each of these is two of D, G, S plus C, so exactly three items in total. \n\nThe number of people with all four items is g. \n\nAdditionally, there might be people who have only C. Let me call that h. So h is the number of people who own only candy hearts and none of the other three items. \n\nTherefore, the total population is h + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900. \n\nWe know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items), d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items).

So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.

          "text1": "Wait, actually, if someone only has candy hearts and nothing else, that would be exactly one item? But the problem didn't mention that. The problem gives numbers for exactly two, exactly three, and presumably exactly four, but maybe the rest have exactly one (i.e., only candy hearts). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234. Then the total population is a + b + c + d = 900. So a = 900 - 437 - 234 - d = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d. Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x = number of people with exactly C and D only (so part of the b group)\n- y = number with exactly C and G only\n- z = number with exactly C and S only\n\nThen x + y + z = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items (c = 234) can be broken down into three categories:\n\n- a = number with C, D, G only\n- b = number with C, D, S only\n- c = number with C, G, S only",
          "text2": "Wait, hold on. If a is only D plus C, then a would be D and C only, so exactly two items (C and D). Similarly, b is G and C only, exactly two items, and c is S and C only. So a + b + c is the number of people with exactly two items. \n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items would be the sum of d + e + f. Each of these is two of D, G, S plus C, so exactly three items in total. \n\nThe number of people with all four items is g. \n\nAdditionally, there might be people who have only C. Let me call that h. So h is the number of people who own only candy hearts and none of the other three items. \n\nTherefore, the total population is h + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900. \n\nWe know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items), d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items). So substituting:\n\nh + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \u21d2 h + g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. \n\nSo h + g = 229. \n\nNow, we also know the total number of people who own each item. Let's look at the counts for D, G, S.\n\nFor D: the number of people who own D is a (only D and C) + d (D and G but not S) + e (D and S but not G) + g (all three D, G, S) plus those who have D and all four (which is g).",

Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234.

Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.

Since everyone owns C, the only people not in any of D, G, S are the ones who own only C, which is A =229 -x. \n\nThe total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is 900 - A = 900 - (229 -x)= 671 +x.\n\nBut also, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S can be calculated via inclusion-exclusion for those three sets:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229S|.\n\nBut here, the intersections are over D, G, S.

Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234. Then the total population is a + b + c + d = 900. So a = 900 - 437 - 234 - d = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d. Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x = number of people with exactly C and D only (so part of the b group)\n- y = number with exactly C and G only\n- z = number with exactly C and S only\n\nThen x + y + z = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items (c = 234) can be broken down into three categories:\n\n- a = number with C, D, G only\n- b = number with C, D, S only\n- c = number with C, G, S only",

So a + b + c is the number of people with exactly two items. \n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items would be the sum of d + e + f. Each of these is two of D, G, S plus C, so exactly three items in total. \n\nThe number of people with all four items is g. \n\nAdditionally, there might be people who have only C. Let me call that h. So h is the number of people who own only candy hearts and none of the other three items. \n\nTherefore, the total population is h + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = 900. \n\nWe know that a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items), d + e + f = 234 (exactly three items). So substituting:\n\nh + 437 + 234 + g = 900 \u21d2 h + g = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. \n\nSo h + g = 229. \n\nNow, we also know the total number of people who own each item.

Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234.

Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.

          "text1": "Wait, actually, if someone only has candy hearts and nothing else, that would be exactly one item? But the problem didn't mention that. The problem gives numbers for exactly two, exactly three, and presumably exactly four, but maybe the rest have exactly one (i.e., only candy hearts). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234. Then the total population is a + b + c + d = 900. So a = 900 - 437 - 234 - d = 900 - 671 - d = 229 - d. Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x = number of people with exactly C and D only (so part of the b group)\n- y = number with exactly C and G only\n- z = number with exactly C and S only\n\nThen x + y + z = b = 437.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people with exactly three items (c = 234) can be broken down into three categories:\n\n- a = number with C, D, G only\n- b = number with C, D, S only\n- c = number with C, G, S only",

The problem gives numbers for exactly two, exactly three, and presumably exactly four, but maybe the rest have exactly one (i.e., only candy hearts). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the total population as 900. Let me let:\n\n- a = number of people who own exactly one item (only candy hearts)\n- b = number owning exactly two items (candy hearts + one other)\n- c = number owning exactly three items (candy hearts + two others)\n- d = number owning all four items (candy hearts + the other three)\n\nGiven that b = 437 and c = 234.

Hmm, but we need another equation to relate these variables with the given numbers of people owning each item.\n\nThe problem states the number of people owning each of the other three items: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). Since everyone has candy hearts, the counts for each of these three items (D, G, S) are the number of people who own that item plus candy hearts. So for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is the number of people who have D and C, possibly with others. \n\nLet me think in terms of the variables a, b, c, d. Each person's items can be categorized as follows:\n\n- a people have only C.\n- b people have C plus one other (either D, G, or S). So these are split into three groups: C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.\n- c people have C plus two others, so combinations like C+D+G only, C+D+S only, C+G+S only.\n- d people have all four: C+D+G+S.\n\nNow, the total number of people who own a diamond ring (D) is equal to the number of people who have D plus C (regardless of the other items). So that would include:\n\n- Those who have only C+D (part of the b group)\n- Those who have C+D+G (part of c group)\n- Those who have C+D+S (another part of c group)\n- Those who have all four (d)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, the total number of D owners is:\n\n(Number of C+D only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + d = 195.\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\n(Number of C+G only) + (Number of C+D+G only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 367.\n\nAnd for S:\n\n(Number of C+S only) + (Number of C+D+S only) + (Number of C+G+S only) + d = 562.\n\nBut since the total number of people with exactly two items (b = 437) is the sum of C+D only, C+G only, C+S only.
