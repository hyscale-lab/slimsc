Let me check:\n\nAfter a quick recall, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is indeed OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, if that's the case, then in our problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, so that gives us the distance between O and I. But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nYes, because if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. So, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169. We already know OI\u00b2 =13, so IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156. Hence, IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, okay. So, IA squared is 156.\n\nTherefore, if I can express IA in terms of other triangle parameters, perhaps using the formula for the inradius or other relations, I can set up an equation.\n\nI recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by the formula:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 }",

So OI squared equals R squared minus twice R times r. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me verify that. For example, in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI is zero, and indeed R\u00b2 - 2Rr would be ( (a/(\u221a3))\u00b2 ) - 2*(a/\u221a3)*( (a\u221a3)/6 ) ). Let's see: R is a/(\u221a3), r is (a\u221a3)/6. Then R\u00b2 = a\u00b2/3, 2Rr = 2*(a/\u221a3)*(a\u221a3/6) = 2*(a\u00b2/6) = a\u00b2/3. So R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 0, which is correct. So that formula holds.\n\nTherefore, given that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. In this problem, R is 13, r is 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Let me see.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius is given by r = (\u0394)/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

Specifically, in triangle AIB, for example, but maybe more straightforward to recall the formula:\n\nIA = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me verify this. \n\nIn the incenter, the angle bisector of angle A divides it into two angles of measure A/2. Considering the right triangle formed by the inradius, half of the angle, and the distance IA. If we drop a perpendicular from I to side BC, that length is r. Then in the right triangle formed by I, the foot of the perpendicular, and vertex A, the angle at I is A/2, the opposite side is r, and the hypotenuse is IA. Therefore, sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems correct. So IA = r / sin(A/2). \n\nGiven that IA is sqrt(156) as we found earlier, so sqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39), so sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 after rationalizing.

Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo s - a = 2\u221a30. Let me note that.\n\nNow, we need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30. Therefore, (b + c - a) = 4\u221a30. Hmm, so that's one equation.\n\nWe also know that the inradius r = 6, so r = \u0394/s \u21d2 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 = 6s, where \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlso, the circumradius R = 13, and the formula for circumradius is R = (a b c)/(4\u0394). So 13 = (a b c)/(4\u0394). Since \u0394 = 6s, substitute:\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 * 6 s) \u21d2 13 = (a b c)/(24 s) \u21d2 a b c = 24 * 13 s = 312 s. Hmm, so we have that.\n\nOur target is to find AB * AC, which is c * b. So if I can express bc in terms of other variables, maybe using these equations.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps using the Law of Sines? Since R is known. The Law of Sines says that a/(sin A) = 2R = 26, so sin A = a / 26. Similarly for other angles.",

Since we need to find AB * AC, which are sides c and b respectively (since in standard notation, AB is c, AC is b, BC is a).\n\nSo, we can now write a = 4\u221a30.\n\nWe also have from earlier that b + c - a = 4\u221a30. Substituting a = 4\u221a30,\n\nb + c - 4\u221a30 = 4\u221a30 \u21d2 b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nSo that's another equation: b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nAlso, the semiperimeter s is (a + b + c)/2. Since a + b + c = (a) + (b + c) = 4\u221a30 + 8\u221a30 = 12\u221a30.

Let me see. Let me try to express a in terms of b and c from equation 1. From equation 1:\n\na = b + c - 4\u221a30.\n\nSo substituting into s:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = ( (b + c -4\u221a30) + b + c ) / 2 = (2b + 2c -4\u221a30)/2 = b + c - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s = b + c - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s can be written in terms of b and c. Interesting.\n\nSo, s = b + c - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the semiperimeter is expressed in terms of b and c. Let me see.\n\nNow, equation 3: a b c = 312 s. Since a = b + c -4\u221a30, substitute that in:\n\n(b + c -4\u221a30) * b * c = 312 * s.\n\nBut s is equal to b + c -2\u221a30. Therefore,\n\n(b + c -4\u221a30) * b * c = 312*(b + c -2\u221a30).\n\nHmm, that's a big equation. Let me see if I can write this as:\n\nLet me denote for simplicity, let me set x = b + c, and y = bc. Then, since a = x -4\u221a30, s = x - 2\u221a30.\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\na b c = (x -4\u221a30) * y = 312*(x -2\u221a30).\n\nSo,\n\n(x -4\u221a30)y = 312(x -2\u221a30).\n\nHmm, so this is one equation involving x and y. But we need another equation to relate x and y.\n\nWe also have the area equation: Area = 6s = 6*(x -2\u221a30).\n\nBut the area can also be expressed using Heron's formula:\n\nArea = sqrt[s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ns = x -2\u221a30.\n\ns - a = (x -2\u221a30) - (x -4\u221a30) = 2\u221a30.\n\ns - b = (x -2\u221a30) - b = ( (b + c) - 2\u221a30 ) - b = c - 2\u221a30.\n\nSimilarly, s - c = b - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, Heron's formula gives:\n\nArea = sqrt[ (x -2\u221a30) * 2\u221a30 * (c -2\u221a30)*(b -2\u221a30) ]\n\nHmm, that's complicated. Let me see if I can express (c -2\u221a30)*(b -2\u221a30).\n\nLet me compute (b -2\u221a30)(c -2\u221a30) = bc -2\u221a30(b + c) + (2\u221a30)^2 = y - 2\u221a30 x + 4*30 = y - 2\u221a30 x + 120.\n\nTherefore, the area squared is:\n\n[ (x -2\u221a30) * 2\u221a30 * (y - 2\u221a30 x + 120) ]\n\nSo,\n\nArea\u00b2 = (x -2\u221a30)*(2\u221a30)*(y -2\u221a30 x + 120).\n\nBut we also know Area = 6(x -2\u221a30), so Area squared is 36(x -2\u221a30)^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n36(x -2\u221a30)^2 = (x -2\u221a30)*(2\u221a30)*(y -2\u221a30 x + 120).\n\nWe can divide both sides by (x -2\u221a30), assuming it's non-zero, which it is because semiperimeter can't be zero.\n\nSo:\n\n36(x -2\u221a30) = 2\u221a30*(y -2\u221a30 x + 120).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n18(x -2\u221a30) = \u221a30*(y -2\u221a30 x + 120).\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n\u221a30*y - \u221a30*(2\u221a30 x) + \u221a30*120\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\u221a30*y - (2*30)x + 120\u221a30\n\nSo:\n\n\u221a30*y -60x + 120\u221a30\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n18x - 36\u221a30 = \u221a30 y -60x + 120\u221a30.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n18x -36\u221a30 - \u221a30 y +60x -120\u221a30 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(18x +60x) + (-36\u221a30 -120\u221a30) - \u221a30 y =0\n\n78x - 156\u221a30 - \u221a30 y = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\u221a30 y =78x -156\u221a30.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (78x -156\u221a30)/\u221a30.\n\nLet me rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a30:\n\ny = [78x -156\u221a30] * \u221a30 / 30\n\n= [78x * \u221a30 - 156\u221a30 * \u221a30] /30\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n\u221a30 * \u221a30 =30, so:\n\n= [78x\u221a30 -156*30]/30\n\n= [78x\u221a30 - 4680]/30\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n78 is 6*13, 30 is 6*5.

Let me note that down:\n\nEquation A: y = (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nNow, let's recall the other equation we had from equation 3:\n\n(x -4\u221a30)y = 312(x -2\u221a30).\n\nWe can substitute y from equation A into this equation.\n\nSo,\n\n(x -4\u221a30) [ (13/5)x\u221a30 -156 ] = 312(x -2\u221a30).\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's try expanding the left-hand side (LHS):\n\nFirst, let me write the terms:\n\nFirst term: (x -4\u221a30)*(13/5 x\u221a30) = (13/5)x\u221a30*(x) - (13/5)x\u221a30*4\u221a30\n\nSecond term: (x -4\u221a30)*(-156) = -156x + 156*4\u221a30\n\nSo, compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nFirst term of first product:\n\n(13/5)x\u221a30 * x = (13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30\n\nSecond term of first product:\n\n- (13/5)x\u221a30 *4\u221a30 = - (13/5)*4*x*(\u221a30)^2 = - (52/5)x*(30) = - (52*30)/5 x = - (1560)/5 x = -312x\n\nSecond part:\n\nSecond product terms:\n\n-156x + 156*4\u221a30 = -156x + 624\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms, the left-hand side is:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -312x -156x + 624\u221a30\n\nSimplify:\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n-312x -156x = -468x\n\nSo,\n\nLHS = (13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x + 624\u221a30\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is 312(x -2\u221a30) = 312x - 624\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, setting LHS = RHS:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x + 624\u221a30 = 312x - 624\u221a30.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x +624\u221a30 -312x +624\u221a30 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x terms: -468x -312x = -780x\n\nFor \u221a30 terms: 624\u221a30 +624\u221a30 = 1248\u221a30\n\nSo,\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -780x +1248\u221a30 =0\n\nLet me write this equation as:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5)x\u00b2 - 780x +1248\u221a30 =0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in x.

Maybe factor out common terms?\n\nLet me see if all coefficients have a common factor. Let me check coefficients:\n\n13\u221a30, 3900, 6240\u221a30.\n\nHmm, 13 is a prime number. Let's see:\n\n3900 divided by 13: 13*300 = 3900. So 3900 =13*300.\n\n6240 divided by 13: 13*480=6240.

Let me see if x can be 2\u221a30. Since in the semiperimeter s =x -2\u221a30, so if x=2\u221a30, then s=0, which is impossible. Therefore, the only feasible solution is x=8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, x =8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nNow, recall that equation A: y = (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nSubstituting x =8\u221a30:\n\ny = (13/5)*(8\u221a30)*\u221a30 -156.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, (8\u221a30)*(\u221a30)=8*(\u221a30)^2=8*30=240.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (13/5)*240 -156 = (13*48) -156 = 624 -156 =468.\n\nTherefore, y = bc =468.\n\nHence, the product AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b = y =468.",

Then, using the Law of Sines, we found a =4\u221a30, so plugging that into s gives s=6\u221a30. Then, substituting into the formula for abc=312 s gives abc=312*6\u221a30, and since a is 4\u221a30, so dividing gives bc = (312*6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)= (312*6)/4 = 312*(3/2)= 468.

Then, since s -a = ( -a + b + c)/2, so that gives b +c -a =4\u221a30, but since s = (a +b +c)/2, so s = a +2\u221a30, leading to s=6\u221a30 when a=4\u221a30.

Therefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. So, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169.

For example, in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI is zero, and indeed R\u00b2 - 2Rr would be ( (a/(\u221a3))\u00b2 ) - 2*(a/\u221a3)*( (a\u221a3)/6 ) ).

The inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Let me see.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the inradius is given by r = (\u0394)/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The distance from the incenter to vertex A can be found using trigonometric relations. Specifically, in triangle AIB, for example, but maybe more straightforward to recall the formula:\n\nIA = (r) / sin(A/2).

Then in the right triangle formed by I, the foot of the perpendicular, and vertex A, the angle at I is A/2, the opposite side is r, and the hypotenuse is IA. Therefore, sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems correct. So IA = r / sin(A/2). \n\nGiven that IA is sqrt(156) as we found earlier, so sqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39), so sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 after rationalizing.

Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo s - a = 2\u221a30. Let me note that.\n\nNow, we need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

Let me think.\n\nIf we consider the angle bisector of angle A, then in the triangle, the inradius r is related to the angle bisector.

From equation 1:\n\na = b + c - 4\u221a30.\n\nSo substituting into s:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = ( (b + c -4\u221a30) + b + c ) / 2 = (2b + 2c -4\u221a30)/2 = b + c - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s = b + c - 2\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, s can be written in terms of b and c.

Since a = b + c -4\u221a30, substitute that in:\n\n(b + c -4\u221a30) * b * c = 312 * s.\n\nBut s is equal to b + c -2\u221a30.

Let me note that down:\n\nEquation A: y = (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nNow, let's recall the other equation we had from equation 3:\n\n(x -4\u221a30)y = 312(x -2\u221a30).\n\nWe can substitute y from equation A into this equation.\n\nSo,\n\n(x -4\u221a30) [ (13/5)x\u221a30 -156 ] = 312(x -2\u221a30).\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's try expanding the left-hand side (LHS):\n\nFirst, let me write the terms:\n\nFirst term: (x -4\u221a30)*(13/5 x\u221a30) = (13/5)x\u221a30*(x) - (13/5)x\u221a30*4\u221a30\n\nSecond term: (x -4\u221a30)*(-156) = -156x + 156*4\u221a30\n\nSo, compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nFirst term of first product:\n\n(13/5)x\u221a30 * x = (13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30\n\nSecond term of first product:\n\n- (13/5)x\u221a30 *4\u221a30 = - (13/5)*4*x*(\u221a30)^2 = - (52/5)x*(30) = - (52*30)/5 x = - (1560)/5 x = -312x\n\nSecond part:\n\nSecond product terms:\n\n-156x + 156*4\u221a30 = -156x + 624\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms, the left-hand side is:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -312x -156x + 624\u221a30\n\nSimplify:\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\n-312x -156x = -468x\n\nSo,\n\nLHS = (13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x + 624\u221a30\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is 312(x -2\u221a30) = 312x - 624\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, setting LHS = RHS:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x + 624\u221a30 = 312x - 624\u221a30.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -468x +624\u221a30 -312x +624\u221a30 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor x terms: -468x -312x = -780x\n\nFor \u221a30 terms: 624\u221a30 +624\u221a30 = 1248\u221a30\n\nSo,\n\n(13/5)x\u00b2\u221a30 -780x +1248\u221a30 =0\n\nLet me write this equation as:\n\n(13\u221a30 /5)x\u00b2 - 780x +1248\u221a30 =0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in x. Let me see. Let me try to multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n13\u221a30 x\u00b2 - 3900x + 6240\u221a30 =0\n\nHmm, this is still quite messy. Maybe factor out common terms?\n\nLet me see if all coefficients have a common factor. Let me check coefficients:\n\n13\u221a30, 3900, 6240\u221a30.\n\nHmm, 13 is a prime number. Let's see:\n\n3900 divided by 13: 13*300 = 3900. So 3900 =13*300.\n\n6240 divided by 13: 13*480=6240. So 6240=13*480.\n\nTherefore, let me factor 13:\n\n13[ \u221a30 x\u00b2 - 300x + 480\u221a30 ] =0\n\nSo the equation reduces to:\n\n\u221a30 x\u00b2 - 300x + 480\u221a30 =0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\u221a30 x\u00b2 - 300x + 480\u221a30 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps divide both sides by \u221a30 to simplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - (300/\u221a30)x + 480 =0.\n\nSimplify the middle term:\n\n300/\u221a30 = 300/(\u221a30) = (300\u221a30)/30 =10\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 -10\u221a30 x + 480 =0.\n\nAh! That's much better. So quadratic equation in x:\n\nx\u00b2 -10\u221a30 x +480 =0.\n\nWe can solve for x using quadratic formula.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = (10\u221a30)^2 -4*1*480.\n\nCompute:\n\n(10\u221a30)^2 = 100*30 = 3000.\n\n4*1*480 = 1920\n\nTherefore, D = 3000 -1920 =1080.\n\nThen, sqrt(D)=sqrt(1080)=sqrt(36*30)=6*sqrt(30).\n\nThus, solutions are:\n\nx = [10\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30]/2 = [ (10\u221a30 \u00b16\u221a30) ] /2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nx = (10\u221a30 +6\u221a30)/2 =16\u221a30/2=8\u221a30,\n\nor x=(10\u221a30 -6\u221a30)/2 =4\u221a30/2=2\u221a30.\n\nHmm, so x is either 8\u221a30 or 2\u221a30.\n\nBut x is b + c. Let me see if x can be 2\u221a30. Since in the semiperimeter s =x -2\u221a30, so if x=2\u221a30, then s=0, which is impossible. Therefore, the only feasible solution is x=8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, x =8\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nNow, recall that equation A: y = (13/5)x\u221a30 -156.\n\nSubstituting x =8\u221a30:\n\ny = (13/5)*(8\u221a30)*\u221a30 -156.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, (8\u221a30)*(\u221a30)=8*(\u221a30)^2=8*30=240.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (13/5)*240 -156 = (13*48) -156 = 624 -156 =468.\n\nTherefore, y = bc =468.\n\nHence, the product AB\u00b7AC = c\u00b7b = y =468.",

Let me check the steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, we found that AI\u00b2 =156, which led us to (s -a)^2 =120, so s -a =2\u221a30. Then, since s = (a + b + c)/2, rearranged to get s = a + 2\u221a30. Then, using the Law of Sines, we found a =4\u221a30, so plugging that into s gives s=6\u221a30. Then, substituting into the formula for abc=312 s gives abc=312*6\u221a30, and since a is 4\u221a30, so dividing gives bc = (312*6\u221a30)/(4\u221a30)= (312*6)/4 = 312*(3/2)= 468.

Then, since s -a = ( -a + b + c)/2, so that gives b +c -a =4\u221a30, but since s = (a +b +c)/2, so s = a +2\u221a30, leading to s=6\u221a30 when a=4\u221a30. Then, with a=4\u221a30, bc= (312*s)/a = (312 *6\u221a30)/4\u221a30 = (312*6)/4= 468. All steps check out. So the answer should be 468.",

Let me check:\n\nAfter a quick recall, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is indeed OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, if that's the case, then in our problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, so that gives us the distance between O and I.

Therefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. So, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169.

For example, in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI is zero, and indeed R\u00b2 - 2Rr would be ( (a/(\u221a3))\u00b2 ) - 2*(a/\u221a3)*( (a\u221a3)/6 ) ). Let's see: R is a/(\u221a3), r is (a\u221a3)/6. Then R\u00b2 = a\u00b2/3, 2Rr = 2*(a/\u221a3)*(a\u221a3/6) = 2*(a\u00b2/6) = a\u00b2/3. So R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 0, which is correct.

Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo s - a = 2\u221a30. Let me note that.\n\nNow, we need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

So 13 = (a b c)/(4\u0394). Since \u0394 = 6s, substitute:\n\n13 = (a b c)/(4 * 6 s) \u21d2 13 = (a b c)/(24 s) \u21d2 a b c = 24 * 13 s = 312 s.

Hmm, but maybe it's better to keep it squared for now.\n\nSo (s - a)^2 = 120. Let me note that down. So s - a = sqrt(120), but actually, perhaps we can keep it as (s - a)^2 = 120 for now.\n\nOur goal is to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. Then, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So s - a = ( -a + b + c ) / 2. Therefore, (s - a)^2 = [ (b + c - a)/2 ]^2 = 120.\n\nSo, (b + c - a)^2 = 480. Hmm, but I don't know if that helps directly. Let me see.\n\nWe also know that the inradius r = 6 is related to the area and semiperimeter by r = area / s, so area = r * s = 6s.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula with the circumradius: area = (a b c)/(4 R). Since R is 13, area = (a b c)/(52). Therefore:\n\n6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, so that relates the product of the sides to the semiperimeter. But we need AB * AC, which is c * b.

Therefore, OI\u00b2 =13.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation from the right triangle AIO:\n\nAI\u00b2 + 13 = 169\n\nTherefore, AI\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156\n\nSo AI = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, if that's the case, then in our problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, so that gives us the distance between O and I. But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nYes, because if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. So, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169.

Let me see.\n\nSuppose we have the incenter I, and from I, the distance to side BC is r. The angle between the angle bisector and the side is A/2, so the distance IA would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg r and angle A/2. Therefore, IA = r / sin(A/2).

Let me confirm that. Since the inradius is the distance from I to each side, and in the angle bisector, the distance from I to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the angle at A. Let me think.\n\nIf we consider the angle bisector of angle A, then in the triangle, the inradius r is related to the angle bisector. The formula IA = r / sin(A/2) comes from considering the right triangle formed by I, the inradius, and the angle bisector. Let me visualize that. If we drop a perpendicular from I to side BC, that's the inradius r. The distance from I to A along the angle bisector would then form a right triangle where the angle at I is A/2, the opposite side is r, so the hypotenuse IA would be r / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, IA = r / sin(A/2). So we have IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore:\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)\n\nSolving for sin(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = 3 / (\u221a(13*3)) = 3 / (\u221a13 * \u221a3) ) = \u221a3 / \u221a13 = sqrt(3/13)\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13).

Let me check:\n\nAfter a quick recall, the formula for the distance between incenter and circumcenter is indeed OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, if that's the case, then in our problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, so that gives us the distance between O and I. But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nYes, because if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169. So, OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169. We already know OI\u00b2 =13, so IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156. Hence, IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, okay. So, IA squared is 156.\n\nTherefore, if I can express IA in terms of other triangle parameters, perhaps using the formula for the inradius or other relations, I can set up an equation.\n\nI recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by the formula:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2 }",

So OI squared equals R squared minus twice R times r. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me verify that. For example, in an equilateral triangle, O and I coincide, so OI is zero, and indeed R\u00b2 - 2Rr would be ( (a/(\u221a3))\u00b2 ) - 2*(a/\u221a3)*( (a\u221a3)/6 ) ). Let's see: R is a/(\u221a3), r is (a\u221a3)/6. Then R\u00b2 = a\u00b2/3, 2Rr = 2*(a/\u221a3)*(a\u221a3/6) = 2*(a\u00b2/6) = a\u00b2/3. So R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 0, which is correct. So that formula holds.\n\nTherefore, given that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. In this problem, R is 13, r is 6, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Let me verify this.\n\nYes, according to some sources, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = \u221a[r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2]. So since we have IA squared is 156, and r is 6, so:\n\nIA\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 = 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120) or -sqrt(120), but since s > a (as s is semiperimeter, so (a + b + c)/2 > a \u21d2 b + c > a), so s - a is positive. Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo s - a = 2\u221a30. Let me note that.\n\nNow, we need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. So s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30. Therefore, (b + c - a) = 4\u221a30. Hmm, so that's one equation.\n\nWe also know that the inradius r = 6, so r = \u0394/s \u21d2 6 = \u0394/s \u21d2 \u0394 = 6s, where \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlso, the circumradius R = 13, and the formula for circumradius is R = (a b c)/(4\u0394).

Hmm, but maybe it's better to keep it squared for now.\n\nSo (s - a)^2 = 120. Let me note that down. So s - a = sqrt(120), but actually, perhaps we can keep it as (s - a)^2 = 120 for now.\n\nOur goal is to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let a = BC, b = AC, c = AB.

Let me think.\n\nIf we consider the angle bisector of angle A, then in the triangle, the inradius r is related to the angle bisector. The formula IA = r / sin(A/2) comes from considering the right triangle formed by I, the inradius, and the angle bisector. Let me visualize that. If we drop a perpendicular from I to side BC, that's the inradius r. The distance from I to A along the angle bisector would then form a right triangle where the angle at I is A/2, the opposite side is r, so the hypotenuse IA would be r / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, IA = r / sin(A/2). So we have IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Earlier, we found IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

That's a good point. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OA is the hypotenuse, so OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nIA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OI\u00b2 =13\u00b2 - (\u221a13)^2 =169 -13=156,\n\nThus, IA=\u221a156=2\u221a39.\n\nSo, the length of IA is 2\u221a39. Now, perhaps we can relate IA to other elements.\n\nThe formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex: In general, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:\n\nIA = \u221a[r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 ]\n\nwhere r is inradius, s is semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite A (BC).",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r) =13(13 -12)=13*1=13, which matches what we had before. Also, given that IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps there is a relation in terms of angles. Let me think of triangle OIA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe know OA is the circumradius, so OA =13. OI we found is sqrt(13). Therefore,\n\n13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 =156 => IA = sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39).\n\nHmm, so IA is 2\u221a39. \n\nThere is a formula for the length of IA. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = \u221a(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 ), where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite A. \n\nYes, that formula is correct. Let me confirm: in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). So if that's the case, then IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe have IA\u00b2 =156, r=6, so 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 => 156 =36 + (s -a)^2 => (s -a)^2=120 => s -a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30). Hmm, but s is semiperimeter, so s=(a+b+c)/2. Therefore, s - a = (-a + b + c)/2. \n\nSo ( (-a + b + c)/2 )\u00b2 =120 => (-a + b + c)^2 = 480. \n\nHmm, okay, so that's one equation. Let's note that down: (-a + b + c)^2 =480.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps we can get equations from other vertices, but since we only have information about IA, maybe we need other relations. \n\nWe also know that the inradius r = area / s =6, so area =6s. \n\nThe area can also be expressed using the formula (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(52). Therefore,\n\n(a b c)/52 =6 s => a b c =312 s. \n\nHmm, so that's another equation. \n\nAdditionally, we can use the Law of Sines. Since the triangle is related to the circumradius R=13, so each side is 2R sin(angle). Specifically:\n\na = 2 R sin \u03b1 =26 sin \u03b1,\n\nb =26 sin \u03b2,\n\nc =26 sin \u03b3,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are the angles at vertices A, B, C respectively. Since angles sum to \u03c0, \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = \u03c0.\n\nBut not sure yet how to connect these equations.",
