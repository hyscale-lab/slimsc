Because the lottery is choosing 4 numbers, so to have exactly k matches, you need exactly k numbers from Jen's 4, and the rest from the other 6 numbers. Therefore, the number of ways is C(4, k)*C(6, 4 - k). Then, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4).\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly k matches is [C(4, k)*C(6, 4 -k)] / C(10,4). Therefore, the probability of at least two matches is the sum over k=2,3,4 of those terms.\n\nTherefore, P(B) = [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,3)C(6,1) + C(4,4)C(6,0)] / C(10,4).\n\nTherefore, once I compute that, then P(A|B) = [1 / C(10,4)] divided by [that sum / C(10,4)], so the denominators cancel, so it's 1 divided by [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,3)C(6,1) + C(4,4)C(6,0)]. Therefore, the probability is 1 divided by the sum of those terms. So I need to compute that sum.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute C(4,2)*C(6,2):\n\nC(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15 = 90.\n\nThen C(4,3)*C(6,1): C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6, so 4*6 = 24.\n\nThen C(4,4)*C(6,0): C(4,4) is 1, C(6,0) is 1, so 1*1 =1.\n\nAdding those together: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.\n\nTherefore, the numerator of P(B) is 115, and the denominator is C(10,4) which is 210.",

Because she has 4 numbers, so you choose k of her numbers to be in the winning, and the remaining 4 - k numbers must come from the remaining 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by her. So yes, that formula should work.\n\nTherefore, for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2), exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1), exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0).\n\nTherefore, P(B) = [C(4,2)C(6,2) + C(4,3)C(6,1) + C(4,4)C(6,0)] / C(10,4).",

Therefore, the number of ways is C(4, k)*C(6, 4 - k). Then, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4).\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly k matches is [C(4, k)*C(6, 4 -k)] / C(10,4).
