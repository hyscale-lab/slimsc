Let me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\na - (b + c) =1/2 --> equation 1\n\nb - (a + c) =1/3 --> equation 2\n\nc - (a + b) =1/4 --> equation3\n\nSo now we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n1. a - b - c =1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c =1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c =1/4\n\nNow, we can solve this system. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c =1/2\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c =1/3\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c =1/4\n\nLet me add all three equations together:\n\n(a - b -c) + (-a + b -c) + (-a -b +c) = 1/2 +1/3 +1/4\n\nLeft side:\n\na -a -a + (-b +b -b) + (-c -c +c) = (-a) + (-b) + (-c)\n\nSo left side: - (a + b + c)\n\nRight side: 1/2 +1/3 +1/4. Let me compute that:\n\nConvert to 12 denominator:\n\n6/12 +4/12 +3/12 =13/12\n\nThus,\n\n- (a + b + c) =13/12 \u2192 a + b + c = -13/12\n\nHmm, so sum of a, b, c is -13/12.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find each variable.\n\nLet me see equation1: a - (b + c) =1/2.\n\nBut since a + b + c = -13/12, then b + c = -13/12 -a\n\nSubstitute into equation1:\n\na - (-13/12 -a) =1/2 \u2192 a +13/12 +a =1/2 \u2192 2a +13/12 =1/2\n\n2a =1/2 -13/12 = (6/12 -13/12)= -7/12 \u2192 a= -7/24\n\nSimilarly, do the same for equation2.\n\nEquation2: -a + b -c=1/3\n\nAgain, from a + b +c = -13/12, so -a - b -c=13/12. Hmm, maybe express b -c?",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps instead of working with variables, let me set variables in terms of logarithms. Let me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z.

In terms of a, b, c:\n\na - (b + c) = 1/2\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) =1/3, so log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z)=1/3, so:\n\nb - (a + c) =1/3\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4, so log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) =1/4, so:\n\nc - (a + b) =1/4\n\nSo now we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.

Let me write them in standard form:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c = 1/2  \nEquation2: -a + b - c = 1/3  \nEquation3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo now, three equations with three variables. Let's see how to solve this. Maybe adding equations?\n\nLet me try adding all three equations together. Let's see:\n\nLeft sides: (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c)  \n= a - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c  \nCombine like terms:\n\na -a -a = -a  \n-b + b - b = -b  \n-c -c + c = -c  \nTotal: -a - b - c\n\nRight sides: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that:\n\nConvert to twelfths: 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12\n\nSo the sum of all three equations gives:\n\n- (a + b + c) = 13/12  \nThus,\n\na + b + c = -13/12\n\nHmm, interesting. So the sum of a, b, c is -13/12. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find each variable by combining equations. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's denote S = a + b + c = -13/12\n\nNow, let's see if we can express each equation in terms of S.\n\nLooking at Equation1: a - (b + c) = 1/2  \nBut since b + c = S - a, substitute:\n\na - (S - a) = 1/2  \na - S + a = 1/2  \n2a - S = 1/2  \nSimilarly, since S is known, we can write 2a = 1/2 + S  \n=> a = (1/2 + S)/2  \n= (1/2 + (-13/12))/2  \nCompute that: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -13/12 = -7/12.

So maybe if I can find log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z, then I can compute this linear combination. That might be a good approach.\n\nLet me denote a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then, since logarithm is a function here, converting the given equations into terms of a, b, c might be helpful.\n\nSo let me try that substitution. Let me set:\n\nLet a = log\u2082x, so x = 2^a,\n\nSimilarly, b = log\u2082y, so y = 2^b,\n\nand c = log\u2082z, so z = 2^c.\n\nThen, substituting into the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x/(y z)) = log\u2082(2^a / (2^b * 2^c)) = log\u2082(2^{a - (b + c)}) = a - b - c = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y/(x z)) = log\u2082(2^b / (2^a * 2^c)) = log\u2082(2^{b - (a + c)}) = b - a - c = 1/3.\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z/(x y)) = log\u2082(2^c / (2^a * 2^b)) = log\u2082(2^{c - (a + b)}) = c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, converting all equations into linear equations in terms of a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nAh, this seems manageable.

So substituting:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (2^(1/12) y) * y\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, combine the exponents of 2:\n\n1/4 + 1/12 = 3/12 +1/12 =4/12 =1/3. So 2^(1/3) multiplied by y * y = y\u00b2\n\nThus, RHS is 2^(1/3) * y\u00b2\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y\u00b2\n\nSolve for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) because 1/3 is 4/12.\n\nSo exponent: -5/12 -4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4) \u2192 y = 2^(-3/8) since y is positive.\n\nAlright, so now we have y = 2^(-3/8). Then, from Equation 4: x = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8).\n\nLet me compute the exponent:\n\n1/12 - 3/8. Let's convert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24.\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo now we have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).",

Let's see:\n\nEquation (3): z = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nAgain, substituting x from equation (1):\n\nx = y z * 2^(1/2), so:\n\nz = ( y z * 2^(1/2) ) * y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\nz = y\u00b2 z * 2^(1/2 + 1/4)\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4, so 2^(3/4)\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nz = y\u00b2 z * 2^(3/4)\n\nDivide both sides by z (since z is positive, can do that):\n\n1 = y\u00b2 * 2^(3/4)\n\nThus, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8)\n\nOkay, so now we have z and y in terms of exponents of 2.

When multiplying exponents with the same base, add the exponents:\n\n-3/8 + (-5/12) = Let's find a common denominator. 24?\n\n-3/8 = -9/24, -5/12 = -10/24. So total is -19/24.\n\nTherefore, the bracket term is 2^(-19/24). Then multiply by 2^(1/2):\n\nAdding exponents: -19/24 + 1/2 = -19/24 + 12/24 = -7/24\n\nThus, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo, now we have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)",

Great, so the values are correct.\n\nTherefore, a = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|. Let's compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Since logarithm of a product is sum of logs:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082x\u2074 + log\u2082y\u00b3 + log\u2082z\u00b2 = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nWhich is 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n4a + 3b + 2c = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6,\n\nSecond term: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\nThird term: 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nSo sum all three terms:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me find a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common denominator is 24.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -75/24.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is | -75/24 | = 75/24.\n\nBut the problem says \"the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| is m/n where m and n are coprime...\", so we need to simplify 75/24.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f73=25, 24 \u00f73=8. So 25/8. Since 25 and 8 have no common divisors besides 1, so m=25, n=8. Therefore m + n = 25 +8 =33.",
