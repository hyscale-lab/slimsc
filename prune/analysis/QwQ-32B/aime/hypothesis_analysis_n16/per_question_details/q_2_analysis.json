Let me denote equation 1 as:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand equation 2 as:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y in terms of x, or vice versa.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\ny = x*(sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) * ( sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 ) = x*( sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 )\n\nSo y = x tan\u00b3\u03b8,\n\nsince tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8, so tan\u00b3\u03b8 = sin\u00b3\u03b8/cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, from equation 2, we have y = x tan\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nNow substitute this into equation 1:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + (x tan\u00b3\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: x/cos\u03b8,\n\nSecond term: x tan\u00b3\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 = x*( sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 ) / sin\u03b8 = x*( sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 )\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nx/cos\u03b8 + x sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1.\n\nFactor out x / cos\u00b3\u03b8:\n\nx / cos\u00b3\u03b8 [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] =1.\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\nTherefore:\n\nx / cos\u00b3\u03b8 =1,\n\nThus,\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\nand since y = x tan\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = cos\u00b3\u03b8 * tan\u00b3\u03b8 = cos\u00b3\u03b8*(sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8) = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the envelope is parametrized by \u03b8 as (x,y) = ( cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8 ). \n\nTherefore, the envelope is the astroid curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, but wait, actually, parametrizing as (cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8) gives the astroid? Let me confirm:\n\nIf x = cos^3\u03b8, y = sin^3\u03b8,\n\nthen x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1. Yes, so the envelope is indeed the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nTherefore, the family of lines PQ (the segments of unit length from x-axis to y-axis) have an envelope which is the astroid. \n\nTherefore, the astroid is the curve tangent to each of these PQ segments. \n\nTherefore, points on the astroid lie on exactly one such segment PQ (the one they are tangent to). \n\nTherefore, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any PQ except AB. \n\nSince the astroid is the envelope, the points on the astroid lie on exactly one PQ (the tangent one). Therefore, if point C is on both AB and the astroid, then it would lie only on AB (since AB is also a member of the family F, and the astroid gives that it's only on that one PQ). \n\nTherefore, the point C must be the intersection point of AB and the astroid, other than A and B. Since A and B are on both AB and the astroid (since A is (1/2, 0): plug into astroid equation: ( (1/2)^(2/3) ) + 0 = (1/2)^(2/3). But 1/2 is (2^{-1}), so (2^{-1})^(2/3) = 2^{-2/3} \u2248 0.63, which is not 1.",

Let me recall that method.\n\nLet me consider the family of lines as F(a,b) = (x/a) + (y/b) -1 =0, with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.

Then \u03b8 is from 0 to \u03c0/2, since a and b are positive (they are coordinates on x and y axes in first quadrant). \n\nTherefore, the lines can be written as (x/cos\u03b8) + (y/sin\u03b8) =1, where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nSo, the envelope of these lines can be found by taking the derivative of F(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8 and setting it to zero.\n\nLet me write F(\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we take the partial derivative of F with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y*(-cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nTherefore, the envelope condition is:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2) x*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, then eliminate \u03b8 to get the envelope equation.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nSo,\n\nx/y = [ (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [ (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 ] = (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) * (cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 ) = (cos\u00b3\u03b8)/(sin\u00b3\u03b8)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx/y = (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)^3,\n\nLet me denote t = cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 = cot\u03b8,\n\nThus, x/y = t^3,\n\nTherefore, x = y t^3.\n\nAlso from equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nLet me express cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t.\n\nSince t = cot\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8,\n\nLet me set sin\u03b8 = s, so cos\u03b8 = t s,\n\nThen since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 s\u00b2 =1,\n\ns\u00b2(1 + t\u00b2)=1,\n\ns = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nTherefore,\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nNow, substitute into equation 1:\n\nx / ( t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y / (1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1,\n\nWhich is,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1,\n\nFactor sqrt(1 + t\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/t + y ] =1,\n\nBut from earlier, x = y t^3,\n\nSo substitute x = y t^3:\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ (y t^3)/t + y ] = sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ y t\u00b2 + y ] = sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) * y (t\u00b2 +1 ) = y sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 =1,\n\nSo,\n\ny = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 ]\n\nBut also, since x = y t^3,\n\nx = [1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 ] * t^3 = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nSo, now we have x and y in terms of t. Let me write them as:\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\ny = 1 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can parametrize this envelope in terms of t.",

Let me see as \u03b8 approaches 0+, cos\u03b8 approaches 1, sin\u03b8 approaches 0, so the second term blows up to infinity. Similarly, as \u03b8 approaches \u03c0/2-, cos\u03b8 approaches 0, so the first term blows up. Therefore, the function f(\u03b8) tends to infinity at both ends. Therefore, if it has a minimum at \u03b8=\u03c0/3 where f(\u03b8)=2, that would mean that 2 is the minimum value, so the equation f(\u03b8)=2 would have exactly one solution at \u03b8=\u03c0/3.

So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So C is only on AB among all the segments in F. And we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nWe have to find such a point C on AB. Since AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me parametrize AB. Let me write the parametric equations for AB. Since it's a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1. Since C is distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1, not including the endpoints.\n\nWe need to find such a point C (i.e., find t) such that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. That means, for any other segment PQ in F (not AB itself), C is not on PQ. So, to rephrase, if we suppose that C is on some PQ in F, then that PQ must be AB. Therefore, for the point C, the only unit segment from the x-axis to the y-axis passing through C is AB. All other unit segments passing through C must not exist.

Each segment PQ is of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between them is 1.

Then \u03b8 is from 0 to \u03c0/2, since a and b are positive (they are coordinates on x and y axes in first quadrant). \n\nTherefore, the lines can be written as (x/cos\u03b8) + (y/sin\u03b8) =1, where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2).\n\nSo, the envelope of these lines can be found by taking the derivative of F(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8 and setting it to zero.\n\nLet me write F(\u03b8) = x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nTo find the envelope, we take the partial derivative of F with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\ndF/d\u03b8 = x*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y*(-cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nTherefore, the envelope condition is:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2) x*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, then eliminate \u03b8 to get the envelope equation.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx*(sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y*(cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nSo,\n\nx/y = [ (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [ (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 ] = (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8) * (cos\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 ) = (cos\u00b3\u03b8)/(sin\u00b3\u03b8)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx/y = (cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8)^3,\n\nLet me denote t = cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 = cot\u03b8,\n\nThus, x/y = t^3,\n\nTherefore, x = y t^3.\n\nAlso from equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nLet me express cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t.\n\nSince t = cot\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8,\n\nLet me set sin\u03b8 = s, so cos\u03b8 = t s,\n\nThen since sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\ns\u00b2 + t\u00b2 s\u00b2 =1,\n\ns\u00b2(1 + t\u00b2)=1,\n\ns = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nTherefore,\n\nsin\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\ncos\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nNow, substitute into equation 1:\n\nx / ( t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) + y / (1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1,\n\nWhich is,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1,\n\nFactor sqrt(1 + t\u00b2):\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ x/t + y ] =1,\n\nBut from earlier, x = y t^3,\n\nSo substitute x = y t^3:\n\nsqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ (y t^3)/t + y ] = sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) [ y t\u00b2 + y ] = sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) * y (t\u00b2 +1 ) = y sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 =1,\n\nSo,\n\ny = 1 / [ sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 ]\n\nBut also, since x = y t^3,\n\nx = [1 / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)^3 ] * t^3 = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nSo, now we have x and y in terms of t. Let me write them as:\n\nx = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\ny = 1 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can parametrize this envelope in terms of t.",

So that's the setup.\n\nNow, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ is a unit-length segment starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. So for example, if P is (a, 0) on the x-axis, then Q must be (0, b) such that the distance from (a,0) to (0,b) is 1. So the equation would be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1, so a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. So all such segments PQ are the line segments between (a,0) and (0,b) where a and b satisfy a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, with a \u2265 0 and b \u2265 0 since they are in the first quadrant.\n\nSo the family F is all those unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Now, the problem states there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any segment from F except AB itself. So, in other words, C is a point on AB such that the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. All other segments in F that pass through C must be excluded except AB. So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So C is only on AB among all the segments in F. And we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.\n\nWe have to find such a point C on AB. Since AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me parametrize AB. Let me write the parametric equations for AB. Since it's a line from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. So when t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1. Since C is distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1, not including the endpoints.\n\nWe need to find such a point C (i.e., find t) such that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. That means, for any other segment PQ in F (not AB itself), C is not on PQ. So, to rephrase, if we suppose that C is on some PQ in F, then that PQ must be AB. Therefore, for the point C, the only unit segment from the x-axis to the y-axis passing through C is AB. All other unit segments passing through C must not exist. Hence, C must be such that any unit segment PQ (other than AB) that passes through C would have to not be in F?",

So triangle OAB is a right-angled triangle at O with legs 1/2 and sqrt(3)/2, hypotenuse 1. So angle at A and B? Hmm, maybe not important right now.\n\nThe problem says that there is a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that is not on any segment from family F except AB itself. So all other segments in F don't pass through C except AB. So C is sort of an excluded point from all other segments in F. We need to find OC squared.\n\nFirst, let me understand the family F. Each segment PQ is of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between them is 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. Therefore, all such segments PQ are the line segments from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are non-negative and satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Maybe the point (x,y) lies such that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 =1 at (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Because if the line is tangent to the circle at that point, then that would be the only solution. \n\nThat seems promising. Let me check that idea.\n\nIf the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the circle p^2 + q^2=1 at the point (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), then the condition for tangency would give us the point (x,y). Let me see.\n\nThe tangent line to the circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 at point (p\u2080, q\u2080) is given by p*p\u2080 + q*q\u2080 =1.",

Yes, so that's good. \n\nTherefore, the segment AB is exactly the case when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, for point C (on AB) to not lie on any other PQ except AB, the equations:\n\nx_C/p + y_C/q =1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have only the solution p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, the system must have only that solution. \n\nBut for a general point C on AB, the equations would have other solutions unless the system is set up so that only that solution exists. \n\nTherefore, substituting y_C from AB into the first equation gives us an equation in p and q.
