So C is not on any other PQ segment except AB. So we need to find such a point C on AB (other than A and B) which is not on any other PQ in F. \n\nWe have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, then express it as a fraction and add numerator and denominator. \n\nAlright, so how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, let's parametrize the segment AB. Since points A and B are given, we can write the parametric equations for AB. Let me think. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So a parametric equation for AB can be written as starting at A when t = 0 and moving towards B as t increases. Let me define a parameter t where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nSo, coordinates of a general point C on AB can be expressed as:\n\nx = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n\ny = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t\n\nSo, when t = 0, we get A (1/2, 0), and when t = 1, we get B (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, every other segment in F that passes through C must coincide with AB? Or rather, the point C is only on AB and no other segments from F.

Then the equation of the line PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1. So, for each angle \u03b8 between 0 and \u03c0/2, we have a line PQ with intercepts (cos\u03b8,0) and (0, sin\u03b8).
