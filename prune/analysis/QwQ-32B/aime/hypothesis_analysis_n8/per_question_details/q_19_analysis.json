Which is indeed true. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, in this coordinate system, we can model the triangle such that A is at (0,0), I is at (d,0), O is at (d,h), with d\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 169.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. Since I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Therefore, in triangle AID, angle at D is right angle, so sin(A/2) = opposite over hypotenuse = ID / IA, so IA = ID / sin(A/2) = r / sin(A/2). So IA = r / sin(A/2). Therefore, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 / sin\u00b2(A/2).\n\nSo from the previous calculation, IA\u00b2 =156 = (6)^2 / sin\u00b2(A/2),\n\nSo 156 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2),\n\nso sin\u00b2(A/2) = 36 /156 = 3/13,\n\nso sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13),\n\nso cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13).\n\nTherefore, cos(A) = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13.\n\nSo angle A has cosine 7/13.

Also, the area can be expressed as (a b c)/(4R). Since R is known. Hmm, but maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me think again.\n\nWe know angle A/2, since we found sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Let's compute cos(A/2). Since sin\u00b2(A/2) + cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). \n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13). Then, using the double-angle formula, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13. So cos A = 7/13. Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (49/169)) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = 2\u221a30 /13.\n\nNow, going back to the Law of Sines, the sides: \n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) = 4\u221a30.",
