Therefore, the filled region is precisely the intersection of the non-empty rows and non-empty columns, and it must be filled completely with a single color C, which is the color of those rows and columns. The empty rows are those not in the chosen rows, and empty columns are those not in the chosen columns. The choice is: select a subset of rows (non-empty rows), a subset of columns (non-empty columns), and a color C (white or black), such that the intersection is filled with C, and this is a maximal arrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the color must be consistent: all non-empty rows must be color C, and all non-empty columns must be color C. Because if a non-empty row is color C1 and a non-empty column is color C2, then their intersection cell must be both C1 and C2, which is only possible if C1 = C2.

For example, if two different colorings result in the same set of white and black cells, would they be considered the same?

Maybe the rows and columns only need to have chips of the same color if they have chips. \n\nIn other words, a row without any chips doesn't need to have a color. Similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, a row can have no chips, and thus doesn't enforce any color on its columns. \n\nThis changes everything! \n\nPreviously, I assumed that if a row is colored, it must have all its cells filled. But actually, the problem states:\n\n\"all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\"\n\nThis means that in any row that has chips, all those chips must be the same color. Similarly for columns. But rows without chips don't impose any color on their columns, and vice versa. \n\nAh! This is a crucial misinterpretation earlier. \n\nTherefore, rows and columns can be partially filled, as long as the chips in a row are all the same color, and the chips in a column are all the same color. Additionally, the arrangement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating the color conditions. \n\nThis is a different problem! \n\nLet me re-analyze with this correct understanding:\n\nEach row can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color (if any).\n\nEach column can have 0 to 5 chips, all of the same color (if any).\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement is maximal: adding any chip would require that either the row or column would have conflicting colors. \n\nThis is a different scenario. \n\nSo, to model this, we can think of each row as being in one of three states: \n\n- White: all its chips are white (could be 1 to 5 chips),\n\n- Black: all its chips are black (could be 1 to 5 chips),\n\n- Empty: no chips.\n\nSimilarly for columns. \n\nHowever, the intersection of a white row and black column must not have any chips (since a chip there would have to be both colors). \n\nMoreover, the arrangement is maximal, so for any empty cell (i,j), there is no way to place a chip there without violating the color condition. \n\nTo place a chip of color C at (i,j), the row i must be either empty or already colored C, and similarly the column j must be empty or already colored C. \n\nBut since it's maximal, for every empty cell (i,j), either:\n\n- The row i is non-empty and its color \u2260 C,\n\n- Or the column j is non-empty and its color \u2260 C,\n\nfor both C in {white, black}.",

But what if we choose to leave some cells empty even if their row and column are both W? \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. \n\nThe problem states that the chips must be placed such that all chips in the same row and same column are the same color. It does NOT require that all cells in a row must be filled if the row is colored. \n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption that all intersections of W rows and columns must be filled is incorrect. \n\nOh no! This is a critical error. \n\nThe problem requires that the chips in a row are all the same color, but they don't have to fill the entire row. Similarly for columns. \n\nTherefore, my previous analysis is flawed because I assumed that whenever a row and column are both W, the cell must be filled, but in reality, you can choose to leave it empty. \n\nTherefore, the problem is more complicated. \n\nLet me start over with this in mind. \n\nThe problem requires:\n\n1.

Then, to color it white, we would need all its columns to be either uncolored or white. But any column in W_cols is already white, so that's okay, but columns in B_cols are black, so they conflict. Therefore, in order to color the uncolored row white, all columns in the row must not be in B_cols. But since the row is uncolored, it can intersect with B_cols columns, which are already black. Therefore, if the row has any column in B_cols, then coloring the row white would conflict with those columns. \n\nFor the arrangement to be maximal, we cannot color this row white without conflict, so there must be at least one column in B_cols that is in this row. Similarly, to color it black, there must be at least one column in W_cols in the row. \n\nTherefore, every uncolored row must have at least one column in W_cols and one column in B_cols. Therefore, preventing it from being colored either color. \n\nSimilarly, every uncolored column must have at least one row in W_rows and one row in B_rows. \n\nTherefore, the conditions for maximality are:\n\n1.

For every uncolored column, it intersects both W_rows and B_rows.\n\nThis ensures that you can't extend the white or black regions further. \n\nNow, to count the number of such maximal arrangements, we need to consider all possible choices of W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols satisfying these conditions. \n\nLet me see how to model this.\n\nFirst, note that the choice of W_rows, W_cols, B_rows, B_cols must satisfy:\n\n- W_rows and B_rows are disjoint subsets of the 5 rows.\n\n- W_cols and B_cols are disjoint subsets of the 5 columns.\n\nMoreover, the remaining rows (not in W_rows or B_rows) must each intersect both W_cols and B_cols.\n\nSimilarly, the remaining columns (not in W_cols or B_cols) must each intersect both W_rows and B_rows.\n\nLet me try to model this as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet R be the set of rows, with subsets W, B, U (Uncolored). Similarly, C the columns with subsets W', B', U'.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- W and B are disjoint (no row is both white and black).\n\n- W' and B' are disjoint.\n\n- For every row in U, it must intersect both W' and B' (i.e., the row has at least one column in W' and at least one in B').\n\n- For every column in U', it must intersect both W and B (i.e., the column has at least one row in W and at least one in B).\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement must be maximal, so these conditions must hold.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of 4-tuples (W, B, W', B') where:\n\n- W, B partition some subset of rows (leaving U),\n\n- W', B' partition some subset of columns (leaving U'),\n\n- The remaining rows (U) each meet W' and B',\n\n- The remaining columns (U') each meet W and B.\n\nBut this is still quite abstract.

Therefore, every row must be either white, black, or if it's unassigned, then all its cells must be blocked by columns being of different colors. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let me think of the grid as a matrix. Let\u2019s denote R_i as the color assigned to row i (could be W, B, or 0 for empty).

That means that for any cell that is empty (i.e., either R_i \u2260 C_j or one of them is 0), you cannot place a chip there. To ensure maximality, for every empty cell (i,j), there must be some reason why you can't place a chip there. The reason could be that either:\n\n1. The row's color is different from the column's color, so even if you wanted to put a chip there, the row and column would conflict. \n\n2.
