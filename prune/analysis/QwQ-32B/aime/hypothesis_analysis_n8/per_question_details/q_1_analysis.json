Let's compute that expression.\n\nFirst, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082x\u2074 + log\u2082y\u00b3 + log\u2082z\u00b2 =4 log\u2082x +3 log\u2082y +2 log\u2082z.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4a +3b +2c.\n\nSubstituting a, b, c:\n\n4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6.\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8.\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nSo adding them up:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8.",

Perfect, matches equation3.\n\nSo the solution is a=-7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nFirst, let's note that log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) can be written as 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z. Since log(ab) = log a + log b, and exponents can be pulled out.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c. Then we take the absolute value of that, and then find m/n where that fraction is reduced.\n\nGiven that a = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12,\n\nSo compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8 = - (2 + 9/8) = - (16/8 +9/8)= -25/8.\n\nSo total is -25/8. The absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nThus, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, which are coprime (since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1). So m +n =25 +8=33.",

Perfect, matches equation3.\n\nSo the solution is a=-7/24, b=-3/8, c=-5/12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nFirst, let's note that log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) can be written as 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z. Since log(ab) = log a + log b, and exponents can be pulled out.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4a +3b +2c. Then we take the absolute value of that, and then find m/n where that fraction is reduced.\n\nGiven that a = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12,\n\nSo compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with denominator 6:\n\n-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8 = - (2 + 9/8) = - (16/8 +9/8)= -25/8.\n\nSo total is -25/8. The absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.\n\nThus, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, which are coprime (since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1). So m +n =25 +8=33.",

So:\n\nx = 2^{1/12} * y\n\nTherefore, x = 2^{1/12} y. So we can write x in terms of y.

That's (2/6 + 3/6) = 5/6. So:\n\ny = 2^{5/6} * y z^2\n\nDivide both sides by y (since y is positive, so can't be zero):\n\n1 = 2^{5/6} z^2\n\nTherefore, z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\n\nThus, z = 2^{-5/12} (since z is positive)\n\nHmm, okay, so we found z.

Since we have z, maybe express x in terms of y or vice versa.\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} x y\n\nThus, x y = 2^{-5/12 - 1/4}\n\nCompute exponent: 1/4 is 3/12, so -5/12 - 3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3\n\nTherefore, x y = 2^{-2/3}\n\nSo x y = 2^{-2/3}\n\nAlso, from equation 1: x = 2^{1/2} y z.

So:\n\nx = 2^{1/12} * y\n\nTherefore, x = 2^{1/12} y. So we can write x in terms of y.
