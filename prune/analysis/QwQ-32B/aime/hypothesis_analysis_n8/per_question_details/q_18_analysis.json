So, for them to be perpendicular, this angle must be 90\u00b0, so 30*(k - m)=90 \u21d2 k - m = 3. So, the difference in steps must be 3. \n\nTherefore, if we have two chords from the same vertex with steps m and m+3, they form a right angle. Therefore, to form a rectangle, starting from a vertex, moving along step m, then turning 90\u00b0 (i.e., stepping m+3 from the new vertex), and so on, should form a rectangle.",
