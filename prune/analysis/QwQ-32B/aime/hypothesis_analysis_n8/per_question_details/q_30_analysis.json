The modulus is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}. Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Hmm, but we might need to keep track of the exact exponent.",

Hmm, so perhaps we can compute this product by relating it to the value of some polynomial evaluated at specific points. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have a polynomial \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\). Then the product over all roots of unity \\(w\\) of \\(f(w)\\) is equal to the product over \\(w^{13}=1\\) of \\(f(w)\\). There's a formula for such products. Let me recall that for a polynomial \\(P(x)\\), the product over its roots \\(r_i\\) of \\(f(r_i)\\) is the resultant of \\(P(x)\\) and \\(f(x)\\), but I might need to check.",
          "text2": "Wait, that might be the case. Let me think of it that way. Let me see: if the product is over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2). Since \u03c9^k are all the 13th roots of unity, then this is equivalent to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2x + x\u00b2), where x is each root. That might be a better way to think about it. So, the product is over all roots of x^13 -1 =0 of (2 - 2x +x\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, maybe I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. Remember that for a polynomial P(x), if we have all the roots, then the product over (x - a_i) is P(x). But here, the terms are (2 - 2x +x\u00b2), so perhaps I can write this as x\u00b2 - 2x +2.

But since \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root, the roots x would be \u03c9^0, \u03c9^1, ..., \u03c9^12.\n\nTherefore, the product is the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) where x ranges over all 13th roots of unity. Hmm, products over roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials. The cyclotomic polynomial \u03a6_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. Since 13 is prime, \u03a6_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, since all roots except 1 are primitive.\n\nBut in this problem, the product is over all 13th roots of unity (including 1), so maybe we can express the product as a certain evaluation of a polynomial?\n\nLet me think: suppose I have a polynomial P(x) = product_{x a 13th root of unity} (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2).

That seems manageable, but we need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first. Let me compute these terms.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), and the angle is 45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i *13*(\u03c0/4)}. Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) e^{-i \u03c0/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i *13*(\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^{13}. Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Hmm, but we might need to keep track of the exact exponent.",

Therefore, the total product is ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing this expression and then taking modulo 1000. \n\nSo now, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. Since 1 + i and 1 - i are complex conjugates, their 13th powers will also be conjugates. Let me compute (1 + i)^n first. \n\nNote that 1 + i can be written in polar form.
