Therefore, if D to E is x, and E to C is y, then x + y = DC =107. But then after C comes F, so CF would be another segment, so the total distance from D to F would be DE + EC + CF = x + y + CF = 107 + CF. \n\nBut we need to relate this to the other rectangle EFGH. Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help here. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet's set coordinate system. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB =107, BC=16, so if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is along the x-axis. Then, since AD=16, point A would be at (0,16), and point B at (107,16). \n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has FG=17 and EF=184. The points E and F are on the line that includes D, E, C, F. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line D-E-C-F is along the x-axis. Therefore, points E and F must also lie on the x-axis. Let me denote coordinates for E and F. Let me let E be at some point (a, 0), and F at (b, 0). Since the order is D(0,0), E(a,0), C(107,0), F(b,0), so the coordinates must satisfy 0 < a < 107 < b. \n\nNow, since EFGH is a rectangle, and F is one of its vertices, let's figure out the coordinates of G and H. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent. Since EF is 184 units long, and FG is 17 units. Since F is on the x-axis at (b,0), and EF is 184, we need to determine the direction of the rectangle. Since EF is a side, the direction from E to F is along the x-axis?",

Let me write the general equation of a circle passing through these two points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c = 0.\n\nSince D(0,0) is on the circle, substituting gives 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c =0.\n\nSo the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by =0.\n\nNow, point A(0,16) is on the circle. Substituting x=0, y=16:\n\n0 + (16)^2 + 0 + b*16 =0 => 256 +16b =0 => 16b = -256 => b = -16.\n\nSo now equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax -16y =0.\n\nNow, the other two points H(e,17) and G(f,17) must also lie on this circle.\n\nLet's substitute H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*e -16*(17) =0\n\nSimilarly, substitute G(f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*f -16*(17) =0\n\nTherefore, both equations must hold.\n\nSo let's write them:\n\nFor H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 =0\n\nSimplify: e\u00b2 + a e + (289 - 272) = e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0\n\nSimilarly, for G(f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 + 289 + a f - 272 =0\n\nSimplify: f\u00b2 + a f +17 =0\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0\n\n2) f\u00b2 + a f +17 =0\n\nSo both equations have the same constant term and same coefficients except for e and f. So subtracting them:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e +17) - (f\u00b2 + a f +17) =0 => e\u00b2 - f\u00b2 + a(e - f)=0\n\nFactor e\u00b2 - f\u00b2 = (e - f)(e + f), so:\n\n(e - f)(e + f) + a (e - f) =0\n\nFactor out (e - f):\n\n(e - f)(e + f + a)=0\n\nSince e \u2260 f (since E and F are different points), so (e - f) \u22600, so we have:\n\ne + f + a =0 => a = - (e + f)\n\nSo from this, we can express a in terms of e and f.
