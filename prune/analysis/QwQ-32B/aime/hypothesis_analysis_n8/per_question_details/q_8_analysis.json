Let me recall some algebraic identities.\n\nThe expression given is symmetric in a, b, c. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and let me denote P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Maybe I can express the given quadratic expression in terms of S, P, Q?\n\nLet me see. Let's consider the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. \n\nThis can be written as a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). \n\nAs before, since (b + c) = S - a, so substituting:\n\na\u00b2(S - a) + b\u00b2(S - b) + c\u00b2(S - c).\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= a\u00b2S - a\u00b3 + b\u00b2S - b\u00b3 + c\u00b2S - c\u00b3\n\n= S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3)\n\nSo, the given expression equals S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so if I can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S, P, Q, maybe that would help. Let me recall the formulas.\n\nFirst, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - 2P.\n\nSecond, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So that's S\u00b3 - 3S P + 3Q.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expression:\n\nS(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = S(S\u00b2 - 2P) - [S\u00b3 - 3S P + 3Q] \n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst term: S*(S\u00b2 - 2P) = S\u00b3 - 2 S P\n\nSecond term: minus [S\u00b3 - 3 S P + 3 Q] = -S\u00b3 + 3 S P - 3 Q\n\nAdding the two terms:\n\n(S\u00b3 - 2 S P) + (-S\u00b3 + 3 S P - 3 Q) = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b3) + (-2 S P + 3 S P) + (-3 Q) \n\nSimplifies to:\n\n(0) + (S P) - 3 Q = S P - 3 Q\n\nTherefore, the given expression is equal to S P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.\n\nWe know S = 300, so substituting S = 300:\n\n300 P - 3 Q = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100 P - Q = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, Q = 100 P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now we have expressions involving P and Q.

So maybe if we can express it in terms of the sum a + b + c, the sum of products ab + bc + ca, and the product abc?\n\nLet me try to express the given expression in terms of these symmetric sums. \n\nFirst, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. \n\nI need to see if the given expression can be written in terms of S, P, Q. Let me see:\n\nThe given expression is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nHmm, let me group terms:\n\n= a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSince a + b + c = S, then (b + c) = S - a, (a + c) = S - b, and (a + b) = S - c.\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the expression:\n\n= a\u00b2(S - a) + b\u00b2(S - b) + c\u00b2(S - c)\n\n= S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3)\n\nHmm, okay. So the expression is equal to S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3). \n\nNow, perhaps we can relate this to other symmetric sums. Let me recall that:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P\n\nAlso, the sum a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be expressed using the identity:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\n\nSo, substituting that into our previous expression:\n\nThe given expression becomes:\n\nS(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = S(S\u00b2 - 2P) - [S\u00b3 - 3S P + 3Q]\n\nLet me compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, expand S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2):\n\n= S*(S\u00b2 - 2P) = S\u00b3 - 2S P\n\nThen subtract (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3):\n\n= S\u00b3 - 2S P - [S\u00b3 - 3S P + 3Q]\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n\n= S\u00b3 - 2S P - S\u00b3 + 3S P - 3Q\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nS\u00b3 - S\u00b3 cancels out. Then -2S P + 3S P = S P, so we get S P - 3Q\n\nTherefore, the given expression simplifies to S*P - 3Q = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, putting all together, we have two equations:\n\n1. S = a + b + c = 300\n2. S*P - 3Q = 6,000,000\n\nWe need to find triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers satisfying these.\n\nGiven that S is fixed at 300, so equation 2 becomes:\n\n300 * P - 3Q = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100 * P - Q = 2,000,000\n\nSo, rearranged, we have:\n\nQ = 100 P - 2,000,000\n\nHmm, okay.

Since the variables can be in any order, so the number of permutations depends on whether any of the numbers are equal.\n\nIn this case, all three numbers are distinct (150,100,50), so each permutation is unique.

So actually, the solutions where one variable is zero are part of this arithmetic progression family when d=100. So those cases are included here.\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic progression solutions include the cases where one variable is zero (since when d=100, you get 200,100,0) and the case where all variables are equal (d=0). So all these cases are part of this family.\n\nTherefore, to count all such triples, we can think of all possible d such that variables are non-negative integers. Let me see:\n\nThe variables are 100 + d, 100, and 100 - d. To have all non-negative, we need 100 - d \u2265 0 \u21d2 d \u2264 100, and 100 + d can be up to 200, but since a, b, c are non-negative integers, d can be from 0 up to 100. However, d must be an integer because the variables are integers. So d can be 0,1,2,...,100. But for each d, the three numbers are (100 + d, 100, 100 - d). \n\nHowever, when d is an integer, then variables will be integers.

For d=1, (101,100,99), which is different from, say, d=2 (102,100,98), etc., up to d=100, which gives (200,100,0). \n\nBut note that when d=100, we get (200,100,0). Similarly, d=50 gives (150,100,50), which was our earlier example. So actually, the solutions we found earlier (the all-100s and the ones with a zero and the others 200 and 100) are part of this arithmetic progression family. Additionally, the triples like (150,100,50) are also part of this family. \n\nTherefore, all triples where the three numbers form an arithmetic progression centered at 100 (i.e., with middle term 100) will satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of such triples is the number of integers d from -100 to 100 such that all terms are non-negative. However, since d can be from -100 to 100, but when d is negative, it's equivalent to positive d with the first and last terms swapped.\n\nHowever, since we are counting ordered triples (a, b, c), then each d from -100 to 100 gives a unique ordered triple, except when d=0, which only gives one triple.",
