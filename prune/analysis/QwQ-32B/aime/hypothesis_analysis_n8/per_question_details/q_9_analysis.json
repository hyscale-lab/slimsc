          "text1": "Wait, original Equation A is 10 ln x = x ln y, so substituting a and b gives 10a = e^a * b.\n\nSimilarly, Equation B: 10 ln y = 4y ln x => 10b = 4 e^b * a.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n1. 10a = e^a * b. (Equation C)\n2. 10b = 4 e^b * a. (Equation D)\n\nHmm, so we have equations in terms of a and b. Let me see if I can relate them. Let's try to express one variable in terms of another. Let's solve Equation C for b:\n\nFrom Equation C: b = (10a)/e^a.\n\nThen plug this expression for b into Equation D:\n\n10*(10a / e^a) = 4 e^b * a.\n\nSimplify left side: 100a / e^a = 4 e^b * a.\n\nWe can divide both sides by a (assuming a \u2260 0, which is valid because x >1 implies a = ln x >0):\n\n100 / e^a = 4 e^b.\n\nThen, let's solve for e^b:\n\ne^b = (100)/(4 e^a) = 25 / e^a.\n\nSo e^b = 25 / e^a. Let's take natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nb = ln(25) - a.\n\nHmm, so that gives us a relationship between b and a: b = ln25 - a.\n\nBut from Equation C, we had b = (10a)/e^a. So substituting b from this new equation into that:\n\nln25 - a = (10a)/e^a.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving a only: ln25 - a = (10a)/e^a.\n\nThis looks complicated.

Let me choose which equation to substitute into.\n\nLooking back at Equation (1): 10 ln x = x ln y. Since y is 25/x, let's substitute that in.\n\nSo ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.
