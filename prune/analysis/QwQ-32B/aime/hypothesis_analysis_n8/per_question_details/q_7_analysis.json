          "text1": "Wait, actually, maybe phrased another way: the rotation would move each blue vertex to a position that was originally red, so the rotated blue set must be entirely contained within the red vertices of the original. \n\nHmm, so let me formalize this. Let me denote the octagon's vertices as labeled 0 through 7 in order. Let\u2019s consider the coloring as a subset B of the vertices (blue), and R (red) is the complement. The problem requires that there exists some rotation (i.e., an element of the cyclic group C8) such that when you rotate B by k positions, the rotated B is a subset of R. \n\nSo, equivalently, for some rotation by k, we have (B + k) \u2286 R. Which is equivalent to saying B \u2229 (R + (-k)) = B, because rotating B by k is the same as shifting coordinates so that B is now at positions B + k, and we want these positions to be in R.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe it's that when you rotate the octagon, the set of blue vertices after rotation coincides with a subset of the original red vertices. But phrased as \"all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So, every blue vertex, after rotation, is now at a vertex that was originally red. That is, the rotated blue vertices must not include any original blue vertices.",

So, the rotated version of B doesn't overlap with B.",
          "text2": "Wait, perhaps the problem allows overlapping? Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So, after rotation, each blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red. So, in the original coloring, those positions must have been red. So the rotated blue vertices must be entirely within the original red vertices. \n\nTherefore, for some k, the set B rotated by k is a subset of R. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings (B, R) such that there exists a rotation k where (B +k) \u2286 R. Since R is the complement of B, that is, R = S \\ B where S is all 8 vertices. So (B +k) \u2286 S \\ B, which implies that B \u2229 (B +k) = \u2205.",

As we saw earlier, there are subsets of size 4 that cannot be rotated to be disjoint. For example, the subset {1,2,4,6} cannot be rotated to be disjoint from itself. \n\nTherefore, we must find the number of subsets of size 4 that can be rotated to be disjoint. \n\nSo, to compute this, perhaps compute total subsets of size 4: 70.
