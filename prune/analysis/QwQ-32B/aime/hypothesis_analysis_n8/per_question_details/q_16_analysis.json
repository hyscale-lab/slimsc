          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps primes where p divides n\u2074 +1 must satisfy p \u22611 mod 8. Let me check with small primes.\n\nLet me try small primes. Let me see:\n\nTake p=2. Then n\u2074 +1. Let's see, n must be odd, since if n is even, n\u2074 is even, so n\u2074 +1 is odd. So 2 divides n\u2074 +1 only if n is odd, but n\u2074 is 1 mod 2, so n\u2074+1 is 0 mod 2. So 2 divides n\u2074 +1 for any odd n, but 2\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? Let's see, n=1: 1 +1=2, so 2 divides it but 4 doesn't. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. 82 mod 4 is 2, so 4 doesn't divide it. n=5: 625 +1=626, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, seems like 4 never divides n\u2074 +1 because n is odd, so n=2k+1, n\u2074 = (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + ... +1, so mod 4, n\u2074 is 1 mod 4, so n\u2074 +1 is 2 mod 4. Therefore 4 can't divide n^4 +1. So 2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3. Let's see. For 3 to divide n\u2074 +1, we need n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 3. Let's compute n\u2074 mod 3. Since 3 is small, n can be 0,1,2 mod 3. 0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod 3. So n\u2074 mod3 is either 0 or 1. So n\u2074 +1 mod3 is either 1 or 2. Therefore, never 0 mod 3. So 3 can't divide n\u2074 +1. So no.\n\np=5. Let's check. Let's see, n\u2074 mod5. The possible residues mod5 are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod5, 3\u2074=(3^2)^2=9^2\u22614^2=16\u22611 mod5, 4^4=(4^2)^2=16^2\u22611^2=1 mod5. So n\u2074 mod5 is always 0 or 1. Therefore, n\u2074 +1 mod5 is 1 or 2. So 5 can't divide n\u2074 +1 either. Hmm.\n\np=7. Let's check. 7 mod8 is 7. Let's see n\u2074 mod7.\n\nPossible residues 0-6.\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22612 mod7, 3\u2074=81\u22614 mod7, 4\u2074=256. 256 divided by 7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4. So 4 mod7. 5\u2074=(5^2)^2=25^2\u22614^2=16\u22612 mod7. 6\u2074=(-1)^4=1 mod7. So n\u2074 mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. So to get n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7. But none of the residues are 6, so 7 can't divide n\u2074 +1 either.\n\nNext prime p=11. 11 mod8 is 3. Let me check n\u2074 mod11. Let's see:\n\nn from 0 to 10:\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22615 mod11, 3\u2074=81\u22614 mod11, 4\u2074=256 mod11. 256 divided by 11: 11*23=253, so 3 mod11. 5\u2074: 5^4=625 mod11. 625-55*11=625-605=20\u22619 mod11. 6\u2074= (6^2)^2=36^2\u22613^2=9 mod11. 7\u2074? 7^2=49\u22615 mod11, so 5^2=25\u22613 mod11. 8\u2074: 8^2=64\u22619 mod11, so 9^2=81\u22614 mod11. 9\u2074: 9^2=81\u22614 mod11, so 4^2=16\u22615 mod11. 10\u2074=(-1)^4=1 mod11. So the residues are 0,1,4,5,9,3. So n\u2074 mod11 can be 0,1,3,4,5,9. So to get n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11, which is 10 mod11, but 10 isn't among those residues. So 11 can't divide n\u2074 +1.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=13. 13 mod8 is 5. Let me check n\u2074 mod13.\n\nn from 0 to 12:\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22613 mod13, 3\u2074=81\u226181-6*13=81-78=3 mod13?",

So now, does there exist n with n\u2074\u2261-1 mod17\u00b2?\n\nSo the question is, does there exist an n such that n\u2074 +1 \u22610 mod289 (since 17\u00b2=289). If so, then 17 is the smallest prime for which this is possible. So we need to check whether the solution mod17 can be lifted to mod17\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma or something.\n\nHensel's lemma says that if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f'(n) not \u22610 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Here f(n)=n\u2074 +1. The derivative f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3.

Let's compute f\u2019(2)=4*(2)^3=32 mod17. 32 mod17 is 32-17=15\u226115 mod17\u22600. So Hensel's lemma applies here. Therefore, there exists a solution mod17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is the smallest prime where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1 for some n. So the first part is p=17.\n\nNow the second part is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m\u2074 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2=289. So we need to find the minimal m where m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Since we know that n=2 mod17 is a solution mod17.

The results were 1,3,8,9, etc., but none equal to 12. So mod13, there is no solution to n\u2074\u2261-1, so p=13 cannot be considered.\n\nSimilarly, check p=7. Let me see n\u2074 mod7. Since 7 is prime, by Fermat's little theorem, n\u2076\u22611 mod7, so n\u2074\u2261n^{-2} mod7.

Let me write n = n\u2080 + 17k, where k is an integer to be determined. Then, n\u2074 +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nExpanding n\u2074:\n\n(n\u2080 +17k)^4 = n\u2080\u2074 + 4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) + 6n\u2080\u00b2(17k)^2 +4n\u2080(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.\n\nWe can compute this mod17\u00b2. Since 17\u00b2 divides terms with 17\u00b2 or higher. So terms with (17k)^2, (17k)^3, etc., will be 0 mod17\u00b2. So only the first two terms remain mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, (n\u2080 +17k)^4 \u2261 n\u2080\u2074 + 4n\u2080\u00b3*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2.

Then n\u2074 +1. Let's see, n must be odd, since if n is even, n\u2074 is even, so n\u2074 +1 is odd. So 2 divides n\u2074 +1 only if n is odd, but n\u2074 is 1 mod 2, so n\u2074+1 is 0 mod 2. So 2 divides n\u2074 +1 for any odd n, but 2\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1? Let's see, n=1: 1 +1=2, so 2 divides it but 4 doesn't. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. 82 mod 4 is 2, so 4 doesn't divide it. n=5: 625 +1=626, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, seems like 4 never divides n\u2074 +1 because n is odd, so n=2k+1, n\u2074 = (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + ... +1, so mod 4, n\u2074 is 1 mod 4, so n\u2074 +1 is 2 mod 4. Therefore 4 can't divide n^4 +1. So 2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3. Let's see. For 3 to divide n\u2074 +1, we need n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 3. Let's compute n\u2074 mod 3. Since 3 is small, n can be 0,1,2 mod 3. 0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod 3. So n\u2074 mod3 is either 0 or 1. So n\u2074 +1 mod3 is either 1 or 2. Therefore, never 0 mod 3. So 3 can't divide n\u2074 +1. So no.\n\np=5. Let's check. Let's see, n\u2074 mod5. The possible residues mod5 are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod5, 3\u2074=(3^2)^2=9^2\u22614^2=16\u22611 mod5, 4^4=(4^2)^2=16^2\u22611^2=1 mod5. So n\u2074 mod5 is always 0 or 1. Therefore, n\u2074 +1 mod5 is 1 or 2. So 5 can't divide n\u2074 +1 either. Hmm.\n\np=7. Let's check. 7 mod8 is 7. Let's see n\u2074 mod7.\n\nPossible residues 0-6.\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22612 mod7, 3\u2074=81\u22614 mod7, 4\u2074=256. 256 divided by 7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4. So 4 mod7. 5\u2074=(5^2)^2=25^2\u22614^2=16\u22612 mod7. 6\u2074=(-1)^4=1 mod7. So n\u2074 mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. So to get n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7. But none of the residues are 6, so 7 can't divide n\u2074 +1 either.\n\nNext prime p=11. 11 mod8 is 3. Let me check n\u2074 mod11. Let's see:\n\nn from 0 to 10:\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22615 mod11, 3\u2074=81\u22614 mod11, 4\u2074=256 mod11. 256 divided by 11: 11*23=253, so 3 mod11. 5\u2074: 5^4=625 mod11. 625-55*11=625-605=20\u22619 mod11. 6\u2074= (6^2)^2=36^2\u22613^2=9 mod11. 7\u2074? 7^2=49\u22615 mod11, so 5^2=25\u22613 mod11. 8\u2074: 8^2=64\u22619 mod11, so 9^2=81\u22614 mod11. 9\u2074: 9^2=81\u22614 mod11, so 4^2=16\u22615 mod11. 10\u2074=(-1)^4=1 mod11. So the residues are 0,1,4,5,9,3. So n\u2074 mod11 can be 0,1,3,4,5,9. So to get n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11, which is 10 mod11, but 10 isn't among those residues. So 11 can't divide n\u2074 +1.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=13. 13 mod8 is 5. Let me check n\u2074 mod13.\n\nn from 0 to 12:\n\n0\u2074=0, 1\u2074=1, 2\u2074=16\u22613 mod13, 3\u2074=81\u226181-6*13=81-78=3 mod13?",

Then n\u2074 +1 \u22612 mod4. So 2\u00b2 divides n\u2074+1 only if n\u2074 +1 \u22610 mod 4, but since it's 2 mod4, that can't happen. So 4 can't divide n\u2074 +1, so 2 is out. \n\nSo primes p must be odd primes congruent to 1 mod8, since otherwise, as per the order argument, they can't have n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod p. So the primes we need to consider are primes where p \u22611 mod8. The first few primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc. So perhaps the answer is 17?",

Let's see GCD(34,289). Since 289=17\u00b2, and 34=2*17, so GCD(34,289)=17. Check if 17 divides238: 238 divided by17 is14 (17*14=238). So yes.
