Since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, the problem reduces to considering the three items (D, G, S), and then the counts of people owning exactly two, three, or all four of the original four items can be translated into counts related to D, G, S.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, since everyone has the candy hearts, the total number of items owned by each person is 1 (candy) plus the number of D, G, S they own. Therefore:\n\n- The number of people who own exactly two items overall must be those who have candy plus exactly one of D, G, S. So exactly one of the three other items. That is, the count for exactly two items is the sum over all single items. So, if we let x_D be the number of people who have only D and candy, x_G similarly, x_S similarly, then the total exactly two would be x_D + x_G + x_S = 437.\n\n- The number of people who own exactly three items overall would be those who have candy plus exactly two of D, G, S. So that would be the sum of all pairs: y_DG (only D and G and candy), y_DS, y_GS. So total exactly three is y_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234.\n\n- The number of people who own all four items is z (those who have D, G, S, and candy).\n\n- The remaining people (those who own only candy) would be a = 900 - (437 + 234 + z) = 900 - (671 + z) = 229 - z.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning each item can be calculated by adding up all the people who have that item. For example, the number of people who own a diamond ring (195) is equal to:\n\nx_D (only D and candy) + y_DG (D and G) + y_DS (D and S) + z (all four).\n\nSimilarly for golf clubs (367):\n\nx_G + y_DG + y_GS + z.\n\nAnd garden spades (562):\n\nx_S + y_DS + y_GS + z.\n\nSo we can write three equations:\n\n1. x_D + y_DG + y_DS + z = 195 (diamonds)\n2. x_G + y_DG + y_GS + z = 367 (golf)\n3. x_S + y_DS + y_GS + z = 562 (spades)\n\nAdditionally, we know that:\n\nx_D + x_G + x_S = 437 (exactly two items)\n\nand\n\ny_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234 (exactly three items)\n\nAlso, the total population is:\n\na + (x_D + x_G + x_S) + (y_DG + y_DS + y_GS) + z = 900\n\nWhich as before gives a = 229 - z.\n\nNow, the problem is to find z, the number of people who own all four items (i.e., all three of D, G, S plus candy).\n\nLet me see how to solve these equations.\n\nFirst, let's note that the sum of all x's and y's and z is 900 - a = 900 - (229 - z) = 671 + z.\n\nBut perhaps we can proceed with the equations.\n\nLet me denote the variables:\n\nLet me call the sum of x_D + x_G + x_S = 437 (Equation A)\n\nThe sum of y_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234 (Equation B)\n\nThen, the three item equations (1,2,3) can be considered as:\n\nEquation 1: x_D + (y_DG + y_DS) + z = 195 - but wait, no, actually Equation 1 is x_D + y_DG + y_DS + z = 195. Similarly for the others.\n\nLet me rewrite equations 1,2,3 as follows:\n\nEquation1: x_D + (y_DG + y_DS) + z = 195.",
          "text2": "Wait, but since everyone has C, the total number of people is h + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nThe problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Since \"exactly two of these things\" includes the candy hearts? Let me clarify.\n\nEach of the four items: D, G, S, C. Since everyone has C, owning exactly two items would mean that they have C plus one of the others. For example, someone who owns D and C (and nothing else) would be in the \"exactly two\" group. Similarly, someone who owns G and C, or S and C. So the total number of people in exactly two items is a + b + c.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items would be those who have C plus two of D, G, S. So that would be d + e + f. And the number owning exactly four items is g = x. The number owning only C is h.\n\nTherefore, according to the problem:\n\nNumber of people with exactly two items: a + b + c = 437.\n\nNumber with exactly three items: d + e + f = 234.\n\nNumber with exactly four items: g = x.\n\nNumber with only C: h.\n\nSo total: h + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = h + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nTherefore, h = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nNow, we need to relate this to the counts of the individual items. Let's see:\n\nThe total number of people who own D (including those who have more) is 195.

Since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, the problem reduces to considering the three items (D, G, S), and then the counts of people owning exactly two, three, or all four of the original four items can be translated into counts related to D, G, S.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, since everyone has the candy hearts, the total number of items owned by each person is 1 (candy) plus the number of D, G, S they own. Therefore:\n\n- The number of people who own exactly two items overall must be those who have candy plus exactly one of D, G, S. So exactly one of the three other items. That is, the count for exactly two items is the sum over all single items. So, if we let x_D be the number of people who have only D and candy, x_G similarly, x_S similarly, then the total exactly two would be x_D + x_G + x_S = 437.\n\n- The number of people who own exactly three items overall would be those who have candy plus exactly two of D, G, S. So that would be the sum of all pairs: y_DG (only D and G and candy), y_DS, y_GS. So total exactly three is y_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234.\n\n- The number of people who own all four items is z (those who have D, G, S, and candy).\n\n- The remaining people (those who own only candy) would be a = 900 - (437 + 234 + z) = 900 - (671 + z) = 229 - z.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning each item can be calculated by adding up all the people who have that item. For example, the number of people who own a diamond ring (195) is equal to:\n\nx_D (only D and candy) + y_DG (D and G) + y_DS (D and S) + z (all four).\n\nSimilarly for golf clubs (367):\n\nx_G + y_DG + y_GS + z.\n\nAnd garden spades (562):\n\nx_S + y_DS + y_GS + z.\n\nSo we can write three equations:\n\n1. x_D + y_DG + y_DS + z = 195 (diamonds)\n2. x_G + y_DG + y_GS + z = 367 (golf)\n3. x_S + y_DS + y_GS + z = 562 (spades)\n\nAdditionally, we know that:\n\nx_D + x_G + x_S = 437 (exactly two items)\n\nand\n\ny_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234 (exactly three items)\n\nAlso, the total population is:\n\na + (x_D + x_G + x_S) + (y_DG + y_DS + y_GS) + z = 900\n\nWhich as before gives a = 229 - z.\n\nNow, the problem is to find z, the number of people who own all four items (i.e., all three of D, G, S plus candy).\n\nLet me see how to solve these equations.\n\nFirst, let's note that the sum of all x's and y's and z is 900 - a = 900 - (229 - z) = 671 + z.\n\nBut perhaps we can proceed with the equations.\n\nLet me denote the variables:\n\nLet me call the sum of x_D + x_G + x_S = 437 (Equation A)\n\nThe sum of y_DG + y_DS + y_GS = 234 (Equation B)\n\nThen, the three item equations (1,2,3) can be considered as:\n\nEquation 1: x_D + (y_DG + y_DS) + z = 195 - but wait, no, actually Equation 1 is x_D + y_DG + y_DS + z = 195. Similarly for the others.\n\nLet me rewrite equations 1,2,3 as follows:\n\nEquation1: x_D + (y_DG + y_DS) + z = 195.",
          "text2": "Wait, but since everyone has C, the total number of people is h + a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 900.\n\nThe problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things. Since \"exactly two of these things\" includes the candy hearts? Let me clarify.\n\nEach of the four items: D, G, S, C. Since everyone has C, owning exactly two items would mean that they have C plus one of the others. For example, someone who owns D and C (and nothing else) would be in the \"exactly two\" group. Similarly, someone who owns G and C, or S and C. So the total number of people in exactly two items is a + b + c.\n\nSimilarly, the number of people who own exactly three items would be those who have C plus two of D, G, S. So that would be d + e + f. And the number owning exactly four items is g = x. The number owning only C is h.\n\nTherefore, according to the problem:\n\nNumber of people with exactly two items: a + b + c = 437.\n\nNumber with exactly three items: d + e + f = 234.\n\nNumber with exactly four items: g = x.\n\nNumber with only C: h.\n\nSo total: h + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + g = h + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nTherefore, h = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.\n\nNow, we need to relate this to the counts of the individual items. Let's see:\n\nThe total number of people who own D (including those who have more) is 195. This includes those who have D only (a), D and G (d), D and S (e), D and G and S (g), and D and G and C, etc.",
