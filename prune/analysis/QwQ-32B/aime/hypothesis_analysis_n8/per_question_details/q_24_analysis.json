Because otherwise, the median is part of the list. So the problem must require n to be even. That makes sense. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nAh, yes! The problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Since for an odd-length list, the median is an element of the list, so the only way for the median not to be in the list is if the list has even length. Therefore, n must be even. That's crucial.

Let me think of possible numbers.\n\nFirst, the mode is 9. So 9 must be present at least twice, but more frequently than any other number. Let me consider how many times 9 appears. Suppose the minimum is twice, but to be a unique mode, it has to be strictly more than the frequency of any other number. So the other numbers can appear at most once, or maybe twice if 9 appears three times, etc.\n\nHmm. Let me consider possible scenarios.\n\nLet me try with n=6. Let me see if that's possible. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the list has 6 elements. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Since the median must be an integer not in the list. Let me try to construct such a list.\n\nSince the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears 3 times. Then other numbers can appear at most 2 times. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the list has three 9s, and three other numbers. Let me see. The total sum would be 3*9 plus the sum of the other three numbers equals 30. So 27 plus the sum of the other three numbers =30. So the other three numbers must add to 3. Since they are positive integers. The minimal they can be is 1,1,1. But then those numbers (the 1s) would each appear once, but since 9 appears three times, that's okay because 3>1. So that could work.

Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states the median is a positive integer not in the list. So whether n is even or odd:\n\nIf n is odd, the median is the middle element, which is in the list, so that can't satisfy the condition. Therefore, n must be even. Because otherwise, the median is part of the list. So the problem must require n to be even. That makes sense. I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nAh, yes! The problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Since for an odd-length list, the median is an element of the list, so the only way for the median not to be in the list is if the list has even length. Therefore, n must be even. That's crucial. So n is even.\n\nTherefore, the list has an even number of elements. Let me note that.\n\nSo n is even, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be an integer not present in the list, and the mode is 9 (appearing more times than any other number), and the sum is 30.\n\nOkay, now let me consider possible values of n. Let me think of possible numbers.\n\nFirst, the mode is 9. So 9 must be present at least twice, but more frequently than any other number. Let me consider how many times 9 appears. Suppose the minimum is twice, but to be a unique mode, it has to be strictly more than the frequency of any other number. So the other numbers can appear at most once, or maybe twice if 9 appears three times, etc.\n\nHmm. Let me consider possible scenarios.\n\nLet me try with n=6. Let me see if that's possible. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the list has 6 elements. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. Since the median must be an integer not in the list. Let me try to construct such a list.\n\nSince the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears 3 times. Then other numbers can appear at most 2 times. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the list has three 9s, and three other numbers. Let me see. The total sum would be 3*9 plus the sum of the other three numbers equals 30. So 27 plus the sum of the other three numbers =30. So the other three numbers must add to 3. Since they are positive integers. The minimal they can be is 1,1,1. But then those numbers (the 1s) would each appear once, but since 9 appears three times, that's okay because 3>1. So that could work. But let's check the median.\n\nIf the list is sorted, the three 9's would be in the middle?",

So 27 plus the sum of the other three numbers =30. So the other three numbers must add to 3. Since they are positive integers. The minimal they can be is 1,1,1. But then those numbers (the 1s) would each appear once, but since 9 appears three times, that's okay because 3>1. So that could work.

          "text1": "Wait, no\u2014 actually, the median of a list with an odd number of elements is the middle number, which would need to be in the list. Since the median here isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because when the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since the median is a positive integer, that means those two middle numbers must add up to an even number so their average is an integer. But also, that integer (the median) isn't present in the list itself. Got it.\n\nSo first step: the list has an even number of elements, let's say there are 2n numbers. The median will be the average of the nth and (n+1)th terms. Since the median isn't in the list, that average must not be one of the numbers. Let me note that down.\n\nAlso, the mode is 9. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as k, which must be at least 2 (since you need at least two occurrences to be a mode, unless all numbers are unique, but here since there's a unique mode, so 9 has to occur more than any other number). But maybe more? Let's see.\n\nLet me think about how to construct such a list. Let's consider the possible lengths of the list. Since the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the length can't be too big. Let's see, if the list has 2 elements, the sum is 30, but then there's no mode, so that's impossible. For 4 elements? Let's see. Maybe.",
          "text2": "Wait, but the median is an element of the list if n is odd. So that's impossible. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be an element of the list. So n must be even.\n\nAh, that's an important point. Since the median must not be in the list, it can't be an element of the list. So n must be even, so the median is an average of two numbers, which can be an integer not in the list. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Let me note that.\n\nSo n is even. Let's let n = 2k for some integer k. The median will then be (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which must be an integer not in the list. So (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, so they must be both even or both odd. Their average is an integer m, and m is not in the list.\n\nAdditionally, the mode is 9, unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let me think of possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, the sum is 30, so the numbers can't be too big. Since 9 is a mode, let's see how many 9s there can be.\n\nSuppose the number of 9s is m. Since it's the mode, m must be greater than the count of any other number. Let me consider possible m values. Let's try m=2 first.",
