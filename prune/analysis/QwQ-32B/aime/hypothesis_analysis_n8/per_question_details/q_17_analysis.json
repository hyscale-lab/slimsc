          "text1": "Wait, actually, the sphere must contain each of the boxes in \ud835\udcd1. Therefore, the sphere must be big enough to contain all possible boxes in \ud835\udcd1. But since the boxes can vary in dimensions, maybe we need to find the maximum possible minimal sphere radius across all such boxes? Or perhaps the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in \ud835\udcd1. Hmm, actually, the question says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of \ud835\udcd1\". So that sphere must contain every box in \ud835\udcd1, so the sphere must be large enough to contain the largest such box in some sense.\n\nTherefore, the sphere's radius must be at least as big as the radius needed for the \"worst-case\" box in \ud835\udcd1, i.e., the box in \ud835\udcd1 that requires the largest sphere. So essentially, we need to find the maximum value of the minimal sphere radius required for each box in \ud835\udcd1, and then that maximum is the minimal r required here. Therefore, to find r, we need to find the maximum of the minimal sphere radii over all boxes in \ud835\udcd1, and then compute r\u00b2 and find p + q.\n\nSo first, let's think about what determines the minimal sphere that can contain a rectangular box. For a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the minimal enclosing sphere must have a radius equal to half of the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere must have a diameter at least equal to that space diagonal. Therefore, the radius is (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2. \n\nTherefore, for each box in \ud835\udcd1, the required radius is (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2, and we need to find the maximum value of this over all boxes in \ud835\udcd1, then square it, and compute p + q where r\u00b2 = p/q.\n\nTherefore, our goal reduces to maximizing sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Since sqrt is a monotonically increasing function, this is equivalent to maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 (surface area) and abc = 23 (volume).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to an optimization problem: maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 subject to 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here? Or maybe some algebraic manipulation.",

Therefore, the sphere must be large enough to contain the \"largest\" box in B, in some sense.

Therefore, the minimal sphere that can contain all of them must have a radius equal to half the maximum space diagonal of any box in B. Therefore, to find r, we need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes in B, then take half of that. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: given l, w, h positive real numbers with lwh=23 and 2(lw + lh + wh)=54, find the maximum value of sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2).

Let me denote the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. The constraints are g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx -27 =0 and h(x,y,z)=xyz -23=0. \n\nThe Lagrangian would then be L = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + zx -27) - \u03bc(xyz -23).

Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Let me see if that assumption can lead us somewhere.\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, we can write variables as a, a, c. Then, let's write the constraints:\n\nFirst, the surface area equation: ab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2ac =27.\n\nThe volume equation: a\u00b2c =23.\n\nWe can write a\u00b2 + 2ac =27. Let me solve for c from the volume equation: c =23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into the surface area equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/a\u00b2) =27 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 46/a =27.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na\u00b3 +46 =27a \u21d2 a\u00b3 -27a +46=0.\n\nHmm, solving the cubic equation a\u00b3 -27a +46=0. Let me see if this can be factored. Let me try possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting a=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8-54= -46 +46=0. Hey, a=2 is a root. Therefore, (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. The quadratic equation a\u00b2 +2a -23=0 has roots (-2 \u00b1sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 \u00b14*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 \u00b12sqrt(6). But since a must be positive, so the roots are a=2 and a= -1 +2\u221a6 \u2248-1+4.89\u22483.89. The other root is negative, so discard. Therefore, possible a=2 or a\u22483.89.\n\nSo, if a=2, then c=23/(a\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then, the dimensions are a=2, b=2, c=5.75. Let me check the surface area:\n\nab + bc + ac = 2*2 + 2*5.75 +2*5.75 =4 + 11.5 +11.5=27. Correct. Volume is 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.",

Since it's an optimization problem with constraints. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x,y,z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which we want to maximize. The constraints are g(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz - 27 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints would involve setting the gradient of f equal to \u03bb times the gradient of g plus \u03bc times the gradient of h. So:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n\u2207g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)\n\n\u2207h = (yz, xz, xy)\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc yz\n\n2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc xz\n\n2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc xy\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + xz + yz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution here. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that two variables are equal? Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me test that.\n\nLet me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y.\n\nSo, substituting into the constraints:\n\nFirst constraint: xy + xy + y^2 = 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27,\n\nSecond constraint: x y\u00b2 = 23.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me express x from the second equation: x = 23 / y\u00b2. Substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(23 / y\u00b2)*y + y\u00b2 = 27 => 46 / y + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y: 46 + y\u00b3 = 27y => y\u00b3 -27 y +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Trying y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So y=2 is a root. Then factor it:\n\n(y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) =0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 +2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the real roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23 =0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive (length), so the other positive root is y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. So possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.899.\n\nSo let's take y=2 first. Then x =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then variables are x=23/4, y=2, z=2. Let me compute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 here: (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529/16)+(128/16)= 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nNow check the other possible y value: y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute that numerically: 2\u221a6 \u22484.899, so y\u22483.899. Then x=23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute y\u00b2: (approx) (3.899)^2 \u224815.196, so x\u224823/15.196\u22481.514. Then l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 would be x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2\u2248 (1.514)^2 + 2*(15.196)\u22482.29 +30.39\u224832.68. Which is less than 41.06. So the case y=2 gives a higher value. Therefore, the case where two variables are 2 and one is 23/4 gives a higher l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2. Hmm.",

Coefficients: 1 (a\u00b3), 0 (a\u00b2), -27 (a), +46 (constant).\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 2:\n\n2 | 1 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0-27 \u00a0\u00a046\n\nMultiply 2 down:\n\nBring down 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1*2=2, add to next term: 0 +2=2\n\nMultiply 2*2=4, add to -27: -23\n\nMultiply -23*2= -46, add to 46: 0. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. So other roots are solutions to a\u00b2 +2a -23=0 \u21d2 a=(-2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1\u221a96)/2 = (-2 \u00b14\u221a6)/2 = -1 \u00b12\u221a6. Since a must be positive, only a= -1 +2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 +4.898\u22483.898, and a=2. So the roots are a=2 and a\u22483.898.\n\nThus, when a = 2, then c=(27 -4)/4 =23/4=5.75.

But since the boxes can vary in dimensions, maybe we need to find the maximum possible minimal sphere radius across all such boxes? Or perhaps the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in \ud835\udcd1. Hmm, actually, the question says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of \ud835\udcd1\". So that sphere must contain every box in \ud835\udcd1, so the sphere must be large enough to contain the largest such box in some sense.\n\nTherefore, the sphere's radius must be at least as big as the radius needed for the \"worst-case\" box in \ud835\udcd1, i.e., the box in \ud835\udcd1 that requires the largest sphere. So essentially, we need to find the maximum value of the minimal sphere radius required for each box in \ud835\udcd1, and then that maximum is the minimal r required here. Therefore, to find r, we need to find the maximum of the minimal sphere radii over all boxes in \ud835\udcd1, and then compute r\u00b2 and find p + q.\n\nSo first, let's think about what determines the minimal sphere that can contain a rectangular box. For a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the minimal enclosing sphere must have a radius equal to half of the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere must have a diameter at least equal to that space diagonal. Therefore, the radius is (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2. \n\nTherefore, for each box in \ud835\udcd1, the required radius is (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2, and we need to find the maximum value of this over all boxes in \ud835\udcd1, then square it, and compute p + q where r\u00b2 = p/q.\n\nTherefore, our goal reduces to maximizing sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Since sqrt is a monotonically increasing function, this is equivalent to maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 (surface area) and abc = 23 (volume).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to an optimization problem: maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 subject to 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here?

The quadratic equation a\u00b2 +2a -23=0 has roots (-2 \u00b1sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 \u00b14*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 \u00b12sqrt(6).

Let me see if there are integer roots. Trying y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So y=2 is a root. Then factor it:\n\n(y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) =0.

So the problem is: maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + xz + yz = 27 and xyz = 23. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps using Lagrange multipliers here? Since it's an optimization problem with constraints. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x,y,z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which we want to maximize. The constraints are g(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz - 27 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints would involve setting the gradient of f equal to \u03bb times the gradient of g plus \u03bc times the gradient of h. So:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n\u2207g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)\n\n\u2207h = (yz, xz, xy)\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc yz\n\n2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc xz\n\n2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc xy\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + xz + yz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution here. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that two variables are equal? Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me test that.\n\nLet me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y.\n\nSo, substituting into the constraints:\n\nFirst constraint: xy + xy + y^2 = 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27,\n\nSecond constraint: x y\u00b2 = 23.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me express x from the second equation: x = 23 / y\u00b2. Substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(23 / y\u00b2)*y + y\u00b2 = 27 => 46 / y + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y: 46 + y\u00b3 = 27y => y\u00b3 -27 y +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Trying y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So y=2 is a root. Then factor it:\n\n(y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) =0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 +2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the real roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23 =0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive (length), so the other positive root is y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. So possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.899.\n\nSo let's take y=2 first. Then x =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then variables are x=23/4, y=2, z=2. Let me compute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 here: (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529/16)+(128/16)= 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nNow check the other possible y value: y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute that numerically: 2\u221a6 \u22484.899, so y\u22483.899. Then x=23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute y\u00b2: (approx) (3.899)^2 \u224815.196, so x\u224823/15.196\u22481.514. Then l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 would be x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2\u2248 (1.514)^2 + 2*(15.196)\u22482.29 +30.39\u224832.68. Which is less than 41.06. So the case y=2 gives a higher value. Therefore, the case where two variables are 2 and one is 23/4 gives a higher l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2. Hmm.",

So then the sides would be a\u22483.89, a\u22483.89, c\u22481.525. Let me check the volume: (3.89)^2*1.525 \u2248(15.13)*(1.525)\u224823, which is correct. So that is another solution.\n\nSo with a=2, the space diagonal would be sqrt(2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 + (23/4)^2). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(4 +4 + (529/16)) = sqrt(8 + 529/16). Converting 8 to 128/16, so total is (128 +529)/16=657/16. So sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4. Let me compute sqrt(657): 25^2=625, 26^2=676, so between 25 and 26. Approximately 25.63. So sqrt(657)/4\u224825.63/4\u22486.4075.\n\nFor the other case where a\u22483.89, the space diagonal would be sqrt( (3.89)^2 + (3.89)^2 + (1.525)^2 ). Let me compute each term:\n\n(3.89)^2\u224815.13, so two of those sum to 30.26, plus (1.525)^2\u22482.325, so total\u224830.26+2.325\u224832.585. So sqrt(32.585)\u22485.71.

So, sqrt(41.0625) is the space diagonal, so the radius squared would be (sqrt(41.0625)/2)^2 = (41.0625)/4 =10.265625.\n\nSecond case: a\u22483.898, c\u22481.515. Let me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 (since a=b). So, 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.515)^2 \u22482*(15.19) +2.3\u224830.38 +2.3\u224832.68.

          "text2": "Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think. Let me denote variables x = l, y = w, z = h. So the problem is: maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + xz + yz = 27 and xyz = 23. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps using Lagrange multipliers here? Since it's an optimization problem with constraints. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x,y,z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which we want to maximize. The constraints are g(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz - 27 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints would involve setting the gradient of f equal to \u03bb times the gradient of g plus \u03bc times the gradient of h. So:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n\u2207g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)\n\n\u2207h = (yz, xz, xy)\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc yz\n\n2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc xz\n\n2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc xy\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + xz + yz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution here. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that two variables are equal? Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me test that.\n\nLet me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y.\n\nSo, substituting into the constraints:\n\nFirst constraint: xy + xy + y^2 = 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27,\n\nSecond constraint: x y\u00b2 = 23.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me express x from the second equation: x = 23 / y\u00b2. Substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(23 / y\u00b2)*y + y\u00b2 = 27 => 46 / y + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y: 46 + y\u00b3 = 27y => y\u00b3 -27 y +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Trying y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So y=2 is a root. Then factor it:\n\n(y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) =0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 +2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the real roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23 =0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive (length), so the other positive root is y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. So possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.899.\n\nSo let's take y=2 first. Then x =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then variables are x=23/4, y=2, z=2. Let me compute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 here: (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529/16)+(128/16)= 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nNow check the other possible y value: y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute that numerically: 2\u221a6 \u22484.899, so y\u22483.899. Then x=23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute y\u00b2: (approx) (3.899)^2 \u224815.196, so x\u224823/15.196\u22481.514. Then l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 would be x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2\u2248 (1.514)^2 + 2*(15.196)\u22482.29 +30.39\u224832.68. Which is less than 41.06. So the case y=2 gives a higher value. Therefore, the case where two variables are 2 and one is 23/4 gives a higher l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2. Hmm.",

Since it's an optimization problem with constraints. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x,y,z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which we want to maximize. The constraints are g(x,y,z) = xy + xz + yz - 27 = 0 and h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints would involve setting the gradient of f equal to \u03bb times the gradient of g plus \u03bc times the gradient of h. So:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\n\u2207g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)\n\n\u2207h = (yz, xz, xy)\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\n2x = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc yz\n\n2y = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc xz\n\n2z = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc xy\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + xz + yz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution here. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that two variables are equal? Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me test that.\n\nLet me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y.\n\nSo, substituting into the constraints:\n\nFirst constraint: xy + xy + y^2 = 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27,\n\nSecond constraint: x y\u00b2 = 23.\n\nWe need to solve for x and y. Let me express x from the second equation: x = 23 / y\u00b2. Substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(23 / y\u00b2)*y + y\u00b2 = 27 => 46 / y + y\u00b2 = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by y: 46 + y\u00b3 = 27y => y\u00b3 -27 y +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there are integer roots. Trying y=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So y=2 is a root. Then factor it:\n\n(y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) =0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 +2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the real roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23 =0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive (length), so the other positive root is y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. So possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.899.\n\nSo let's take y=2 first. Then x =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then variables are x=23/4, y=2, z=2. Let me compute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 here: (23/4)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = (529/16) + 8 = (529/16)+(128/16)= 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nNow check the other possible y value: y = -1 + 2\u221a6. Let me compute that numerically: 2\u221a6 \u22484.899, so y\u22483.899. Then x=23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute y\u00b2: (approx) (3.899)^2 \u224815.196, so x\u224823/15.196\u22481.514. Then l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 would be x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2\u2248 (1.514)^2 + 2*(15.196)\u22482.29 +30.39\u224832.68. Which is less than 41.06. So the case y=2 gives a higher value. Therefore, the case where two variables are 2 and one is 23/4 gives a higher l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2. Hmm.",
