          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps the standard parametrization of a torus is when the axis of revolution is the z-axis, so let's adjust the coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me reorient: Let me set the generating circle in the x-y plane, centered at (R, 0, 0), where R = 6, the distance from the center to the axis (which is the z-axis in this case). So the generating circle has center (6,0,0) and radius 3. Then, when revolved around the z-axis, the torus is formed. \n\nIn this case, the equation of the torus is:\n\n(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R)^2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nwhere R = 6 and r = 3, so as before:\n\n(\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, so equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nSo, to find where they are tangent along a circle, perhaps we need to find a circle lying on both surfaces, and the gradients of the two surfaces are colinear there.",
          "text2": "Wait, no, actually, the axis of revolution is the z-axis, so the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0), but the axis is the z-axis. Therefore, the distance from the sphere's center (origin) to the torus's axis is 6 units along the x-axis.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should model this mathematically. Let me consider a general point on the torus. Using the parametrization of the torus:\n\nA point on the torus can be given by:\n\nx = (R + r cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\ny = (R + r cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6\n\nz = r sin \u03b8\n\nwhere R is the major radius (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, which is 6), and r is the minor radius (radius of the generating circle, 3). \u03b8 and \u03c6 are angles parameterizing the position on the torus.\n\nSo, substituting R = 6 and r = 3, we have:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\ny = (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6\n\nz = 3 sin \u03b8\n\nNow, the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nTo find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere, we can substitute the parametrization into the sphere's equation and find conditions where they are tangent. However, this might get complicated, but perhaps we can find the points where the distance from the origin to the torus's surface is equal to 11 (for external tangency) or the points where the sphere's surface is at 11 units from the origin, but the torus is inside, so maybe the distance is 11 minus something?",
