To have exactly k matches, we need to choose k numbers from her 4, and the remaining 4 - k numbers from the remaining 6 numbers not in her selection.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4, k)*C(6, 4 - k).\n\nTherefore, for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2).

Then the probability of grand prize is 1, but the probability of a prize (which would require at least 2 matches) would also be 1, so the conditional probability would be 1. But if the total numbers are 5, and she picks 4, then total combinations are C(5,4)=5. The grand prize is 1. The prize would require at least 2 matches.",
