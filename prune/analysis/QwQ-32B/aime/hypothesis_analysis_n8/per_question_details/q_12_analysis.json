For example, first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c + f. The sum of these three numbers is 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. \n\nHmm.

So that's a key constraint.\n\nNow let's look at the second equation. The sum of the vertical columns as two-digit numbers is 99. Each column is 10*(top digit) + bottom digit. So the first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c +f.

So the sum of the top row digits is 8.\n\nAdditionally, since each column's digits add to 9, the bottom row digits sum to (d + e + f) = (9 -a)+(9 -b)+(9 -c) = 27 - (a + b +c) =27 -8=19. So the bottom digits sum to 19.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are:\n\nFor each column:\n\na + d =9,\n\nb + e =9,\n\nc + f =9,\n\nAlso:\n\na + b + c =8,\n\nand\n\nd + e + f =19.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a,b,c) where each is a digit (0-9), their sum is 8, and then for each such triple, the corresponding d,e,f are determined as d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, and we must also ensure that d,e,f are digits (0-9). Because even if a is a digit, 9 - a must be between 0 and 9. Since a is between 0 and 9, 9 -a is between 0 and 9, so that's okay. Similarly for e and f. So as long as a, b, c are digits (0-9) summing to 8, then d,e,f will automatically be digits between 0 and 9. So the only constraint is that a, b, c are digits (0-9), each between 0 and 9, and their sum is 8. So the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 with each variable between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9, the upper bounds (9) on each variable are redundant here. Because the maximum any variable can be is 8 (if the other two are 0). So the constraints are just non-negative integers a, b, c with a + b + c =8.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, which is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So for the top and bottom rows:\n\n- The units digits (c and f) add to 9,\n\n- The tens digits (b and e) add to 9,\n\n- The hundreds digits (a and d) add to 9.\n\nTherefore, this is a key insight. So, that gives three equations:\n\n1. c + f = 9,\n\n2. b + e = 9,\n\n3. a + d = 9.\n\nNow, the second part is equation2: the sum of the three column numbers (each column being two-digit numbers read top to bottom) is 99.\n\nRecall each column is a two-digit number: first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c + f. So their sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nBut since we already have from the first set of equations that a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9, perhaps we can substitute these into equation2?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst, let's write equation2 again:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n10a + 10b +10c + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nFactor out the 10:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9 => d =9 -a,\n\nb + e=9 => e=9 - b,\n\nc + f=9 => f=9 - c.\n\nTherefore, substituting d, e, f in terms of a, b, c into the equation above:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + ( (9 -a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) ) =99.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + [27 - (a + b + c)] =99\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nThen equation becomes:\n\n10S + (27 - S) =99\n\nSo 9S +27 =99 => 9S =72 => S =8.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c =8.\n\nSo the sum of the top row digits is 8, and since d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, the sum of the bottom row digits is (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) =27 - (a + b +c)=27 -8=19.\n\nBut actually, we might not need that. The key is that a + b + c must equal 8.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible digits a,b,c (each 0-9) such that:\n\n1. a + b + c =8,\n\n2. Each of a, b, c is between 0 and9,\n\n3. Additionally, since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c must also be digits between 0 and9.\n\nTherefore, for each digit a, we must have 9 -a between 0 and9, so a can be from 0 to9. Similarly for b and c. Since a + b + c =8, and each of a,b,c at most 8 (since 8 is the total sum).",

          "text2": "Wait, yes, because S1, S2, S3 are each 9. So each column must add to 9. So that's a crucial point.\n\nTherefore, the first equation gives us that each column's digits (a+d, b+e, c+f) must each equal 9.\n\nTherefore, the vertical columns each sum to 9. So that's a key constraint.\n\nNow let's look at the second equation. The sum of the vertical columns as two-digit numbers is 99. Each column is 10*(top digit) + bottom digit. So the first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c +f. Their sum is 99.\n\nSo:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c +f) = 99.\n\nBut since we already know that a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9, perhaps we can substitute those into this equation.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me rewrite each term:\n\n10a + d = 10a + (9 -a) = 9a +9,\n\nSimilarly, 10b + e =10b + (9 -b)=9b +9,\n\n10c +f =10c + (9 -c)=9c +9,\n\nTherefore, the total sum becomes:\n\n(9a +9) + (9b +9) + (9c +9) = 9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99.\n\nSo 9(a + b + c) +27 =99,\n\nSubtract 27: 9(a + b + c)=72,\n\nDivide by9: a + b + c =8.\n\nAh! So the sum of the top row digits is 8.\n\nAdditionally, since each column's digits add to 9, the bottom row digits sum to (d + e + f) = (9 -a)+(9 -b)+(9 -c) = 27 - (a + b +c) =27 -8=19. So the bottom digits sum to 19.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are:\n\nFor each column:\n\na + d =9,\n\nb + e =9,\n\nc + f =9,\n\nAlso:\n\na + b + c =8,\n\nand\n\nd + e + f =19.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a,b,c) where each is a digit (0-9), their sum is 8, and then for each such triple, the corresponding d,e,f are determined as d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, and we must also ensure that d,e,f are digits (0-9). Because even if a is a digit, 9 - a must be between 0 and 9. Since a is between 0 and 9, 9 -a is between 0 and 9, so that's okay. Similarly for e and f. So as long as a, b, c are digits (0-9) summing to 8, then d,e,f will automatically be digits between 0 and 9. So the only constraint is that a, b, c are digits (0-9), each between 0 and 9, and their sum is 8. So the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 with each variable between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nBut since 8 is less than 3*9, the upper bounds (9) on each variable are redundant here. Because the maximum any variable can be is 8 (if the other two are 0). So the constraints are just non-negative integers a, b, c with a + b + c =8.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, which is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(10,2)=45.",

So, that gives three equations:\n\n1. c + f = 9,\n\n2. b + e = 9,\n\n3. a + d = 9.\n\nNow, the second part is equation2: the sum of the three column numbers (each column being two-digit numbers read top to bottom) is 99.\n\nRecall each column is a two-digit number: first column is 10a + d, second is 10b + e, third is 10c + f. So their sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.\n\nBut since we already have from the first set of equations that a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9, perhaps we can substitute these into equation2?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst, let's write equation2 again:\n\n(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99\n\nLet me group terms:\n\n10a + 10b +10c + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nFactor out the 10:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.\n\nBut from the first equations, we have:\n\na + d =9 => d =9 -a,\n\nb + e=9 => e=9 - b,\n\nc + f=9 => f=9 - c.\n\nTherefore, substituting d, e, f in terms of a, b, c into the equation above:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + ( (9 -a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) ) =99.\n\nSimplify:\n\n10*(a + b + c) + [27 - (a + b + c)] =99\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nThen equation becomes:\n\n10S + (27 - S) =99\n\nSo 9S +27 =99 => 9S =72 => S =8.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c =8.\n\nSo the sum of the top row digits is 8, and since d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c, the sum of the bottom row digits is (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) =27 - (a + b +c)=27 -8=19.\n\nBut actually, we might not need that. The key is that a + b + c must equal 8.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible digits a,b,c (each 0-9) such that:\n\n1. a + b + c =8,\n\n2. Each of a, b, c is between 0 and9,\n\n3. Additionally, since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c must also be digits between 0 and9.\n\nTherefore, for each digit a, we must have 9 -a between 0 and9, so a can be from 0 to9. Similarly for b and c.
