The direction vector is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56 ) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56 ).

Similarly, rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14 ) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14 ) = -6\u221a14 /11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at C is:\n\nUsing point C(0,0):\n\ny -0 = (-6\u221a14 /11)(x -0 )\n\nThus, y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nWe have equations:\n\nTangent at B: y = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 )\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 ) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14 ) to cancel coefficients:\n\n(x -9 ) = -x\n\nThus, x -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192x=9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2 ) = (-6*9\u221a14 )/(22 ) = (-27\u221a14)/11",

Let's compute that.\n\nThe tangent at C. The radius OC is from O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ) to C(0,0). Direction vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56 ). The slope of OC is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: - (84)/(11\u221a14 ) = - (84/(11\u221a14 )) = similar to before, rationalize:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14 ) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14 ) = - (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11 and passes through C(0,0). So its equation is y = (-6\u221a14 /11 ) x.\n\nNow, the point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. Tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 )\n\n2. Tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11 )x\n\nSet them equal to find D's coordinates.\n\nSet (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 ) = (-6\u221a14 /11 )x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14 ) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9 ) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x= 9/2.\n\nThen substitute back into equation 2: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)(9/2 ) = (-54\u221a14 )/(22 ) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, point D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nHmm, coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14 /11 ). Alright.\n\nNow, need to find point P, which is the other intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nWe have coordinates for A and D, so we can parametrize line AD and find its other intersection with the circle.\n\nFirst, let me write coordinates for points A and D.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, 4\u221a14 /3 )\n\nPoint D: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 )\n\nLet me convert these to decimals to see if that helps, but maybe fractions are better.\n\nLet me parametrize line AD. Let me use a parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D. But since we need to find the other intersection P, which is beyond D?",
          "text2": "Wait, O is (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ), and point B is (9,0).\n\nCompute the difference in y: 0 - 33\u221a14 /56 = -33\u221a14 /56.\n\nDifference in x: 9 -9/2 =9/2.\n\nTherefore slope of OB is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x)= ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (-33\u221a14)/56 *2/9 = (-66\u221a14)/(504 ) = simplify numerator and denominator by 6: (-11\u221a14)/84. Yes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, slope of tangent at B is perpendicular: m_tangent = -1/( slope_OB ) = -1/( (-11\u221a14)/84 ) =84/(11\u221a14 )\n\nYes, so 84/(11\u221a14 ) can be rationalized as (84\u221a14)/(11*14)= (6\u221a14)/11. Since 84 divided by 14 is 6. So slope is (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at B is:\n\nUsing point B(9,0):\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 )\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C: need to compute its equation.\n\nPoint C is (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.\n\nCompute slope of OC: from O(9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ) to C(0,0).\n\n\u0394y = 0 - 33\u221a14 /56 = -33\u221a14 /56.\n\n\u0394x = 0 -9/2 = -9/2.\n\nThus slope of OC is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x)= ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / ( -9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56)*(2/9 )= (66\u221a14)/(504 )= (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so slope_tangent = -1/( (11\u221a14)/84 )= -84/(11\u221a14 ). Similarly, rationalizing:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14 ) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14 ) = -6\u221a14 /11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at C is:\n\nUsing point C(0,0):\n\ny -0 = (-6\u221a14 /11)(x -0 )\n\nThus, y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nWe have equations:\n\nTangent at B: y = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 )\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14 /11)(x -9 ) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14 ) to cancel coefficients:\n\n(x -9 ) = -x\n\nThus, x -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192x=9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2 ) = (-6*9\u221a14 )/(22 ) = (-27\u221a14)/11",
