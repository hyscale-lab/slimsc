The triangle's inradius is to be found.\n\nPerhaps the triangle is a right triangle? Let me assume that ABC is a right-angled triangle at B. Let's see if that helps.\n\nIf angle B is 90\u00b0, then the inradius r_in = (AB + BC - AC)/2.\n\nSuppose the eight circles are placed along the leg from B to the hypotenuse? Not sure.",
