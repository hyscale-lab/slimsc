So that works.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, the problem is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (since Bob can win only if Alice starts in a losing position).

Since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor is 404, but 5*404=2020, so the numbers are 5,10,...,2020.

So 5k \u22642022 \u2192 k \u22642022/5=404.4, so k=0,...,404. So total terms: 405 (since k starts at 0). Let me check:\n\nFirst term: k=0: 2, next k=404: 2+5*404=2+2020=2022. 2022 is \u22642024.

So that's correct.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5:\n\nStart at 2, then 7,12,...,2022. The last term is 2022. The number of terms: Let me compute (2022 -2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nThus total numbers are 404+405=809. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I think the answer is 809.",

Let's find the last term. Let L =5k +2 \u22642024 \u21925k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4. So k=404 gives 5\u00d7404+2=2020+2=2022. Therefore the last term is 2022. The number of terms is 405? Let's see: starting at k=0 (2=5\u00d70 +2), so terms from k=0 to k=404, which is 405 terms.",
