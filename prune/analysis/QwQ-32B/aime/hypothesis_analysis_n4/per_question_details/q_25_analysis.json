          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps considering the data given: the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of the things, and 234 own exactly three. Since everyone owns C, if someone owns exactly two things, that must be C plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four (C plus the three others). \n\nTherefore, the number of people who own exactly two items is the number of people who have C and exactly one of the others. Similarly, exactly three items is C plus two others, and exactly four is C plus all three. \n\nTherefore, the problem's data is given in terms of these counts. Let me note that the total number of residents is 900, so:\n\nTotal = (number who own exactly 1 item) + (exactly 2) + (exactly 3) + (exactly 4)\n\nBut since everyone owns at least C, the \"exactly 1 item\" is actually the people who own only C and nothing else. Let's denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet a = number of people who own only C (i.e., exactly 1 item: C)\nb = number of people who own exactly 2 items (C plus one of D, G, S)\nc = number of people who own exactly 3 items (C plus two of D, G, S)\nd = number of people who own all four items (C plus D, G, S)\n\nGiven in the problem:\n\nb = 437\n\nc = 234\n\nTotal = a + b + c + d = 900\n\nTherefore:\n\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900 \u21d2 a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So a + d = 229. Hmm, but we need another equation to find d. \n\nWe can also use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three items D, G, S, because the counts for D, G, S are given. Let's think of the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, and then the candy hearts are a given for everyone.",
          "text2": "Wait, but let me write that properly. Let me see:\n\nLet me define:\n\n- a = number who own only C (so none of D, G, S). This is the \"exactly one\" category in the problem.\n\n- b = number who own exactly one of D, G, S and C. This is the \"exactly two\" in the problem (since they have C plus one). The problem says this is 437.\n\n- c = number who own exactly two of D, G, S and C. This is \"exactly three\" in the problem (C plus two). The problem states this is 234.\n\n- d = number who own all three of D, G, S and C. This is \"exactly four\" in the problem, which is what we need to find (let's call this x).\n\nTherefore, the total is a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWe can write:\n\na + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nTherefore, a + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So a + x = 229. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, we also need to relate these to the given numbers of people who own each item (D:195, G:367, S:562).\n\nLet me think. The number of people who own D is 195. This includes those who own D along with any combination of G, S, or none (but they all have C). So:\n\nNumber owning D is:\n\nNumber who own only D (i.e., D but not G, S) plus those who own D and one other (G or S) plus those who own D and both others (G and S). So:\n\n|D| = (number with exactly D) + (number with D and one other) + (number with D and both others) + (number with D and all three?",

Since everyone is in C, so yes, the answer is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, and since C is universal, that's the same as all four.\n\nTherefore, maybe we can model this with the three items D, G, S, and use inclusion-exclusion with the given data.\n\nBut let's see.
