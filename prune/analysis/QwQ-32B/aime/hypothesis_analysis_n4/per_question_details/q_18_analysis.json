So, 15 rectangles. \n\nHowever, perhaps some of these rectangles are congruent but counted multiple times? But no, each pair of diameters is unique, so each combination gives a distinct rectangle. For example, choosing diameters V0-V6 and V1-V7 gives a different rectangle than V0-V6 and V2-V8, etc. \n\nTherefore, the total number should be 15.

I made an assumption that the rectangle must have sides along diameters, but maybe the sides of the rectangle can be other diagonals or sides of the dodecagon, not necessarily diameters. So my previous reasoning only counts the rectangles formed by diameters. But maybe there are other rectangles that don't use diameters as sides.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider all possible rectangles, not just those formed by diameters. That complicates things.
