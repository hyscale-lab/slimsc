The circle of tangency must lie in a plane perpendicular to this line, i.e., the y-z plane at some x-coordinate. Let's denote the plane as x = c. The intersection of the sphere and the torus in this plane would give the circle of tangency.\n\nLet me compute this for the internal tangent case (a = 2). The sphere's equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121. The torus's equation is [(sqrt((x - 2)^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2] = 9.\n\nAt the plane x = c, substituting into both equations:\n\nFor the sphere: c\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121 \u21d2 y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121 - c\u00b2.\n\nFor the torus: [(sqrt((c - 2)^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2] = 9.\n\nSince they are tangent along this plane, their intersections must coincide as a single circle.
