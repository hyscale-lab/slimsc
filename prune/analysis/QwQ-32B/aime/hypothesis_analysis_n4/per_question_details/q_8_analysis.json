          "text1": "Alternatively, since S is 300, maybe we can expand this expression to see if there's a relation with (a + b + c)^3 or something?",
          "text2": "Wait a second, I recall that expressions involving terms like a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 can be factored or related to other symmetric expressions. Let me think. The given expression is symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe there's a way to write this in terms of the sum a + b + c, the sum of products ab + bc + ca, and the product abc?\n\nLet me see. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc. Then, perhaps the given expression can be written in terms of S, P, Q?\n\nLet me try expanding the given expression. Let's see:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n= a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSince b + c = S - a, a + c = S - b, and a + b = S - c, substituting these in:\n\n= a\u00b2(S - a) + b\u00b2(S - b) + c\u00b2(S - c)\n= S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3)\n\nHmm, okay. So the expression can be rewritten as S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3). \n\nBut maybe there's another way to express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3? Let me recall that:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\n\nSo substituting that into the expression:\n\nOriginal expression = S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - [ (S)^3 - 3S(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc ]\n\nHmm, but I also know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - 2P, where P = ab + bc + ca.\n\nSubstituting that into the first term:\n\nOriginal expression = S(S\u00b2 - 2P) - [ S\u00b3 - 3S P + 3Q ]\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst term: S^3 - 2S P\n\nSecond term: - [ S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q ] = -S^3 + 3 S P - 3 Q\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(S^3 - 2 S P) + (-S^3 + 3 S P - 3 Q) = (S^3 - S^3) + (-2 S P + 3 S P) + (-3 Q)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= (0) + (S P) - 3 Q\n\nTherefore, the original expression simplifies to S P - 3 Q.\n\nSo according to this, the given expression equals S*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nTherefore, substituting S = 300, we have:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me write that equation again:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nI need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c satisfying both equations.\n\nHmm, this still looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution or a way to parameterize variables here. Let me think.\n\nSince the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solution might have some symmetry as well. Maybe two variables are equal? Let me consider cases where two variables are equal, or perhaps all three are equal. Let me check if all three can be equal first.\n\nIf a = b = c, then since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation:\n\nab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000\n\nThen 100*(30,000) - (100)^3 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000. Hey, that works! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. So that's one solution.\n\nBut are there others? Since the problem asks for triples, maybe there are more solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different? Let's try that.\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation. Let me denote variables as a, a, c where c = 300 - 2a.\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca = a^2 + a c + a c = a^2 + 2a c.\n\nBut c = 300 - 2a, so:\n\nab + bc + ca = a\u00b2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a\u00b2 + 600a - 4a\u00b2 = -3a\u00b2 + 600a.\n\nThen abc = a * a * c = a\u00b2(300 - 2a).\n\nSo plugging into the second equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) - a\u00b2(300 - 2a)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nSecond term: -a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = -300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(-300a\u00b2 + 60,000a) + (-300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3) =\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a = 2,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a = 1,000,000\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation for integer a.\n\nLet me try possible integer values. Since c = 300 - 2a must be nonnegative, 300 - 2a >= 0 => a <= 150.\n\nSo a is between 0 and 150. Let me see if a=100 is a solution:\n\nPlugging a=100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So yes, a=100 is a root. That's the symmetric solution.\n\nSo (a, a, c) = (100,100,100). But since we set a = b, this is the same as the symmetric case. So perhaps there are other roots?\n\nLet me factor the cubic equation. Since a=100 is a root, we can factor (a - 100):\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100).\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nLet me write the cubic as a\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000.\n\nDivide by (a - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1  -300   30,000   -1,000,000\n\nMultiply 100*1=100, add to -300: -200\n\n100*(-200) = -20,000, add to 30,000: 10,000\n\n100*(10,000) = 1,000,000, add to -1,000,000: 0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000)\n\nTherefore, the equation factors to (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0\n\nSo the roots are a = 100, and roots of a\u00b2 -200a +10,000=0.\n\nLet me solve the quadratic:\n\na = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n200\u00b2 - 40,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.\n\nSo discriminant is zero, so a = 200/(2) = 100. So the quadratic has a double root at a=100. Therefore, the only real root is a=100. Hence, in the case where a = b, the only solution is a = 100, leading to c = 100. So that's the same as the symmetric case.\n\nTherefore, if two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. Hmm, so maybe the only solution with two variables equal is the symmetric case. Hmm, but perhaps there are solutions where all three variables are different?",

So it's a perfect square.\n\nThus, factors as (a - 100)^2. So the cubic is (a - 100)^3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the only real root is a = 100. So if we have a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 100.

Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot at a=100:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply -200*100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000*100 = 1,000,000. Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0. Perfect.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000).\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000.\n\nDiscriminant: (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square.\n\nThus, factors as (a - 100)^2. So the cubic is (a - 100)^3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the only real root is a = 100. So if we have a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 100.
