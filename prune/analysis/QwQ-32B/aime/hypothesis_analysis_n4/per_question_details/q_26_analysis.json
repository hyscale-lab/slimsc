To rationalize:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = 84\u221a14/(11*14) = 6\u221a14/11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the equation of tangent at B is:\n\ny - 0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x - 9).\n\nSimilarly, tangent at C (0,0):\n\nFirst, the radius OC is from O(9/2, 33\u221a14/56) to C(0,0). The slope of OC is (33\u221a14/56 - 0)/(9/2 - 0) = (33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/504 = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nAgain, rationalizing: -84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, equation of tangent at C is:\n\ny - 0 = (-6\u221a14/11)(x - 0) => y = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nNow, to find point D, the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSet the equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x - 9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to simplify:\n\n(x - 9) = -x,\n\nThus, x - 9 = -x,\n\n2x = 9,\n\nx = 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into one of the equations to find y:\n\nUse tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)*(9/2) = (-6\u221a14)*(9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.",

Yes, so slope of OB is -11\u221a14 /84, so tangent at B has slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 84/(11\u221a14 )\n\nSimilarly, the slope of OC is from O (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ) to C (0,0):\n\n\u0394x = -9/2, \u0394y = -33\u221a14 /56,\n\nso slope is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = (-33\u221a14 /56 ) / (-9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56)*(2/9)= (66\u221a14)/504= 11\u221a14 /84.

          "text1": "Wait, if I place C at (0,0), then point B can be at (9,0), since BC =9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0). Let me set point B at (9,0). Then point A is some point (x,y). Then AC = 10, so the distance from A to C (0,0) is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =100. The distance from A to B (9,0) is 5, so \u221a[(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2] =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n2. (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation1:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] =100 -25,\n\nExpand (x -9)^2: x\u00b2 -18x +81,\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +18x -81 - y\u00b2 =75,\n\nSimplify: 18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 75 +81 =156,\n\nx =156/18 =26/3 \u22488.666...\n\nHmm, so x is 26/3. Then y\u00b2 =100 -x\u00b2 =100 - (26/3)^2.\n\nCalculating (26/3)^2: 26\u00b2=676, so 676/9, so y\u00b2= (900 -676)/9 =224/9. Therefore, y= \u00b1\u221a(224/9)= \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Since triangles are typically considered in upper half-plane, let's take y positive: so point A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Okay, so coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nB: (9,0),\n\nC: (0,0).\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. Hmm, so to find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since the circle \u03c9 passes through A, B, C, its center O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Let me find the coordinates of the circumcenter O.\n\nTo find circumcenter O, we can compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nFirst, let's compute the midpoint of AB and the slope of AB, then find the perpendicular bisector.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nMidpoint of AB: [(26/3 +9)/2, (4\u221a14/3 +0)/2]\n\nConvert 9 to 27/3, so x-coordinate: (26/3 +27/3)/2 = (53/3)/2 =53/6,\n\ny-coordinate: (4\u221a14/3)/2 = 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSlope of AB: (0 -4\u221a14/3)/(9 -26/3) = (-4\u221a14/3)/( (27/3 -26/3)) = (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3) = -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite: 1/(4\u221a14).",
          "text2": "Wait, but if I place C at (0,0), and B at (9,0), then point A must satisfy AC=10 and AB=5. Let me see.\n\nLet me try coordinate system. Let me set point C at (0,0). Let me let point B be at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane such that AC = 10 and AB = 5. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet me denote coordinates: Let A = (x,y). Then distance from A to C (0,0) is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A to B (9,0) is \u221a((x-9)^2 + y\u00b2) = 5, so (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 100 => x\u00b2 - 18x + 81 - x\u00b2 = -75 => -18x + 81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x = 156 / 18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen plugging back x = 26/3 into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 => (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 => y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9 => y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, okay. So coordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since the triangle is drawn in the Asymptote code with point C at origin, A at (10,0), but in the problem, AC is 10, so maybe the triangle is oriented such that A is above the x-axis. Let's take y positive, so A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nNow, need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the circumcircle.",
