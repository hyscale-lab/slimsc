However, considering the collinear points D, E, C, F on the x-axis, and C is at (107,0).\n\nLet me check the possible (e,f) pairs and see which ones make sense in terms of the points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), F being collinear in some order.\n\nFirst, let's look at (e,f)=(3,187):\n\nThen E is at (3,0), F is at (187,0). So the order along the x-axis would be D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So all four points are in order from 0 to 187. This is valid.\n\nSecond, (e,f)=(-187, -3):\n\nE is at (-187,0), F at (-3,0). The points D(0,0) is between E and F? Since E is at -187 and F is at -3, so ordering is E(-187), D(0), F(-3)? No, wait F is at -3 which is to the right of D(0)?",

Let me plug these into the circle equation.\n\nAgain, general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y + c =0.\n\nPlugging in D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c =0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + 256 +0 +16 b =0 \u21d2 256 +16b =0 \u21d2 b = -16.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x -16 y =0.\n\nNow plug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a f -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +289 + a f +272 =0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 + a f +561 =0. (1)\n\nPlug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +a e -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +a e +561 =0. (2)\n\nSo equations (1) and (2) must hold. Therefore, both e and f satisfy x\u00b2 + a x +561 =0. Therefore, by Vieta's formula:\n\ne + f = -a,\n\ne*f =561.\n\nAdditionally, from the rectangle EFGH, the distance between E and F is 184. Since they are on the x-axis, |f - e| =184. So f - e = \u00b1184.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nEither f = e +184 or f = e -184,\n\nand e*f =561.\n\nSo let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: f = e +184. Then e*(e +184) =561 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184 e -561 =0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation: e = [ -184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*561) ]/2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 is 33856 (since 180\u00b2=32400, 4*180*4=2880, 4\u00b2=16; (180+4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 + 4\u00b2= 32400+1440+16=33856). Then,\n\nDiscriminant = 33856 +4*561 = 33856 +2244= 36100.\n\nAh, 36100 is 190\u00b2, since 190\u00b2=36100. Therefore,\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1190 ] /2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\ne = ( -184 +190 ) /2 =6/2 =3,\n\nor e = ( -184 -190 ) /2 = (-374)/2 =-187.\n\nSo if e=3, then f =3+184=187,\n\nIf e=-187, then f= -187 +184= -3.\n\nCase 2: f =e -184,\n\nthen e*(e -184)=561 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -184 e -561=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 184\u00b2 +4*561 = same as before, 36100,\n\nso sqrt(36100)=190,\n\nso e= [184 \u00b1190]/2,\n\nso:\n\ne=(184+190)/2=374/2=187,\n\nor e=(184 -190)/2=(-6)/2=-3.\n\nThus f= e-184,\n\nso for e=187, f=187-184=3,\n\nfor e=-3, f= -3 -184= -187.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are symmetric. So the possible pairs (e,f) are (3,187), (-187, -3), (187,3), (-3, -187). However, considering the collinear points D, E, C, F on the x-axis, and C is at (107,0).\n\nLet me check the possible (e,f) pairs and see which ones make sense in terms of the points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), F being collinear in some order.\n\nFirst, let's look at (e,f)=(3,187):\n\nThen E is at (3,0), F is at (187,0). So the order along the x-axis would be D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So all four points are in order from 0 to 187. This is valid.\n\nSecond, (e,f)=(-187, -3):\n\nE is at (-187,0), F at (-3,0). The points D(0,0) is between E and F? Since E is at -187 and F is at -3, so ordering is E(-187), D(0), F(-3)? No, wait F is at -3 which is to the right of D(0)?",
