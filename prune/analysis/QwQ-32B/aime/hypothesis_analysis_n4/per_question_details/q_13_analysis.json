          "text1": "Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work entirely in minutes. Let me see. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: in hours.\n\nTotal time for first case: T1 + t/60 = 4 hours.\n\nTotal time for second case: T2 + t/60 = 2.4 hours.\n\nBut the walking time T1 is the time taken to walk 9 km at speed s, so T1 = 9 / s hours.\n\nSimilarly, T2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equations:\n\nFirst equation: 9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSecond equation: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nNow, we can set up these two equations with two variables (s and t) and solve for them.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nIf we subtract equation 2 from equation 1, we can eliminate t:\n\n(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6\n\nSo:\n\n9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n9*( (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 1.6\n\nWhich simplifies to 9*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6\n\nSo 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6\n\nMultiply both sides by s(s + 2):\n\n18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.6:\n\n18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)\n\n18 divided by 1.6: Let's compute that. 1.6 is 8/5, so 18/(8/5) = 18*(5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25\n\nSo s(s + 2) = 11.25\n\nThus, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nQuadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nSolving for s using quadratic formula:\n\ns = [ -2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2\n\nBecause discriminant is 4 + 4*11.25 = 4 + 45 = 49\n\nSo sqrt(49) = 7.\n\nThus, s = [ -2 + 7 ] / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5, or s = [ -2 -7 ] /2 = -4.5. Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nOkay, so the original speed is 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow, let's find t. Let's plug s = 2.5 back into one of the equations. Let's take equation 1:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSo 9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4\n\nCompute 9 / 2.5: 9 divided by 2.5 is 3.6. Because 2.5*3 =7.5, so 9 -7.5 =1.5, so 1.5/2.5 = 0.6. So total 3.6 hours.\n\nThus, 3.6 + t/60 = 4\n\nSubtract 3.6: t/60 = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by 60: t = 24 minutes.\n\nSo t is 24 minutes. Let me check with the second equation to confirm.\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\ns + 2 is 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h. So 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Then 2 + t/60 = 2.4. Since t is 24, t/60 is 0.4. 2 + 0.4 is 2.4. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nSo now, we need to compute the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. s was 2.5, so adding 0.5 gives 3 km/h.\n\nSo new speed is 3 km/h. Then the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then add t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.\n\nConvert that into minutes: 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204 minutes.",
          "text2": "Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in hours for time, but note that t is in minutes. Let me think. Maybe convert t minutes to hours by dividing by 60. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\nTotal time in first scenario: 4 hours = walking time1 + (t/60) hours.\n\nSimilarly, total time in second scenario: 2 hours 24 minutes. Since 24 minutes is 0.4 hours (because 24/60=0.4), so that's 2.4 hours. So that equals walking time2 + (t/60) hours.\n\nOur goal is to find, when her speed is s + 0.5, the total time (walking time3 + t minutes).\n\nWe need to find s and t first, probably, using the two scenarios given. Let's set up equations.\n\nFirst, the walking time is distance divided by speed. The distance is fixed at 9 km.\n\nSo, in the first scenario, walking time1 = 9 / s hours.\n\nSimilarly, walking time2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.\n\nSo the total time equations are:\n\nFirst scenario: 9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSecond scenario: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nSo now we have two equations with two variables: s and t. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4\n\nHmm, okay, so we can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. Let me try that.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n[9/s - 9/(s + 2)] + [t/60 - t/60] = 4 - 2.4\n\nSimplify:\n\n9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6\n\nSo, 9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n1/s - 1/(s + 2) = ( (s + 2) - s ) / [s(s + 2)] ) = 2 / [s(s + 2)]\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6\n\nSo, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6\n\nTherefore, s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6\n\nLet me compute 18 divided by 1.6. Let's see, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18*(5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25. So,\n\ns(s + 2) = 11.25\n\nSo, expanding the left side: s\u00b2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\ns\u00b2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nLet me solve for s using quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so here a=1, b=2, c= -11.25\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49\n\nSo sqrt(D) =7\n\nTherefore, s = [ -2 \u00b17 ] / (2*1)\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\ns = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5\n\ns = (-2 -7)/2= -9/2= -4.5\n\nBut since speed can't be negative, s=2.5 km/h. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo, s is 2.5 km/h. Now, let's find t.\n\nWe can substitute s back into one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:\n\n9/s + t/60 =4\n\nPlugging s=2.5:\n\n9 / 2.5 + t/60 =4\n\nCompute 9 divided by 2.5: 9 /2.5 = 3.6\n\nSo 3.6 + t/60 =4\n\nSubtract 3.6:\n\nt/60 =0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by 60:\n\nt= 0.4 *60=24 minutes.\n\nSo t is 24 minutes. Let me confirm with equation 2 to be sure.\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s +2) + t/60=2.4\n\ns +2 is 2.5 +2=4.5 km/h\n\n9/4.5 =2. So,\n\n2 + t/60 =2.4\n\nt/60=0.4 \u2192 t=24. Yep, that matches. Good.\n\nSo now we know s=2.5 km/h and t=24 minutes.\n\nNow the question is: when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.\n\nWe need to find the total time, which is walking time + t minutes (24 minutes). Let's compute the walking time first.\n\nWalking time at 3 km/h for 9 km is distance/speed =9/3=3 hours.\n\nThen, adding the t minutes (24 minutes), so total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.\n\nConvert that entirely into minutes to make it easier? Or perhaps keep it in hours?",

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nOkay, so the original speed is 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow, let's find t. Let's plug s = 2.5 back into one of the equations. Let's take equation 1:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4\n\nSo 9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4\n\nCompute 9 / 2.5: 9 divided by 2.5 is 3.6. Because 2.5*3 =7.5, so 9 -7.5 =1.5, so 1.5/2.5 = 0.6.

Since t is 24, t/60 is 0.4. 2 + 0.4 is 2.4. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nSo now, we need to compute the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. s was 2.5, so adding 0.5 gives 3 km/h.\n\nSo new speed is 3 km/h. Then the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then add t minutes, which is 24 minutes.
