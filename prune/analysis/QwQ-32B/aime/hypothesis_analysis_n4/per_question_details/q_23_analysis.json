So, in other words, M is the maximum value such that for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than M. Therefore, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. So we need to find infimum of BD\u00b2, which would be the minimal BD\u00b2 possible. So we need to find the minimal possible BD squared, given all the conditions, and that minimal value is the answer. Because that would be the greatest M such that M is less than all BD squared. If BD squared can get as small as M, then M is the infimum, so the greatest real number less than BD squared for all rhombi is M. So yes, that must be the case.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal BD squared, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n3. a c + b d =0.\n\nSo variables are a, b, c, d with these equations. So perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B on the hyperbola such that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, let me consider parametrizing the hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. A standard parametrization for hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization can be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8).",
          "text2": "Wait, let me read again:\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, in other words, find the maximum M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus ABCD. So M must be a lower bound for BD\u00b2, but the greatest such lower bound. That is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, yes, we need to compute inf BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi as described, and that is the answer. So the question reduces to finding the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), given the constraints from the hyperbola and the rhombus conditions.\n\nLet me see. Let me try to express variables in terms of each other. Let me consider equations from hyperbola and the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nLet me see, from the hyperbola equation for point B: (x2\u00b2)/20 - (y2\u00b2)/24 =1. Let me solve for y2\u00b2: y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2)/20 *24 -24 = (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.",
