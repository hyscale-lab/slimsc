          "text1": "Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in substituting equations?\n\nLet me go back.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nlog_x(y^x)=10 \u2192 x^10 = y^x. Correct.\n\nlog_y(x^{4y})=10 \u2192 y^10 =x^{4y}. Correct.\n\nThen, from first equation, y =x^{10/x}\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\ny^10 = (x^{10/x})^10 =x^{100/x}\n\nWhich equals x^{4y}=x^{4*(x^{10/x})}\n\nTherefore equate exponents: 100/x=4*(x^{10/x})",
          "text2": "Wait a second, so maybe I can express y in terms of x here. Let me see:\n\nFrom the first equation: log_x(y^x)=10 \u21d2 x log_x(y)=10 \u21d2 log_x(y)=10/x \u21d2 y =x^{10/x}\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =10. Applying the same logic: 4y log_y(x)=10 \u21d2 log_y(x) =10/(4y). Then, log_y(x)=10/(4y) \u21d2 x = y^{10/(4y)} = y^{5/(2y)}. \n\nSo now we have two expressions:\n\ny =x^{10/x} (from first equation)\n\nand \n\nx = y^{5/(2y)} (from second equation)\n\nHmm, perhaps substituting one into the other?\n\nLet me substitute the first into the second. Since y =x^{10/x}, plug into the expression for x:\n\nx = [x^{10/x}]^{5/(2y)}}\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled, but let's try to simplify.\n\nFirst, the exponent on the right side is 5/(2y). Since y =x^{10/x}, substituting that gives:\n\nx = [x^{10/x}]^{5/(2 * x^{10/x})}\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\nThe exponent on x is (10/x) multiplied by (5/(2 x^{10/x})) = (50)/(2x * x^{10/x}) = 25/(x^{1 + 10/x})",
