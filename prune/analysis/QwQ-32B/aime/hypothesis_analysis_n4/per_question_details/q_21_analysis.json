Since gcd(s, s-1)=1, so (b-1) must divide s*(s-1), so factors of (b-1) must be distributed between s and s-1.\n\nTherefore, each prime factor of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, the prime factors of (b-1) can't be split between them.",
          "text2": "Wait, so my mistake was in thinking that since (b-1) divides s(s-1) and gcd(s, s-1)=1, then (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) divides s-1. But that's not necessarily true. \n\nLet me see. Let me take an example where (b-1) divides s(s-1) but doesn't divide either s or s-1. \n\nTake the example above, b=13, s=9. Then b-1=12. 12 divides 9*8=72. 12 divides 72, yes. But 12 doesn't divide 9 or 8. So that's a case where (b-1) divides the product, but not either factor. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. So I need to backtrack. \n\nSo, since s and s-1 are coprime, then for (b-1) to divide their product, (b-1) must be a divisor of their product. Since they are coprime, the prime factors of (b-1) must be partitioned between s and s-1. That is, if (b-1) factors into, say, factors a and b where a divides s and b divides s-1, such that a*b = b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can have s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ).",
