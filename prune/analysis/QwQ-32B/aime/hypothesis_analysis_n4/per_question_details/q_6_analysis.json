So yes, f(x) is | |x| - 1/2 |, and g(x) is | |x| - 1/4 |. So, in the expression g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))), we first compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)), which is | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |, then apply g to that, so g of that is | | [f(sin(2\u03c0x))] | - 1/4 |, but since f(sin(2\u03c0x)) is already an absolute value, so actually, it's | (| |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | ) - 1/4 |. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but maybe manageable.\n\nSimilarly, the other function is x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). So similar steps.\n\nGiven that both functions involve trigonometric functions with periods, perhaps the entire system has some periodicity which we can exploit to limit our analysis to a fundamental period and then multiply by the number of periods in a certain interval.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the periods of h(x) and k(y).\n\nStarting with h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))). The inner function sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1. Since f and g are both absolute value functions, which are even functions, so applying them won't change the period. Therefore, the period of h(x) is the same as sin(2\u03c0x), so 1. So h(x) is periodic with period 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the function k(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). The inner function is cos(3\u03c0y). The cosine function has period 2\u03c0/(3\u03c0) = 2/3. So cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3. Again, applying f and g, which are even functions, won't change the period. Therefore, the period of k(y) is 2/3.\n\nTherefore, to find all intersections, we can consider the fundamental periods of x and y. Since h(x) has period 1 in x, and k(y) has period 2/3 in y, the overall system's period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 2/3. The LCM of 1 and 2/3 is 2, since 2 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 1 and 2/3 (since 2/(2/3)=3). So the system repeats every 2 units in x and y.",

Then, applying g and multiplying by 4, the function y(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) still has period 1/2. \n\nSimilarly, for the second equation x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). Let's analyze its period. The inner function cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/(3), because cos(3\u03c0(y + 2/3)) = cos(3\u03c0y + 2\u03c0) = cos(3\u03c0y). But again, taking absolute value inside f and g might affect the period. Let's see:\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3. Then |cos(3\u03c0y)| would have period 1/3, since cos(3\u03c0(y + 1/3)) = cos(3\u03c0y + \u03c0) = -cos(3\u03c0y), so the absolute value would make it equal to |cos(3\u03c0y)|. Therefore, |cos(3\u03c0y)| has period 1/3. Then, applying f to that (i.e., | |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 1/2 |) would retain the period 1/3? Because the operations inside f are just absolute values and shifts, so the period remains the same as |cos(3\u03c0y)|. Then, applying g and scaling by 4 would keep the period as 1/3. Therefore, the function x(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) has period 1/3 in y.\n\nTherefore, the functions y(x) and x(y) have periods 1/2 and 1/3 respectively.
