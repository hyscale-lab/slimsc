So, the total number is the number of paths starting with R plus the number starting with U. \n\nSo let's formalize this. Let's handle both cases:\n\nCase 1: Path starts with Right (R). The runs are R, U, R, U, R. There are three R runs and two U runs. Each run must have at least 1 step. The total right steps must be 8, so the three R runs must sum to 8. Similarly, the two U runs must sum to 8. \n\nThe number of ways to distribute the right steps: this is the number of positive integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c \u22651. Similarly, for the up steps: d + e = 8, with d, e \u22651. \n\nThe number of solutions for the right steps is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, for the up steps, it's C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1). \n\nTherefore, the number of paths starting with R is C(7,2)*C(7,1). \n\nSimilarly, Case 2: Path starts with Up (U). The runs are U, R, U, R, U. Here, there are three U runs and two R runs. So, the U runs must sum to 8, and the R runs must sum to 8. \n\nThe number of ways for U runs: a + b + c =8, so C(7,2). For R runs: d + e =8, so C(7,1). \n\nTherefore, the number of paths starting with U is also C(7,2)*C(7,1). \n\nTherefore, total paths would be 2 * C(7,2)*C(7,1).",
