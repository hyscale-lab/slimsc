          "text1": "Wait, but the problem says \"rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices\". So if you rotate by 0\u00b0, then the blue vertices stay in their original positions, so their positions must have been originally red. Therefore, in that case, the only way that works is if all blue vertices are originally red, i.e., there are no blue vertices. So the case where all vertices are red would satisfy the condition for rotation 0\u00b0, but there are other rotations too.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the existence of any rotation (including the identity) such that when you rotate the blue set, all those rotated positions were originally red. So, the condition is that there exists some rotation r such that r(B) is a subset of R. Since R is the complement of B, this is equivalent to r(B) \u2229 B = \u2205. Because if you rotate B by r and the image is entirely in R, then none of the rotated blue vertices are in B. So, the rotated set doesn't overlap with the original B. Therefore, the condition is that there exists a rotation r where r(B) and B are disjoint.",
          "text2": "Wait, no: if k=0, then the rotation is the identity, so r(S) = S. So the condition would be S \u2286 S^c, which can only happen if S is empty. So, except for the case when S is empty, k=0 won't work. But if S is empty, then all rotations would satisfy the condition trivially, but since the problem is asking for the existence of at least one rotation. So, when S is empty, any rotation works, so that case is counted. \n\nSimilarly, when S is the entire set, then we need that some rotation maps S to a subset of the complement (which is empty), so only possible if S is empty, which it isn't, so that case contributes 0. \n\nSo, the problem is to compute the probability over all subsets S (each vertex independently red or blue, so 2^8 total colorings) that there exists a rotation k (from 0 to 7) such that S rotated by k is contained in the complement of S (i.e., S rotated by k is disjoint from S).",
