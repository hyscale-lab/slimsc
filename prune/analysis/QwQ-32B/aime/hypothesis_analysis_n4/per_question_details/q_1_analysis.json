Let me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then, since log\u2082(x/(y z)) is equal to log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly, the second equation would be log\u2082(y/(x z)) = log\u2082y - log\u2082(x z) = b - (a + c) = 1/3. The third equation is log\u2082(z/(x y)) = log\u2082z - log\u2082(x y) = c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo, by converting to a, b, c variables, which are the logs base 2 of x, y, z respectively, we can turn the system into linear equations. That might be easier because linear systems are straightforward to solve. Let me write that down:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nNow, this is a system of three equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let's try that:\n\nAdding (1) + (2):\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (1/2) + (1/3)\n\nSimplify left side: (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 0 + 0 - 2c = -2c\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6\n\nSo, -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12\n\nHmm, okay.

Similarly, b = log\u2082y, so y = 2^b, and c = log\u2082z, so z = 2^c.\n\nThen, let's rewrite the equations in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Let's compute the argument of the log:\n\nx/(yz) = 2^a / (2^b * 2^c) = 2^{a - b - c}.
