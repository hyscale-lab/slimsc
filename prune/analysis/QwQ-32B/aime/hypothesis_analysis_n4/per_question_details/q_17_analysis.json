          "text2": "Wait, but when I assumed two variables equal, I found that when a = b =2, which gives the higher sum. But perhaps there is a case where all three variables are different that gives a higher sum?\n\nHmm, to check that, perhaps need to consider Lagrange multipliers without assuming symmetry.\n\nLet me try to proceed with the Lagrangian equations again.\n\nWe had:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 1 - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(y z) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 1 - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(x z) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 1 - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(x y) = 0,\n\nSo, the three equations are:\n\n1. 1 = \u03bb(y + z) + \u03bc(y z)\n\n2. 1 = \u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc(x z)\n\n3. 1 = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y)\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n[1 - 1] = \u03bb[(y + z) - (x + z)] + \u03bc[ y z - x z ]\n\n0 = \u03bb(y - x) + \u03bc z (y - x )\n\nSo, 0 = (y -x)( \u03bb + \u03bc z )\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 - 3:\n\n0 = \u03bb( (x + z) - (x + y) ) + \u03bc( x z - x y )\n\n0 = \u03bb(z - y) + \u03bc x ( z - y )\n\n0 = (z - y)( \u03bb + \u03bc x )\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 - 3:\n\n0 = \u03bb( (y + z) - (x + y) ) + \u03bc( y z - x y )\n\n0 = \u03bb(z - x) + \u03bc y ( z - x )\n\n0 = (z - x)( \u03bb + \u03bc y )\n\nTherefore, from these equations, either the differences (y - x), (z - y), (z - x) are zero, or the terms (\u03bb + \u03bc z) etc. are zero.\n\nCase 1: All variables are equal. Then x = y = z. But as we saw earlier, that would require volume 27, which is not 23, so this is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Some variables are equal, others not. Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, from the first subtraction equation, if y = z, then (y - x) could be non-zero, but then (\u03bb + \u03bc z) must be zero. Let's see.\n\nSuppose y = z. Then, from equation 1 and 2:\n\nEquation 1: 1 = \u03bb( y + y ) + \u03bc(y^2 ) \u21d2 1 = 2\u03bb y + \u03bc y\u00b2\n\nEquation 2: 1 = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y )\n\nEquation 3: 1 = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc(x y )\n\nSo equations 2 and 3 become the same. So, we have two equations:\n\n1 = 2\u03bb y + \u03bc y\u00b2,\n\n1 = \u03bb(x + y) + \u03bc x y.\n\nAlso, the constraints are:\n\nSurface area: xy + y^2 + x y = 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2 =27 (",
