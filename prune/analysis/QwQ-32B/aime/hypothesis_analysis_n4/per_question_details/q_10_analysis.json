Therefore, the set A would consist of the numbers (positions +1) where the 1s are in the binary expansion of 2024. Then the sum of the elements of A would be the sum over those (positions +1).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the key is to write 2024 in binary, find the positions of the 1s, add 1 to each of those positions, and sum them up. Let me check this approach.\n\nFirst, let me compute the binary representation of 2024.\n\nLet me divide 2024 by 2 repeatedly:\n\n2024 \u00f7 2 = 1012, remainder 0\n\n1012 \u00f7 2 = 506, remainder 0\n\n506 \u00f72 = 253, rem 0\n\n253 \u00f72 =126, rem 1\n\n126 \u00f72 =63, rem 0\n\n63 \u00f72 =31, rem 1\n\n31 \u00f72 =15, rem 1\n\n15 \u00f72 =7, rem 1\n\n7 \u00f72 =3, rem 1\n\n3 \u00f72 =1, rem 1\n\n1 \u00f72 =0, rem 1.\n\nSo writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.",
