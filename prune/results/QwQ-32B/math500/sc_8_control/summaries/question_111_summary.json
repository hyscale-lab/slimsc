      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers with some geometric and arithmetic subsequence conditions. The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, they tell us that a_{13} = 2016, and we need to find a_1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The sequence is strictly increasing, so each term is larger than the one before. The conditions are on every triplet of terms, but alternating between geometric and arithmetic depending on their positions. Let me rephrase the conditions:\n\nFor any k, the three terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric progression. That means the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. So, (a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}.\n\nSimilarly, the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic progression. So the difference between consecutive terms is constant here. Therefore, 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}.\n\nAlright, so every odd-indexed term followed by the next two terms forms a geometric sequence, and every even-indexed term followed by the next two forms an arithmetic sequence. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each subsequent term must be larger than the previous.\n\nGiven that a_{13} is 2016, we need to find a_1. Since 13 is an odd index, maybe we can work backwards? Or maybe build the sequence step by step up to the 13th term?\n\nLet me try to write out the relationships for some specific k to see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me start by considering k=1. Then:\n\nFirst triplet (geometric): a_1, a_2, a_3. So, (a_2)^2 = a_1 * a_3.\n\nSecond triplet (arithmetic): a_2, a_3, a_4. So, 2a_3 = a_2 + a_4.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2:\n\nTriplet 1: a_3, a_4, a_5 (geometric) => (a_4)^2 = a_3 * a_5.\n\nTriplet 2: a_4, a_5, a_6 (arithmetic) => 2a_5 = a_4 + a_6.\n\nContinuing this way, for each k, we can write similar equations.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can express each term in terms of the previous ones and find a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a repeating pattern or a way to express terms in terms of a_1 and some ratio or common difference?\n\nWait, since every odd-even-odd triplet is geometric, and every even-odd-even triplet is arithmetic, maybe the sequence has a periodic structure? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I can express the terms in terms of a_1 and some variables, then find a relation using the given a_{13}=2016.\n\nLet me try to write down the first few terms in terms of a_1 and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me start with a_1. Let's call that term a.\n\nThen, let's define a_2 as some term, say b.\n\nSince a_1, a_2, a_3 form a geometric progression, so (a_2)^2 = a_1 * a_3. Therefore, a_3 = (a_2)^2 / a_1 = b\u00b2 / a.\n\nBut since all terms are integers, this implies that a must divide b\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the next triplet is a_2, a_3, a_4 which is arithmetic. Therefore, 2a_3 = a_2 + a_4. So, a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2*(b\u00b2/a) - b.\n\nAgain, since a_4 must be an integer, so 2*(b\u00b2)/a - b must be an integer. So 2b\u00b2 - ab must be divisible by a. Let's see:\n\nWait, 2*(b\u00b2/a) - b = (2b\u00b2 - ab)/a. Therefore, (2b\u00b2 - ab) must be divisible by a. So, 2b\u00b2 - ab = a*(2b\u00b2/a - b). Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Let's note that 2b\u00b2 must be divisible by a, since the first term is 2b\u00b2/a, which must be integer, so a divides 2b\u00b2. Since a divides b\u00b2, as we saw earlier, then a divides 2b\u00b2 is automatically satisfied, but perhaps more constraints?\n\nHmm, maybe proceeding step by step.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNow, the next triplet starting at a_3 is a_3, a_4, a_5, which must be geometric again. So (a_4)^2 = a_3 * a_5.\n\nTherefore, a_5 = (a_4)^2 / a_3.\n\nSimilarly, since a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2, so substituting that in:\n\na_5 = ( (2a_3 - a_2)^2 ) / a_3.\n\nBut a_3 is b\u00b2/a, so substituting that:\n\na_5 = ( (2*(b\u00b2/a) - b)^2 ) / (b\u00b2/a )\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, compute 2a_3 - a_2: that's 2*(b\u00b2/a) - b.\n\nLet me write this as (2b\u00b2 - ab)/a.\n\nThen, squaring that gives (2b\u00b2 - ab)^2 / a\u00b2.\n\nDivide by a_3, which is b\u00b2/a, so the entire expression becomes [ (2b\u00b2 - ab)^2 / a\u00b2 ] / (b\u00b2/a ) = (2b\u00b2 - ab)^2 / (a\u00b2) * a / b\u00b2 = (2b\u00b2 - ab)^2 / (a b\u00b2).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe this approach is going to involve too many variables. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence has a repeating pattern every two terms? Let me think. Since the geometric and arithmetic conditions alternate, maybe there's a way to express terms in terms of the previous two?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is such that the odd terms form a geometric progression and the even terms form an arithmetic progression? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the terms in terms of a_1 and a_2, then find a recurrence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a general formula for a_n in terms of a_1 and some ratio or difference.\n\nWait, let's try writing the first few terms in terms of a_1 and a_2, then see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let a\u2081 = x (this is the value we need to find, so maybe we can express everything in terms of x and set up an equation when we reach a\u2081\u2083 = 2016).\n\nLet\u2019s let a\u2082 = y.\n\nNow, since a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 form a geometric progression, so (a\u2082)\u00b2 = a\u2081 * a\u2083 \u21d2 a\u2083 = y\u00b2 / x.\n\nThen, the next triplet a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084 is arithmetic, so 2a\u2083 = a\u2082 + a\u2084 \u21d2 a\u2084 = 2a\u2083 - a\u2082 = 2(y\u00b2/x) - y.\n\nThen, moving on, the next triplet a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085 must be geometric. So (a\u2084)\u00b2 = a\u2083 * a\u2085 \u21d2 a\u2085 = (a\u2084)\u00b2 / a\u2083.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\na\u2085 = [ (2(y\u00b2/x) - y) ]\u00b2 / (y\u00b2/x )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, let me write a\u2084 as (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x (since 2(y\u00b2/x) - y = (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x).\n\nTherefore, a\u2084 squared is (2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / x\u00b2.\n\nDivided by a\u2083 which is y\u00b2/x, so:\n\na\u2085 = [ (2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / x\u00b2 ] / ( y\u00b2/x ) = [ (2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / x\u00b2 ] * [ x / y\u00b2 ] = (2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / (x y\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, that's still complicated, but let's see if we can simplify:\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n(2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 = [ y(2y - x) ]^2 = y\u00b2 (2y - x)^2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2085 becomes [ y\u00b2 (2y - x)^2 ) / (x y\u00b2 ) ] = (2y - x)^2 / x.\n\nSo, a\u2085 = (2y - x)^2 / x.\n\nOkay, that's a bit better.\n\nNow, moving on to the next triplet, which is a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086. This must be an arithmetic sequence, so 2a\u2085 = a\u2084 + a\u2086 \u21d2 a\u2086 = 2a\u2085 - a\u2084.\n\nSubstituting the known terms:\n\na\u2086 = 2*( (2y - x)^2 / x ) - (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2*(2y - x)^2 / x.\n\nSecond term: (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x.\n\nTherefore, a\u2086 = [ 2(2y - x)^2 - (2y\u00b2 - xy) ] / x.\n\nLet me expand 2(2y - x)^2:\n\n2*(4y\u00b2 -4xy + x\u00b2) = 8y\u00b2 -8xy + 2x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract (2y\u00b2 - xy):\n\nSo 8y\u00b2 -8xy + 2x\u00b2 -2y\u00b2 + xy = (8y\u00b2 -2y\u00b2) + (-8xy + xy) + 2x\u00b2 = 6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2.\n\nThus, a\u2086 = (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)/x = (6y\u00b2)/x -7y + 2x.\n\nHmm, okay, moving on.\n\nNow, the next triplet is a\u2085, a\u2086, a\u2087, which must be geometric. So (a\u2086)^2 = a\u2085 * a\u2087 \u21d2 a\u2087 = (a\u2086)^2 / a\u2085.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute a\u2086 squared over a\u2085:\n\na\u2086 squared is [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)/x ]^2 divided by a\u2085 which is (2y - x)^2 / x.\n\nSo,\n\na\u2087 = [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)^2 / x\u00b2 ] / [ (2y - x)^2 / x ]\n\n= [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)^2 / x\u00b2 ] * [ x / (2y - x)^2 ]\n\n= [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)^2 / x ] / (2y - x)^2\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe there is a pattern here that I can exploit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can look for a recursive relation between the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we can find a relationship between x and y such that all terms are integers and the sequence is strictly increasing. Since the problem states that it's a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers, so each term must be an integer greater than the previous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assume that the terms follow a certain pattern. Let me see if there is a way to make this simpler by assuming that the ratios and differences are integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence can be expressed in terms of a geometric progression followed by an arithmetic progression, repeating?\n\nWait, maybe if we look at the terms in pairs. Let me see:\n\nStarting with a1, a2, a3 (geometric), then a2, a3, a4 (arithmetic), then a3, a4, a5 (geometric), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write equations for the terms in terms of a1 and a2, then express a13 in terms of a1 and a2, set it equal to 2016, and solve for a1. Since the problem gives a13, which is an odd index, maybe this is manageable.\n\nBut since the expressions get complicated, perhaps there's a pattern every two steps?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there is a way to express terms in terms of previous terms. Let me try to see if the terms can be written in terms of a1 and a2 with some recurrence.\n\nLooking back at the first few terms:\n\na1 = x\n\na2 = y\n\na3 = y\u00b2/x\n\na4 = 2a3 - a2 = 2*(y\u00b2/x) - y\n\na5 = (a4)^2 / a3 = [ (2y\u00b2/x - y)^2 ] / (y\u00b2/x ) = (2y - x)^2 / x\n\na6 = 2a5 - a4 = 2*( (2y - x)^2 / x ) - [2y\u00b2/x - y ]\n\nWait, let me re-express a6 as I did before: (6y\u00b2 -7xy + 2x\u00b2)/x.\n\nHmm, perhaps if I can write terms in terms of previous terms, but maybe the expressions are getting too complex. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence has a period of 4? Let me see:\n\nWait, let's suppose that the sequence follows a pattern where every four terms can be expressed in terms of the first two. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the even terms form an arithmetic progression and the odd terms form a geometric progression? Let me test this idea.\n\nSuppose that the odd terms are a geometric sequence and the even terms are an arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet me see if this works.\n\nSuppose odd terms: a1, a3, a5, a7,... form a geometric progression with common ratio r.\n\nSo, a3 = a1 * r, a5 = a3 * r = a1*r^2, etc.\n\nEven terms: a2, a4, a6,... form an arithmetic progression with common difference d.\n\nSo, a4 = a2 + d, a6 = a2 + 2d, etc.\n\nBut let's see if this satisfies the given conditions.\n\nFirst, check the geometric condition for a1, a2, a3.\n\nBut according to the problem, a1, a2, a3 must form a geometric progression. So, a2^2 = a1 * a3.\n\nBut if a3 = a1*r, then a2^2 = a1*(a1*r) \u21d2 a2^2 = a1^2 * r \u21d2 a2 = a1 * sqrt(r). But since a2 must be an integer, sqrt(r) must be rational, but this complicates things. Also, the even terms are supposed to be arithmetic. Let's see if that works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this assumption isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the even terms form a geometric progression and the odd terms form an arithmetic progression? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relation where each term is a function of the previous term?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled with a system of equations where each term is related to the prior terms. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for a recursive formula. Let me try to write down the first few terms in terms of a1 and a2, then see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet me write down the terms step by step:\n\nLet\u2019s denote a\u2081 = x, a\u2082 = y.\n\nThen:\n\na\u2083 = (a\u2082)\u00b2 / a\u2081 = y\u00b2 / x.\n\na\u2084 = 2a\u2083 - a\u2082 = 2(y\u00b2/x) - y = (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x.\n\na\u2085 = (a\u2084)\u00b2 / a\u2083 = [(2y\u00b2 - xy)/x]^2 / (y\u00b2/x) = [(2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / x\u00b2] * [x / y\u00b2] = (2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 / (x y\u00b2).\n\nWait, but earlier, I had simplified that to (2y - x)^2 / x. Let me confirm that:\n\nWait, (2y\u00b2 - xy) can be factored as y(2y - x). So:\n\n(2y\u00b2 - xy)^2 = y\u00b2 (2y - x)^2. Therefore,\n\n[(2y\u00b2 - xy)^2]/(x y\u00b2) = [y\u00b2(2y -x)^2]/(x y\u00b2) ) = (2y -x)^2 / x. Yes, that's correct. So a\u2085 = (2y - x)^2 / x.\n\nThen, a\u2086 = 2a\u2085 - a\u2084.\n\nPlugging in:\n\na\u2085 = (2y - x)^2 / x,\n\na\u2084 = (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x,\n\nso,\n\na\u2086 = 2*( (2y -x)^2 / x ) - (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n2*(2y -x)^2 - (2y\u00b2 - xy)\n\nFirst expand (2y -x)^2: 4y\u00b2 -4xy +x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by 2: 8y\u00b2 -8xy + 2x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract (2y\u00b2 -xy): 8y\u00b2 -8xy +2x\u00b2 -2y\u00b2 +xy = 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2086 = (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that as a\u2086 = (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x.\n\nProceeding further, a\u2085, a\u2086, a\u2087 must form a geometric progression. Therefore, (a\u2086)^2 = a\u2085 * a\u2087 \u21d2 a\u2087 = (a\u2086)^2 / a\u2085.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute a\u2086 squared divided by a\u2085.\n\na\u2086 squared is [(6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x]^2.\n\nDivided by a\u2085 which is (2y -x)^2/x.\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u2087 = [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)^2 / x\u00b2 ] / [ (2y -x)^2 / x ] = [ (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)^2 / x\u00b2 ] * [x / (2y -x)^2 ] = (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)^2 / [x*(2y -x)^2 ]\n\nHmm, that's quite complex. Let me see if I can factor the numerator.\n\nLooking at the numerator: 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2. Let me see if that factors.\n\nLet me treat this as a quadratic in y: 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2.\n\nLooking for factors of 6*2x\u00b2 =12x\u00b2 that add up to -7x. Let's see:\n\nFactors of 12x\u00b2 that add to -7x: -3x and -4x?\n\nWait, 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to factor:\n\n(3y - a x)(2y - b x) = 6y\u00b2 - (3b +2a)xy +ab x\u00b2.\n\nWe need 3b +2a =7 and ab=2.\n\nLooking for integers a and b such that ab=2 and 3b +2a=7.\n\nPossible pairs for a and b (positive integers since terms are increasing):\n\na=1, b=2: 3*2 +2*1=6+2=8 \u22607.\n\na=2, b=1: 3*1 +2*2=3+4=7. Bingo!\n\nTherefore, 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2 = (3y - 2x)(2y -1x).\n\nTherefore, 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2 = (3y -2x)(2y -x).\n\nTherefore, the numerator (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)^2 = [(3y -2x)(2y -x)]^2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2087 = [ (3y -2x)^2 (2y -x)^2 ] / [x*(2y -x)^2 ] = (3y -2x)^2 / x.\n\nTherefore, a\u2087 = (3y - 2x)^2 / x.\n\nHmm, okay, that's a bit better.\n\nContinuing, the next triplet is a\u2086, a\u2087, a\u2088 which must be arithmetic. Therefore, 2a\u2087 = a\u2086 + a\u2088 \u21d2 a\u2088 = 2a\u2087 - a\u2086.\n\nSubstituting:\n\na\u2087 = (3y - 2x)^2 / x,\n\na\u2086 = (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x,\n\nso,\n\na\u2088 = 2*( (3y -2x)^2 /x ) - (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n2*(3y -2x)^2 - (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)\n\nFirst expand (3y -2x)^2: 9y\u00b2 -12xy +4x\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by 2: 18y\u00b2 -24xy +8x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2): 18y\u00b2 -24xy +8x\u00b2 -6y\u00b2 +7xy -2x\u00b2 =\n\n(18y\u00b2 -6y\u00b2) + (-24xy +7xy) + (8x\u00b2 -2x\u00b2) =\n\n12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2088 = (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)/x.\n\nHmm, proceeding further, the next triplet is a\u2087, a\u2088, a\u2089 must be geometric. Therefore, (a\u2088)^2 = a\u2087 *a\u2089 \u21d2 a\u2089 = (a\u2088)^2 /a\u2087.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\na\u2088 squared divided by a\u2087:\n\n[ (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)/x ]^2 / [ (3y -2x)^2 /x ]\n\n= [ (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)^2 / x\u00b2 ] / [ (3y -2x)^2 /x ]\n\n= [ (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)^2 /x\u00b2 ] * [x / (3y -2x)^2 ]\n\n= (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)^2 / [x*(3y -2x)^2 ]\n\nHmm, again, maybe the numerator factors?\n\nLet me see if 12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2 can be factored.\n\nTreat as quadratic in y:\n\n12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2.\n\nLooking for factors of 12*6x\u00b2=72x\u00b2 that add to -17x.\n\nHmm, let me try:\n\n(4y - 3x)(3y - 2x) = 12y\u00b2 -8xy -9xy +6x\u00b2 =12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2. Yes, that works!\n\nTherefore, 12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2 = (4y -3x)(3y -2x).\n\nTherefore, numerator squared is [(4y -3x)(3y -2x)]^2.\n\nThus, a\u2089 = [ (4y -3x)^2 (3y -2x)^2 ] / [x*(3y -2x)^2 ] = (4y -3x)^2 / x.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (4y -3x)^2 /x.\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na1 = x\n\na2 = y\n\na3 = (y)^2 / x\n\na4 = (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x = y(2y -x)/x\n\nWait, but maybe expressed as (2y -x) * (y/x). Hmm.\n\nBut let's look at the terms that are odd indices:\n\na1 = x\n\na3 = y\u00b2/x\n\na5 = (2y -x)^2/x\n\na7 = (3y - 2x)^2/x\n\na9 = (4y -3x)^2/x\n\nHmm, so the coefficients of y and x in the numerator seem to follow a pattern.\n\nLooking at the numerators:\n\nFor a3: y\u00b2 = (1*y -0*x)^2\n\nWait, a3 is (y)^2/x, so numerator is y squared.\n\nWait, but starting from a5:\n\na5: (2y -x)^2 /x\n\na7: (3y -2x)^2 /x\n\na9: (4y -3x)^2 /x\n\nSo the coefficients for the terms in the numerator for the odd indices beyond a3 are:\n\nFor a5: 2y -x \u2192 coefficients (2, -1)\n\na7: 3y -2x \u2192 (3, -2)\n\na9: 4y -3x \u2192 (4, -3)\n\nSo the coefficients of y and x in the numerator for a_{2k+1} seem to be (k+1, -k). Let's check:\n\nAt a5, which is the third odd term (since a1 is first, a3 is second, a5 is third?), Wait actually:\n\nWait, a1 is the first term, so the odd terms are a1 (1st), a3 (2nd), a5 (3rd), a7 (4th), etc. So for the nth odd term, the coefficient would be (n+1, -n). For example:\n\na3 (2nd odd term): 2y -x \u2192 (2, -1). Hmm, n=2 gives (3, -2), but that doesn't fit. Wait maybe my indexing is off.\n\nAlternatively, for a_{2k+1}:\n\nLooking at a3 (k=1): (2y -x)^2/x \u2192 coefficients (2, -1)\n\na5 (k=2): (3y -2x)^2/x \u2192 (3, -2)\n\na7 (k=3): (4y -3x)^2/x \u2192 (4, -3)\n\nSo for a_{2k+1}, the numerator is ( (k+1)y -k x )\u00b2. So yes, the pattern is that for a_{2k+1}, it's ( (k+1)y -k x ) squared over x.\n\nTherefore, generalizing, a_{2k+1} = [ ( (k+1)y -k x )\u00b2 ] / x.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the even terms:\n\na2 = y\n\na4 = (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x = (2y -x)y /x\n\nWait, but let's see the even terms:\n\na2 = y\n\na4 = (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x = (2y -x)y/x\n\na6 = (6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2)/x. Wait, but earlier we saw that 6y\u00b2 -7xy +2x\u00b2 factors into (3y -2x)(2y -x). So a6 = (3y -2x)(2y -x)/x\n\nSimilarly, a6 = (3y - 2x)(2y -x)/x.\n\nSimilarly, a8 is (12y\u00b2 -17xy +6x\u00b2)/x, which factors into (4y -3x)(3y -2x)/x. So:\n\na4 = (2y -x)/x * y\n\nWait, perhaps the even terms can also be expressed in terms of previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here for even terms:\n\na2 = y\n\na4 = (2y -x) * y /x\n\na6 = (3y -2x)*(2y -x)/x\n\na8 = (4y -3x)*(3y -2x)/x\n\nHmm, so each even term seems to be a product of terms like (k y - (k-1)x) times previous terms, divided by x? Let me see:\n\na4: (2y -x) * y /x\n\na6: (3y -2x)*(2y -x)/x\n\na8: (4y -3x)*(3y -2x)/x\n\nSo the pattern for even terms a_{2k} would be:\n\na_{2k} = [ (k y - (k-1)x ) * ( (k-1)y - (k-2)x ) * ... * (2y -x) ) ] / x^{k-1} } ?\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each even term can be written as the product of terms up to that point divided by some factor. Alternatively, since the even terms follow an arithmetic progression with the previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, given that the even terms are part of arithmetic sequences, maybe they form an arithmetic progression themselves?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLooking at a2, a4, a6, a8:\n\na2 = y\n\na4 = (2y\u00b2 - xy)/x = (2y -x)y/x\n\na6 = (3y -2x)(2y -x)/x\n\na8 = (4y -3x)(3y -2x)/x\n\nHmm, let me compute these terms numerically in terms of x and y, perhaps with some substitution to see if they form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose I pick specific values for x and y to see if a pattern emerges. Let me see if I can choose x and y such that the terms are integers and the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nLet me suppose that x and y are such that the fractions become integers. For example, let me suppose that x divides y\u00b2 (since a3 = y\u00b2/x must be integer). Let me set x = 1. Then, let's see.\n\nWait, but maybe that's too arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps there is a relation between x and y such that each term is integer.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives a13 = 2016, which is an odd-indexed term, so a13 is of the form [ ( (k+1)y -k x )\u00b2 ] /x, where k corresponds to the term's position. Let's see:\n\nWait, a13 is the 7th odd term (since starting from a1 as the first odd term, then a3 is second, a5 third, a7 fourth, a9 fifth, a11 sixth, a13 seventh). So for a_{2*6 +1}= a13, so k=6. So according to the pattern above, a_{13} = [ (7y -6x)^2 ] / x.\n\nTherefore, according to the problem, this equals 2016. So:\n\n(7y -6x)^2 /x = 2016.\n\nTherefore, (7y -6x)^2 = 2016x.\n\nHmm, so that's an equation involving x and y. Also, since all terms must be integers and the sequence is strictly increasing, we have constraints that each term must be an integer and each subsequent term is larger than the prior.\n\nAdditionally, we can find relations between x and y from previous terms. Let me see.\n\nAlso, note that a_{2k} terms must also be integers. For example, a2 = y must be an integer, which it is since it's part of the sequence. a4 must be integer: (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x must be integer. Which requires that x divides 2y\u00b2 -xy, which is equivalent to x divides 2y\u00b2.\n\nSince x divides y\u00b2 (from a3 = y\u00b2/x being integer), so x divides 2y\u00b2 is automatically true. But maybe more constraints?\n\nSimilarly, proceeding further, each term must be integer. So the terms like a6, a8, etc., must also be integers, which would impose more conditions on x and y.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find x and y such that (7y -6x)^2 =2016x, and also ensuring that all previous terms are integers and the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nAdditionally, the sequence must be strictly increasing, so each term must be larger than the previous. Let's see:\n\na1 =x,\n\na2 = y must be greater than x,\n\na3 = y\u00b2/x must be greater than y,\n\nso y\u00b2/x > y \u21d2 y >x,\n\nso since y >x, that's consistent with a2 >a1.\n\nSimilarly, a4 must be greater than a3:\n\na4 = (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x = (2y\u00b2/x - y). Since y >x, let me see:\n\nLet me write a4 = 2*(y\u00b2/x) - y. Since y\u00b2/x =a3, which is greater than y, so 2a3 - y must be greater than a3 \u21d2 2a3 - y >a3 \u21d2 a3 > y. Which is true because a3 = y\u00b2/x and since y >x, then y\u00b2/x > y (because y/x >1, so y*(y/x) > y). So yes, a4 will be greater than a3.\n\nContinuing, each subsequent term must be increasing. So perhaps as long as the terms are defined properly, the sequence will be increasing.\n\nBut to make this manageable, let me focus on the equation (7y -6x)^2 =2016x.\n\nLet me denote that as:\n\nLet\u2019s set (7y -6x)^2 =2016x.\n\nLet me denote that equation (1).\n\nOur variables are positive integers x and y, with y >x (since a2 >a1), and also we need other terms to be integers, so the terms like a3, a4, etc., must be integers. Since a3 = y\u00b2/x must be integer, so x divides y\u00b2. Similarly, a4 = (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x must be integer, which is equivalent to x divides (2y\u00b2 -xy) \u21d2 x divides 2y\u00b2 (since x divides y\u00b2, so x divides 2y\u00b2 is automatically true). So perhaps the main constraints are that x divides y\u00b2 and the equation (1).\n\nLet me see if I can express y in terms of x, or vice versa.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote D =7y -6x. Then D^2 =2016x \u21d2 D = sqrt(2016x). Since D must be an integer, so 2016x must be a perfect square. Therefore, 2016x is a perfect square. Let me factor 2016 to see what x must be.\n\nFactorizing 2016:\n\n2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^1.\n\nTherefore, 2016x = 2^5 *3^2 *7^1 *x.\n\nTo make this a perfect square, all exponents in the prime factorization must be even. Therefore:\n\n- For prime 2: exponent is 5 + exponent of 2 in x. Must be even \u21d2 exponent of 2 in x must be odd (since 5 + odd = even).\n\n- For prime 3: exponent is 2 + exponent of 3 in x. Must be even \u21d2 exponent of 3 in x must be even (since 2 + even = even).\n\n- For prime 7: exponent is 1 + exponent of 7 in x. Must be even \u21d2 exponent of 7 in x must be odd (since 1 + odd = even).\n\nAdditionally, any other primes in x must have even exponents to keep the total exponents even.\n\nTherefore, x must be of the form:\n\nx = 2^{odd} * 3^{even} *7^{odd} * (other primes)^{even exponents}.\n\nBut since x is a positive integer, and we want minimal terms perhaps? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is likely designed to have an integer answer, perhaps x is a factor of 2016 multiplied by some squares?\n\nAlternatively, let me set x = 2^{a} *3^{b}*7^{c}*... such that:\n\na must be odd,\n\nb must be even,\n\nc must be odd,\n\nand other primes have even exponents.\n\nTherefore, the minimal x would be 2^1 *3^0 *7^1 = 14, but maybe other factors. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that x is of the form (2^1 *7^1)*k^2, where k is an integer. Then, x =14k\u00b2, so that the exponents:\n\nFor 2: 1 (from 14) plus 2*(exponent in k) \u21d2 must be odd \u21d2 1 + even is odd, so that works.\n\nFor 7: 1 (from 14) plus 2*(exponent in k) \u21d2 must be odd \u21d2 1 + even is odd, so that works.\n\nFor 3: exponent in x is 0 plus 2*(exponent in k). To keep it even, which it is. So that works.\n\nSo x=14k\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set variables such that D =7y -6x = m, so m^2 =2016x \u21d2 x = m\u00b2/(2016).\n\nSince x must be an integer, m\u00b2 must be divisible by 2016. Therefore, m must be divisible by sqrt(2016). Since 2016=2^5*3^2*7, sqrt(2016)= 2^(2.5)*3*sqrt(7). Not integer, so m must be divisible by 2^3*3*7= 168, because 168\u00b2=28224, which is divisible by 2016. Wait, perhaps m must be a multiple of the square root of 2016's radical part.\n\nAlternatively, to make m\u00b2 divisible by 2016, m must be divisible by the product of primes with exponents rounded up to the next even.\n\nWait, let me think again. To make m\u00b2 divisible by 2^5*3^2*7^1, then m must be divisible by 2^3 *3^1 *7^1, because:\n\nThe exponent of 2 in m must be at least ceil(5/2)=3,\n\nExponent of 3 must be at least ceil(2/2)=1,\n\nExponent of 7 must be at least ceil(1/2)=1.\n\nThus, m must be divisible by 2^3 *3^1 *7^1 = 8*3*7 = 168.\n\nTherefore, m=168n, where n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into x:\n\nx = m\u00b2 /2016 = (168n)^2 /2016 = (28224 n\u00b2)/2016 = 14 n\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, x must be 14n\u00b2, where n is a positive integer, and m=168n.\n\nTherefore, D = m =168n,\n\nSo, D =7y -6x =168n,\n\nBut x=14n\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, 7y -6*(14n\u00b2)=168n,\n\nSimplify:\n\n7y =168n +84n\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by7:\n\ny=24n +12n\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, y =12n\u00b2 +24n.\n\nSo now, we can express y in terms of n, and x in terms of n.\n\nSo x=14n\u00b2,\n\ny=12n\u00b2 +24n.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that all terms in the sequence are integers and strictly increasing. Let's check these conditions.\n\nFirst, check that a3 = y\u00b2/x must be integer.\n\nCompute a3:\n\na3 = y\u00b2 /x = (12n\u00b2 +24n)^2 / (14n\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n(12n\u00b2 +24n)^2 = [12n(n +2)]^2 = 144n\u00b2(n+2)^2.\n\nTherefore, a3 =144n\u00b2(n+2)^2 /14n\u00b2 = (144/14)(n+2)^2 = (72/7)(n+2)^2.\n\nHmm, but 72/7 is not an integer. Wait, that's a problem. Because a3 must be an integer. Therefore, this suggests that our assumption might have an error, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate a3.\n\nWait, numerator is (12n\u00b2 +24n)^2:\n\nLet me compute (12n\u00b2 +24n)^2:\n\n= (12n(n + 2))\u00b2 = 144n\u00b2(n +2)^2,\n\nYes, so divided by x=14n\u00b2,\n\ngives (144/14)(n+2)^2 = (72/7)(n+2)^2.\n\nHmm, which is not an integer unless 7 divides (n+2)^2. Since 7 is prime, 7 divides (n+2). Therefore, n+2 must be a multiple of 7. Let me set n+2 =7k, so n=7k -2. Then, (n+2)^2 =49k\u00b2, so 72/7 *49k\u00b2 =72*7 k\u00b2= 504k\u00b2, which is integer.\n\nTherefore, to have a3 integer, we need n+2 divisible by 7 \u21d2 n \u22615 mod7.\n\nTherefore, n must be congruent to 5 mod7. Let me set n=7k -2 for some integer k \u22651 (since n must be positive; when k=1, n=5, which is okay).\n\nWait, n must be positive. Let me see, if n=7k -2, then to have n>0, 7k -2 >0 \u21d2k \u22651 (since k=1 gives n=5, which is okay).\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to write n=7m -2, where m is a positive integer. Let me proceed.\n\nLet me set n=7m -2, where m\u22651.\n\nThen, n=7m -2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx=14n\u00b2=14*(7m -2)^2,\n\ny=12n\u00b2 +24n=12*(7m -2)^2 +24*(7m -2).\n\nHmm, this might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of parameterizing with n, we can see that since 7 divides (n+2), let me let n =7k -2, then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe pick n such that n+2 is divisible by7, so n=5,12,19,...\n\nLet me try the minimal n which is n=5 (since n must be at least 1, but n=5 is the first n where n+2 is 7).\n\nLet me test n=5:\n\nThen,\n\nx=14*(5)^2=14*25=350,\n\ny=12*(5)^2 +24*5=12*25 +120=300+120=420.\n\nSo x=350, y=420.\n\nCheck a3 = y\u00b2/x = (420)^2 /350 = (176400)/350 = 176400 \u00f7350.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 17640/35= 17640 \u00f735= 504.\n\nYes, 35*504=17640, so a3=504. That's integer.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nNow, check a4 = (2y\u00b2 -xy)/x.\n\nCompute 2y\u00b2 -xy:\n\n2*(420)^2 -350*420.\n\nFirst compute 420\u00b2=176400,\n\n2*176400=352800,\n\n350*420=147000,\n\nSo 352800 -147000=205800.\n\nDivide by x=350:\n\n205800/350 = 205800 \u00f7350 = 588.\n\nSo a4=588.\n\nCheck if a4 >a3: 588>504, yes.\n\nNext, a5=(2y -x)^2/x.\n\nWait, according to previous terms, a5=(2y -x)^2/x. Let me compute:\n\n2y -x =2*420 -350=840 -350=490,\n\n(490)^2=240100,\n\nDivide by x=350: 240100 /350 = 240100 \u00f7350 = 686.\n\nSo a5=686. Which is greater than a4=588? Wait no, 686>588? Wait 686 is greater than 588, yes. Wait 686-588=98, so yes, increasing.\n\nProceeding to a6=2a5 -a4=2*686 -588=1372 -588=784.\n\nCheck a6=784>686, yes.\n\nThen a7=(3y -2x)^2/x.\n\n3y -2x=3*420 -2*350=1260 -700=560,\n\n560 squared is 313600,\n\ndivided by 350: 313600 /350 = 896.\n\na7=896>784, good.\n\na8=2a7 -a6=2*896 -784=1792-784=1008.\n\na8=1008>896, okay.\n\na9=(4y -3x)^2/x.\n\n4y -3x=4*420 -3*350=1680-1050=630,\n\n630\u00b2=396900,\n\ndivided by 350: 396900/350= 1134.\n\na9=1134>1008, yes.\n\nContinuing to a10=2a9 -a8=2*1134 -1008=2268-1008=1260.\n\na10=1260>1134, okay.\n\na11=(5y -4x)^2/x.\n\nWait according to the earlier pattern, a_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -k x]^2 /x. For a11, which is the 6th odd term (since a1 is first, a3 second, a5 third, a7 fourth, a9 fifth, a11 sixth), so k=5 (since 2k+1=11 \u21d2k=5). Therefore,\n\na11=(6y -5x)^2/x.\n\nCompute 6y -5x =6*420 -5*350=2520 -1750=770,\n\n770 squared is 592900,\n\ndivided by 350: 592900/350 = 1694.\n\na11=1694>1260, okay.\n\na12=2a11 -a10=2*1694 -1260=3388 -1260=2128.\n\na12=2128>1694, yes.\n\na13=(7y -6x)^2/x.\n\nWhich is exactly the term given as 2016.\n\nCompute 7y -6x=7*420 -6*350=2940 -2100=840,\n\n840 squared is 705600,\n\ndivided by x=350: 705600/350 = 2016. Perfect, that's exactly the given a13=2016.\n\nTherefore, with n=5, we get a valid sequence where all terms are integers and strictly increasing, and a13=2016. Therefore, the value of a1 is x=350.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for a1. So if x is 350, then that's the answer?\n\nBut let me check if there could be smaller n. Let me try n=5 is the first n that works, but let me see if n=12 (next possible n where n+2 divisible by7 gives n=12 would be n=12 (since 12+2=14 divisible by7). Let me check n=12:\n\nx=14*(12)^2=14*144=2016,\n\ny=12*(12)^2 +24*(12)=12*144 +288= 1728 +288=2016.\n\nSo x=2016, y=2016.\n\nCheck a3= y\u00b2/x = (2016)^2 /2016=2016. So a3=2016.\n\nBut then a2 =y=2016, so a1=2016, a2=2016. But the sequence must be strictly increasing, so a2 must be greater than a1. Here, they are equal, which violates the strictly increasing condition. Therefore n=12 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, n=19 would lead to even larger numbers, but likely not minimal. Since the problem asks for a1, and it's possible that 350 is the minimal, but let me check n=5 is the minimal valid n.\n\nWait, n=5 gives a1=350, which works. Let me see if there is a smaller n. The next possible n would be n=5-7= -2, but n must be positive, so n=5 is the smallest n that satisfies n+2 divisible by7. Hence, n=5 is the minimal solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be a1=350. But let me confirm with the equations.\n\nWait, but let me see if there are other possible n values where n+2 is divisible by 7, but with n smaller than5? For example n= -2 gives n+2=0, but n must be positive. So n=5 is indeed the smallest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another solution where the constraints are satisfied without the n parameterization?\n\nWait, the equations led us to x=14n\u00b2 and y=12n\u00b2+24n with the condition that n+2 must be divisible by7. Thus, the minimal solution is n=5, leading to a1=350. Since the problem states that the sequence is strictly increasing and all terms are positive integers, and given that a13=2016, this must be the unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 350.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=5, the terms are as follows:\n\na1=350,\n\na2=420,\n\na3=504,\n\na4=588,\n\na5=686,\n\na6=784,\n\na7=896,\n\na8=1008,\n\na9=1134,\n\na10=1260,\n\na11=1694,\n\na12=2128,\n\na13=2016? Wait, hold on, a13 is supposed to be 2016, but according to our calculation above:\n\nWait, when n=5, x=350, y=420,\n\na13=(7y -6x)^2/x,\n\n7y=7*420=2940,\n\n6x=6*350=2100,\n\n7y-6x=2940-2100=840,\n\n840 squared is 705,600,\n\ndivided by x=350,\n\n705600 \u00f7350= 2016. Yes, that's correct. So a13=2016, so that works.\n\nBut wait, in the sequence above, when I listed up to a13:\n\nWait, a12=2128, then a13 is 2016? But 2016 is less than 2128. That would violate the strictly increasing condition.\n\nWait a minute! This is a problem. Because a12 is 2128 and a13 is 2016, which is smaller. That can't be, since the sequence must be strictly increasing. So this is a contradiction. What did I do wrong?\n\nOh no! That's a big mistake. Let me recalculate the terms up to a13.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the terms step by step with n=5 (x=350, y=420):\n\na1 =350,\n\na2=420,\n\na3= y\u00b2/x =420\u00b2/350 =176400/350=504,\n\na4=2a3 -a2=2*504 -420=1008-420=588,\n\na5=(2y -x)^2/x= (840-350)^2 /350=490\u00b2/350=240100/350=686,\n\na6=2a5 -a4=2*686 -588=1372-588=784,\n\na7=(3y-2x)^2/x= (1260-700)^2 /350=560\u00b2/350=313600/350=896,\n\na8=2a7 -a6=2*896 -784=1792-784=1008,\n\na9=(4y-3x)^2/x=(1680-1050)^2 /350=630\u00b2/350=396900/350=1134,\n\na10=2a9 -a8=2*1134 -1008=2268-1008=1260,\n\na11=(5y-4x)^2/x=(2100 -1400)^2 /350=700\u00b2/350=490000/350=1400,\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating a11.\n\nWait, a11 is [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x where for a11, which is the 6th odd term (since a1 is 1st, a3 is 2nd, a5 third, a7 fourth, a9 fifth, a11 sixth), so k=5 (since 2k+1=11 \u21d2k=5). Therefore,\n\na11=(6y -5x)^2/x.\n\nCompute 6y -5x: 6*420 -5*350 =2520 -1750=770,\n\nthen 770 squared is 592,900,\n\ndivided by 350: 592900/350= 1694.\n\nWait, so a11=1694. Then a12=2a11 -a10=2*1694 -1260=3388-1260=2128,\n\na13=(7y -6x)^2/x= (2940-2100)^2 /350=840\u00b2/350=705,600/350=2016.\n\nWait, so a12 is 2128 and a13 is 2016, which is less than a12. That violates the strictly increasing condition. That's a problem.\n\nOh no, so my mistake was in the calculation of a11. Wait, let's recheck:\n\nWait, when I calculated a11 earlier, I said a11=(6y-5x)^2/x. Let's compute that again:\n\n6y =6*420=2520,\n\n5x=5*350=1750,\n\nso 2520-1750=770,\n\n770 squared is 592,900,\n\ndivided by 350 is 592900/350 = 1694, which is correct.\n\nThen a12=2*1694 -1260= 3388-1260=2128,\n\na13=2016 which is less than a12. So the sequence decreases at a13, which is not allowed. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So our earlier assumption must be wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the sequence is strictly increasing. Therefore, the case n=5 is invalid because a13 is less than a12. So this suggests that my approach is missing something.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me retrace the steps. The problem arises because when we set up the equation for a13, we only considered the condition (7y -6x)^2 =2016x, but didn't ensure that the subsequent terms after a13 are also increasing, but actually, the problem only requires up to a13. Wait, no, the problem says the sequence is strictly increasing for all positive integers. So even though the problem gives a13, the sequence must still be increasing up to at least a13. Since a13 is less than a12, this is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the solution with n=5 is invalid. So my mistake was that I didn't check that all terms up to a13 are increasing, which is necessary.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is a different n where this doesn't happen?\n\nLet me see. Let me try to see if there's another n where the terms are increasing up to a13.\n\nWait, so the problem is that a13 must be greater than a12. Let me see what is a12 in terms of n.\n\nFrom the general expressions:\n\na12 = 2a11 -a10,\n\nand a11 = [(6y -5x)^2]/x,\n\na10 = [(5y -4x)^2]/x,\n\nWait, let me see if I can express a12 and a13 in terms of n.\n\nAlternatively, let's express a12 and a13 in terms of n using our previous parameterization.\n\nGiven x=14n\u00b2,\n\ny=12n\u00b2+24n,\n\nthen:\n\na12 = 2a11 -a10,\n\nwhere:\n\na11 = (6y -5x)^2/x,\n\na10 = (5y -4x)^2/x,\n\nSimilarly,\n\na13 = (7y -6x)^2/x.\n\nWe need a13 >a12.\n\nLet me compute a12 and a13 in terms of n.\n\nFirst compute a10:\n\na10 = (5y -4x)^2/x,\n\n= [5*(12n\u00b2+24n) -4*(14n\u00b2)]\u00b2 / (14n\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n5*(12n\u00b2 +24n)=60n\u00b2 +120n,\n\n4*(14n\u00b2)=56n\u00b2,\n\nSo 60n\u00b2 +120n -56n\u00b2=4n\u00b2 +120n.\n\nThus,\n\na10 = (4n\u00b2 +120n)^2/(14n\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly,\n\na11 = (6y -5x)^2/x,\n\n= [6*(12n\u00b2+24n) -5*(14n\u00b2)]\u00b2/(14n\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside:\n\n6*(12n\u00b2+24n)=72n\u00b2 +144n,\n\n5*14n\u00b2=70n\u00b2,\n\nThus, 72n\u00b2+144n -70n\u00b2=2n\u00b2 +144n,\n\nTherefore,\n\na11 = (2n\u00b2 +144n)^2/(14n\u00b2).\n\nThen,\n\na12 =2a11 -a10,\n\n= 2*( (2n\u00b2 +144n)^2/(14n\u00b2) ) - (4n\u00b2 +120n)^2/(14n\u00b2)\n\n= [2*(2n\u00b2 +144n)^2 - (4n\u00b2 +120n)^2]/(14n\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly,\n\na13 = (7y -6x)^2/x,\n\n= [7*(12n\u00b2+24n) -6*(14n\u00b2)]\u00b2/(14n\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside:\n\n7*(12n\u00b2+24n)=84n\u00b2 +168n,\n\n6*14n\u00b2=84n\u00b2,\n\nThus, 84n\u00b2 +168n -84n\u00b2=168n,\n\nThus,\n\na13=(168n)^2/(14n\u00b2)= (28224n\u00b2)/(14n\u00b2)=2016.\n\nSo a13 is indeed 2016 regardless of n, as we had before.\n\nBut we need a13 >a12 \u21d22016 >a12.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that a12 <2016.\n\nSo compute a12 in terms of n:\n\nLet me compute numerator of a12:\n\n2*(2n\u00b2 +144n)^2 - (4n\u00b2 +120n)^2.\n\nLet me denote A =2n\u00b2 +144n,\n\nB =4n\u00b2 +120n,\n\nthen numerator is 2A\u00b2 - B\u00b2.\n\nExpand A and B:\n\nA =2n\u00b2 +144n,\n\nA\u00b2= (2n\u00b2)^2 +2*(2n\u00b2)(144n) + (144n)^2=4n^4 +576n^3 +20736n\u00b2,\n\n2A\u00b2=8n^4 +1152n^3 +41472n\u00b2,\n\nB=4n\u00b2 +120n,\n\nB\u00b2= (4n\u00b2)^2 +2*(4n\u00b2)(120n) + (120n)^2=16n^4 +960n^3 +14400n\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n2A\u00b2 - B\u00b2 = (8n^4 +1152n^3 +41472n\u00b2) - (16n^4 +960n^3 +14400n\u00b2)\n\n= 8n^4 -16n^4 +1152n^3 -960n^3 +41472n\u00b2 -14400n\u00b2\n\n= (-8n^4) +192n^3 +27072n\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\na12 = [ -8n^4 +192n^3 +27072n\u00b2 ] / (14n\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n-8n^4 /14n\u00b2 = -8n\u00b2/14 = -4n\u00b2/7,\n\n192n^3 /14n\u00b2 =192n/14=96n/7,\n\n27072n\u00b2 /14n\u00b2 =27072/14=1933.714... Wait, but fractions:\n\nWait 27072 divided by14: 14*1933=27062, so 27072-27062=10 \u21d227072/14=1933 +10/14=1933+5/7\u22481933.714.\n\nSo,\n\na12= (-4n\u00b2/7) + (96n/7) + 1933.714...\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe factor terms:\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n-8n^4 +192n^3 +27072n\u00b2 = -8n^4 +192n^3 +27072n\u00b2.\n\nFactor out -8n\u00b2:\n\n= -8n\u00b2(n\u00b2 -24n -3384).\n\nWait, that doesn't help much. Alternatively, factor numerator:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a common factor:\n\nLooking at coefficients:\n\n-8, 192,27072.\n\nFactor of 8:\n\n-8(n^4 -24n^3 -3384n\u00b2).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe plugging in n=5 and see what happens.\n\nWait, with n=5,\n\na12's numerator:\n\n-8*(5)^4 +192*(5)^3 +27072*(5)^2,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-8*625= -5000,\n\n192*125=24000,\n\n27072*25=676,800,\n\nTotal: -5000 +24000=19000 +676,800=695,800.\n\nThen divide by14*(5)^2=14*25=350,\n\nThus, a12=695800/350= 1988.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation with n=5 gave a12=2128. Hmm, discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait let me recalculate with n=5:\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-8*(5)^4 +192*(5)^3 +27072*(5)^2,\n\nFirst term: -8*625= -5000,\n\nSecond term: 192*125=24,000,\n\nThird term:27072*25=676,800,\n\nTotal: -5000 +24,000=19,000; 19,000+676,800=695,800.\n\nDivide by14n\u00b2=14*25=350,\n\n695,800 \u00f7350= 695,800 \u00f7350.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10:69,580 \u00f735= 69580/35= 1988.

Which one is correct?\n\nWait let's recalculate step by step for n=5:\n\nGiven x=350, y=420.\n\nCompute up to a12:\n\na1=350,\n\na2=420,\n\na3=504,\n\na4=588,\n\na5=686,\n\na6=784,\n\na7=896,\n\na8=1008,\n\na9=1134,\n\na10=1260,\n\na11= (6y -5x)^2/x = (2520-1750)^2 /350=770\u00b2/350=592,900/350=1694,\n\na12=2*a11 -a10=2*1694 -1260=3388-1260=2128.\n\nWait, this is different from the algebraic calculation. So there's an error in the algebraic expression. Let me see where.\n\nWait in the algebraic expression, a12 is calculated as [ -8n^4 +192n^3 +27072n\u00b2 ] / (14n\u00b2 )\n\nFor n=5,\n\nNumerator: -8*(625) +192*(125) +27072*(25)\n\n= -5000 +24,000 +676,800 = 695,800,\n\ndivided by 350 gives 1988, but the step-by-step calculation gives 2128. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's recompute a10 and a11:\n\na10 is (5y -4x)^2/x,\n\nwith y=420, x=350,\n\n5y=2100,\n\n4x=1400,\n\n5y-4x=700,\n\n700 squared is 490,000,\n\ndivided by 350 is 490,000 /350=1400.\n\nAh! Here is the mistake. Earlier, I had:\n\na10 = (5y -4x)^2/x,\n\nWith y=420 and x=350,\n\n5y -4x = 5*420 -4*350 =2100 -1400=700,\n\nso a10=700\u00b2/350=490000/350=1400.\n\nBut previously I thought it was 1260. That was my mistake.\n\nWait in my step-by-step earlier, I said:\n\na9=1134,\n\na10=2a9 -a8=2*1134 -1008=2268-1008=1260.\n\nBut according to the formula, a10 should be (5y-4x)^2/x=1400.\n\nThere's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait let's recalculate the terms step by step again with n=5:\n\na1=350,\n\na2=420,\n\na3= y\u00b2/x=420\u00b2/350=176400/350=504,\n\na4=2a3 -a2=2*504 -420=1008-420=588,\n\na5=(2y -x)^2/x=(840-350)^2/350=490\u00b2/350=240,100/350=686,\n\na6=2a5 -a4=2*686 -588=1372-588=784,\n\na7=(3y-2x)^2/x=(1260-700)^2/350=560\u00b2/350=313,600/350=896,\n\na8=2a7 -a6=2*896 -784=1792-784=1008,\n\na9=(4y-3x)^2/x=(1680-1050)^2/350=630\u00b2/350=396,900/350=1134,\n\na10=2a9 -a8=2*1134 -1008=2268-1008=1260,\n\nWait, but according to the formula a10=(5y-4x)^2/x=700\u00b2/350=1400. So discrepancy here.\n\nAh! There's a mistake in the general formula.\n\nWait, the formula for a_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -kx]^2/x,\n\nso a9 is the 5th odd term (since a1 is 1st, a3 2nd, a5 3rd, a7 4th, a9 5th). So k=4 (since 2k+1=9 \u21d2k=4).\n\nThus, a9=(5y -4x)^2/x. Wait, but in the step-by-step, a9 was calculated as (4y-3x)^2/x. That was the mistake!\n\nWait, I think I made an error in the general formula earlier.\n\nLet me re-express the general term for a_{2k+1}:\n\nLooking back at the terms:\n\na3 (k=1): (2y -x)^2/x \u2192 (1+1)y -1x,\n\na5 (k=2): (3y-2x)^2/x \u2192 (2+1)y -2x,\n\na7 (k=3): (4y-3x)^2/x \u2192 (3+1)y -3x,\n\na9 (k=4): (5y-4x)^2/x,\n\na11 (k=5): (6y-5x)^2/x,\n\na13 (k=6): (7y-6x)^2/x.\n\nYes, so the general term for a_{2k+1} is [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x.\n\nTherefore, a9 is (5y-4x)^2/x, not (4y-3x)^2/x. That was my mistake earlier when I was calculating step-by-step.\n\nSo in the step-by-step calculation, when computing a9, I incorrectly used (4y-3x)^2/x instead of (5y-4x)^2/x. That's where the error came from.\n\nSo let me recalculate the terms correctly with n=5:\n\na1=350,\n\na2=420,\n\na3= (2y -x)^2/x= (840-350)^2/350=490\u00b2/350=686? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait a3 is actually the first odd term after a1, so it's a geometric triplet with a1, a2, a3. So a3 is y\u00b2/x =420\u00b2/350=504. Correct.\n\nThen a4=2a3 -a2= 2*504 -420=1008-420=588.\n\na5 is the next odd term (third term in odd indices), which is (3y-2x)^2/x. Wait no:\n\nWait, a5 is the third odd term (a1, a3, a5), so k=2, so (3y-2x)^2/x.\n\nYes:\n\na5=(3y-2x)^2/x=(1260-700)^2/350=560\u00b2/350=896/ but wait:\n\nWait 3y-2x=3*420-2*350=1260-700=560,\n\n560\u00b2 is 313600,\n\ndivided by350: 313600/350= 896.\n\nYes, so a5=896.\n\nThen a6=2a5 -a4=2*896-588=1792-588=1204? Wait no, earlier I had 784. Wait, confusion arises.\n\nWait let me recast all terms correctly:\n\nWait, the terms are built step by step:\n\nAfter a3=504,\n\na4=2a3 -a2=2*504 -420=1008-420=588,\n\na5 is the next odd term (third odd term: a1=350, a3=504, a5 is third), which is geometric:\n\na3, a4, a5 must form a geometric sequence.\n\nThus, (a4)^2 =a3*a5 \u21d2 a5= (a4)^2/a3= (588)^2 /504.\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous method. Wait, so there is confusion between the general formula and step-by-step.\n\nWait, I think my mistake was in the general formula earlier. Let me re-express everything carefully.\n\nLet me start over with the step-by-step terms using n=5 (x=350, y=420):\n\nCompute terms step by step:\n\na1 = 350,\n\na2 =420,\n\na3 must satisfy the geometric triplet a1,a2,a3: (a2)^2 =a1*a3 \u21d2420\u00b2=350*a3 \u21d2 a3= (420\u00b2)/350 = (176400)/350=504.\n\na4 must satisfy the arithmetic triplet a2,a3,a4: 2a3 =a2 +a4 \u21d22*504 =420 +a4 \u21d21008=420+a4 \u21d2a4=588.\n\na5 must form a geometric triplet with a3,a4,a5: (a4)^2 =a3*a5 \u21d2588\u00b2 =504*a5 \u21d2a5= (588\u00b2)/504.\n\nCalculate 588\u00b2=345,744,\n\nDivide by504: 345744 \u00f7504,\n\n504*686=504*(700-14)=504*700=352,800 minus504*14=7,056 \u2192 352,800-7,056=345,744. So a5=686.\n\nWait, so a5=686.\n\nThen a6 must form an arithmetic triplet with a4,a5,a6: 2a5 =a4 +a6 \u21d22*686 =588 +a6 \u21d21372 -588= a6 \u21d2a6=784.\n\nNext, a7 forms a geometric triplet with a5,a6,a7: (a6)^2 =a5*a7 \u21d2784\u00b2=686*a7 \u21d2a7= (784\u00b2)/686.\n\nCalculate 784\u00b2=614,656,\n\nDivide by686: 614656 \u00f7686.\n\nLet me see, 686*900=617,400 which is more than 614,656. So 686*896=?\n\nWait 686*(900-4)=686*900 -686*4=617,400-2,744=614,656. So a7=896.\n\nThen a8 must form an arithmetic triplet with a6,a7,a8: 2a7 =a6 +a8 \u21d22*896=784 +a8 \u21d21792-784=1008 \u21d2a8=1008.\n\na9 forms a geometric triplet with a7,a8,a9: (a8)^2 =a7*a9 \u21d21008\u00b2=896*a9 \u21d2a9= (1008\u00b2)/896.\n\nCompute 1008\u00b2=1,016,064,\n\nDivide by896: 1,016,064 \u00f7896.\n\nLet me compute 896*1134=?\n\n896*1000=896,000,\n\n896*100=89,600,\n\n896*34=30,464,\n\nTotal: 896,000+89,600=985,600 +30,464=1,016,064. So a9=1134.\n\na10 forms arithmetic triplet with a8,a9,a10: 2a9 =a8 +a10 \u21d22*1134=1008 +a10 \u21d22268-1008=1260 \u21d2a10=1260.\n\na11 forms geometric triplet with a9,a10,a11: (a10)^2 =a9*a11 \u21d21260\u00b2=1134*a11 \u21d2a11= (1260\u00b2)/1134.\n\n1260\u00b2=1,587,600,\n\nDivide by1134:\n\n1134*1400=1,587,600. So a11=1400.\n\na12 forms arithmetic triplet with a10,a11,a12: 2a11 =a10 +a12 \u21d22*1400=1260 +a12 \u21d22800 -1260=1540 \u21d2a12=1540.\n\na13 forms geometric triplet with a11,a12,a13: (a12)^2 =a11*a13 \u21d21540\u00b2=1400*a13 \u21d2a13= (1540\u00b2)/1400.\n\nCompute 1540\u00b2=2,371,600,\n\nDivide by1400: 2,371,600 \u00f71400= 2,371,600 \u00f71400= 1,694.\n\nWait, but the problem states that a13=2016. But according to this calculation, a13=1694. That's a problem.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong now?\n\nWait, let me recalculate a13:\n\na11=1400,\n\na12=1540,\n\nso the geometric triplet a11,a12,a13 requires that (a12)^2 =a11*a13.\n\nThus, a13= (a12)^2 /a11 = (1540)^2 /1400.\n\n1540 squared is 1540*1540.\n\nCalculate 1500\u00b2=2,250,000,\n\nPlus 40*1500*2=120,000,\n\nPlus 40\u00b2=1,600,\n\nTotal: 2,250,000 + 120,000 =2,370,000 +1,600=2,371,600,\n\nDivide by1400:2,371,600 \u00f71400= 2,371,600 \u00f71400= 1694. So a13=1694, not 2016.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, a13 must be 2016. This is a contradiction. So something is very wrong here.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the general formula with n=5, I had a13=2016, but step-by-step calculation gives a13=1694. So there must be a miscalculation in the general formula approach.\n\nWait let me re-express the general formula:\n\nWe had set x=14n\u00b2,\n\ny=12n\u00b2+24n,\n\nthen a13=(7y -6x)^2/x.\n\nWith n=5,\n\n7y=7*(12*(25)+24*5)=7*(300+120)=7*420=2940,\n\n6x=6*14*25=6*350=2100,\n\n7y-6x=2940-2100=840,\n\nthen a13=840\u00b2/(14*25)=705,600/350=2016.\n\nBut step-by-step, with x=350,y=420,\n\na13= (a12)^2/a11=1540\u00b2/1400=1694.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there's a mistake in the general formula derivation.\n\nAh, I see the problem now. In the general formula, I assumed that a_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x,\n\nBut in the step-by-step calculation, the terms don't follow that. For example, a5=686, which according to the general formula would be [(2+1)y -2x]^2/x= (3y-2x)^2/x.\n\nWith y=420 and x=350,\n\n3y-2x=1260-700=560,\n\n(560)^2/x=313,600/350=896, but step-by-step we have a5=686. So discrepancy.\n\nThis means my general formula was incorrect. That's the problem.\n\nWhere did I go wrong in deriving the general formula?\n\nLet me revisit the earlier steps.\n\nEarlier, I tried to compute the terms step by step in terms of x and y and observed a pattern. Let me re-examine that.\n\nStarting with a1=x, a2=y.\n\na3=y\u00b2/x,\n\na4=2a3 -a2 =2y\u00b2/x -y,\n\na5=(a4)^2/a3 = (2y\u00b2/x -y)^2 / (y\u00b2/x) = (2y -x)^2/x,\n\nWait here, that's the correct expression for a5: (2y -x)^2/x.\n\nBut in the step-by-step with x=350,y=420, this would give (840-350)^2/350=490\u00b2/350=686, which matches the step-by-step calculation. So a5=686.\n\nThen a6=2a5 -a4=2*686 - (2y\u00b2/x -y).\n\nWait compute a4:\n\na4=2y\u00b2/x -y =2*(420)^2/350 -420= 2*(176400/350) -420= 2*(504) -420=1008-420=588,\n\nThus, a6=2*686 -588=1372-588=784.\n\nThen a7=(a6)^2/a5=784\u00b2/686= (784/686)*784= (1.142857...)*784= but exact calculation:\n\n784 divided by686 is 1.142857, which is 8/7.\n\nThus, 784= (8/7)*686,\n\nSo 784\u00b2 /686 = (64/49)*686 = (64/49)*(686)=64*(686/49)=64*(14)= 896. So a7=896.\n\nThus, a7=(a6)^2/a5= (784)^2 /686=896,\n\nWhich is (3y -2x)^2/x?\n\nWait 3y-2x= 3*420 -2*350=1260-700=560,\n\n560 squared divided by x=350 gives (560)^2 /350=313600/350=896. So yes, that matches. So a7=(3y -2x)^2/x.\n\nSimilarly, a9 should be (4y-3x)^2/x,\n\n4y-3x=4*420 -3*350=1680-1050=630,\n\n630\u00b2 /350=396900/350=1134. Which matches the step-by-step a9=1134.\n\nThen a11=(5y-4x)^2/x,\n\n5y-4x=5*420-4*350=2100-1400=700,\n\n700\u00b2/350=490000/350=1400, which matches the step-by-step a11=1400.\n\nThen a13=(6y-5x)^2/x?\n\nWait, according to the pattern:\n\na_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x.\n\nWait for a13, which is the 7th odd term (since a1 is first, up to a13 as the 7th), so k=6 (since 2k+1=13 \u21d2k=6),\n\nThus, a13=(7y-6x)^2/x.\n\n7y-6x=7*420 -6*350=2940-2100=840,\n\n840 squared divided by350: 705,600/350=2016. So according to this, a13=2016.\n\nBut step-by-step calculation gave a13=1694. There's a contradiction.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait in the step-by-step, after a11=1400 and a12=1540,\n\na13 should be calculated as part of the geometric triplet a11,a12,a13,\n\nso (a12)^2 =a11*a13 \u21d2a13=(a12)^2/a11= (1540)^2 /1400= 1694.\n\nBut according to the general formula, it should be (7y-6x)^2/x=2016.\n\nThis inconsistency arises because in the step-by-step calculation, the value of a12 is 1540, but according to the general formula, a12 should be:\n\na12=2a11 -a10,\n\nwhere a11=1400 and a10= (5y-4x)^2/x=700\u00b2/350=1400,\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait a10 is the 5th odd term's next arithmetic term. Wait let me retrace:\n\nWait a10 is an even term, so it's part of the arithmetic triplet a8,a9,a10,\n\nso a10=2a9 -a8=2*1134 -1008=2268-1008=1260,\n\nthen a11 is the next odd term: geometric triplet a9,a10,a11,\n\nso (a10)^2 =a9*a11 \u21d21260\u00b2=1134*a11 \u21d2a11= (1260\u00b2)/1134=1400,\n\nthen a12 is arithmetic triplet a10,a11,a12 \u21d22a11 =a10 +a12 \u21d22*1400=1260+a12 \u21d2a12=2800-1260=1540,\n\nthen a13 is geometric triplet a11,a12,a13 \u21d2a13=(a12)^2 /a11= (1540)^2/1400=1694,\n\nbut according to general formula, a13 should be (7y-6x)^2/x=2016.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my general formula is incorrect.\n\nWhere is the mistake?\n\nWait the general formula for a_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x,\n\nFor a13, which is the 7th odd term (since 2*6+1=13),\n\nso k=6,\n\nso a13=(7y -6x)^2/x,\n\nbut according to step-by-step calculation, a13 is (a12)^2/a11=1540\u00b2/1400=1694,\n\nbut (7y-6x)^2/x= (2940-2100)^2/350=840\u00b2/350=2016.\n\nTherefore, there is a discrepancy between the general formula and the step-by-step calculation. Which means that my general formula was wrong.\n\nHmm, so my earlier derivation of the general formula must have an error. Let me see where.\n\nLooking back:\n\nWhen I derived the terms up to a9, I had:\n\na5 = (2y -x)^2/x,\n\na7 = (3y -2x)^2/x,\n\na9 = (4y -3x)^2/x,\n\na11=(5y -4x)^2/x,\n\na13=(6y -5x)^2/x,\n\nWait, but according to step-by-step, a13 should be (7y -6x)^2/x,\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step, a13 is the 13th term, which is the 7th odd term (since 1,3,5,7,9,11,13), so k=6,\n\nso according to the pattern I thought,\n\na_{2k+1}= [(k+1)y -k x]^2/x,\n\nso for a_{13}=a_{2*6+1}, so k=6,\n\nso a13 should be (7y -6x)^2/x,\n\nbut in the step-by-step, it's not that.
