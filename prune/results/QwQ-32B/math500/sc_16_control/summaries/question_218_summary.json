      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are only 0s and 1s. Hmm, let's think. First, 450 factors into prime factors. Let me break that down. 450 is 45 times 10, so that's 9*5*10. Breaking it down further, 9 is 3\u00b2, 5 stays, and 10 is 2*5. So altogether, 450 = 2 * 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b2. \n\nSo any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25, right? Wait, because 2*3\u00b2*5\u00b2. So to be divisible by 2, the number has to be even. Since all digits are 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. Because 1 is odd and can't make the number even. So the number must end with 0. \n\nNext, divisible by 5\u00b2, which is 25. For a number to be divisible by 25, its last two digits must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. But since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the only possible ending is 00. So the last two digits must be 00. That's a key point. So the number must end with two zeros. \n\nNow, the other condition is divisibility by 9. Divisibility by 9 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits is just the number of 1s in the number. Therefore, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. \n\nSo putting this all together, the number must end with two zeros, and the remaining digits (all the digits except the last two) must consist of some number of 1s and 0s, with the total number of 1s being a multiple of 9. Also, since we want the smallest such number, we need the smallest possible number of digits. \n\nSo, the minimal approach would be to find the smallest number composed of 1s followed by 00 (since ending with 00 is required), where the number of 1s is a multiple of 9. Let me see. \n\nWait, but actually, the 1s can be anywhere except the last two digits, but to minimize the number, we want as few digits as possible. So probably, the number will be a bunch of 1s followed by two 0s. Let me check. \n\nSo let's start with the number of 1s. Since the number must have a digit sum divisible by 9, the minimal number of 1s is 9. So the smallest candidate would be 11111111100 (nine 1s followed by two 0s). Let me check if that works. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a smaller number. Let's see. Let me think step by step. \n\nFirst, the number must end with 00, so the last two digits are fixed. The preceding digits must be a combination of 1s and 0s such that the total number of 1s is a multiple of 9, and the number is as small as possible. \n\nThe smallest possible number would have the least number of digits. So the minimal number of digits would be when the number of 1s is 9, and then two zeros. That gives 11 digits: 9 ones and 2 zeros. \n\nBut maybe there's a shorter number? Let me see. For example, if the number of 1s is 9, that's the minimal required. Let me check if 11111111100 is divisible by 450. \n\nLet me compute 11111111100 divided by 450. \n\nFirst, 450 times 24700 is 111150000, which is larger. Wait, maybe better to do division step by step. \n\nAlternatively, let me check divisibility by 450: since it's divisible by 2, 5\u00b2, and 9. We already know it ends with 00, so divisible by 100, which is more than enough for 2 and 25. The digit sum is 9, so divisible by 9. Therefore, 11111111100 is divisible by 450. \n\nBut is there a smaller number? Let's see. Suppose the number of 1s is 9, but arranged in a shorter number. Wait, but 9 ones plus two zeros is 11 digits. If we can have fewer digits but still meet the conditions, that would be better. \n\nWait, the number must end with two zeros. So the minimal possible length is when the non-zero part (the 1s) is as few as possible, but the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. The minimal number of 1s is 9, so that gives 11 digits. \n\nIs there a way to have a smaller number with fewer digits? Let's see. Suppose the number has 9 ones and two zeros. So total 11 digits. Maybe arranged differently? But the smallest number would be the one with the 1s as far to the right as possible, but since leading zeros aren't allowed, the first digit has to be 1. So the number would start with 1, followed by some combination of 0s and 1s, ending with 00. \n\nWait, but the number 11111111100 is 1 followed by eight 1s and then 00. That's 11 digits. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a number with, say, 9 ones but arranged in a shorter way? Wait, no. The total digits are 9 + 2 = 11. So that's the minimal length possible for 9 ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 18 ones? But that would be longer, so no. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a number with 9 ones but arranged in such a way that the number is smaller? For example, maybe 10011111100? But that would have more digits? Wait, no. Wait, let's think of the numerical value. \n\nThe number 11111111100 is the smallest 11-digit number with nine 1s and two zeros at the end. Because if you have any zeros before the last two digits, that would place a 0 earlier, making the number smaller? Wait, actually, no. For example, 1000000001100 is a longer number but smaller in value. Wait, but in terms of digit count, the number with 11 digits is the minimal. So if there exists a smaller number with 11 digits, that would be better, but perhaps not. \n\nWait, actually, the numerical value of the number with nine 1s followed by two 0s is the smallest possible 11-digit number meeting the criteria because any 0 placed before the end would require more digits. For example, inserting a 0 in the middle would mean you need more digits to reach nine 1s. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to check whether a number with fewer digits could satisfy the conditions. Let's see. Suppose the number has 9 ones and two zeros. So total 11 digits. Let's see if that is indeed the minimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 1s can be 9 but arranged in fewer digits? No, because each 1 takes a digit. So 9 ones plus two zeros must be 11 digits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number can have more zeros in between but still with the 1s adding up to 9? But that would still require 11 digits. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a number with fewer digits where the number of 1s is a multiple of 9, but arranged such that it still ends with 00. Let me see. For example, 11100. That has three 1s, but three isn't a multiple of 9, so that's not. 11111100 has six 1s, still not a multiple of nine. 11111111100 is nine 1s. \n\nAlternatively, 10010010000? But that would have fewer 1s? Let me count. Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number with 18 1s but shorter? No, that would be longer. \n\nHmm. So maybe 11111111100 is the minimal. But let me confirm by checking if that number divided by 450 gives an integer. \n\nCalculating 11111111100 \u00f7 450. Let's divide step by step. \n\nFirst, divide by 10 to get 1111111110, then divide by 45. \n\nDividing 1111111110 by 45. Let's see:\n\n45 \u00d7 24,691,358 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to do 1111111110 \u00f7 45:\n\n45 \u00d7 24,691,358 = ?\n\nWait, 45 \u00d7 24,691,358: Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, 1111111110 divided by 5 is 222,222,222. Then divided by 9: 222,222,222 \u00f79 = 24,691,358. So yes, 24,691,358 \u00d7 45 = 1,111,111,110. Then multiplying by 10 gives back the original number. So yes, 11111111100 divided by 450 is indeed 24,691,358 \u00d710 = 246,913,580. \n\nTherefore, that number is divisible by 450. \n\nBut is there a smaller number? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose instead of having all the 1s first, maybe arranging some zeros in between could result in a smaller number with the same number of digits? \n\nFor instance, 1000000001100 has 10 digits? Wait, no, let me count. If I have two zeros at the end, and then 9 ones in between, but spread out. Wait, no. Let's think of the 11-digit numbers. The smallest 11-digit number with nine 1s and two zeros is indeed 10000000011 followed by 00? Wait, no. Wait, the first digit must be 1, then the rest can have zeros and ones. \n\nWait, actually, the smallest number would have the 1s as far to the right as possible. So the smallest number with nine 1s and two zeros (with the two zeros at the end) would be 1000000001100? Wait, no, that's 13 digits. Wait, I'm getting confused. \n\nWait, the number must end with two zeros. The first digit is 1, then the remaining nine digits (since total is 11 digits) can have eight more 1s and one zero. Wait, no, nine 1s total. So after the first 1, there are ten digits left. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nWait, the total number of digits is 11. The first digit is 1, then the next nine digits must include eight 1s and one 0, followed by the last two zeros. Wait, but the last two are already zeros. So actually, the first nine digits (excluding the last two zeros) must have nine 1s. Wait, no. \n\nWait, total digits: 11. The last two are zeros. The first nine digits must be all 1s? Because the total number of 1s has to be nine. So yes, the first nine digits are all 1s, then two zeros. That gives 11111111100. \n\nIf instead, you have some zeros in the first nine digits, then the total number of 1s would be less than nine, which would not satisfy the divisibility by 9. So that's not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number is indeed 11111111100. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a smaller number with more than 9 ones but arranged in a way that the total number of digits is less? For example, 18 ones would require 20 digits (18 ones plus two zeros), which is longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 9 is the minimal number of 1s, so the minimal number is 11 digits. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 11111111100. \n\nBut let me think again if there's a smaller number. Maybe with 9 ones but arranged in a way that the number is shorter? \n\nWait, the number must have at least 11 digits. Because to have 9 ones and two zeros. Since the two zeros are at the end, the first nine digits must be all ones. Wait, no, actually, the first part can have zeros as long as the total number of ones is nine. \n\nWait, for example, maybe the number is 1110000001100. But that's 13 digits. Longer than 11. \n\nAlternatively, 110000000100? That has only four ones. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 10111111100. Let's see. That has 10 digits? Let's count: 1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's 11 digits. Wait, yes. \n\nWait, here's another arrangement: 10111111100. That has the same number of digits (11), but the first digit is 1, then a 0, followed by seven 1s, then 1 more 1 and two zeros. Wait, total 1s: 1 (first digit) + 7 + 1 = 9. So that's also nine 1s. \n\nBut numerically, 10111111100 is smaller than 11111111100, right? Because the second digit is 0 instead of 1. \n\nOh! So this is a smaller number. Wait a second, I didn't think of that. So arranging the zeros in the earlier digits can lead to a smaller number even with the same number of 1s. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number isn't necessarily the one with all 1s followed by zeros. \n\nSo, to get the smallest possible number, we need the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. Since the first digit must be 1, then the next digits should be 0 as much as possible. \n\nTherefore, the strategy is to have as many 0s as possible after the first 1, but still having the total number of 1s equal to 9, and ending with two 0s. \n\nSo, let me try to construct such a number. \n\nWe need a number ending with '00', with exactly nine '1's in the preceding digits, and as many leading zeros as possible (but leading zeros aren't allowed, so the first digit is 1). \n\nTo make the number as small as possible, after the first '1', we should place zeros wherever possible, but ensuring that we have nine 1s in total. \n\nSo the minimal number would be the smallest number with 1 followed by some 0s and 1s (total of 9 ones including the first digit), ending with two 0s. \n\nLet me try constructing it step by step. \n\nStart with '1', then try to place as many 0s as possible, inserting 1s only when necessary to reach the total of nine. \n\nLet me think of building the number digit by digit, trying to minimize the value. \n\nThe first digit is 1. \n\nThen, to make the number as small as possible, the next digits should be 0 as much as possible. \n\nBut we have to have a total of nine 1s. \n\nSo after the first '1', we need eight more '1's. \n\nSo the remaining digits before the last two zeros must contain eight 1s and the rest 0s, arranged in such a way that the number is as small as possible. \n\nTherefore, to minimize the number, after the first digit, we want the next digits to be 0s until we have to put a 1. \n\nSo, the minimal number would look like 1 followed by a bunch of 0s, then the remaining 1s, then 00. \n\nWait, but the remaining 1s can be placed at the end before the two zeros. \n\nWait, for example: \n\nSuppose the number is 1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s and then two 0s. Wait, but that would be 1 00000000 11111111 00. That's 1 +8 +8 +2 = 19 digits, which is longer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging the 1s as sparsely as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number is 11111111100, but we saw that 10111111100 is smaller. \n\nWait, let's compare 10111111100 and 11111111100 numerically. \n\n10111111100 is 10,111,111,100 \n\n11111111100 is 11,111,111,100 \n\nYes, 10... is smaller than 11..., so 10111111100 is indeed smaller. \n\nBut can we do even better? Let's see. \n\nWhat about 100111111100? Wait, that's 12 digits? Let me count: 1 followed by 00, then 11111111 and then 00? No, let me recount. \n\nWait, 1 (1st digit), then 0 (2nd), 0 (3rd), then eight 1s (digits 4-11), then 00 (digits 12-13). Wait, that's 13 digits. \n\nWait, the total digits must be 1 (first) plus the remaining digits before the last two 0s. Let me clarify. \n\nWe need the total number of 1s to be 9. The first digit is 1, so we need 8 more 1s in the remaining digits before the last two zeros. \n\nThe total digits excluding the last two zeros is (total digits -2). Let's denote the total digits as N, so N-2 digits before the last two zeros. Among those N-2 digits, there must be 8 ones and the rest zeros. \n\nTo minimize the number, we want the leftmost digits after the first 1 to be as many zeros as possible. \n\nSo the earliest possible positions for the remaining 8 ones should be as far to the right as possible. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number would be constructed as follows: \n\nStart with 1, then follow with as many 0s as possible, then place the remaining 8 ones, then the two zeros. \n\nTherefore, the number would be 1 followed by k zeros, then 8 ones, then two zeros. \n\nThe total length would be 1 + k +8 +2 = 11 +k. Wait, but k can be any number such that the total digits is minimized. \n\nWait, actually, to minimize the total number of digits, k should be 0. Because if k is 0, then the number is 1 followed by 8 ones and then two zeros, totaling 1+8+2=11 digits, which is the same as the original 11111111100. But that's the same as the first number, but arranged with all 1s after the first digit. \n\nWait, but if we set k=1, meaning one zero after the first digit, then the remaining 7 ones would have to be placed after that zero. So the number would be 1 0 followed by 7 ones and then two zeros. Total digits: 1 +1 +7 +2 =11. That gives 10111111100, which is smaller. \n\nSimilarly, if we set k=2, then two zeros after the first digit, then 6 ones and two zeros at the end. So the number would be 100111111100. Wait, but that's 12 digits? Let's count: 1 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10), 0 (11), 0 (12). Wait, that's 12 digits. \n\nWait, the total digits would be 1 + 2 (zeros) +6 (ones) +2 (zeros) = 11. Wait, 1+2+6+2 =11. Wait, 1 followed by two 0s, then six 1s, then two 0s: total digits 1+2+6+2=11. So the number is 100111111100 (11 digits). \n\nWait, let's count the digits here: \n\n1 (1st), 0 (2nd), 0 (3rd), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10), 0 (11), 0 (12)? No, that's 12 digits. Wait, maybe I messed up. \n\nWait, 1 (1), then two zeros (digits 2-3), then six 1s (digits 4-9), then two zeros (digits 10-11). That's 1 + 2 +6 +2 =11 digits. So the number is 100111111100. \n\nWait, that's 1 followed by two 0s, then six 1s, then two 0s. So total digits: 1 +2 +6 +2 =11. \n\nSo that number is 100111111100. Comparing to 10111111100 (which is 10 followed by seven 1s and two 0s), which is smaller? \n\nLet me write them out:\n\n100111111100 versus 10111111100. \n\nComparing digit by digit: \n\nFirst digit: 1 vs 1 \u2192 same. \n\nSecond digit: 0 vs 0 \u2192 same. \n\nThird digit: 0 vs 1 \u2192 Here, the first number has 0, the second has 1. So the first number (100111111100) is smaller. \n\nTherefore, 100111111100 is smaller than 10111111100. \n\nContinuing this logic, perhaps we can get even smaller numbers by adding more zeros after the first digit. \n\nLet's try k=3. \n\nThat would be 1 followed by three zeros, then five 1s, then two zeros. Total digits: 1+3+5+2=11. The number is 1000111111100? Wait, let me check digits again. \n\nWait, 1 (1), then three 0s (digits 2-4), then five 1s (digits 5-9), then two 0s (digits 10-11). So the number is 1000111111100? Wait, that's 11 digits. \n\nWait, 1 followed by three 0s: 1 0 0 0, then five 1s: 1 1 1 1 1, then two 0s. So the number is 1000111111100. \n\nWait, but when written out: 1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0 \u2192 yes, 11 digits. \n\nComparing to the previous one (100111111100):\n\nCompare digit by digit:\n\n1 vs 1 \u2192 same. \n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same. \n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same. \n\n0 vs 1 \u2192 Here, first number has 0, second has 1 at the 4th digit. So 1000111111100 is smaller. \n\nContinuing this, let's try k=4 (four zeros after the first 1):\n\nThen we have 1 followed by four 0s, then four 1s, then two 0s. \n\nTotal digits: 1+4+4+2=11. \n\nThe number is 10000111111100? Wait, counting digits:\n\n1 (1), four 0s (digits 2-5), four 1s (digits 6-9), two 0s (10-11). \n\nSo the number is 10000111111100? Wait, let's see: 1 followed by four 0s: 10000, then four 1s: 1111, then two 0s. So the full number is 10000111111100? Wait, that's 12 digits. Wait, no: 1 (1st), then 4 zeros (digits 2-5), then four 1s (digits 6-9), then two zeros (digits 10-11). So total digits 11. \n\nWait, the number would be: 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 \u2192 that's 11 digits. \n\nWait, written out: 10000111100? No, wait. Let me count again. \n\nWait, 1 (1), then four 0s (digits 2-5), then four 1s (digits 6-9), then two 0s (10-11). So the digits are:\n\n1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0 \u2192 11 digits. So the number is 100001111100. Wait, that's 1 followed by four zeros, then four ones, then two zeros. \n\nComparing to the previous one (1000111111100):\n\nCompare digit by digit:\n\n1 vs 1 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 1 \u2192 Here, the first number (100001111100) has a 0 at the 5th digit, while the second (1000111111100) has a 1 at the 5th digit. Wait, actually, in the second number (k=3), the fifth digit was the start of the 1s. Let me see:\n\nWait, when k=3, the number was 1000 (four digits?), no, wait, let me recheck the previous example. \n\nWait, when k=3 (three zeros after the first 1):\n\n1 (1st), three 0s (digits 2-4), then five 1s (digits 5-9), then two 0s (digits 10-11). So the fifth digit is a 1. \n\nWhereas with k=4, the fifth digit is 0, and the sixth is 1. \n\nTherefore, the number with k=4 (four zeros) is smaller than the k=3 case. \n\nContinuing this pattern, perhaps increasing the number of leading zeros after the first digit reduces the number's value. \n\nContinuing further: k=5 (five zeros after first digit):\n\nThen, the number would be 1 followed by five 0s, then three 1s, then two 0s. Total digits: 1+5+3+2=11. \n\nThe number: 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 \u2192 11 digits. \n\nThis is 10000011100. \n\nComparing to the previous (k=4 case: 100001111100):\n\nCompare digit by digit:\n\n1 vs 1 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 0 \u2192 same.\n\n0 vs 1 \u2192 Here, the new number (k=5) has a 0 at the 6th digit, while the previous had a 1. So the new number is smaller. \n\nContinuing this, k=6: six zeros after first digit, then two 1s, then two zeros. \n\nTotal digits: 1+6+2+2=11. \n\nNumber: 1 followed by six 0s, two 1s, two 0s: 10000001100. \n\nComparing to k=5 case (10000011100):\n\nDigit 7: the new number has a 0 vs the old's 1, so smaller. \n\nk=7: seven zeros after first digit, then one 1, then two zeros. \n\nTotal digits: 1+7+1+2=11. \n\nNumber: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 10000000100. \n\nCompare to previous (k=6: 10000001100). At digit 8: 0 vs 1 \u2192 smaller. \n\nk=8: eight zeros after first digit, then one 1, then two zeros. Wait, but we need eight more 1s after the first digit. Wait, total 1s must be nine. \n\nWait, when k=8, after the first digit, we have eight 0s, then one 1, then two 0s. So total 1s: first digit plus that one 1 = 2? No, that's not enough. \n\nWait, I must have messed up. Let's see:\n\nWait, when k is the number of zeros after the first digit, then the remaining digits before the last two zeros are (k) zeros plus (8) ones (since we need 8 more ones). \n\nWait, so total digits before last two zeros: k +8. \n\nTherefore, total digits including the last two zeros: 1 +k +8 +2 = 11 +k. Wait, but we need the total digits to be 11. \n\nAh, here's the mistake! \n\nWait, sorry, my earlier approach was wrong. \n\nWait, let me re-clarify:\n\nThe total number of digits must be N = (number before last two zeros) + 2. \n\nThe number before the last two zeros must contain exactly 8 ones (since the first digit is 1, total 9 ones). \n\nTherefore, the number of digits before the last two zeros is (N-2), and in those (N-2) digits, there must be 8 ones. \n\nTherefore, the total digits N must be at least 1 (for the first digit) + 8 (ones) + 0 (zeros) + 2 (ending zeros) \u2192 11 digits. \n\nTherefore, the minimal N is 11. \n\nIn that case, the digits before the last two zeros must be exactly 9 digits (since N-2 =9). \n\nThese 9 digits must contain 8 ones and 1 zero. \n\nTo minimize the number, we need to place the single zero as far to the right as possible. \n\nWait, that's a better way to think. \n\nSo in the 9 digits before the ending two zeros, we have to have 8 ones and 1 zero. \n\nTo make the entire number as small as possible, the leftmost digit is 1, then the next digits should have the zero as far to the right as possible. \n\nTherefore, the earliest possible placement of the zero is at the last possible position. \n\nSo the 9 digits before the last two zeros should be eight 1s followed by a zero? No, wait. Wait, the 9 digits have to have 8 ones and 1 zero. To make the number as small as possible, the zero should be placed as far to the left as possible? Wait no, actually to minimize the number, you want the smaller digits (zeros) to be as left as possible. Wait, but since the first digit is fixed as 1, the next digits: to minimize the number, after the first 1, we want as many zeros as possible. \n\nWait, the 9 digits (excluding the last two zeros) must contain 8 ones and 1 zero. To make the number as small as possible, the zero should be placed as early as possible in those 9 digits. \n\nWait, but that would make the number smaller. \n\nWait, let me think of the 9 digits (positions 2 to 10, since the first digit is 1, and the last two are zeros). \n\nThese 9 digits need to have 8 ones and 1 zero. To make the overall number as small as possible, the zero should be placed in the earliest possible position. \n\nWait, for example, putting the zero in the second position (right after the first 1):\n\nSo the number would be 1 0 followed by 8 ones and then two zeros: 101111111100. \n\nWait, but that's 1 followed by 0, then 8 ones, then two zeros. That's 11 digits. \n\nWait, let's count: 1 (digit1), 0 (digit2), then eight 1s (digits3-10), then two zeros (digits11-12). Wait, that's 12 digits. Wait, confusion again. \n\nWait, total digits must be 11. \n\nSo the 9 digits before the last two zeros must be exactly 9 digits. \n\nSo positions 1 is 1, then positions 2-10 (9 digits) must contain 8 ones and 1 zero, then positions 11-12 are zeros. Wait, but 1 +9 +2=12 digits. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. I think I messed up the total digits count earlier. \n\nWait, let's recalculate: \n\nThe number has to end with two zeros, so the last two digits are fixed. \n\nThe first digit is 1. \n\nThe remaining digits between the first and the last two zeros must have exactly 8 ones (since total ones needed are 9, and one is already in the first digit). \n\nThe number of digits between the first digit and the last two zeros is (total digits -3). \n\nWait, let me define total digits as N. \n\nThen N = 1 (first digit) + (N - 3) (digits between first and last two zeros) + 2 (last zeros) = N. \n\nThe digits between first and last two zeros must have 8 ones and (N-3 -8) zeros. \n\nBut we want the minimal N. \n\nTo have those digits between first and last two zeros have 8 ones, the minimal N is when those digits have as few digits as possible. \n\nThe minimal number of digits between first and last two zeros is 8 (all ones), making total digits 1+8+2=11. \n\nBut in that case, those digits are all ones, so the number is 1 followed by eight 1s and two zeros: 11111111100. \n\nHowever, if we introduce a zero in those 8 digits (so making it 9 digits instead of 8), then we can have the zero placed early to make the number smaller. \n\nWait, confusion arises from miscalculations earlier. Let's approach this systematically. \n\nLet me consider that the total digits must be such that:\n\nTotal digits = 1 (first digit) + (number of digits between first and last two zeros) + 2 (last two zeros). \n\nThe digits between first and last two zeros must contain exactly 8 ones. \n\nTo minimize the total number of digits, we want those 8 ones to be in as few digits as possible, but since they can be separated by zeros, perhaps inserting a zero allows for a smaller number. \n\nWait, actually, the minimal total digits is 11, as previously thought. Because if we have exactly 8 ones in the digits between first and last two zeros, then those digits need to be exactly 8 digits (all 1s). If we add a zero there, we need an extra digit, making total digits 12, which is larger. \n\nWait, so if we want the minimal number of digits, we can't have any zeros in the digits between first and last two zeros. Because that would require more digits. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of digits is 11, with the digits between first and last zeros being all ones. So the number is 11111111100. \n\nBut earlier I thought that 10111111100 is smaller but that requires 11 digits as well? \n\nWait, let's count digits in 10111111100: \n\n1 (1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 0 (10), 0 (11). \n\nWait, that's 11 digits. \n\nBut in this case, the digits between first and last two zeros (positions 2-10) have 7 ones and one zero. Wait, that's only 7 ones. But we need 8 ones. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake. \n\nIf the number is 10111111100, then the digits between the first digit and the last two zeros (positions 2 to 10) are: 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0. \n\nWait, that is: 0 followed by seven 1s and a 0. Wait, no, positions 2-10:\n\nPosition 2:0, positions 3-9: seven 1s, position 10: 0? Wait, but then the last two zeros start at position 10 and 11. \n\nWait, actually, in this number: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 \n\nThe digits between the first digit (position1) and the last two zeros (positions 10-11) are positions 2-9 (since the 10th is part of the last two zeros). \n\nWait, maybe my confusion is in the count. Let me parse it again:\n\nNumber is 10111111100. Let's list each digit:\n\n1 (1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 0 (10), 0 (11). \n\nSo the digits between first (position1) and the last two zeros (positions 10-11) are positions 2 through 9. That's 8 digits. \n\nIn those 8 digits, how many 1s are there? \n\nPositions 2:0, 3-9: seven 1s. So total of 7 ones. \n\nBut we need 8 ones in those digits. \n\nTherefore, this number only has 1 (first digit) +7 (in the middle) = 8 ones total. Which is insufficient. \n\nAh! So that's the problem. \n\nEarlier mistake was not counting the required number of 1s. \n\nSo, the total number of 1s must be 9. \n\nTherefore, in the digits between first and last two zeros (positions 2 to N-1, where N is total digits), there must be 8 ones. \n\nTherefore, in the case of 11 digits, those middle digits (positions 2-9) must have 8 ones. \n\nTherefore, if we try to place a zero in there, we would have to have only 7 ones, which is insufficient. \n\nTherefore, in the 11-digit case, the middle 8 digits must all be 1s. \n\nTherefore, the only 11-digit number possible is 11111111100. \n\nWait, so my earlier examples with 10111111100 were invalid because they didn't have enough 1s. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number is indeed 11111111100. \n\nBut let me confirm again. \n\nSuppose I want to have a 12-digit number. Then the middle digits (positions 2 to 10) can have 8 ones and one zero. \n\nSo the total digits would be 12. \n\nLet me construct such a number with a zero placed as early as possible to minimize the value. \n\nFor example, the number would be 1 followed by a 0, then seven 1s, then a 0, and then two zeros. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nTotal digits: 12. \n\nFirst digit:1. \n\nLast two digits:00. \n\nMiddle digits (positions 2-10): need 8 ones and 1 zero. \n\nTo minimize the number, place the zero as early as possible. \n\nSo the first middle digit (position2) is 0. \n\nThen positions 3-10 have seven 1s and one zero? Wait no, total of 8 ones and one zero in those 9 digits. \n\nWait, positions 2-10 (9 digits) need to have 8 ones and 1 zero. \n\nPlacing the zero at the first position (position2):\n\nNumber: 1 0 followed by 8 ones and then two zeros. \n\nWait, but positions 2-10 would be 0 followed by 8 ones. \n\nWait, 0 followed by 8 ones in 9 digits: yes, that's 8 ones and 1 zero. \n\nTherefore the number is 101111111100 (12 digits). \n\nThis has 1 (first digit) + 8 ones in positions 3-10, so total 9 ones. \n\nThis is a valid number. \n\nNow, 101111111100 is smaller than the 11-digit number 11111111100 (which is 11,111,111,100 vs 10,111,111,100). Wait, no, actually 10,111,111,100 is smaller. \n\nWait, but 101111111100 is 10 billion something, whereas 11111111100 is 11 billion. So indeed, the 12-digit number is smaller than the 11-digit one. \n\nWait a second! That contradicts the earlier conclusion. \n\nSo the key is that even though it has more digits, the numerical value is smaller. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number might actually be longer but with a smaller numeric value. \n\nTherefore, my previous assumption that the minimal digit count gives the minimal number is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, I need to consider numbers with more digits but smaller numeric value. \n\nSo the problem is now to find the smallest numeric value (not the fewest digits) such that it's a multiple of 450, composed of 0s and 1s, and ends with two zeros. \n\nTherefore, the approach should be to find the smallest number (numerically) composed of 0s and 1s, ending with 00, with digit sum a multiple of 9. \n\nTo find the smallest such number, we can think of it as the minimal number greater than or equal to 450, composed of 0s and 1s, divisible by 450. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a BFS approach, but since I'm doing this manually, let's think step by step. \n\nWe need the number to end with 00, so it's divisible by 100, which covers the 2 and 5\u00b2 requirements. \n\nThe digit sum must be divisible by 9. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest number made of 0s and 1s, ending with 00, with digit sum a multiple of 9. \n\nTo find the smallest such number, we can think of numbers ending with 00, with preceding digits consisting of 1s and 0s, with total 1s being 9, 18, etc. \n\nThe smallest possible would be with 9 ones. \n\nNow, the challenge is to arrange the 9 ones and the two zeros at the end in the smallest possible number. \n\nThe smallest number is the one with the least digits, but if a longer number has a smaller numeric value, it's better. \n\nWait, for example, 10000000000 (but that has digit sum 1, not divisible by 9). \n\nWait, the minimal number with digit sum 9, ending with 00. \n\nThe minimal number would be the one where the 1s are placed as far to the right as possible. \n\nSo, starting from the right, after the two zeros, we need to have nine 1s. But since we can have leading zeros (but not allowed), so the first digit must be 1. \n\nTherefore, the number would be 1 followed by some combination of 0s and 1s, totaling 9 ones, ending with 00. \n\nTo minimize the number, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. \n\nSo, the earliest possible digits after the first 1 should be 0s, with the 1s placed as far to the right as possible. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number would be 1 followed by (n-3 digits) where n is the total digits. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number is 1000000001100? Wait, no, that might not be minimal. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number would be the smallest number with 9 ones and two zeros at the end. \n\nThe smallest such number is 10000000000 (but digit sum 1) no. \n\nWait, the minimal number with 9 ones and ending with 00 is the number where the 9 ones are as far to the right as possible, after the initial 1. \n\nSo, for example, the number would be 1 followed by eight 0s, then nine 1s and two 0s? No, that's too long. \n\nWait, perhaps arranging the nine 1s after some zeros. \n\nLet me think of it as a number like 1 followed by a bunch of zeros, then a bunch of ones, then two zeros. \n\nTo make it as small as possible, the block of ones should be as far to the right as possible. \n\nFor example, the number 1 followed by k zeros, then nine 1s, then two zeros. \n\nBut the total number of digits would be 1 + k +9 +2. \n\nThe digit sum is 1 +9 =10? Wait, no, the digit sum must be 9 +1 (the first digit). Wait, no, the first digit is 1, then the nine 1s. So total 10 ones. \n\nWait, we need the digit sum to be a multiple of 9. \n\nAh! Right, the digit sum must be divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. \n\nSo, if we have the first digit as 1, then the remaining 1s must be 8, 17, etc. \n\nWait, so to get digit sum divisible by 9, the total number of 1s must be 9, 18, 27, etc. \n\nTherefore, the minimal is 9. \n\nTherefore, total number of 1s must be exactly 9, so the first digit is 1, then the remaining 8 ones are placed in the other digits (before the last two zeros). \n\nTherefore, the total digits are 1 (first) + (positions for 8 ones and some zeros) +2 (zeros). \n\nTo minimize the number, we need the 8 ones to be placed as far to the right as possible. \n\nTherefore, the number would be 1 followed by m zeros, then 8 ones, then two zeros. \n\nThe total digits are 1 + m +8 +2 = m +11. \n\nTo minimize the numeric value, we need the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. \n\nTherefore, the earliest digits after the first should be zeros. \n\nThus, the minimal number is when m is as large as possible. \n\nWait, but m is the number of zeros between the first digit and the block of 8 ones. \n\nTo place the 8 ones as far right as possible, m should be maximized. \n\nBut the total digits can't be infinite. \n\nWait, but since we can choose m as large as needed, but the numeric value will increase as m increases beyond a certain point. \n\nWait, actually, increasing m adds more leading zeros after the first digit, which decreases the numeric value. \n\nWait, for example, if m=8, then the number is 1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s and two 0s? Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nWait, if m is the number of zeros after the first digit before the 8 ones, then:\n\nNumber structure: \n\n1 followed by m zeros, then 8 ones, then two zeros. \n\nTotal digits: 1 + m +8 +2 = m +11. \n\nThe numeric value is 10^{m+10} + (10^2 -1)*10^{m+2} / (10-1) ? Not sure, but numerically, the number would look like 1 followed by m zeros, then eight 1s, then two zeros. \n\nFor example, if m=0:\n\n1 11111111 00 \u2192 11111111100 (11 digits). \n\nIf m=1:\n\n1 0 11111111 00 \u2192 101111111100 (12 digits). \n\nIf m=2:\n\n1 00 11111111 00 \u2192 1001111111100 (13 digits). \n\nAnd so on. \n\nThe numeric value of the number when m increases is actually getting smaller? \n\nWait, 101111111100 (12 digits) is 10,111,111,100, whereas the 11-digit number is 11,111,111,100. \n\nYes, the 12-digit number is smaller. \n\nSimilarly, m=2 gives 1001111111100 (13 digits) which is 10,011,111,1100 \u2192 10,011,111,100 which is even smaller. \n\nContinuing this, m=8:\n\n1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s and two zeros: \n\n1 00000000 11111111 00 \u2192 which is 1000000001111111100 (total digits 1+8+8+2=19). \n\nThis number is 1,000,000,001,111,111,100 which is way smaller than the 12-digit one. \n\nWait, but the digit sum here is 1 (first digit) +8 (ones) =9. \n\nYes, so this is valid. \n\nHowever, this is a 19-digit number. But is there an even smaller numeric value? \n\nWait, if we make m=9, then:\n\n1 followed by nine 0s, then eight 1s and two zeros: \n\n1 000000000 11111111 00 \u2192 10000000001111111100 (20 digits). \n\nThis is even smaller numerically but longer. \n\nThe trend is that as m increases, the numeric value decreases (since we add more leading zeros after the first digit), but the length increases. \n\nHowever, the minimal numeric value would be when m approaches infinity, but we can't do that. \n\nWait, but actually, the smallest possible numeric value is when the number is the smallest possible, which would be the earliest possible occurrence where the conditions are met. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a smaller number with fewer digits. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose we consider numbers where the number of 1s is 9, and arranged such that the numeric value is as small as possible. \n\nThe smallest possible number would have the 1s as far to the right as possible, which requires placing them after as many zeros as possible. \n\nThus, the minimal number would be 1000000001100? Wait, but let's count the 1s there: \n\n1 followed by eight 0s, then two 1s and two 0s?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that's made up entirely of zeros and ones. Hmm, let's see. Alright, first, let's break down what the problem is asking. A multiple of 450 means that the number has to be divisible by 450. And the digits can only be 0 or 1. So, the number must end with a bunch of zeros and ones, but all digits except maybe the trailing zeros have to be 1 or 0? Wait, no, actually all digits can be 0 or 1. So the entire number is composed of 0s and 1s. But it has to be a multiple of 450. \n\nFirst, let me recall that 450 factors into prime factors. Let me do that. 450 is 45 times 10, which is 9*5*10. Breaking that down further, 9 is 3 squared, 5 is prime, and 10 is 2*5. Wait, so 450 is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2. So the prime factors are 2, 3, 3, 5, 5. \n\nTherefore, any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 3^2 (so 9), and 5^2 (so 25). Let me note down the divisibility rules for these factors since the number can only have 0s and 1s. \n\nStarting with divisibility by 2: For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. So whatever number we come up with must end with a 0. That makes sense. \n\nNext, divisibility by 5: Similarly, a number divisible by 5 must end with 0 or 5. But since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. So actually, the number must end with at least one 0. But since we already have to satisfy divisibility by 2, the last digit is already 0. However, for divisibility by 5^2, which is 25, we need to make sure the number is divisible by 25. \n\nWait, right. The number must be divisible by 25 as well. Divisibility by 25 requires that the last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. But since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the only possible options here are 00. Because 25, 50, 75 contain digits 2,5,7 which aren't allowed. Therefore, the last two digits must be 00. So the number must end with two zeros. So that's an important point. So the number must end with \"00\".\n\nNow, moving on to divisibility by 9 (since 9 is 3 squared). Divisibility by 9 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. Since the digits are only 0s and 1s, the sum of the digits is just the number of 1s in the number. Therefore, the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9. \n\nSo putting all together, the number must:\n\n- End with two zeros (so last two digits 00).\n\n- The total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.\n\nAdditionally, it must be the smallest such number. So we need the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s, ending with 00, with the number of 1s being a multiple of 9, and the number itself must be divisible by 450 (so also divisible by 2,5,9, etc. as above). \n\nSo, the approach is probably to construct a number with 1s and 0s ending with 00, and the number of 1s is a multiple of 9, and find the smallest such number. Since we need the minimal one, perhaps the number should have the least number of digits possible. \n\nLet me think how to approach this. Since the number ends with two zeros, the structure is something like N followed by 00, where N is a sequence of 1s and 0s. The total number of 1s in N plus the two zeros (but zeros don't contribute to the digit sum) must be a multiple of 9. Wait, actually the zeros don't add to the digit sum, so the number of 1s in the entire number (including the part before the last two zeros) must be a multiple of 9. \n\nTherefore, we need to construct the number as follows: The number is composed of some 1s and 0s, ending with \"00\", and the count of 1s is divisible by 9. The goal is to make the smallest such number (smallest in numerical value, which corresponds to the fewest digits possible). \n\nTo minimize the number, we want as few digits as possible. Let's think about how to structure this. The minimal number would have the fewest digits possible. Let's consider the minimal number of digits required. \n\nFirst, the number must end with two zeros, so the minimal length is at least 3 digits. But obviously, a 3-digit number ending with 00 would be 100, but that has only one 1, which is not a multiple of 9. So that's too small. \n\nSimilarly, a 4-digit number could be 1100, which has two 1s. Still not 9. 10100? Wait, no, the last two must be 00. Let me think step by step. \n\nPerhaps the number must be at least 11 digits? Let me see. Since the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9, the minimal number of 1s is 9. So, the number must have at least 9 ones and two zeros at the end, so total digits at least 11. But perhaps the minimal number is more than that because of the arrangement. \n\nWait, but maybe the 9 ones can be arranged in the first part before the two zeros, but we have to ensure that the entire number is divisible by 25 and 9. Wait, actually, since we already have the two zeros at the end, the divisibility by 25 is satisfied, and the digit sum (number of ones) must be divisible by 9. So perhaps the minimal number would be the smallest number with 9 ones followed by two zeros? But arranged such that the number is as small as possible. \n\nWait, but arranging the ones and zeros in the first part to make the number as small as possible. The smallest number would have the 1s as far to the right as possible. Wait, actually, to minimize the numerical value, you want the leftmost digits to be as few as possible. So perhaps arranging the 1s with as many leading zeros as possible? But the number can't have leading zeros. So the first digit must be 1, followed by some combination of 0s and 1s, then ending with two 0s. \n\nHmm. Let me think. The problem is similar to finding the smallest number made of 1's and 0's ending with 00, with digit sum 9. The minimal such number would have the 1's as far to the right as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem that can be approached by considering the number as N = (a number composed of 1s and 0s) followed by 00. Let me denote the part before the last two zeros as M. So N = M * 100. Then, since N must be divisible by 450, then N must be divisible by 450, so M * 100 must be divisible by 450. Dividing both sides by 50, we get M * 2 must be divisible by 9. Therefore, M must be divisible by 9/ gcd(2,9) which is 9. So M must be divisible by 9. \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nWe have N = M * 100. 450 divides N, so 450 divides M * 100. Therefore, M * 100 must be a multiple of 450. \n\nDivide both sides by 50: M * 2 must be a multiple of 9. Because 450 / 50 = 9, and 100 / 50 = 2. \n\nTherefore, 2*M \u2261 0 mod 9. Therefore, M must be \u2261 0 mod 9/ gcd(2,9). Since gcd(2,9)=1, so M must be divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, M must be divisible by 9. Since M is a number consisting of 1s and 0s (since the digits before the last two zeros are part of M), we need the smallest such M divisible by 9, and then N will be M followed by 00. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s (without leading zeros) that is divisible by 9, and then appending two zeros to it. \n\nSince the digit sum of M must be a multiple of 9 (because the digit sum of a number divisible by 9 must be a multiple of 9). Since M is made up of 1s and 0s, the digit sum is just the number of 1s in M, so that must be a multiple of 9. \n\nTherefore, the minimal such M is the smallest number made of 1s and 0s (starting with 1) with digit sum 9. Because adding more 1s would make it larger, so minimal digit sum is 9. \n\nTherefore, the minimal M would be the number with nine 1s and as few digits as possible, but arranged to be the smallest number. Wait, but to make the smallest number, we need the fewest digits possible? Wait, no, the minimal number (numerically) would have the 1s as far to the right as possible. \n\nWait, actually, the minimal number with nine 1s would be 111111111 (nine 1s). But that's 111111111, which is 9 digits. But perhaps there is a smaller number (numerically) with nine 1s and some 0s. For example, 1000000001 would have two 1s, but that's not enough. Wait, but we need exactly nine 1s. \n\nWait, no, actually, the minimal number (smallest in value) with nine 1s would be 111111111 (nine 1s) because adding zeros would make it longer, but the leading digits would be 1 followed by zeros. Wait, actually, if you have nine 1s, the smallest number is 111111111. If you spread the 1s out with zeros, the number would be larger because the first digit is still 1, but the following digits could have zeros, but the total number of digits would be more. For example, 1000000001 has two 1s and is smaller than 111111111, but in our case, we need nine 1s. So the minimal number with nine 1s is indeed 111111111. \n\nWait, but that would be the minimal in terms of digit count. However, perhaps there is a number with more digits but a smaller numeric value? For example, 10000000000000000001 has two 1s but more zeros. But since we need exactly nine 1s, the minimal numeric value would be achieved by having the first digit 1, followed by the remaining 1s as far to the right as possible. \n\nWait, actually, the smallest number with nine 1s is indeed 111111111. Any other arrangement with zeros would require adding more digits, making the number longer, hence larger in numeric value. For example, 1011111111 has ten digits but starts with 1 followed by 0, so the number is 1,011,111,111 which is larger than 111,111,111. Wait, actually, no, 1011111111 is 1,011,111,111 which is larger than 111,111,111. So the minimal number with nine 1s is indeed 111111111 (nine 1s). \n\nTherefore, the minimal M is 111111111. Then N would be 11111111100. But is that divisible by 450?\n\nWait, let's check. 11111111100 divided by 450. Let me compute 11111111100 / 450. \n\nFirst, 450 is 45*10, so divide by 10 first: 1111111110. Then divide by 45: 1111111110 /45. Let's see, 45 times 24,691,358 is 1,111,111,110. Wait, 45 * 24,691,358 = 45*(24,000,000 + 691,358) = 1,080,000,000 + 45*691,358. Let me compute 45*691,358:\n\n45 * 691,358 = 45*(700,000 - 8,642) = 45*700,000 - 45*8,642 = 31,500,000 - 388,890 = 31,500,000 - 388,890 = 31,111,110. \n\nAdding to the previous part: 1,080,000,000 + 31,111,110 = 1,111,111,110. So yes, 45 * 24,691,358 = 1,111,111,110. Therefore, 1,111,111,110 is divisible by 450. Therefore, 11111111100 divided by 10 is 1111111110, which divided by 45 gives exactly that. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is divisible by 450. \n\nBut wait, is there a smaller number? Because maybe there is a smaller M (the part before the two zeros) that is divisible by 9 but with fewer digits. Wait, but the minimal digit sum for divisibility by 9 is 9, so M must have at least nine 1s. The minimal number of digits for M would be nine (all 1s), so 111111111. If there's a number with more digits but with 9 ones arranged such that the number is smaller, but with leading zeros? No, leading zeros aren't allowed. \n\nWait, for example, could there be a number like 1111111101? That has nine 1s but spread out. Wait, 1111111101 is 10 digits, which is longer than 9 digits, so numerically it's larger. The 9-digit number 111111111 is smaller than any 10-digit number starting with 1. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is indeed the minimal such number. Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number with more 1s but arranged in a way that the total number is smaller? No, because the digit sum must be a multiple of 9, so the next possible digit sum would be 18, but that would require 18 ones, which would make the number much longer, so larger. \n\nHmm. Wait, but maybe there is a number with nine 1s but arranged with some zeros in between that actually results in a smaller number when followed by two zeros. For instance, maybe 10000000011? But that has only two 1s. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps 10000000000000000000000000000000000000001 followed by zeros? No, that's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a number with nine 1s but with some zeros in between that actually results in a smaller number than 111111111 followed by two zeros. Let me think: \n\nSuppose the number is 11111111100 (the candidate). Another number could be 111111110100? Wait, but that's 12 digits. But 11111111100 is 11 digits. So shorter is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a number like 100111111100? Let's see: 1 followed by zeros and ones. Wait, but the digit count would still be more than 11. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a different arrangement of the 1s in the first 9 digits? Like 100000000 followed by 1s? Wait, but to have nine 1s in 9 digits, the only way is all 1s. If you have fewer digits, you can't have nine 1s. \n\nWait, so the minimal M is indeed 111111111 (nine 1s) and then adding two zeros gives 11111111100, which is 11 digits. \n\nBut let me check if there's a smaller number. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose instead of nine 1s, maybe a higher multiple of 9? Like 18? But that would require more digits. So probably not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number doesn't have exactly nine 1s but more, but arranged such that the total is a multiple of nine, but the number is shorter? Wait, but how?\n\nWait a second, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine the logic. \n\nThe problem requires the entire number (before appending the two zeros) must have a digit sum divisible by 9, but since we append two zeros, which don't affect the digit sum. Therefore, the total digit sum of N (the final number) is equal to the digit sum of M (the part before the zeros). Therefore, M must have digit sum divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, the minimal M is the smallest number (with 1s and 0s, no leading zeros) with digit sum 9. The minimal such M is indeed 111111111 (nine 1s). \n\nHence, the minimal N is 11111111100. \n\nBut let me verify with an example. Let's see, 11111111100 divided by 450. \n\nCalculating 11111111100 \u00f7 450. \n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1111111110 \u00f7 45. \n\nNow, 45 \u00d7 24,691,358 = 1,111,111,110, as I had before. Which is exactly the numerator. So yes, it's divisible. \n\nTherefore, the number is valid. \n\nBut wait, is there a smaller number? Let's see, maybe with leading zeros? No, leading zeros aren't allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the 1s in such a way that the number is shorter? Let me think. Suppose instead of nine 1s, can we have a number with nine 1s but in fewer digits? No, because nine 1s in a number must be at least nine digits. So the minimal length is nine digits for M, then adding two zeros gives 11 digits. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is the minimal. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. Let me check if there is a number with nine 1s but arranged in a way that when followed by two zeros, the entire number is smaller. But since the first digit must be 1, the next digits can be 0s and 1s. For example, 10000000000 is 1 followed by ten zeros, but that has only one 1. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 11111111000: Wait, that's 10 digits before the two zeros? Wait, no, if it's 111111110 followed by two zeros, that would be 11111111000, which has 10 digits before the two zeros? Wait, no, actually, the M in that case would be 111111110 (eight 1s and one 0), which has a digit sum of 8, which isn't divisible by 9. So that's invalid. \n\nAlternatively, 11111110100: That would be M as 111111101, which has seven 1s and one 0? Wait, no, count again: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1 \u2192 that's eight 1s. Not nine. \n\nHmm. Maybe 11111111100 is indeed the smallest. \n\nWait, another way: Let's think of the problem as finding the minimal number consisting of 1's and 0's ending with 00, with digit sum a multiple of 9, and the number itself divisible by 25 (which is already handled by ending with 00). So the key is the digit sum divisible by 9 and the number must be divisible by 9 (which it is if the digit sum is divisible by 9). \n\nTherefore, the minimal such number would be the minimal number with digit sum 9 and ending with 00. Since the minimal digit sum is 9, the minimal number is the smallest number with 9 ones and ending with two zeros. \n\nTo make it as small as possible, we want the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. Since it must start with a 1, the next digits should have as many zeros as possible before the remaining 1s. \n\nWait, so for example, if I have nine 1s and two zeros at the end, the minimal number would be 100000000100? Wait, but that's 12 digits. Wait, but that has only two 1s. No. \n\nWait, the total number of 1s has to be nine. So perhaps the minimal number would be 1 followed by eight zeros, then a 1, then two zeros? But that would be 1 00000000 1 00, totaling 11 digits. But that has two 1s. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, arranging the 1s as 1 followed by 0s and then 1s. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number is 11111111100 (eleven digits) because any other arrangement with nine 1s would require at least nine 1s in the first part, so the minimal is to have them all in the front. \n\nAlternatively, if I spread the 1s out with zeros in between, the number becomes longer but might actually be larger numerically. For instance, 10000000011111111100 would be way longer and bigger. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number is indeed 11111111100. \n\nWait, but let me test a smaller candidate. Suppose someone claims that 11111111100 is the answer, but is there a smaller one?\n\nSuppose we try with 9 ones but arranged in a shorter number.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are only zeros and ones. Hmm, let me think. First, I know that 450 factors into prime factors. Let me write that down. 450 is 45 times 10, which is 9*5*2*5? Wait, no, 45 is 9*5, and 10 is 2*5, so altogether that's 2*3\u00b2*5\u00b2. Right, so the prime factors are 2, 3 squared, and 5 squared. \n\nNow, the multiple has to be a number made up entirely of 1s and 0s. So it's like a number like 100, 101, 110, 111, etc., but with all digits 0 or 1. And it has to be divisible by 450. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, since 450 is divisible by 10 (because of the 2 and 5), the number must end with a 0. So the last digit has to be 0. That makes sense. So whatever number we come up with must end with a 0. \n\nNext, the number must be divisible by 9. Because 450 has 9 as a factor (since 3 squared is 9). For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Since all the digits are 1s and 0s, the sum of the digits is just the number of 1s. So the number of 1s in the number must be a multiple of 9. \n\nAlso, since it has to be divisible by 5\u00b2, which is 25, the last two digits must form a number divisible by 25. But since the last digit is 0 (from the 10 factor), the last two digits can only be 00 or something else. Wait, but to be divisible by 25, the last two digits need to be 00, 25, 50, or 75. But since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the only possible last two digits are 00. So the number must end with two zeros. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The number must be divisible by 25. Since the number ends with 0 (from the 10 requirement), the last two digits must form a number divisible by 25. The possible endings for divisibility by 25 are 00, 25, 50, 75. But since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the only possible two-digit endings are 00. Because 25, 50, 75 have digits that are not 0 or 1. So the last two digits must be 00. Therefore, the number must end with two zeros. So the number must end with \"00\". So that's an important point. So the number has to end with two zeros. \n\nSo putting that together, the number must end with \"00\", have a digit sum (number of 1s) divisible by 9, and also divisible by 2 (which it already is because it ends with 0). Wait, but 450 is already 2*3\u00b2*5\u00b2, so all the factors are covered by ensuring divisibility by 2, 9, and 25. So those three conditions together should ensure divisibility by 450. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s, ending with 00, with the number of 1s being a multiple of 9. \n\nNow, how to approach this? Let me think. The number must have at least two zeros at the end. The remaining digits (before the last two zeros) can be a combination of 1s and 0s, but the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. Also, we want the smallest such number, so we need the fewest digits possible. \n\nLet me think of constructing such a number. Since the number must end with 00, the part before the last two zeros must be a number made of 1s and 0s, and when you append \"00\" to it, the total number of 1s is a multiple of 9. \n\nSo essentially, the problem is equivalent to finding the smallest number (in terms of digit length) made of 1s and 0s, which when followed by \"00\" has a digit sum divisible by 9. \n\nAlternatively, the number before the trailing zeros must have a digit sum that is 0 mod 9, since adding the two zeros doesn't add to the digit sum. \n\nSo the key is to find the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s (without any trailing zeros yet) such that its digit sum is a multiple of 9, and then append \"00\" to it. \n\nBut since we need the entire number (with the two zeros) to be as small as possible, we need the minimal length possible. \n\nSo the minimal number of 1s required is 9, because the digit sum must be a multiple of 9, so the smallest possible sum is 9. \n\nTherefore, the number before the two zeros must have exactly nine 1s and some number of 0s, arranged such that the number itself is as small as possible. Wait, but the total digits (including the two zeros) must be minimized. \n\nWait, but actually, the total number of digits would be (number of digits in the prefix) + 2. To minimize the total, the prefix should be as short as possible. \n\nSo, the minimal prefix is a number made of 1s and 0s with a digit sum of 9, and as few digits as possible. \n\nSo, the minimal number of digits needed for a digit sum of 9 with 1s and 0s is 9 digits of 1 followed by nothing else. But that would be 111111111 (nine 1s). But perhaps there's a shorter number with 0s interspersed? Wait, no. Because if you have 0s, that would require more digits to reach the same digit sum. For example, 101111111 has 8 ones and one zero, so the digit sum is still 8? Wait, no, 101111111 has 8 ones? Wait, let me count: 1 followed by 0, then seven 1s? Wait, maybe my example is off. Let me think again. \n\nActually, the minimal number of digits needed for a digit sum of 9 is 9 digits of 1, since adding any 0 would require adding an extra digit without increasing the digit sum. So to get a digit sum of 9 in the fewest digits, you just have nine 1s. \n\nTherefore, the minimal prefix would be 111111111, followed by 00, making the number 11111111100. But wait, is this number divisible by 450? Let me check. \n\nFirst, check divisibility by 10: yes, ends with 0. \n\nDivisibility by 9: sum of digits is 9, so yes. \n\nDivisibility by 25: last two digits are 00, so yes. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 should be divisible by 450. But is that the smallest possible?\n\nWait a second, perhaps there is a smaller number. Because maybe the number of 1s can be 9, but arranged in a shorter number by having some zeros in between? Wait, but to have nine 1s, you can't have fewer than nine digits. So the minimal prefix is nine 1s. So 11111111100 is 11 digits long. \n\nBut maybe there's a number with more than nine 1s but arranged in such a way that the total digits are fewer? Wait, no. Because if the digit sum must be a multiple of nine, the minimal digit sum is nine. So if you have 18 ones, that would require more digits. So 9 is the minimal. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is the minimal? Hmm. But let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number isn't necessarily all 1s followed by 00. Maybe there's a number with some zeros in between the 1s which is shorter? Wait, but if the digit sum is nine, you can't have fewer than nine 1s, so the minimal number of digits would be nine 1s plus two zeros, totaling 11 digits. \n\nBut maybe arranging the 1s and 0s in a different way allows a smaller number? For example, leading zeros aren't allowed, so the number must start with 1. \n\nWait, perhaps 11111111100 is indeed the smallest. But let me test it. \n\nWait, let me compute 11111111100 divided by 450. Let's see. 11111111100 divided by 450. \n\nFirst, 450 times 24,000 is 10,800,000. Hmm, but 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100. Let me do it step by step. \n\nAlternatively, since 450 is 45*10, so 11111111100 divided by 10 is 1,111,111,110. Then divided by 45. \n\n1,111,111,110 divided by 45. Let me see: 45*24,691,358 = ?\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too calculation-heavy, perhaps I should think of another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a smaller number. Let me think differently. \n\nThe problem requires the number to be divisible by 450, so it must be divisible by 2, 5\u00b2, and 9. \n\nWe already considered the divisibility by 2 and 5\u00b2, so the last two digits must be 00. \n\nDivisibility by 9 requires the digit sum to be a multiple of 9. \n\nSo the minimal number is the minimal number made of 1's and 0's ending with 00, with the number of 1's being a multiple of 9, and as short as possible. \n\nThe minimal number of 1's is 9, so we need a number that has 9 ones and some zeros (including the last two zeros). \n\nThe minimal length would be 9 ones plus 2 zeros, but arranged in the shortest possible way. \n\nHowever, the arrangement must start with a 1 (since leading zeros are not allowed). So the first digit is 1, then the remaining digits can be arranged with as few digits as possible. \n\nThe minimal arrangement would be 11111111100 (nine 1s followed by two 0s), which is 11 digits. \n\nBut perhaps there is a shorter arrangement where the 9 ones are spread out with some zeros in between, but allowing the total digits to be less? \n\nWait, no. Because even if you have zeros in between, the total number of digits must be at least 9 (for the 1s) + 2 (for the 0s) = 11 digits. So you can't have fewer than 11 digits. \n\nTherefore, 11111111100 is the minimal such number. \n\nBut let me check another possibility. Suppose instead of nine 1s, maybe the digit sum is 18 (the next multiple of 9). Then, the number could have 18 ones and two zeros, but that would require 20 digits, which is longer. So that's worse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a number with 9 ones but arranged in a way that the total digits are less? Wait, no. Because even if you have 9 ones and 0 zeros before the last two, you have 11 digits. If you add a zero somewhere in the middle, that would make it 12 digits, which is longer. \n\nWait, unless there's a way to have the same digit count but with a smaller numerical value. For example, maybe a number like 100000000100? Let's see: digit sum is 1+1=2, which isn't divisible by 9. So that's no good. \n\nAlternatively, 111000000000? The digit sum is 3, which is also not divisible by 9. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal is indeed 11 digits. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there is a number with fewer digits. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe the digit sum doesn't have to be exactly 9. It can be 9, 18, 27, etc. So perhaps a smaller number can have a digit sum of 9 but arranged in a shorter number? But how?\n\nWait, the minimal number of digits is 11. So unless there is a number with 9 ones and 2 zeros in 11 digits, which is exactly the 11111111100. So that's the minimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another arrangement with the same number of digits but a smaller numerical value? For example, 10011101100 would have the same number of digits but a smaller number. But the digit sum must be 9. Let me check that example: 1+0+0+1+1+1+0+1+1+0+0. Wait, adding those up: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5? That's only 5. Not 9. So that's not enough. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of a number like 110000000100. That has 1+1+1=3? No, again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, 11111111001. Wait, but that ends with a 1, which doesn't satisfy the last two digits being 00. \n\nAh right, the last two digits must be 00, so the last two digits are fixed. So the first nine digits (before the two zeros) must have a digit sum of 9. Wait, no, the total digit sum (including the last two zeros) is the same as the digit sum of the first part. Since the last two are zeros. \n\nTherefore, the first part (the leading digits before the two zeros) must have a digit sum of 9. To make that first part as small as possible numerically, we want the digits to be as small as possible. \n\nSo the smallest number with digit sum 9 using 1s and 0s is 111111111 (nine 1s). Because any other arrangement would require more digits. For instance, 1000000000 has a digit sum of 1, so to get to 9, you need 9 ones. \n\nAlternatively, arranging the 1s with zeros in between might lead to a smaller number. For example, 100000000000000000001, but that's way longer. \n\nWait, actually, to get a digit sum of 9, the minimal number in terms of digit length is nine 1s. Any other arrangement with zeros would require more digits. For example, 1000000001 has two 1s and eight 0s, but that's only a digit sum of 2, so you need more 1s. \n\nTherefore, the minimal arrangement is nine 1s followed by two 0s. So the number is 11111111100. \n\nBut let me verify this by checking if 11111111100 divided by 450 gives an integer. \n\nLet me compute 11111111100 \u00f7 450. \n\nFirst, divide by 10: 11111111100 /10 = 1111111110 \n\nThen divide by 45: 1111111110 \u00f745. \n\nLet me compute 1111111110 \u00f745. \n\n45 \u00d7 24,691,358 = ?\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to note that 111111111 is 9 ones, which is known to be 111,111,111. \n\nSo 111,111,111 divided by 9 is 12,345,679. So 111,111,111 = 9 \u00d7 12,345,679. \n\nTherefore, 111,111,1110 (the number after dividing by 10) is 111,111,111 \u00d710, so 111,111,1110 divided by 45 is (9 \u00d7 12,345,679 \u00d7 10) / (9\u00d75) ) = (12,345,679 \u00d710)/5 = 12,345,679 \u00d72 = 24,691,358. \n\nSo yes, it divides exactly. Therefore, 11111111100 is indeed divisible by 450. \n\nBut is there a smaller number? Let's see. Suppose someone arranges the 1s and 0s in a different way with the same number of digits but a smaller number. For example, 10011111100. Let's see the digit sum is still 9 (the first 1, then four 1s in the middle, etc.), but the number is smaller numerically. \n\nWait, the number 10011111100 is 10 digits? Wait, no, let me count. Let's see: \n\nStarting with 1, then 0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0. That's 10 digits? Wait, no. Let's count each digit:\n\n1 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 0 (10), 0 (11). So it's 11 digits. So same length as the previous one, but smaller in value. \n\nWait, so maybe that's a smaller number? Let me see. \n\nThe number 10011111100 is 10011111100. Let's compare it to 11111111100. \n\nWhich is smaller? Well, the first digit is 1 in both. The second digit: 0 vs 1. So 100... is smaller than 111... So yes, 10011111100 is smaller than 11111111100. \n\nSo that's a better candidate. \n\nWait, so my initial thought was wrong because I didn't consider that arranging the 1s with some zeros in between can lead to a smaller number even with the same number of digits. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal number isn't the all 1s followed by zeros, but a number where the 1s are spread out to make the overall number smaller. \n\nSo how do we find the minimal such number?\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the smallest number (numerically) composed of 1s and 0s, ending with \"00\", with exactly nine 1s in total. Because the digit sum must be 9. \n\nTo get the smallest number possible, we need the leftmost digits to be as small as possible. Since the first digit must be 1, the next digits should be 0s as much as possible before placing the remaining 1s. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number would be the one where after the leading 1, we have as many 0s as possible, then the remaining 1s, followed by the two 0s. \n\nWait, but the total number of 1s must be nine. So let's see. \n\nStart with 1, then followed by zeros until we have to place the remaining eight 1s. \n\nThe minimal number would be arranging the 1s as far to the right as possible. \n\nSo the number would be 1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s and then two 0s? Wait, no, let me think step by step. \n\nWait, the total number of 1s is nine. The first digit is 1, so that's one 1. The remaining eight 1s can be placed in the remaining digits before the last two zeros. \n\nTo make the number as small as possible, those remaining 1s should be placed as far to the right as possible. \n\nSo the structure is: \n\n1 followed by (some zeros) then the remaining 1s, then two zeros. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number would be 1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s and two zeros? Wait, no. Let me structure it properly. \n\nLet me think of the number as N followed by \"00\", where N is a number made of 1s and 0s with a digit sum of 9. We need the smallest possible N followed by 00. \n\nTo make the entire number as small as possible, N must be the smallest possible number with digit sum 9 (using 1s and 0s), and then append \"00\". \n\nSo the minimal N is the minimal number (smallest in value) with nine 1s and any number of 0s. \n\nThe minimal number with nine 1s is 1000000001 (but that has two 1s). Wait, no. Wait, the minimal number with digit sum 9 is the number with the least digits (which is nine 1s), but arranged to be as small as possible. \n\nWait, actually, numbers with the same digit sum can have different numerical values. For example, 10000000000000000001 is way bigger than 111111111. \n\nTherefore, the minimal numerical value for a number with nine 1s is indeed 111111111, but when considering that we can have leading zeros (but we can't, since numbers don't have leading zeros), so the first digit is fixed as 1, then the remaining digits can be arranged with as many zeros as possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number N is 1000000000 (ten digits with one 1 and nine 0s) but that's digit sum 1. Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, to get digit sum 9, the minimal number would be 111111111 (nine 1s). But if you can spread the 1s with zeros in between to make a smaller number, then that's better. \n\nFor example, 100000000000000000000001 has a digit sum of 2. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 1000000001 has two 1s. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number N is 111111111, so the total number is 11111111100. But when you can arrange the 1s with some zeros in between, you can get a smaller number. \n\nWait, here's an example: 10011111100. Let's see:\n\nThe number is 1 followed by two 0s, then six 1s, then two 0s. Wait, the digit sum here is 1 + 6 = 7. That's not 9. Oops, my mistake. \n\nWait, I need exactly nine 1s. Let me try again. Let's try to construct N as follows: \n\nStart with 1, then as many zeros as possible, then the remaining 8 ones. \n\nSuppose after the first 1, we put seven 0s, then the remaining eight 1s. That would give a number like 10000000111111111. Wait, but that would have 1 + 7 zeros + 8 ones, totaling 16 digits. Then adding two zeros at the end would make it 18 digits. That's worse than the 11-digit number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a smarter arrangement. Let me think of the minimal number with nine 1s. The minimal number is the one where the 1s are as far to the right as possible. \n\nThe minimal number with nine 1s is 111111111, but if you can place some zeros in between, you can have a smaller number. \n\nWait, actually, numbers are compared digit by digit from left to right. So to get the smallest possible number, after the leading 1, the next digits should be as small as possible (i.e., 0s) until the remaining 1s have to be placed. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number would be 1 followed by eight 0s, then eight 1s? Wait, but that would give a digit sum of 1 + 8 = 9. Wait, no. Wait, 1 followed by eight 0s is 1000000000, then adding eight 1s? Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as: \n\nThe minimal number with nine 1s is achieved by placing the 1s as far to the right as possible. For example, the number would be 1000000001 (but that only has two 1s). Not enough. \n\nAlternatively, 10000000000000000001 has two 1s again. \n\nWait, maybe the minimal number with nine 1s is indeed 111111111. Because any other arrangement would require more digits? \n\nWait, no, you can have nine 1s in fewer digits? No, nine 1s require at least nine digits. So the minimal number of digits is nine. Therefore, the minimal numerical value is 111111111. \n\nTherefore, when you append \"00\" to it, you get 11111111100, which is the minimal. \n\nBut earlier I thought of 10011111100 which has the same number of digits but is numerically smaller. Wait, how many 1s does that have? Let me count again. \n\n1 followed by 0,0, then 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s?), then 0,0. Wait, let's count each digit:\n\n1 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10?), wait no. Let me write it out: \n\nNumber: 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Wait, that's 12 digits. Wait, no. Let me recount. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try again. \n\nSuppose the number is 10011111100. Let's count the digits:\n\n1 (1st digit), 0 (2nd), 0 (3rd), 1 (4th), 1 (5th), 1 (6th), 1 (7th), 1 (8th), 1 (9th), 1 (10th?), no. Wait, actually, the last two digits are zeros. Let me write it as:\n\nDigits 1 to 11:\n\n1 (digit1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 0 (10), 0 (11). \n\nSo that's 11 digits. The number of 1s here is 1 (digit1) plus six 1s from digits 4-9, totaling 7 ones. Not enough. \n\nAh, so my mistake earlier was in the count. To have nine 1s, let's try again. \n\nSuppose I have 1 followed by two 0s, then seven 1s, then two 0s. That would give digit count: 1 + 2 +7 +2? Wait, total digits would be 1 (first 1) + 2 zeros +7 ones + 2 zeros? Wait, that would be 12 digits. The number of 1s is 1 +7 =8. Still not enough. \n\nWait, so to have nine 1s, starting with a 1, then some zeros, then the remaining eight 1s. \n\nSuppose after the first 1, we put one 0, then eight 1s, followed by two zeros. That gives the number 101111111100. Let's count digits:\n\n1 (1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 1 (4), 1 (5), 1 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10), 0 (11), 0 (12). Wait, that's 12 digits. The digit sum is 1 + 8 =9. So this number is 101111111100. Which is 12 digits. But the original 11111111100 is 11 digits, which is shorter, so smaller in length, hence smaller in value. \n\nTherefore, that approach doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to have the first digit as 1, then a 0, then seven 0s, then eight 1s and two zeros. Wait, no, that would be too long. \n\nAlternatively, after the first 1, place seven 0s, then eight 1s, then two zeros. That's 1 +7 +8 +2 = 18 digits, which is way longer. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal is indeed 11 digits. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the digit sum doesn't have to be exactly 9, but could be 18? But that would require more digits, so the number would be longer, so not minimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a smaller digit sum? Wait, no, the digit sum must be divisible by 9, so the minimal is 9. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number is 11111111100. \n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Let's think of the problem as finding the minimal number N such that N is a multiple of 450, all digits are 0 or 1, and N ends with 00. \n\nSince N must be divisible by 450, it's equivalent to N mod 450 = 0. \n\nWe can model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal number composed of 1's and 0's ending with 00, such that it's divisible by 450. \n\nAnother approach is to consider that since N ends with 00, we can write N as M * 100, where M is a number composed of 1's and 0's. \n\nThen, N = M * 100. \n\nWe need N divisible by 450 \u21d2 M * 100 divisible by 450 \u21d2 M * 100 /450 = M /4.5 must be an integer \u21d2 M must be divisible by 9 (since 450= 100*4.5, so M must be divisible by 9). \n\nWait, let me recast it properly. \n\nN = M * 100. \n\nWe need N divisible by 450 \u21d2 M*100 divisible by 450 \u21d2 M*100 /450 = M/(450/100) = M/4.5 \u21d2 must be integer. \n\nBut 4.5 is 9/2, so M must be divisible by 9/2 \u21d2 but M must be an integer, so M must be divisible by 9 and even? Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of prime factors. \n\n450 = 2*3\u00b2*5\u00b2. \n\nN = M * 2\u00b2*5\u00b2. \n\nSo N must have at least 2\u00b9, 3\u00b2, and 5\u00b2 in its factors. \n\nSince N = M *2\u00b2*5\u00b2, then M must supply the remaining factors. \n\nThe factors of N are the factors of M multiplied by 2\u00b2*5\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, to have N divisible by 2\u00b9, that's already covered by the 2\u00b2. \n\nTo be divisible by 3\u00b2, M must be divisible by 3\u00b2 (since the 2\u00b2 and 5\u00b2 don't contribute to 3). \n\nWait, so M must be divisible by 9 (3\u00b2). \n\nAdditionally, since M is composed of 0s and 1s, we need to find the smallest M (in terms of digits) made of 0s and 1s divisible by 9. Then, N = M00 will be the required number. \n\nAh! This is a key insight. \n\nSo instead of thinking of the entire number, we can separate M as the number before the trailing zeros. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest M (composed of 1s and 0s, no trailing zeros) divisible by 9, and then appending two zeros. \n\nTherefore, the minimal N is the minimal such M followed by 00. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest M (in terms of digit length and numerical value) made of 1s and 0s divisible by 9. \n\nSince divisibility by 9 requires the digit sum to be a multiple of 9, the minimal digit sum is 9, so M must have a digit sum of 9, and be the smallest possible number with that property. \n\nTherefore, the minimal M is the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s (without trailing zeros) with digit sum 9. \n\nThe minimal such number is 111111111 (nine 1s). \n\nAlternatively, is there a smaller number (numerically) with digit sum 9?
