      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to compute the sum over all triples (a, b, c) of positive integers that can form a triangle, of the term 2^a divided by 3^b times 5^c. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, let me recall the triangle inequality. For a triple (a, b, c) to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, we have:\n\na + b > c,\n\na + c > b,\n\nb + c > a.\n\nSince a, b, c are positive integers, these inequalities must all hold. So, the problem is to sum 2^a/(3^b 5^c) over all such triples (a, b, c).\n\nHmm, this seems like an infinite series, but maybe there's a way to represent it using generating functions or some combinatorial approach. Let me think.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can consider the generating function for each side, but constrained by the triangle inequalities. However, the triangle inequalities complicate things because they introduce dependencies between a, b, and c. Maybe I can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider all triples (a, b, c) and subtract those that don't satisfy the triangle inequalities. Wait, but inclusion-exclusion might get complicated here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem by considering the generating function where each variable a, b, c can be any positive integer, but then subtract the cases where the triangle inequalities are violated. But that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions with constraints. Let me recall that for generating functions, sometimes we can model the problem by considering variables in terms of exponents. Since we have 2^a/(3^b 5^c), the generating function for each variable would be related to a geometric series with terms like 2^a x^a, but here the denominators complicate things.\n\nWait, actually, the term to sum is 2^a / (3^b 5^c) = (2/1)^a * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c. So, this is like a product of terms for each variable. So, perhaps the generating function is the product of three separate generating functions for a, b, c, but with the triangle inequalities constraints.\n\nBut the problem is the triangle inequalities couple the variables. So, maybe I need to find a way to express the sum over all triples (a,b,c) satisfying the triangle inequalities as a combination of generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can fix one variable as the largest, and then express the other two variables in terms of it. Let me think. Without loss of generality, let's suppose that c is the largest side. Then the triangle inequalities would require that a + b > c, and also since c is the largest, we have c < a + b, and c > a and c > b? Wait, no. The triangle inequalities are a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. If c is the largest, then the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied because c is already greater than or equal to a and b (if it's the largest). Wait, actually, if c is the largest, then the other inequalities become trivial. For example, a + c > b is true because c > b (since c is the largest), so a + c > b is definitely true. Similarly, b + c > a is also true. So the only non-trivial inequality is a + b > c. So, if I fix c as the largest, then the condition reduces to a + b > c, with a and b less than or equal to c. But actually, a and b can be up to c, but not necessarily. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all permutations. Since the triangle inequalities are symmetric, maybe I can compute the sum over all triples where a \u2264 b \u2264 c and then multiply by the appropriate symmetry factor. But maybe that complicates things more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can represent the problem as follows:\n\nThe sum over all triples (a, b, c) such that a, b, c are positive integers and a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. But since all three inequalities must hold, maybe we can use the fact that the three inequalities can be rewritten as each side being less than the sum of the other two. So, equivalently, the maximum of a, b, c must be less than the sum of the other two. So, perhaps we can split into cases where each of a, b, or c is the maximum, then use inclusion-exclusion? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem as a triple generating function where each variable a, b, c is at least 1, and then subtract the cases where the triangle inequalities are violated. Wait, perhaps that's an approach.\n\nLet me consider the total sum over all triples (a, b, c) of positive integers of 2^a/(3^b 5^c). Then subtract the sums where a + b \u2264 c, a + c \u2264 b, or b + c \u2264 a. But since these regions might overlap, inclusion-exclusion would be needed. But that could be complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nFirst, compute the total sum S = sum_{a=1 to \u221e} sum_{b=1 to \u221e} sum_{c=1 to \u221e} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c). Then, subtract the sums where a + b \u2264 c, a + c \u2264 b, and b + c \u2264 a, then add back in the overlaps, etc. But let's see if this is feasible.\n\nFirst, compute S:\n\nS = (sum_{a=1}^\u221e 2^a) * (sum_{b=1}^\u221e 1/3^b) * (sum_{c=1}^\u221e 1/5^c)\n\nEach of these is a geometric series.\n\nsum_{a=1}^\u221e 2^a is a geometric series with ratio 2, but wait, the common ratio here is 2, but the sum from a=1 to infinity of 2^a diverges. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, 2^a over 3^b 5^c, so actually the terms are (2/1)^a * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c. Wait, but 2^a is growing exponentially, so the total sum S would diverge. But the problem says \"the set of all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers for which there exist triangles with side lengths a, b, c\". So the original problem is summing over only those triples which form a triangle. But the problem is, when considering the total sum over all triples (without triangle inequalities), that sum would diverge, so perhaps the approach of inclusion-exclusion won't work because we can't compute divergent sums. Hmm, so maybe that approach isn't feasible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe instead of considering all triples and subtracting bad cases, we can directly model the triangle inequalities in the generating function.\n\nLet me think again. Let me consider that for a triple (a, b, c) to form a triangle, each side must be less than the sum of the other two. So, perhaps we can represent each variable in terms of the others. Let me consider ordering the variables. Suppose we fix an order where, say, c is the largest side. Then, as before, the key inequality is a + b > c, with a, b \u2264 c. But since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe I can compute the sum when c is the largest, multiply by 3 (for each permutation where each variable is the largest), and then subtract overlaps where two or more are equal? Hmm, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps compute the sum for c being the largest, then multiply by 3, then adjust for overcounting?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me first consider that in any triangle, the three sides must satisfy that each is less than the sum of the other two. So, perhaps we can model the generating function by considering variables a, b, c with a, b, c \u2265 1 and a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider all triples where a, b, c are positive integers and then subtract the triples where at least one of the triangle inequalities fails.\n\nBut again, dealing with divergent series complicates things. Wait, but perhaps the terms 2^a/(3^b 5^c) actually form a convergent series? Let me check.\n\nWait, the term 2^a is growing exponentially with a, but divided by 3^b and 5^c. Hmm, but if a, b, c can be any positive integers, then for example, if a increases, even if b and c are fixed, the term 2^a / (3^b 5^c) would go to infinity. Therefore, the total sum over all triples would diverge. But the problem restricts to triples that can form triangles, so maybe the sum over those triples converges?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose we have a triangle, so each side must be less than the sum of the other two. Therefore, for example, a < b + c, so a can be at most b + c - 1. Similarly, b < a + c, so b \u2264 a + c - 1, and c \u2264 a + b -1. So each variable is bounded by the sum of the other two minus 1. But even so, since a, b, c can each go to infinity, but with some constraints. Hmm, but maybe the terms decay sufficiently?\n\nWait, the term is 2^a / (3^b 5^c). Let's see: if a is large, but since a must be less than b + c, so if a is large, then b or c must also be large. But 2^a is growing exponentially, but divided by 3^b and 5^c. Hmm, so perhaps for a to be large, either b or c must be large enough so that 3^b or 5^c can counteract the 2^a term. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we fix a and let b and c vary such that a < b + c. Then, for each a, b can range from 1 to some upper limit depending on a and c, but this seems too vague. Maybe instead, think of the generating function approach where variables are constrained by triangle inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a triple generating function where each variable is at least 1, and the triangle inequalities are satisfied. Let me see if I can write the generating function as a product, but with constraints. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions for each variable with the constraints. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe need to compute the sum over all triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are positive integers and satisfy the triangle inequalities, of the term (2/1)^a * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c. Let me denote x = 2, y = 1/3, z = 1/5. Then the term is x^a y^b z^c.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute the triple sum over all (a, b, c) forming a triangle of x^a y^b z^c. Maybe there's a way to express this sum by considering the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the variables in terms of ordering. Let me suppose without loss of generality that a \u2264 b \u2264 c. Then the triangle inequality requires that a + b > c. Since c is the largest, this is the key inequality. Then, all triples can be generated by considering all ordered triples where a \u2264 b \u2264 c and a + b > c, and then accounting for permutations. However, since the original problem counts all triples (a, b, c) without ordering, perhaps it's better to consider unordered triples but with all permutations accounted for. Hmm, but the terms in the sum are not symmetric because the coefficients are different for a, b, c. The term is 2^a / (3^b 5^c), so each variable is weighted differently. Therefore, the order matters here. So, perhaps the variables a, b, c are distinguishable, so we can't assume any ordering. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the generating function as the sum over all triples (a, b, c) with a, b, c \u22651 and a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a of x^a y^b z^c, where x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5. So, maybe we can compute this generating function.\n\nLet me think of the generating function G(x, y, z) = sum_{a, b, c \u22651, a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a} x^a y^b z^c.\n\nWe need to compute G(2, 1/3, 1/5). Hmm, perhaps there is a known formula for such a generating function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rewrite the conditions. Let me note that the triangle inequalities can be rewritten as:\n\nEach side is less than the sum of the other two. So, for all variables, a < b + c, b < a + c, c < a + b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use inclusion-exclusion over the three inequalities.\n\nLet me consider the total generating function without any constraints, which is:\n\nTotal = (sum_{a=1}^\u221e x^a) * (sum_{b=1}^\u221e y^b) * (sum_{c=1}^\u221e z^c) = (x/(1 - x)) * (y/(1 - y)) * (z/(1 - z)), provided |x| < 1, |y| <1, |z| <1. Wait, but in our case, x = 2, which is greater than 1, so this would diverge. Hmm, so that approach isn't helpful here.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find another way. Let me consider that for the triangle inequalities, each of a, b, c must be less than the sum of the other two, so perhaps each variable is at most the sum of the other two minus 1. Maybe I can model this recursively?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables as a, b, c \u2265 1 and a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a. Let me see if there's a way to express this as a combination of regions where each variable is less than the sum of the other two. Since all three inequalities must hold, perhaps we can find a way to parameterize the variables such that they satisfy all three.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that the three inequalities can be rewritten as:\n\na + b > c,\n\na + c > b,\n\nb + c > a.\n\nThese can be rearranged as:\n\nc < a + b,\n\nb < a + c,\n\na < b + c.\n\nSo, each variable is less than the sum of the other two. Therefore, each variable is less than the sum of the other two, so in particular, all variables must be positive integers, so each variable must be at least 1, and also, for example, c must be less than a + b, but since c is a positive integer, c \u2264 a + b - 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's useful to think of variables in terms of two variables and then express the third variable in terms of them. Let me try to fix two variables and then sum over the third.\n\nSuppose we fix a and b, then c must satisfy |a - b| < c < a + b. Since c must be a positive integer, c can range from max(1, |a - b| + 1) to a + b - 1. But since a and b are at least 1, the lower bound is max(1, |a - b| + 1). However, since a and b are positive integers, |a - b| + 1 is at least 1, so c must be between 1 and a + b -1, but also greater than |a - b|. Wait, actually, the triangle inequality requires c > |a - b|. So c must be in (|a - b|, a + b). Since c must be an integer, c can take values from floor(|a - b|) + 1 up to a + b -1. Hmm, but since a and b are integers, |a - b| is an integer, so c must be from |a - b| +1 to a + b -1.\n\nTherefore, for fixed a and b, c can range from max(1, |a - b| +1) to a + b -1. But since a and b are at least 1, |a - b| could be 0 or more. Wait, if a = b, then |a - b| =0, so c must be from 1 to 2a -1. Wait, but c must be greater than 0, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all triples (a, b, c) can be expressed as the sum over a and b from 1 to infinity, and for each a and b, sum over c from max(1, |a - b| +1) to a + b -1, of 2^a/(3^b 5^c). Hmm, this seems manageable, but perhaps complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the variables a, b, c are symmetric in the triangle inequalities, but the coefficients are not symmetric (since 2^a is different from 1/3^b and 1/5^c), perhaps I can proceed by fixing two variables and expressing the third in terms of them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can split the problem into cases where a is the largest, b is the largest, or c is the largest, then compute each case separately and add them up. Since the problem is symmetric except for the coefficients, this might be necessary.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let's split into three cases:\n\nCase 1: c is the largest side (so c \u2265 a, c \u2265 b). Then the triangle inequality reduces to a + b > c.\n\nCase 2: b is the largest side (so b \u2265 a, b \u2265 c). Then the triangle inequality reduces to a + c > b.\n\nCase 3: a is the largest side (so a \u2265 b, a \u2265 c). Then the triangle inequality reduces to b + c > a.\n\nSince these cases are mutually exclusive (unless two sides are equal, but even then, they can be included in multiple cases, so need to be careful). Hmm, actually, if two sides are equal and the third is smaller, they could be part of two cases. For example, if a = b > c, then it's part of both Case 1 and Case 2. Therefore, inclusion-exclusion would be necessary here as well. This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of splitting into cases, proceed as follows:\n\nLet me consider that for any triple (a, b, c) forming a triangle, all three inequalities must hold. So, the sum can be written as:\n\nSum_{a, b, c \u22651} [indicator(a + b > c) * indicator(a + c > b) * indicator(b + c > a)] * (2^a)/(3^b 5^c).\n\nBut this is just rephrasing the problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to note that the triangle inequalities can be expressed as each variable being less than the sum of the other two, so each variable is bounded by the sum of the other two. Therefore, perhaps the generating function can be expressed as a product of three geometric series but with each term limited by the sum of the other two. Wait, I might need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions with variables a, b, c, and constraints. Let me try to write the generating function as follows:\n\nG = sum_{a, b, c >=1, a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a} (2^a)/(3^b 5^c).\n\nLet me make substitutions to simplify variables. Let me set variables x = 2, y = 1/3, z = 1/5. Then G = sum_{a,b,c} x^a y^b z^c with the triangle inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use generating functions in terms of each variable with the constraints. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nFor each a, b, c >=1, the conditions a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a can be rewritten as:\n\nc < a + b,\n\nb < a + c,\n\na < b + c.\n\nThese inequalities can be thought of as each variable being less than the sum of the other two. Therefore, each variable must be less than the sum of the other two. Therefore, each variable is bounded by the sum of the other two. So, perhaps, the generating function can be expressed as the product of three geometric series minus the parts where any of the inequalities fail. But again, inclusion-exclusion is needed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a clever way to express the generating function. Let me consider that if all three inequalities must hold, then equivalently, the variables must satisfy that each is less than the sum of the other two. Therefore, the generating function is the set of triples where each variable is less than the sum of the other two. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as follows: Let me note that for any three numbers a, b, c to form a triangle, they must satisfy that each is less than the sum of the other two, which is equivalent to the three inequalities. Therefore, the generating function can be considered as the set of triples where a, b, c are positive integers with each less than the sum of the other two. So, perhaps the generating function can be written as the product over each variable of their generating functions, but with the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that for each variable, the constraints are dependent on the other two variables, so it's hard to separate the variables. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem is similar to counting lattice points in a region defined by the triangle inequalities, but weighted by the term 2^a / (3^b 5^c). Since the weights are multiplicative, perhaps we can separate the variables in some way.\n\nWait, let me think of the term as 2^a * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c. So, if I can find a generating function for each variable with some constraints, maybe the total generating function would be a product of three generating functions each accounting for their own constraints. But the problem is the constraints are interdependent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions with variables a, b, c and the constraints.\n\nLet me consider that for each a, b, c, the conditions are a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.\n\nThese can be rewritten as:\n\nc < a + b,\n\nb < a + c,\n\na < b + c.\n\nAlternatively, rearranged as:\n\nc < a + b,\n\nc > |a - b|,\n\nSimilarly, the other inequalities give similar conditions. So, combining all three inequalities, the variables must satisfy that each is between the difference and the sum of the other two. Therefore, the region is the set of triples (a, b, c) such that for all permutations, |a - b| < c < a + b, and similarly for the other variables. Wait, but actually, since the inequalities are symmetric, maybe it's sufficient to express c between |a - b| and a + b, and similarly for the other variables. But this seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that for each pair of variables, the third must be less than their sum and greater than their difference. But since all three inequalities must hold, it's equivalent to the three conditions above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a generating function where each variable is at least 1, and for each pair, the third variable is bounded by their sum and difference. But this is still vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of generating functions with constraints on the variables. Let me think of the variables as a, b, c \u2265 1, and then the triangle inequalities are a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.\n\nLet me see if I can write this as a generating function by splitting into cases where one variable is the largest. Let's suppose that c is the largest, so c \u2265 a and c \u2265 b, then the key inequality is a + b > c. Then, the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied because c is at least as big as a and b, so a + c \u2265 a + b (if c \u2265 b) but actually, since c is the largest, a + c > b is true because a and c are both at least 1 and c \u2265 b. Similarly for b + c > a. Therefore, if c is the largest, then the only non-trivial condition is a + b > c. Similarly, if a is the largest, then the key inequality is b + c > a, etc.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can compute the sum by considering three cases where each variable is the largest, compute each case's contribution, then add them up. Since the problem is symmetric except for the coefficients, the three cases will have different expressions but similar structures.\n\nLet me proceed with this approach.\n\nCase 1: c is the largest side, so c \u2265 a and c \u2265 b, and a + b > c.\n\nCase 2: b is the largest side, so b \u2265 a and b \u2265 c, and a + c > b.\n\nCase 3: a is the largest side, so a \u2265 b and a \u2265 c, and b + c > a.\n\nAdditionally, there might be cases where two sides are equal to the largest. But since the inequalities are strict, even if two sides are equal to the third, as long as the inequalities hold, they are counted. However, since we are dealing with integers, if two sides are equal to the third, then the triangle inequality would require that the third is less than the sum, so for example, if a = b = c, then a + b > c becomes 2a > a, which is true. So, equilateral triangles are allowed.\n\nNow, let me compute each case separately.\n\nStarting with Case 1: c is the largest, so c \u2265 a, c \u2265 b, and a + b > c.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nSum over a, b, c such that 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 c, and a + b > c, of 2^a / (3^b 5^c).\n\nSimilarly, Case 2 would involve b being the largest, so:\n\nSum over a, c, b such that 1 \u2264 a, c \u2264 b, and a + c > b, of 2^a / (3^b 5^c).\n\nAnd Case 3 would be:\n\nSum over b, c, a such that 1 \u2264 b, c \u2264 a, and b + c > a, of 2^a / (3^b 5^c).\n\nHowever, since the variables a, b, c are ordered differently in each case, we can compute each case separately and then add them up.\n\nLet me compute Case 1 first.\n\nCase 1: c is the largest, so c \u2265 a and c \u2265 b, and a + b > c.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are:\n\n1 \u2264 a \u2264 c,\n\n1 \u2264 b \u2264 c,\n\nand a + b > c.\n\nSo, for each c from 1 to infinity, and for each a from 1 to c, and for each b from max(1, c - a + 1) to c, since a + b > c implies b > c - a. Since b must be an integer \u22651, so b \u2265 (c - a) +1. But since b also must be \u2264 c, the range for b is from max(1, c - a +1) to c.\n\nHowever, since a can be as small as 1, if a=1, then b must be > c -1, so b \u2265 c (since c -1 +1 = c). But since b \u2264 c, then b = c. But then a + b = 1 + c, which is greater than c, so that's okay. Wait, but if a=1 and c is fixed, then b must be at least c - a +1 = c -1 +1 = c, so b = c. So for a=1, b can only be c.\n\nSimilarly, for a=2, b must be at least c -1, so b can be from c -1 to c, but b must also be \u22651. So as long as c - a +1 \u2264 c, which it is.\n\nTherefore, the sum over a and b for each c is:\n\nFor each c \u22651,\n\nSum_{a=1}^c [ Sum_{b = max(1, c - a +1)}^c (2^a)/(3^b 5^c) ) ]\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me swap the order of summation. Let me first fix c, then a, then b.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the inner sum over b first for fixed a and c.\n\nFor fixed a and c, the lower bound of b is max(1, c - a +1). Let me denote lower_b = max(1, c - a +1). The upper bound is c. So the inner sum over b is Sum_{b = lower_b}^c (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c * 2^a.\n\nWait, actually, the term is 2^a/(3^b 5^c) = 2^a * (1/3)^b * (1/5)^c. So, for fixed a and c, the inner sum over b is:\n\n2^a * (1/5)^c * Sum_{b = lower_b}^c (1/3)^b.\n\nThe sum of (1/3)^b from b = lower_b to c is a geometric series. The sum from b = n to m of r^b is r^n (1 - r^{m - n +1}) / (1 - r).\n\nSo here, r = 1/3, so the sum is ( (1/3)^{lower_b} - (1/3)^{c +1} ) / (1 - 1/3) ) = ( (1/3)^{lower_b} - (1/3)^{c +1} ) / (2/3) ) = (3/2)[ (1/3)^{lower_b} - (1/3)^{c +1} ]\n\nTherefore, the inner sum becomes:\n\n2^a * (1/5)^c * (3/2)[ (1/3)^{lower_b} - (1/3)^{c +1} ]\n\n= 2^{a -1} * (1/5)^c [ (1/3)^{lower_b -1} - (1/3)^c ]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider that lower_b is max(1, c - a +1). Let me split into cases where c - a +1 \u22641 or not.\n\nCase 1a: c - a +1 \u22641 \u21d2 c -a \u22640 \u21d2 a \u2265 c.\n\nBut since a \u2264 c (because c is the largest), this would mean a = c. So when a = c, then lower_b = max(1, c - c +1)=1. Therefore, for a = c, the lower_b is 1, so the sum over b is from 1 to c.\n\nCase1b: c - a +1 >1 \u21d2 a < c. Then lower_b = c -a +1.\n\nTherefore, the inner sum over b can be written as:\n\nIf a = c: sum_{b=1}^c (1/3)^b\n\nElse (a < c): sum_{b = c -a +1}^c (1/3)^b\n\nTherefore, the total sum for Case1 can be written as:\n\nSum_{c=1}^\u221e [ Sum_{a=1}^c [ 2^a * (1/5)^c * ( Sum_{b=lower_b}^c (1/3)^b ) ) ] ]\n\nBreaking into a = c and a < c:\n\n= Sum_{c=1}^\u221e [ (term when a = c) + Sum_{a=1}^{c-1} (term when a < c) ]\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, the term when a = c:\n\nFor a = c, the inner sum over b is Sum_{b=1}^c (1/3)^b.\n\nThis is a geometric series from 1 to c:\n\nSum_{b=1}^c (1/3)^b = (1/3)(1 - (1/3)^c)/(1 - 1/3) ) = (1/3)/(2/3) (1 - (1/3)^c) ) = (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c )\n\nTherefore, the term for a = c is:\n\n2^c * (1/5)^c * (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c )\n\n= (2^c / 5^c) * (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c )\n\n= ( (2/5)^c ) * (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c )\n\nNow, the term when a < c (i.e., a from 1 to c-1):\n\nFor each a from 1 to c-1, the inner sum over b is from b = c - a +1 to c of (1/3)^b.\n\nThis sum is equal to Sum_{b = c -a +1}^c (1/3)^b = (1/3)^{c -a +1} * [1 - (1/3)^a ] / (1 - 1/3) )\n\nWait, let me check. Let me denote n = c - a +1, then the sum from n to c is (1/3)^n + (1/3)^{n+1} + ... + (1/3)^c.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term (1/3)^n, ratio 1/3, and number of terms = c - n +1 = a.\n\nWait, c - (c - a +1) +1 = a. So, the number of terms is a.\n\nThus, the sum is (1/3)^n * (1 - (1/3)^a ) / (1 - 1/3) )\n\n= (1/3)^{c - a +1} * (1 - (1/3)^a ) / (2/3) )\n\n= (3/2)(1/3)^{c - a +1} (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nThus, the inner sum over b is (3/2)(1/3)^{c -a +1} (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nTherefore, the term for a < c is:\n\n2^a * (1/5)^c * (3/2)(1/3)^{c -a +1} (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nSimplify this term:\n\nFirst, 2^a * (3/2) * (1/3)^{c -a +1} = 2^{a} * 3^{- (c -a +1)} * 3/2\n\n= 2^{a -1} * 3^{ - (c -a +1) +1 }\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\n(3/2) * 2^a * (1/3)^{c -a +1} = (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{ - (c - a +1) }\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{-c +a -1}\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{a -1} * 3^{-c}\n\n= (3/2) * (2^a * 3^{a -1}) * 3^{-c}\n\n= (3/2) * (2*3)^{a} * 3^{-1} * 3^{-c}\n\nWait, perhaps better to write as:\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{-c +a -1}\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{a -1} * 3^{-c}\n\n= (3^{a} / (2 * 3^{c - a +1} )) * 2^a ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me write exponents:\n\nThe term is (3/2) * 2^a * (1/3)^{c - a +1} * (1 - (1/3)^a) * (1/5)^c\n\nWait, actually, I need to also multiply by (1 - (1/3)^a) and (1/5)^c.\n\nWait, sorry, the entire term is:\n\n2^a * (1/5)^c * [ (3/2) * (1/3)^{c -a +1} (1 - (1/3)^a ) ]\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\n= 2^a * (1/5)^c * (3/2) * (1/3)^{c -a +1} * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * (1/3)^{c -a +1} * (1/5)^c * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nLet me rewrite exponents:\n\n(1/3)^{c -a +1} = 3^{- (c - a +1)} = 3^{-c + a -1}\n\nThus,\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{-c +a -1} * (1/5)^c * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\n= (3/2) * 2^a * 3^{a -1} * 3^{-c} * 5^{-c} * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\n= (3^{a} / (2 * 3^{1})) * 2^a * 3^{-c} 5^{-c} * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nWait, 3^{a -1} is 3^a /3, so 3/2 * 3^{a -1} = 3/2 * 3^a /3 = 3^a / 2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (3^a / 2) * 2^a * 3^{-c} 5^{-c} * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\n= ( (3*2)^a / 2 ) * ( (1/(3*5))^c ) * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3*2)^a is 6^a, so:\n\n= (6^a / 2 ) * (1/15)^c * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nTherefore, the term for a < c is:\n\n(6^a / 2) * (1/15)^c * (1 - (1/3)^a )\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the total contribution for Case1 is:\n\nSum_{c=1}^\u221e [ Term_{a=c} + Sum_{a=1}^{c-1} Term_{a < c} ]\n\n= Sum_{c=1}^\u221e [ ( (2/5)^c / 2 )(1 - (1/3)^c ) + Sum_{a=1}^{c -1} (6^a / 2)(1/15)^c (1 - (1/3)^a ) ]\n\nHmm, this seems quite involved. Let me see if I can separate the terms.\n\nFirst, let me handle the first part: the a = c term.\n\nSum_{c=1}^\u221e [ ( (2/5)^c / 2 )(1 - (1/3)^c ) ]\n\n= (1/2) Sum_{c=1}^\u221e ( (2/5)^c - (2/5)^c (1/3)^c )\n\n= (1/2) [ Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (2/5)^c - Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (2/(5*3))^c ]\n\n= (1/2) [ ( (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) ) - ( (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) ) ]\n\nCompute each geometric series:\n\nFirst term: (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) = (2/5)/(3/5) = 2/3\n\nSecond term: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) = (2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13\n\nThus, first part becomes:\n\n(1/2)( 2/3 - 2/13 ) = (1/2)( (26 - 6)/39 ) = (1/2)(20/39) = 10/39\n\nOkay, so that's the contribution from the a = c terms.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: the sum over a < c terms.\n\nSum_{c=1}^\u221e Sum_{a=1}^{c -1} [ (6^a / 2)(1/15)^c (1 - (1/3)^a ) ]\n\nLet me swap the order of summation. Let me consider a from 1 to infinity, and for each a, c from a +1 to infinity (since c must be at least a+1 when a < c). Wait, actually, when a is fixed, c can be from a+1 to infinity (since c must be greater than a to have a < c).\n\nWait, actually, for a fixed a, c can be from (a +1) to infinity, since c must be greater than a (since a < c). Wait, but in the original expression, for each c, a goes up to c -1. So swapping the order:\n\nSum_{a=1}^\u221e Sum_{c = a +1}^\u221e [ (6^a / 2)(1/15)^c (1 - (1/3)^a ) ]\n\nTherefore, the term can be written as:\n\n(1/2) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e [6^a (1 - (1/3)^a) Sum_{c = a +1}^\u221e (1/15)^c ]\n\nCompute the inner sum over c:\n\nSum_{c = a +1}^\u221e (1/15)^c = (1/15)^{a +1} / (1 - 1/15) ) = (1/15)^{a +1} / (14/15) ) = (1/15)^{a} * (1/15) / (14/15) ) = (1/15)^a * 1/(14)\n\nThus, substituting back:\n\n(1/2) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e [6^a (1 - (1/3)^a) * (1/15)^a * 1/14 ]\n\n= (1/(2*14)) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e [6^a (1 - (1/3)^a) (1/15)^a ]\n\n= (1/28) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e [ (6/15)^a (1 - (1/3)^a ) ]\n\n= (1/28) [ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e ( (6/15)^a ) - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e ( (6/15)^a (1/3)^a ) ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nFirst term inside: (6/15)^a = (2/5)^a.\n\nSecond term: (6/15 * 1/3)^a = (6/(15*3))^a = (6/45)^a = (2/15)^a.\n\nTherefore:\n\n= (1/28)[ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/15)^a ]\n\nCompute each geometric series:\n\nFirst sum: (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) = (2/5)/(3/5) = 2/3.\n\nSecond sum: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) = (2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13.\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/28)[ 2/3 - 2/13 ] = (1/28)( (26 - 6)/39 ) = (1/28)(20/39) = (20)/(28*39) = (10)/(14*39) = 10/(546) = 5/273.\n\nTherefore, the second part contributes 5/273.\n\nTherefore, the total contribution from Case1 is 10/39 + 5/273.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n39 and 273. 273 = 39*7, so common denominator is 273.\n\n10/39 = 70/273,\n\n5/273 = 5/273,\n\nTotal: 75/273 = 25/91.\n\nHmm, 70 +5 is 75, which reduces to 25/91 (divided numerator and denominator by 3).\n\nSo, Case1 contributes 25/91.\n\nNow, proceeding to compute Case2 and Case3. Since the problem is symmetric except for the coefficients, let me see how the cases might differ.\n\nCase2: b is the largest side, so b \u2265 a, b \u2265 c, and a + c > b.\n\nSimilarly to Case1, the sum would be:\n\nSum_{b=1}^\u221e [ Sum_{a=1}^b Sum_{c=1}^b (indicator(a + c > b) * 2^a / (3^b 5^c) ) ]\n\nFollowing similar steps as Case1, but with variables permuted. Let me see:\n\nIn Case2, the largest side is b, so the constraints are a \u2264 b, c \u2264 b, and a + c > b.\n\nSimilarly, for each b, the variables a and c go from 1 to b, but with a + c > b.\n\nFollowing the same approach as in Case1, the sum would be similar but with variables swapped. Let me see:\n\nThe term to compute would be similar but with the roles of variables:\n\nInstead of 2^a/(3^b 5^c), since in Case2 the largest is b, so the variables a and c are summed over with constraints a + c > b, and terms are 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nFollowing the same steps as in Case1, but with b as the largest variable.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the problem is symmetric in a, b, c except for the coefficients. Since in Case1, the coefficient for c was 1/5^c, and in Case2, since b is the largest, the coefficient for b is 1/3^b, but the variables a and c have coefficients 2^a and 1/5^c respectively.\n\nTherefore, the computation would not be the same as Case1, but the structure is similar. However, this might take a lot of time. Maybe there is a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three cases can be computed similarly, and due to the symmetry, they might have the same form but with variables permuted. However, since the coefficients (2, 1/3, 1/5) are different, each case will have a different result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a generating function approach where we can compute the total sum over all three cases by symmetry, but given the coefficients are different, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total sum is the sum of the three cases, each computed similarly to Case1 but with variables permuted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noticing that the three cases (a largest, b largest, c largest) are mutually exclusive except for when two sides are equal. But given that the variables are integers, even with two sides equal, they would fall into two cases. However, the problem requires inclusion-exclusion, which complicates things. Maybe instead, since the triangle inequalities are symmetric, perhaps the total sum can be expressed as 3 * Case1 - ... but I might need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the total sum over all triangles is equal to the sum over all triples (a, b, c) with a, b, c \u22651 and a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a of 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of splitting into cases, we can use generating functions with constraints.\n\nWait, let me think again of the generating function approach. Let me denote variables x, y, z for a, b, c respectively. Then the generating function is:\n\nG(x, y, z) = sum_{a,b,c \u22651, a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a} x^a y^b z^c.\n\nWe need to compute G(2, 1/3, 1/5).\n\nPerhaps there's a known formula for this generating function. Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as follows:\n\nNote that the conditions a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a are equivalent to |a - b| < c < a + b, and similarly for the other variables. Therefore, for each pair of variables, the third is between their difference and sum. But since all three must hold, perhaps the generating function can be written as the product of three geometric series minus the parts where any inequality fails.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the generating function is equal to the generating function for all triples (a, b, c) minus the generating functions where a + b \u2264 c, a + c \u2264 b, or b + c \u2264 a, plus the overlaps, etc. But since the total generating function diverges, this might not help.\n\nWait, but maybe if we consider the generating function as a formal power series, even if divergent, but with the constraints, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the generating function as follows:\n\nEach of the inequalities must hold, so each variable must be less than the sum of the other two. So, for each variable:\n\na < b + c,\n\nb < a + c,\n\nc < a + b.\n\nTherefore, each variable is bounded by the sum of the other two. This is similar to the conditions for forming a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the following approach inspired by generating functions for triangles:\n\nLet me consider that for each variable, the constraints are a < b + c, etc. So, for example, the generating function for a given a can be expressed in terms of the possible b and c that satisfy the inequalities. But this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use generating functions for each variable with the constraints. Let me think of the generating function as:\n\nG(x, y, z) = sum_{a, b, c \u22651} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{a + b \u2264 c} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{a + c \u2264 b} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{b + c \u2264 a} x^a y^b z^c + ... (inclusion-exclusion terms).\n\nHowever, since the first term diverges, this approach is not helpful unless we can compute the divergent terms in a way that cancels out. But since the problem restricts to triangle triples, perhaps the divergences cancel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the sum converges. Let me check with the terms.\n\nGiven that the term is 2^a/(3^b 5^c). The exponents for a are growing as 2^a, but divided by 3^b and 5^c. However, since in a triangle, a must be less than b + c. So for a to be large, either b or c must also be large. Let me see for example:\n\nSuppose a is very large, so then b + c must be greater than a. Therefore, either b or c must be at least a/2. Therefore, the term 2^a / (3^b 5^c) would have denominator terms with at least 3^{a/2} or 5^{a/2}, so the term would be roughly 2^a / (3^{a/2}) ) = (2^2 / 3)^{a/2} which is (4/3)^{a/2}, which still grows exponentially, albeit slower. Hmm, so maybe the terms still diverge? Wait, but 4/3 >1, so (4/3)^{a/2} tends to infinity. Therefore, the terms might still diverge. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier assumption. Let me check with specific values. Let me see for a triple where a = b + c -1, which is the minimal a to satisfy a + b > c (since a = b + c -1 gives a + b = 2b + c -1, which is greater than c? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms decay sufficiently for the sum to converge. Let me consider the terms where a, b, c form a triangle. Let me see, for example, fix a and b, then c can be up to a + b -1. The term for c is 1/5^c, so for fixed a and b, the sum over c would be up to a + b -1. The sum over c would be a geometric series up to a + b -1 terms, which would be O( (1/5)^{c} ) summed up to c ~ a + b. So the contribution from c would be O( (1/5)^{a + b} ), but multiplied by 2^a /3^b. So the total term would be 2^a/(3^b 5^{a + b}) ) = (2/ (3*5))^a * (1/ (3*5))^b. Which is (2/15)^a (1/15)^b. Hmm, so that would be a convergent double geometric series, since 2/15 and 1/15 are less than 1.\n\nWait, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we fix a and b, then c must be between |a - b| +1 and a + b -1. The term for each c is 1/5^c. So the sum over c would be Sum_{c= max(1, |a - b| +1)}^{a + b -1} 1/5^c.\n\nThis is a finite sum, so for each a and b, the contribution to the total sum is (2^a / 3^b) * [Sum_{c= ... } 1/5^c].\n\nTherefore, the total sum would be Sum_{a,b \u22651} [2^a / 3^b * (Sum_{c= ... } 1/5^c) ].\n\nSince each inner sum is finite, and the terms 2^a /3^b are multiplied by something that's O(1/5^{c}), which for c at least linear in a or b, the terms might decay sufficiently.\n\nWait, let me think of the maximum possible value of c given a and b, which is a + b -1. So the inner sum over c is up to a + b -1. The sum would be at most Sum_{c=1}^{a + b} (1/5)^c, which is less than Sum_{c=1}^\\infty (1/5)^c = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, each term is bounded by 2^a/(3^b) * 1/4.\n\nThus, the total sum is bounded by (1/4) Sum_{a,b \u22651} (2/3)^a (1/3)^{b - a} )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the total sum would be Sum_{a,b \u22651} (2^a /3^b) * (something less than 1/4). So since Sum_{a,b} 2^a /3^b converges?\n\nWait, Sum_{a=1}^\\infty 2^a /3^b summed over b would be problematic. Wait no, for each a and b, it's 2^a /3^b, so the total over a and b is Sum_{a=1}^\\infty (2/3)^a Sum_{b=1}^\\infty (1/3)^b. The first sum is (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) = 2, and the second sum is (1/3)/(1 - 1/3) = 1/2. So total would be 2*(1/2)=1. But multiplied by the inner sum which is less than 1/4, so total sum would be less than 1/4. Hmm, but that might not be exact, but shows that it could converge.\n\nTherefore, maybe the sum is convergent, and the earlier approach with Case1 giving 25/91 is a part of the total sum, but need to compute the other cases.\n\nProceeding, let me try to compute Case2 similarly.\n\nCase2: b is the largest side. So b \u2265 a, b \u2265 c, and a + c > b.\n\nTherefore, the sum is over a, c from 1 to b, with a + c > b.\n\nSimilarly to Case1, we can write this as:\n\nSum_{b=1}^\u221e [ Sum_{a=1}^b Sum_{c=1}^b (indicator(a + c > b) * 2^a / (3^b 5^c) ) ]\n\nFollowing the same steps as Case1, let me see:\n\nFor fixed b, a and c go from 1 to b, with a + c > b.\n\nSimilarly to Case1, for fixed b, a can go from 1 to b, and for each a, c must be from max(1, b - a +1) to b.\n\nWait, the condition a + c > b implies c > b - a \u21d2 c \u2265 b - a +1.\n\nTherefore, the inner sum over c is Sum_{c= max(1, b - a +1)}^b (1/5)^c.\n\nSimilarly, this is analogous to Case1 with variables swapped: here, the largest variable is b, so the roles of a and c are similar to a and b in Case1.\n\nFollowing the same steps as in Case1, we can compute this sum.\n\nLet me denote variables here as follows:\n\nThe term is 2^a / (3^b 5^c), with constraints a \u2264 b, c \u2264 b, and a + c > b.\n\nFollowing the same approach:\n\nFor each b, the total contribution is:\n\nSum_{a=1}^b [ 2^a /3^b Sum_{c= max(1, b -a +1)}^b (1/5)^c ]\n\nLet me split into a = b and a < b.\n\nCase2a: a = b. Then c must satisfy 1 \u2264 c \u2264 b and a + c > b \u21d2 b + c > b \u21d2 c >0, which is always true. So c ranges from 1 to b.\n\nThus, the inner sum over c is Sum_{c=1}^b (1/5)^c.\n\nThis is similar to the a = c case in Case1.\n\nTherefore, the term when a = b is:\n\n2^b /3^b * Sum_{c=1}^b (1/5)^c.\n\nSum_{c=1}^b (1/5)^c = (1/5)(1 - (1/5)^b)/(1 - 1/5) ) = (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^b).\n\nThus, the term is:\n\n2^b /3^b * (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^b ) = ( (2/3)^b ) * (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^b )\n\nThe sum over b of this term is:\n\n(1/4) Sum_{b=1}^\u221e ( (2/3)^b - (2/3)^b (1/5)^b ) = (1/4)[ Sum_{b=1}^\u221e (2/3)^b - Sum_{b=1}^\u221e (2/(15))^b ]\n\nCompute each sum:\n\nFirst sum: (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) = 2.\n\nSecond sum: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) = (2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13.\n\nThus, this part becomes:\n\n(1/4)(2 - 2/13 ) = (1/4)(24/13) = 6/13.\n\nCase2b: a < b.\n\nThen, for each a from 1 to b -1, c must be from max(1, b -a +1) to b.\n\nSimilarly to Case1, the inner sum over c is Sum_{c = (b -a +1)}^b (1/5)^c.\n\nThe sum is (1/5)^{b - a +1} [1 - (1/5)^a]/(1 - 1/5).\n\nWait, similar to earlier steps:\n\nSum_{c = n}^b (1/5)^c where n = b -a +1.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term (1/5)^n, ratio 1/5, number of terms = a.\n\nThus, Sum_{c = n}^b (1/5)^c = (1/5)^n * (1 - (1/5)^a)/(1 - 1/5) = ( (1/5)^{b -a +1} ) * (1 - (1/5)^a ) / (4/5) )\n\n= (5/4) (1/5)^{b -a +1} (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\nTherefore, the term for a < b is:\n\n2^a /3^b * (5/4) (1/5)^{b -a +1} (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (5/4) * 2^a /3^b * (1/5)^{b -a +1} (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= (5/4) * 2^a * (1/5)^{b -a +1} /3^b * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= (5/4) * 2^a * (1/5)^{b} *5^{a -1} /3^b * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n(1/5)^{b -a +1} = (1/5)^{b} *5^{a -1}\n\nSo,\n\n= (5/4) * 2^a *5^{a -1}/5^b *1/3^b * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= (5^{a}/(4*5^b)) * (2^a) * (1/3^b) * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= ( (2*5)^a / (4*5^b*3^b) ) * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= (10^a / (4*(15)^b) ) * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\nTherefore, the term for a < b is:\n\n(10^a / (4*15^b)) * (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\nTherefore, the total contribution from a < b is:\n\nSum_{b=1}^\u221e Sum_{a=1}^{b-1} [ 10^a/(4*15^b) (1 - (1/5)^a) ]\n\nSwap the order of summation:\n\nSum_{a=1}^\u221e Sum_{b = a+1}^\u221e [10^a/(4*15^b) (1 - (1/5)^a) ]\n\n= (1/4) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e 10^a (1 - (1/5)^a) Sum_{b = a+1}^\u221e (1/15)^b\n\nCompute the inner sum over b:\n\nSum_{b = a+1}^\u221e (1/15)^b = (1/15)^{a+1} / (1 - 1/15) ) = (1/15)^{a} * (1/15) / (14/15) ) = (1/15)^a * 1/14\n\nTherefore, the total becomes:\n\n(1/4) * (1/14) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e 10^a (1 - (1/5)^a) (1/15)^a\n\n= (1/(56)) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e [ (10/15)^a (1 - (1/5)^a) ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n10/15 = 2/3,\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/56)[ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/3)^a - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/3 * 1/5)^a ]\n\nWait, no, the second term is (2/3)^a multiplied by (1 - (1/5)^a) = (2/3)^a - (2/3)^a (1/5)^a.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nThe expression inside is (2/3)^a (1 - (1/5)^a) = (2/3)^a - (2/3)^a (1/5)^a = (2/3)^a - (2/15)^a.\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/56)[ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/3)^a - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/15)^a ]\n\nCompute the sums:\n\nFirst sum: (2/3)/(1 - 2/3) = 2.\n\nSecond sum: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) = (2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13.\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/56)(2 - 2/13) = (1/56)(24/13) = 24/(56*13) = 6/(14*13) = 6/182 = 3/91.\n\nTherefore, the contribution from a < b in Case2 is 3/91.\n\nTherefore, the total contribution from Case2 is 6/13 + 3/91.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n6/13 = 42/91,\n\n3/91 = 3/91,\n\nTotal: 45/91.\n\nHmm, that's 45/91.\n\nNow, moving to Case3: a is the largest side, so a \u2265 b, a \u2265 c, and b + c > a.\n\nFollowing similar steps as Cases1 and 2.\n\nCase3: a \u2265 b, a \u2265 c, and b + c > a.\n\nThe sum is over b and c from 1 to a, with b + c > a.\n\nFollowing the same approach:\n\nFor each a, the sum is Sum_{b=1}^a Sum_{c=1}^a [indicator(b + c > a) * 2^a / (3^b 5^c) ]\n\nFollowing similar steps as before:\n\nFirst, split into cases where b = a and b < a, but actually, since a is the largest, and b and c are up to a.\n\nWait, but variables are b and c, so for each a:\n\nThe constraints are b \u2264 a, c \u2264 a, and b + c > a.\n\nLet me first compute the contribution when either b = a or c = a.

Let me see:\n\n7 divided by 13 is equal to (7*7)/(13*7)=49/91. Yes, so 7/13 = 49/91.\n\nTherefore total sum is 25 +45 +49 all over 91:\n\n25 + 45 =70, +49=119.\n\nThus, 119/91 = 17/13. Wait, 119 divided by 91: 91*1=91, 119-91=28, so 1 and 28/91 = 1 + 4/13 = 17/13? Wait, 28/91 is 4/13, so total is 1 +4/13=17/13. But 119/91 simplifies to 17/13 (divided numerator and denominator by 7: 119/91 = 17/13).\n\nWait, but 25 +45 +49 = 119? Let me check:\n\n25 +45 is 70, plus 49 is indeed 119. And 119 divided by 91 is 17/13.\n\nWait, but 91*1.7 = 91 + 63.7 = 154.7, but 17/13 is approximately 1.307.\n\nWait, 119 \u00f7 91: 91 \u00d71 =91, subtract 91 from 119:28. So 28/91 =4/13. So total is 1 +4/13 =17/13.\n\nYes, so the total sum over all three cases is 17/13.\n\nBut wait, the three cases are:\n\nCase1 (c largest): 25/91,\n\nCase2 (b largest): 45/91,\n\nCase3 (a largest): 49/91,\n\nTotal: 25 +45 +49 = 119/91 =17/13.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. When we considered the three cases where each variable is the largest, we assumed that each case is mutually exclusive. However, there are triples where two variables are equal and the third is smaller, which could fall into two cases. For example, if a = b and c < a, then this triple would satisfy both Case1 (if c is the largest?) No, if a = b and c is smaller, then the largest is a and b. So such triples would fall into Case3 (since a and b are the largest, but since a = b, then either Case2 or Case3 applies? Wait, if a = b are the largest, then since a and b are equal and both are largest, then both Case2 and Case3 would include this triple.\n\nAh, here's the problem! The cases where two variables are equal and the third is smaller would be counted in two cases. For example, if a = b and c < a, then this triple is counted both in Case2 (where b is the largest) and Case3 (where a is the largest). Similarly for other permutations. Therefore, the total sum as computed is overcounting those triples where two variables are equal and the third is smaller.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust for overcounting using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Since in our current calculation, we've counted such triples twice, so we need to subtract them once.\n\nSimilarly, triples where all three variables are equal (equilateral triangles) would be counted in all three cases, so they've been counted three times, so need to subtract 2 times their contribution.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n\nSum = Case1 + Case2 + Case3 - 2*(sum over triples where two variables are equal and third smaller) - 2*(sum over equilateral triples).\n\nWait, actually, inclusion-exclusion requires more careful handling.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet S be the total desired sum.\n\nLet A be the sum over triples where c is the largest (Case1),\n\nB be the sum over triples where b is the largest (Case2),\n\nC be the sum over triples where a is the largest (Case3).\n\nThen, by inclusion-exclusion:\n\nS = A + B + C - (sum over triples where two variables are largest) - 2*(sum over triples where all three are equal).\n\nWait, actually, the overlaps between the cases occur when two variables are equal and the third is smaller (so the two equal variables are the largest), or all three are equal.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For triples where exactly two variables are equal and the third is smaller: these are counted in two of the cases (e.g., a = b > c counted in B and C).\n\n- For triples where all three are equal: counted in all three cases.\n\nThus, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nS = A + B + C - (sum over triples with two variables equal and third smaller counted twice) - 2*(sum over equilateral triples).\n\nAlternatively, more precisely:\n\nThe overcount is the sum over all triples that are in two cases (i.e., have two largest variables equal) plus the triples in all three cases (equilateral).\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = A + B + C - (sum over triples with two variables equal and third smaller) - 2*(sum over equilateral triples).\n\nWait, actually, the formula would be:\n\nS = A + B + C - (sum over overlaps of two cases) + (sum over overlaps of all three cases).\n\nBut in standard inclusion-exclusion:\n\nIf the three sets are A, B, C,\n\nthen |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nBut in our case, the total desired set is exactly A \u222a B \u222a C, so S = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C).\n\nTherefore, need to compute the intersections.\n\nFirst, compute A \u2229 B: triples counted in both A and B, meaning that c is the largest (A) and b is the largest (B). So this requires that both b and c are the largest, i.e., b = c and they are both the largest. So, this is the set of triples where b = c \u2265 a, and the triangle inequalities hold.\n\nSimilarly, A \u2229 C is triples where c and a are the largest (i.e., a = c \u2265 b), and B \u2229 C is where a and b are the largest (a = b \u2265 c).\n\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C is triples where a = b = c, the equilateral triples.\n\nTherefore, the overlaps:\n\nA \u2229 B: triples with b = c \u2265 a, and triangle inequalities.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, compute A \u2229 B \u2229 C: equilateral triples where a = b = c. The sum over these is Sum_{k=1}^\u221e 2^k/(3^k 5^k) = Sum_{k=1}^\u221e (2/(3*5))^k = (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) = (2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13.\n\nNow compute A \u2229 B: triples where b = c \u2265 a, and a + b > c (since in A, c is the largest, so a + b > c = b \u21d2 a + b > b \u21d2 a >0, which is always true since a \u22651. Also, in B, b is the largest, so c = b \u2265 a and a + c > b \u21d2 a + b > b \u21d2 a >0. So the triangle inequalities reduce to a < 2b.\n\nBut since b = c and they are the largest, a must be \u2264 b.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b, and the triangle inequalities are automatically satisfied as above.\n\nThus, the sum over A \u2229 B is Sum_{b=1}^\u221e Sum_{a=1}^b 2^a/(3^b 5^b).\n\nBecause b = c, so c = b.\n\nThus, the term is 2^a/(3^b 5^b).\n\nTherefore,\n\nSum_{b=1}^\u221e [ (1/15)^b Sum_{a=1}^b 2^a ]\n\nThe inner sum over a is Sum_{a=1}^b 2^a = 2(2^b -1).\n\nWait, no: Sum_{a=1}^b 2^a = 2(2^b -1)/(2 -1) ) = 2^{b+1} -2.\n\nThus, the total sum is Sum_{b=1}^\u221e (2^{b+1} -2)/(15^b )\n\n= 2 Sum_{b=1}^\u221e (2^b)/(15^b ) - 2 Sum_{b=1}^\u221e 1/15^b\n\n= 2*( (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) ) - 2*( (1/15)/(1 - 1/15) )\n\nCompute first term:\n\n(2/15)/(13/15) = 2/13,\n\nso 2*(2/13) =4/13.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(1/15)/(14/15) =1/14,\n\nso 2*(1/14)=1/7.\n\nThus, total is 4/13 -1/7 = (28 -13)/91 =15/91.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 B =15/91.\n\nSimilarly, A \u2229 C would be triples where a = c \u2265 b.\n\nThe sum is Sum_{c=1}^\u221e Sum_{b=1}^c 2^c/(3^b 5^c).\n\nBecause a = c and they are the largest.\n\nThus, the term is 2^c/(3^b 5^c).\n\nThe sum becomes Sum_{c=1}^\u221e [ (2/5)^c Sum_{b=1}^c 1/3^b ]\n\nThe inner sum over b is Sum_{b=1}^c (1/3)^b = (1/3)(1 - (1/3)^c)/(1 -1/3) ) = (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c).\n\nThus, the total sum is Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (2/5)^c * (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^c )\n\n= (1/2) Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (2/5)^c - (1/2) Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (2/(15))^c\n\nFirst term: (2/5)/(1 - 2/5) = 2/3,\n\nSecond term: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15) =2/13.\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/2)(2/3 - 2/13) = (1/2)(24/39) = (12/39) =4/13.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n(2/3 - 2/13) = (26/39 -6/39)=20/39,\n\nthen multiplied by 1/2 gives 10/39 \u2248 0.256.\n\nWait, my mistake:\n\nWait, (2/3 - 2/13) = (26 - 6)/39 =20/39,\n\ntimes 1/2 is 10/39.\n\nThus, A \u2229 C =10/39.\n\nSimilarly, B \u2229 C is triples where a = b \u2265 c.\n\nThe sum is Sum_{a=1}^\u221e Sum_{c=1}^a 2^a/(3^a 5^c).\n\nBecause a = b and they are the largest.\n\nThe term is 2^a/(3^a) * Sum_{c=1}^a (1/5)^c.\n\nThe inner sum is Sum_{c=1}^a (1/5)^c = (1/4)(1 - (1/5)^a).\n\nThus, total sum is (1/4) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/3)^a (1 - (1/5)^a )\n\n= (1/4)[ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/3)^a - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/(15))^a ]\n\nFirst term: (2/3)/(1 - 2/3)=2,\n\nSecond term: (2/15)/(1 - 2/15)=2/13,\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/4)(2 -2/13)= (1/4)(24/13)=6/13.\n\nWait, that's 6/13.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n(2 - 2/13) = 24/13,\n\ntimes 1/4 is 6/13.\n\nTherefore, B \u2229 C =6/13.\n\nTherefore, the intersections:\n\nA \u2229 B =15/91,\n\nA \u2229 C=10/39 \u2248 10/(39)= approx 0.256,\n\nB \u2229 C=6/13,\n\nAnd A \u2229 B \u2229 C=2/13.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nS = A + B + C - (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C) + (A \u2229 B \u2229 C)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nA =25/91,\n\nB =45/91,\n\nC=49/91,\n\nA \u2229 B =15/91,\n\nA \u2229 C=10/39 = 70/273 \u2248 but let me convert to 91 denominator:\n\n10/39 = (10*7)/(39*7)=70/273 = 10/39,\n\nWait, maybe better to convert all terms to denominator 91.\n\nA \u2229 C =10/39 = (10*7)/(39*7)=70/273 = 10/39 \u2248 but 273=39*7, so 10/39 = 70/273, but 273 is 3*91. Hmm, perhaps better to convert to denominator 91*13=1183? This might get messy. Alternatively, compute fractions directly:\n\nA + B + C =25/91 +45/91 +49/91 = (25+45+49)/91=119/91.\n\nThen subtract (A \u2229 B + A \u2229 C + B \u2229 C):\n\nA \u2229 B =15/91,\n\nA \u2229 C=10/39,\n\nB \u2229 C=6/13,\n\nConvert all to 91 denominator:\n\n15/91 stays as is,\n\n10/39 = (10/39)*(91/91) \u2192 Hmm, better compute numerators over common denominators.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nA \u2229 B =15/91,\n\nA \u2229 C =10/39,\n\nB \u2229 C =6/13,\n\nTotal to subtract:15/91 +10/39 +6/13.\n\nConvert all to denominator 91*3*13? That's too big. Let me compute fractions step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 15/91 +10/39:\n\nThe common denominator is 9*91= 819? Wait, 91 and 39 have gcd 13:\n\n91=13*7,\n\n39=13*3,\n\nThus, common denominator is 13*3*7=273.\n\nSo:\n\n15/91 = (15*3)/273=45/273,\n\n10/39 = (10*7)/273=70/273,\n\nThus, sum is 45+70=115/273.\n\nThen add 6/13:\n\nConvert 6/13 to 273 denominator: 273=13*21,\n\nso 6/13 = 126/273.\n\nTotal subtraction: 115 +126=241/273.\n\nThus, the total subtraction is 241/273.\n\nNow, add back A \u2229 B \u2229 C =2/13 = (2*21)/273=42/273.\n\nTherefore, total S = (119/91) - (241/273) + (42/273).\n\nFirst, convert 119/91 to 273 denominator: 119/91 = (119*3)/273 =357/273.\n\nThus,\n\nS = 357/273 -241/273 +42/273 = (357 -241 +42)/273 = (357 -241 is 116; 116 +42=158)/273.\n\n158/273 simplifies: divide numerator and denominator by GCD(158,273). Let's see, 273 \u00f7158=1 R115; 158 \u00f7115=1 R43; 115 \u00f743=2 R29; 43 \u00f729=1 R14; 29 \u00f714=2 R1; 14 \u00f71=14 R0. So GCD is 1.\n\nThus, S=158/273.\n\nHmm, but this contradicts the earlier total of 17/13\u22481.307, while 158/273\u22480.579.\n\nWait, clearly there is a mistake here because the previous approach gave 17/13, but after inclusion-exclusion, it's 158/273\u22480.579 which is way lower. This suggests an error in the inclusion-exclusion steps.\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps:\n\nInitially, the three cases gave:\n\nA=25/91,\n\nB=45/91,\n\nC=49/91,\n\nTotal A+B+C=119/91\u22481.307.\n\nThen subtract overlaps:\n\nA\u2229B=15/91\u22480.165,\n\nA\u2229C=10/39\u22480.256,\n\nB\u2229C=6/13\u22480.461,\n\nTotal overlaps to subtract:0.165+0.256+0.461\u22480.882,\n\nThen add back A\u2229B\u2229C=2/13\u22480.153,\n\nThus total S\u22481.307 -0.882 +0.153\u22481.307-0.729\u22480.578, which matches the fraction 158/273\u22480.579.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial approach where we thought the cases were mutually exclusive, but clearly they are not, so the correct answer must be the inclusion-exclusion result. However, the problem arises from the initial computation of the cases.\n\nWait, but let me think: the three cases (each variable being the largest) are not mutually exclusive, so their sums include overlaps which must be subtracted. The inclusion-exclusion gives the correct total.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the initial computation of each case may have errors. Let me check the calculations for each case again.\n\nFirst, let me verify Case1: when c is the largest.\n\nEarlier, I calculated Case1 as 25/91.\n\nThe steps were:\n\nFor Case1:\n\nSum from a = c term: 10/39,\n\nSum from a < c term:5/273,\n\nTotal: 10/39 +5/273 = (70 +5)/273 =75/273=25/91. That seems correct.\n\nCase2: when b is the largest gave 45/91.\n\nCase2a (a = b):6/13,\n\nCase2b (a < b):3/91,\n\nWait, hold on, in the calculation for Case2:\n\nWait, no, in Case2:\n\nThe total was 6/13 +3/91,\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n6/13 =42/91,\n\n3/91 is 3/91,\n\nTotal is 45/91. That is correct.\n\nCase3: when a is the largest gave 7/13=49/91.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the initial cases are correct.\n\nNow, the overlaps:\n\nA \u2229 B: triples where b=c \u2265a,\n\nComputed as 15/91,\n\nA \u2229 C: triples where a =c \u2265b,\n\nComputed as 10/39,\n\nB \u2229 C: triples where a =b \u2265c,\n\nComputed as 6/13,\n\nAnd A\u2229B\u2229C: equilateral triples: 2/13.\n\nNow, when we did the inclusion-exclusion:\n\nS = A + B + C - (A\u2229B +A\u2229C + B\u2229C) + A\u2229B\u2229C\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nA+B+C = 25/91 +45/91 +49/91 = 119/91,\n\nA\u2229B +A\u2229C + B\u2229C =15/91 +10/39 +6/13,\n\nConvert all to denominator 273 (which is 91*3):\n\n15/91 = (15\u00d73)/273 =45/273,\n\n10/39 = (10\u00d77)/273 =70/273,\n\n6/13 = (6\u00d721)/273 =126/273,\n\nTotal overlaps:45+70+126=241/273,\n\nA\u2229B\u2229C=2/13= (2\u00d721)/273=42/273,\n\nThus,\n\nS = 119/91 - 241/273 +42/273,\n\nConvert 119/91 to 357/273,\n\nSo,\n\n357 -241 +42 = (357 -241)=116 +42=158,\n\nThus 158/273.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(158,273). Let me compute GCD(158,273):\n\n273 \u00f7158 =1 R115,\n\n158 \u00f7115=1 R43,\n\n115 \u00f743=2 R29,\n\n43 \u00f729=1 R14,\n\n29 \u00f714=2 R1,\n\n14 \u00f71=14 R0,\n\nThus GCD is 1. So 158/273 is reduced.\n\nWait, but 158 and 273:\n\n158 is even, 273 is odd. 2 doesn\u2019t divide 273.\n\n158/2=79, which is prime? 79 is prime.\n\n273 divided by79? 79\u00d73=237, 273-237=36, so no.\n\nThus, fraction is 158/273.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sum over all triples forming a triangle of 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nHmm, but according to the inclusion-exclusion, the answer is 158/273.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of overlaps.\n\nLet me recheck the A\u2229C computation.\n\nA \u2229 C is triples where a =c \u2265b,\n\nThe sum is Sum_{c=1}^\u221e Sum_{b=1}^c 2^c/(3^b 5^c).\n\nWait, in the computation above, I think I might have made an error.\n\nWait, A is the case where c is the largest. In A\u2229C, since C is the case where a is the largest, so a =c must be the largest. Thus, the constraints are a =c \u2265b, and the triangle inequalities must hold.\n\nThe term is 2^a/(3^b 5^c)=2^a/(3^b 5^a) since a =c.\n\nThus, the term is (2/5)^a /3^b.\n\nThe sum over b from1 to a.\n\nThus,\n\nSum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a Sum_{b=1}^a (1/3)^b.\n\nWait, the inner sum is Sum_{b=1}^a (1/3)^b = (1/3)(1 - (1/3)^a)/(1 -1/3)= (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^a).\n\nThus, the total sum is Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a * (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^a )\n\n= (1/2)[ Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a - Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/15)^a ]\n\nFirst sum: (2/5)/(1 - 2/5)= (2/5)/(3/5)= 2/3,\n\nSecond sum: (2/15)/(1 -2/15)=2/13,\n\nThus,\n\nTotal is (1/2)(2/3 -2/13)= (1/2)(24/39)=12/39=4/13\u22480.3077,\n\nBut earlier I had 10/39\u22480.256. So this contradicts my previous calculation.\n\nAh! Here is the mistake! I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nYes, in the previous calculation for A\u2229C, I incorrectly wrote the term as 2^a/(3^b 5^c) with a =c, so it's 2^a/(3^b 5^a), which is (2/5)^a /3^b.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I think I incorrectly used 2^c/(3^b 5^c) but forgot to account for a being equal to c, and also may have miscalculated the inner sum.\n\nWait, let me redo A\u2229C:\n\nA\u2229C is triples where a =c \u2265b,\n\nso the term is 2^a/(3^b 5^c) = 2^a/(3^b 5^a) = (2/5)^a / 3^b.\n\nThe sum is over a from1 to \u221e, and for each a, b from1 to a.\n\nThus,\n\nSum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a Sum_{b=1}^a (1/3)^b\n\n= Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a * [ (1/3)(1 - (1/3)^a)/(1 -1/3) ) ]\n\n= Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a * [ (1/2)(1 - (1/3)^a) ]\n\n= (1/2) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5)^a - (1/2) Sum_{a=1}^\u221e (2/5 *1/3)^a\n\n= (1/2)[ (2/5)/(1 -2/5) - (2/(15))/(1 - 2/15) ]\n\n= (1/2)[ (2/3) - (2/13) ]\n\n= (1/2)(26/39 -6/39)= (1/2)(20/39)=10/39\u22480.256.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the correct calculation I just did. Wait, no, 2/3 is (2/5)/(3/5)= 2/3,\n\nand 2/(15)/(13/15)=2/13.\n\nThus, 2/3 -2/13= (26-6)/39=20/39,\n\ntimes 1/2 gives 10/39. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, in my recheck I thought the answer should be 4/13, but that was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the correct calculation is 10/39.\n\nSo the previous calculation was correct. Thus, A \u2229 C =10/39\u22480.256,\n\nB \u2229 C=6/13\u22480.461,\n\nA \u2229 B=15/91\u22480.165,\n\nA\u2229B\u2229C=2/13\u22480.153.\n\nThus, the inclusion-exclusion gives:\n\nTotal S=119/91 - (15/91 +10/39 +6/13) +2/13.\n\nConverting all to denominator 273:\n\n119/91= 357/273,\n\n15/91=45/273,\n\n10/39=70/273,\n\n6/13=126/273,\n\n2/13=42/273,\n\nThus,\n\n357/273 - (45+70+126)/273 +42/273,\n\n=357 - (241) +42 all over 273,\n\n= (357-241)=116 +42=158,\n\nThus 158/273.\n\nHmm, so according to inclusion-exclusion, the correct answer is 158/273. But this fraction can be simplified?\n\nWait, 158 and 273:\n\n273 \u00f7 7 =39,\n\n158 \u00f77=22.57\u2026 no,\n\n158 \u00f72=79,\n\n273 \u00f72=136.5 no,\n\nSo it reduces to 158/273.\n\nBut let me check if this fraction can be simplified further.\n\n158 divided by 2 is 79, which is a prime number.\n\n273 divided by 79 is 3.455\u2026 Not integer.\n\nThus, it's 158/273.\n\nBut wait, the problem might expect a simpler form, so perhaps there is a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the sum directly.\n\nLet me think again of the original problem. The sum is over all triples (a, b, c) forming a triangle of 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a generating function approach where we can compute the sum directly without splitting into cases.\n\nLet me consider that the generating function G(x,y,z) is the sum over all a,b,c\u22651 with a + b >c, a + c >b, b + c >a of x^a y^b z^c.\n\nWe need to compute G(2, 1/3, 1/5).\n\nPerhaps there's a formula for G(x,y,z).\n\nAlternatively, note that the conditions a + b >c, etc., are equivalent to each variable being less than the sum of the other two. So the generating function can be written as:\n\nG(x,y,z) = sum_{a,b,c \u22651} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{a + b \u2264c} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{a + c \u2264b} x^a y^b z^c - sum_{b + c \u2264a} x^a y^b z^c + ... (inclusion-exclusion terms).\n\nBut since the first term is divergent, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following identity for generating functions of triangles:\n\nIn some references, the generating function for triangles is given by:\n\nG(x,y,z) = \\frac{xyz}{(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)} - \\frac{xyz(x + y + z)}{(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)(1 - xy - xz - yz)}}\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the problem in terms of the generating function for triangles.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the generating function for all triples (a,b,c) forming a triangle is equal to the generating function for all triples minus the generating functions for the cases where one side is too long.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet T be the set of triples forming a triangle,\n\nthen T = All triples - (A \u222a B \u222a C),\n\nwhere A is the set where a \u2265 b + c,\n\nB is where b \u2265 a + c,\n\nC is where c \u2265 a + b.\n\nThus,\n\nG(x,y,z) = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C) + (G_{A\u2229B} + G_{A\u2229C} + G_{B\u2229C}) ) - G_{A\u2229B\u2229C}.\n\nWhere G_total is the generating function for all triples,\n\nG_A is the generating function for triples where a \u2265 b + c,\n\nand similarly for others.\n\nThis is inclusion-exclusion.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nG_total = (x/(1 -x)) (y/(1 -y)) (z/(1 -z)),\n\nsince each variable starts at 1.\n\nG_A is the generating function where a \u2265 b + c,\n\nso a \u22651, b \u22651, c \u22651, and a \u2265 b + c.\n\nThus,\n\nG_A = Sum_{b,c \u22651} y^b z^c Sum_{a =b +c}^\u221e x^a\n\n= Sum_{b,c} y^b z^c * x^{b +c}/(1 -x),\n\nsince Sum_{a\u2265b+c} x^a = x^{b+c}/(1 -x).\n\nThus,\n\nG_A = (x/(1 -x)) Sum_{b,c \u22651} (xy)^b (xz)^c.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSum_{b,c \u22651} y^b z^c x^{b +c} = x^{b +c} y^b z^c = (xy)^b (xz)^c.\n\nThus,\n\nG_A = (x/(1 -x)) * [ Sum_{b=1}^\u221e (xy)^b ] [ Sum_{c=1}^\u221e (xz)^c ]\n\n= (x/(1 -x)) * [ (xy)/(1 - xy) ) * (xz)/(1 - xz) ) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\nG_A = (x/(1 -x)) * (xy/(1 - xy)) * (xz/(1 - xz)) )\n\n= x^3 y z / [ (1 -x)(1 -xy)(1 -xz) ]\n\nSimilarly, G_B and G_C can be computed by symmetry.\n\nG_B = y^3 x z / [ (1 -y)(1 -xy)(1 - yz) ]\n\nG_C = z^3 x y / [ (1 -z)(1 -xz)(1 - yz) ]\n\nNow, the intersections:\n\nG_{A\u2229B}: triples where a \u2265 b +c and b \u2265a +c. This would require a \u2265b +c and b \u2265a +c, implying a \u2265b +c and b \u2265a +c \u21d2 combining, a \u2265b +c and b \u2265a +c \u21d2 a \u2265b +c and b \u2265a +c \u21d2 adding both inequalities: a + b \u2265 a + b + 2c \u21d2 0 \u22652c, impossible since c \u22651. Thus, G_{A\u2229B}=0.\n\nSimilarly, all intersections of two of A,B,C are empty, since they require contradictory inequalities. Thus, G_{A\u2229B}=G_{A\u2229C}=G_{B\u2229C}=0.\n\nSimilarly, G_{A\u2229B\u2229C}=0.\n\nThus, inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies to:\n\nG = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C).\n\nThus,\n\nG(x,y,z)= \\frac{xyz}{(1 -x)(1 -y)(1 -z)} - [ \\frac{x^3 y z}{(1 -x)(1 -x y)(1 -x z)} + \\frac{y^3 x z}{(1 -y)(1 -x y)(1 -y z)} + \\frac{z^3 x y}{(1 -z)(1 -x z)(1 -y z)} ]\n\nTherefore, substituting x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the sum over triangles of 2^a/(3^b 5^c) = 2^a*(1/3)^b*(1/5)^c = x^a y^b z^c where x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5.\n\nThus, we need to compute G(2, 1/3, 1/5).\n\nFirst compute G_total = (2/(1-2)) * ( (1/3)/(1 -1/3) ) * ( (1/5)/(1 -1/5) )\n\nBut wait, G_total is (x/(1 -x))*(y/(1 -y))*(z/(1 -z)).\n\nBut plugging x=2 gives division by (1-2)= -1, which is problematic because it diverges. So this approach also seems to hit a divergence.\n\nHmm, but perhaps with the subtraction terms, it converges?\n\nWait, let's compute each term carefully.\n\nFirst term G_total:\n\nG_total = (x/(1 -x))*(y/(1 -y))*(z/(1 -z))\n\nPlugging x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5:\n\n(2/(1-2))*( (1/3)/(1 -1/3) )*( (1/5)/(1 -1/5) )\n\nBut 1-2 = -1,\n\nso,\n\n= (2/(-1)) * ( (1/3)/(2/3) ) * ( (1/5)/(4/5) )\n\n= (-2) * (1/2) * (1/4) = (-2)*(1/8)= -1/4.\n\nSecond term:\n\nG_A + G_B + G_C.\n\nCompute G_A:\n\nG_A = x^3 y z / [ (1 -x)(1 -x y)(1 -x z) ]\n\nPlug in x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5,\n\nNumerator:2^3*(1/3)*(1/5)=8*(1/15)=8/15.\n\nDenominator:\n\n(1 -2)*(1 -2*(1/3))*(1 -2*(1/5)),\n\n= (-1)*(1 -2/3)*(1 -2/5),\n\n= (-1)*(1/3)*(3/5),\n\n= (-1)*(1/5)= -1/5.\n\nThus, G_A = (8/15)/(-1/5)= (8/15)*(-5)= -8/3.\n\nSimilarly compute G_B:\n\nG_B = y^3 x z / [ (1 -y)(1 -x y)(1 -y z) ]\n\nPlug in y=1/3, x=2, z=1/5,\n\nNumerator: (1/3)^3 *2*(1/5)= (1/27)*(2/5)= 2/(135).\n\nDenominator:\n\n(1 -1/3)*(1 -2*(1/3))*(1 - (1/3)*(1/5)),\n\n= (2/3)*(1 -2/3)*(1 -1/15),\n\n= (2/3)*(1/3)*(14/15),\n\n= (2/3)*(14/45)=28/135.\n\nThus, G_B = (2/135)/(28/135)=2/28=1/14.\n\nSimilarly compute G_C:\n\nG_C = z^3 x y / [ (1 -z)(1 -x z)(1 -y z) ]\n\nPlug in z=1/5, x=2, y=1/3,\n\nNumerator: (1/5)^3 *2*(1/3)= (1/125)*(2/3)=2/(375).\n\nDenominator:\n\n(1 -1/5)*(1 -2*(1/5))*(1 - (1/3)*(1/5)),\n\n= (4/5)*(1 -2/5)*(1 -1/15),\n\n= (4/5)*(3/5)*(14/15),\n\n= (4/5)*(42/75)= (4/5)*(14/25)=56/125.\n\nThus, G_C = (2/375)/(56/125)= (2/375)*(125/56)= (2*125)/(375*56)= (250)/(21000)=25/2100=5/420=1/84.\n\nThus,\n\nG_A + G_B + G_C = (-8/3) +1/14 +1/84.\n\nConvert to common denominator 84:\n\n-8/3 = -224/84,\n\n1/14=6/84,\n\n1/84=1/84,\n\nTotal: (-224 +6 +1)/84 = (-217)/84.\n\nThus,\n\nG = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C) = (-1/4) - (-217/84).\n\n= -1/4 +217/84.\n\nConvert to common denominator 84:\n\n-1/4 = -21/84,\n\nThus,\n\n-21/84 +217/84 =196/84 =49/21=7/3\u22482.333.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous result of 158/273\u22480.579.\n\nClearly, there's a mistake here because the generating function approach is giving a different answer. This suggests that the inclusion-exclusion approach may have been miscalculated or the generating function approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me check the generating function approach again.\n\nThe generating function formula was derived as:\n\nG = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C).\n\nBut in this case, with x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5,\n\nG_total = (2/(1-2))*( (1/3)/(1 -1/3) )*( (1/5)/(1 -1/5) )\n\n= (2/(-1))*( (1/3)/(2/3) )*( (1/5)/(4/5) )\n\n= (-2)*(1/2)*(1/4) = (-2)*(1/8) = -1/4.\n\nThen G_A + G_B + G_C = (-8/3)+(1/14)+(1/84)= let's recompute:\n\nG_A was calculated as -8/3,\n\nG_B was 1/14,\n\nG_C was 1/84,\n\nThus total:\n\n-8/3 +1/14 +1/84,\n\nConvert to denominator 84:\n\n-8/3 = -224/84,\n\n1/14 =6/84,\n\n1/84=1/84,\n\nTotal: (-224 +6 +1)= -217/84.\n\nThus,\n\nG = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C) = (-1/4) - (-217/84) = (-1/4 +217/84).\n\nConvert -1/4 to -21/84,\n\nThus total: (217-21)/84 =196/84 =49/21=7/3\u22482.333.\n\nBut this is a positive number, but the original problem is summing terms like 2^a/(3^b 5^c), which for a=1,b=1,c=1 gives 2/(3*5)=2/15\u22480.133, and other terms are smaller or larger?\n\nWait, the term when a=1, b=1, c=1 is 2/(3*5)=2/15\u22480.133.\n\nWhen a=2, b=1, c=1, but does (2,1,1) form a triangle?\n\n2 +1>1, yes,\n\n1+1>2? 2>2? No, 2 is not greater than 2. So (2,1,1) is not a valid triangle.\n\nSo that term is excluded.\n\na=2, b=2, c=2: equilateral triangle, term is 2\u00b2/(3\u00b25\u00b2)=4/(9*25)=4/225\u22480.0178.\n\na=1,b=1,c=2: 1+1>2? No, so excluded.\n\na=1,b=2,c=2: 1+2>2, yes,\n\n2+2>1, yes,\n\n1+2>2, yes. So it's valid.\n\nTerm is 2^1/(3^2 5^2)=2/(9*25)=2/225\u22480.0089.\n\nSo the terms are indeed small, so getting a total sum of 7/3\u22482.333 seems too large. Therefore, the generating function approach might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the generating function derivation.\n\nWait, the generating function formula for triangles is G = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C).\n\nBut in the derivation, G_A is the generating function for triples where a \u2265 b +c, so those triples are excluded from the triangle set. Thus, the formula should be correct.\n\nBut when plugging in x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5, we get a positive value, but the actual terms are small.\n\nWait, but note that the generating function counts all triples where a,b,c are positive integers forming a triangle, but the terms like 2^a/(3^b 5^c) could sum to a larger value. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we have a triangle with very large a, but b and c also large such that a < b +c.\n\nFor example, let a = b +c -1,\n\nthen the term is 2^{b +c -1}/(3^b 5^c).\n\n= 2^{b +c} / (2*3^b 5^c)\n\n= (2/3)^b * (2/5)^c /2.\n\nThis term, for large b and c, behaves like (2/3)^b*(2/5)^c, which is decaying exponentially.\n\nThus, the total sum should converge.\n\nHowever, the generating function approach gives 7/3\u22482.333, while inclusion-exclusion gave 158/273\u22480.579.\n\nThere's a discrepancy. So where is the mistake?\n\nPerhaps in the generating function formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the generating function approach.\n\nThe formula states:\n\nG(x,y,z) = G_total - (G_A + G_B + G_C).\n\nBut G_total is the generating function for all triples, which includes all a,b,c \u22651.\n\nHowever, when substituting x=2, y=1/3, z=1/5, the G_total term is negative, which is problematic because the generating function should be a sum of positive terms.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the generating function approach is not valid for x,y,z with |x|\u22651, |y|\u22651, |z|\u22651, since the generating functions for G_A, G_B, G_C also may not converge.\n\nIndeed, the problem's terms involve 2^a, which grows exponentially, so the total sum may diverge unless the constraints of the triangle inequalities sufficiently limit the growth.\n\nHowever, in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we obtained a finite value of 158/273\u22480.579, but in the generating function approach, with substitution, it gives a finite value of 7/3\u22482.333.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests an error in one of the approaches.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a small case and see which approach is correct.\n\nLet me compute the sum manually for small a,b,c and see.\n\nConsider all triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c \u22642, and form a triangle.\n\nList all possible triples with a,b,c from1 to2, and check triangle inequalities.\n\nPossible triples:\n\n(1,1,1): valid.\n\n(1,1,2): check 1+1>2? 2>2? No. Invalid.\n\n(1,2,1): same as above, invalid.\n\n(2,1,1): same, invalid.\n\n(1,2,2): valid: 1+2>2, 2+2>1, etc.\n\n(2,1,2): valid.\n\n(2,2,1): valid.\n\n(2,2,2): valid.\n\n(2,2,1): same as (2,1,2).\n\nSo valid triples:\n\n(1,1,1),\n\n(1,2,2),\n\n(2,1,2),\n\n(2,2,1),\n\n(2,2,2).\n\nCompute the sum for these:\n\nFor (1,1,1): 2/15 \u22480.1333.\n\nFor (1,2,2):2^1/(3^2 5^2)=2/(9*25)=2/225\u22480.0089,\n\nSimilarly (2,1,2):2^2/(3^1 5^2)=4/(3*25)=4/75\u22480.0533,\n\n(2,2,1):2^2/(3^2 5^1)=4/(9*5)=4/45\u22480.0889,\n\n(2,2,2):2^2/(3^2 5^2)=4/225\u22480.0178.\n\nTotal sum for these small terms:\n\n0.1333 +0.0089+0.0533+0.0889+0.0178\u22480.3022.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion result of\u22480.579 is larger than this, suggesting that it may be correct as there are more terms with larger a,b,c contributing.\n\nThe generating function approach gives\u22482.333 which is much larger, so likely incorrect.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion approach's result of 158/273\u22480.579 is more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute more terms:\n\nConsider a=3:\n\nPossible triples where a=3.\n\nThen b and c must satisfy:\n\nb +c >3,\n\na=3 \u2264 b or a=3 \u2264c (depending on the largest side).\n\nWait, but need to ensure all triangle inequalities.\n\nLet me list all triples with a=3, b and c from1 to say 4.\n\nBut this could take time. Alternatively, let's see what the inclusion-exclusion answer gives:\n\n158/273 \u22480.579.\n\nThe generating function approach's answer is way higher, so likely wrong.\n\nThus, trusting the inclusion-exclusion approach, the answer is 158/273.

But in that case, all are largest).\n\nWait, no, if all are equal, they are all the largest.\n\nAlternatively, the cases where two variables are equal and the third is smaller are counted twice, but the inclusion-exclusion should have handled that.\n\nWait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach was incorrect because the cases where two variables are equal are counted twice, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, we subtracted the overlaps.\n\nThus, the inclusion-exclusion should give the correct result.\n\nBut there is a contradiction between two methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the generating function approach is correct and I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the sum over unordered triples, but the question says \"all triples (a,b,c)\", which are ordered.\n\nThus, the generating function approach is correct, giving 7/3.\n\nBut the small terms add to\u22480.3366, but the total is 7/3\u22482.333,\n\nThus, there must be significant contributions from larger triples.\n\nLet me compute a=4,b=4,c=4: term is2^4/(3^4 5^4)=16/(81*625)=16/50625\u22480.000316,\n\na=4,b=4,c=5:2^4/(3^4 5^5)=16/(81*3125)=16/253125\u22480.000063,\n\na=4,b=5,c=5:2^4/(3^5 5^5)=16/(243*3125)=16/759375\u22480.000021,\n\na=5,b=5,c=5:32/(243*3125)=32/759375\u22480.000042,\n\nThus, even for a=4,5 contributions are negligible.\n\nBut to reach 2.333, there must be terms where a,b,c are large but the terms are still significant.\n\nWait, consider a=1, b=1, c=1:0.133,\n\na=1,b=2,c=2:0.0089,\n\na=2,b=1,c=2:0.0533,\n\na=2,b=2,c=1:0.0889,\n\na=2,b=2,c=2:0.0178,\n\na=1,b=3,c=3:2/(3^3 5^3)=2/(27*125)=2/3375\u22480.00059,\n\na=3,b=1,c=3:0.0213,\n\na=3,b=3,c=1:0.0213,\n\na=3,b=3,c=3:0.00237,\n\na=1,b=4,c=4:2/(3^4 5^4)=2/(81*625)=2/50625\u22480.0000396,\n\na=4,b=1,c=4:0.000316,\n\na=4,b=4,c=1:0.000316,\n\na=4,b=4,c=4:0.000316,\n\na=2,b=3,c=3:4/(3^3 5^3)=4/3375\u22480.001185,\n\na=3,b=2,c=3:0.00711,\n\na=3,b=3,c=2:0.00237,\n\na=3,b=4,c=4:8/(3^4 5^4)=8/50625\u22480.000158,\n\na=4,b=3,c=4:0.000316,\n\na=4,b=4,c=3:0.000316,\n\na=2,b=4,c=4:4/(3^4 5^4)=4/50625\u22480.000079,\n\na=4,b=2,c=4:0.000316,\n\na=4,b=4,c=2:0.000316,\n\na=3,b=4,c=5:8/(3^4 5^5)=8/(81*3125)=8/253125\u22480.0000316,\n\nand so on.\n\nAdding all these terms up to a,b,c=5 gives about 0.3366+0.0213+0.0213+0.00237+0.00059+0.001185+0.00711+0.00237+0.000158+0.000079+\u2026\u22480.4.\n\nEven up to a=5, it's only 0.4, so to reach 2.333, there must be large terms where a is large but balanced with b and c.\n\nWait, let me consider a=10, b=10, c=10:\n\nTerm is2^{10}/(3^{10}5^{10})=1024/(59049*9765625)= negligible.\n\nThus, the terms decay exponentially.\n\nTherefore, the generating function result of 7/3\u22482.333 must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion result of 158/273\u22480.579 is correct.\n\nGiven that the small terms add up to0.3366, and the total is around0.579, which is plausible.\n\nThe generating function approach must have an error.\n\nPerhaps the generating function formula is for unordered triples, but the problem requires ordered triples.\n\nWait, the generating function formula I used is for ordered triples, since it considers all permutations.\n\nThus, the discrepancy remains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the generating function derivation.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nG(x,y,z) = G_total - G_A - G_B - G_C,\n\nwhere G_total counts all ordered triples, and G_A counts those where a \u2265b +c,\n\n etc.\n\nThus, the formula should be correct.\n\nBut when substituting x=2,y=1/3,z=1/5,\n\nThe result is 7/3\u22482.333,\n\n which would mean the terms sum to that value, but manual summation doesn't reach there, suggesting an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have an answer of 1/2 or 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the problem is symmetric in b and c, but the coefficients are different.\n\nLet me try to write the sum as a triple sum with triangle inequalities.\n\nThe desired sum S is:\n\nS = sum_{a=1}^\u221e sum_{b=1}^\u221e sum_{c=1}^\u221e [indicator(a + b >c, a + c >b, b + c >a)] * 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nWe can rewrite the triangle inequalities as:\n\na < b +c,\n\nb < a +c,\n\nc < a +b.\n\nThese can be considered as:\n\nmax(a,b,c) < a +b +c - max(a,b,c).\n\nLet me denote M = max(a,b,c).\n\nThus, M < a +b +c - M \u21d2 2M <a +b +c \u21d2 a +b +c >2M.\n\nThus, the sum can be written as:\n\nS = sum_{a,b,c \u22651, a +b +c >2M} 2^a/(3^b 5^c),\n\nwhere M = max(a,b,c).\n\nThis might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps split into cases based on which variable is the maximum.\n\nLet me define M = max(a,b,c).\n\nThen,\n\nS = sum_{M=1}^\u221e sum_{a,b,c with max(a,b,c)=M and triangle inequalities} 2^a/(3^b 5^c).\n\nFor each M, the other two variables must be \u2264M, and satisfy the triangle inequalities.\n\nSuppose M is the maximum among a,b,c.\n\nThus, the triangle inequalities require that the sum of the other two variables exceeds M.\n\nThus, for each M, the sum over a,b,c where max(a,b,c)=M,\n\nand a +b +c >2M,\n\nand the other two variables \u2264M.\n\nThis might be manageable.\n\nLet me denote M as the maximum.\n\nThere are three cases:\n\n1. a = M,\n\n2. b = M,\n\n3. c = M.\n\nDue to symmetry, the contributions from cases 1,2,3 can be computed similarly and summed.\n\nLet me compute case1: a = M,\n\nThus, a = M \u2265b and a \u2265c,\n\n and b +c > a =M.\n\nAlso, since a is the maximum, b and c \u2264 M.\n\nThus,\n\nThe sum over a =M from1 to \u221e,\n\nand for each M, sum over b=1 to M,\n\nc=1 to M,\n\nwith b +c >M,\n\nand a =M.\n\nThus,\n\nSum_{M=1}^\u221e 2^M/(3^b 5^c) summed over b,c \u2264M with b +c >M.\n\nThus,\n\nS = Sum_{M=1}^\u221e 2^M [ Sum_{b=1}^M Sum_{c=1}^M [indicator(b +c > M)] (1/3)^b (1/5)^c ].\n\nThis expression might be manageable.\n\nLet me denote the inner sum as S(M):\n\nS(M) = Sum_{b=1}^M Sum_{c=1}^M [b +c > M] (1/3)^b (1/5)^c.\n\nLet me swap the order of summation:\n\nS(M) = Sum_{b=1}^M (1/3)^b Sum_{c= max(1, M -b +1)}^M (1/5)^c.\n\nThe inner sum over c is from c= max(1, M -b +1) to M.\n\nThus,\n\nS(M) = Sum_{b=1}^M (1/3)^b [ Sum_{c= max(1, M -b +1)}^M (1/5)^c ].\n\nThis is similar to the Case1 computation earlier.\n\nLet me compute this inner sum:\n\nFor each b from1 to M,\n\nLet lower_c = max(1, M -b +1).\n\nThus,\n\nSum_{c= lower_c}^M (1/5)^c = (1/5)^{lower_c} * (1 - (1/5)^{M - lower_c +1}) / (1 -1/5).\n\n= (1/4)( (1/5)^{lower_c} - (1/5)^{M+1} ).\n\nThus,\n\nS(M) = (1/4) Sum_{b=1}^M (1/3)^b [ (1/5)^{lower_c} - (1/5)^{M+1} ].\n\n= (1/4)[ Sum_{b=1}^M (1/3)^b (1/5)^{lower_c} -
