Unlike point-particle quantum field theories, string theory\u2019s UV finiteness eliminates the need for regularization at high energies. Perturbative calculations in string theory naturally yield finite results, making it the only quantum theory among the options that does not require regularization.\n\n- **Quantum Chromodynamics (B)**: A quantum field theory (QFT) with asymptotic freedom, QCD still requires regularization and renormalization for loop divergences, even at high energies. Asymptotic freedom simplifies calculations but does not eliminate divergences.\n\n- **Quantum Electrodynamics (C)**: A QFT explicitly requiring regularization (e.g., dimensional regularization) to handle ultraviolet divergences in calculations like electron self-energy. Thus, it necessitates regularization.\n\n- **Classical Electrodynamics (D)**: A classical theory that does not involve quantum field theory concepts like regularization. While it has classical issues (e.g., infinite self-energy of point charges), these are not addressed via regularization, a tool exclusive to QFTs. However, the question focuses on theories that \"never require regularization at high energies,\" and since regularization is irrelevant to classical theories, D technically qualifies. Yet, the context likely prioritizes quantum theories, where string theory (A) uniquely avoids regularization.\n\nThe critical distinction is that regularization is a QFT tool. Among quantum theories, only **Superstring Theory** inherently avoids UV divergences. While Classical Electrodynamics (D) does not use regularization at all, the question\u2019s emphasis on high-energy behavior in the context of quantum theories makes **Superstring Theory** the most confident answer.\n\nAnswer: A"
