Key considerations:  \n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because lineage-specific promoters regulate cell-type expression, not organelle targeting.  \n- **Option B** (co-localization) requires observing apoptosis in iPSCs, which may occur but isn\u2019t the *first* noticeable feature.  \n- **Option C** is unlikely because apoptosis is a normal developmental process, so green signals should be present.  \n- **Option D** focuses on cytoplasmic localization of red. Since mRaspberry is a fluorescent protein typically expressed in the cytoplasm unless modified, this is the most immediate observation. The question emphasizes the \"first\" finding, making subcellular localization the primary visual cue.  \n\nThe first noticeable observation is the cytoplasmic localization of the red signal, as it is a basic structural detail observed before analyzing complex interactions like co-localization.  \n\nAnswer: D"
