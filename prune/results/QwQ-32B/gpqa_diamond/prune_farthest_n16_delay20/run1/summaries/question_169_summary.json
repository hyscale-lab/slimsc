  "llm_tie_break_response_text": "\n\nThe original decay allows the two E particles to potentially take all the available energy Q when the two V particles take minimal energy (effectively zero), resulting in a maximum total energy for the E particles of Q. In the variant, replacing the two V particles with one massless M introduces a constraint due to momentum conservation. To maximize the E particles' total energy, the M must carry some non-zero energy, as its momentum cannot be zero if it is emitted. This forces the total energy of the E particles to be limited to half of the new Q-value (Q/2), as the remaining energy must be carried by M. Thus, the maximum (endpoint) energy of the E particles decreases, while the spectrum remains continuous due to the variable energy distribution between the E particles and M.\n\nAnswer: D) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases."
