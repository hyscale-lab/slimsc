String interactions inherently do not produce the infinities requiring regularization, making it UV-finite. Thus, Superstring Theory does not need regularization at high energies.\n\n- **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: As a quantum field theory, QCD requires regularization despite its asymptotic freedom. High-energy loop calculations still involve UV divergences needing renormalization.\n\n- **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: A quantum field theory with divergent loop integrals, necessitating regularization and renormalization. It requires regularization at high energies.\n\n- **D) Classical Electrodynamics**: A classical theory lacking quantum effects, so it does not encounter divergences requiring regularization. However, the question likely focuses on quantum theories, as regularization is a QFT-specific tool. While technically correct, the context implies a quantum theory answer.\n\nThe question emphasizes quantum theories, and among them, only Superstring Theory is UV-finite. Classical Electrodynamics (D) is correct but distracts from the quantum context implied by the other options. The best answer aligns with the quantum theory that is finite.\n\nAnswer: A"
