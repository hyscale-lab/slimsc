  "llm_tie_break_response_text": "\n\nThe question involves a peptidic compound showing duplicate peaks in its 1H NMR spectrum for an alpha-proton and two distinct peaks in LC-MS with identical mass spectra. Key observations include the peaks integrating to 1H (each contributing 0.5H), spin-spin coupling being ruled out, and the LC-MS peaks having equal intensity.  \n\n**Analysis of Options:**  \n- **A) Contamination with a precursor:** Unlikely, as the mass spectra match the expected compound. Contamination would introduce inconsistent peaks or masses.  \n- **B) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers share the same molecular formula and mass, explaining identical mass spectra. In a racemic mixture, the alpha-proton (part of a chiral center) would exhibit two distinct NMR peaks due to differing environments, with chemical shifts close enough to be \"similar.\" The equal LC-MS peaks reflect a 1:1 enantiomeric ratio.  \n- **C) Double coupling during amide formation:** Invalid, as spin-spin coupling was explicitly ruled out.  \n- **D) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers would cause broader NMR discrepancies beyond the noted alpha-proton peaks, conflicting with the problem\u2019s statement that the spectrum is otherwise consistent.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Enantiomers (B) best explain the data. The NMR shows two peaks for the alpha-proton due to enantiomeric differences, while LC-MS separates them into equal-intensity peaks. Other options fail to align with all observations.  \n\nFinal Answer: B"
