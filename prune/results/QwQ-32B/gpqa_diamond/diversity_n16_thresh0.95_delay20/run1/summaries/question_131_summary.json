Maleic anhydride fits this description, with a five-membered ring containing two carbonyls (165 ppm) and a symmetric CH\u2082 group (137 ppm). \n\nWhen reacting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via Diels-Alder, the major (endo) and minor (exo) products differ in stereochemistry. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product arises from spatial proximity of specific protons. \n\nThe tetramethylcyclopentadiene contributes four methyl groups. In the endo product, two methyl groups (each 3H, totaling 6H) are positioned adjacent on the same face of the ring, creating a cross-peak between their singlets. In the exo product, these methyl groups are on opposite sides, eliminating the cross-peak. Option C connects two 6H singlets (methyl groups), consistent with this stereochemical dependence. Other options involve protons less likely to exhibit such stereochemical sensitivity.\n\nFinal Answer: C"
