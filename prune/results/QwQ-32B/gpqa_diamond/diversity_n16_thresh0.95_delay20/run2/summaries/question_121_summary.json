Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.\n\n2. **Epoxide Structure**: The compound is a bicyclic epoxide with oxygen at position 7. The substituents (methyl groups) are at positions 1, 3, and 4. The epoxide ring involves carbons 6 and another (e.g., 5 or 7), with oxygen at 7.\n\n3. **Less Hindered Carbon Identification**: The less hindered carbon is determined by substituent density. Carbon 6 (originally S) is likely less hindered due to fewer bulky groups compared to other positions.\n\n4. **Inversion of Configuration**: The nucleophile attacks carbon 6 (originally S), causing inversion to R. The other substituents (methyl groups at 1, 3, and 4) remain unchanged.\n\n5. **Product Analysis**: The product retains the original methyl groups and adds a new methyl from the reagent. The stereochemistry at the attacked carbon (now R) and other positions matches **Option B** (1R,4R,5R), which aligns with inversion at carbon 6 and the resulting tetramethyl substituents (2,2,4,5).\n\n**Answer: B**"
