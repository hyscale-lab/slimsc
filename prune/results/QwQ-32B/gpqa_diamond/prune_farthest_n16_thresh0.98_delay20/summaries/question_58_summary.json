Thus, **B** and **C** are excluded.\n\n2. **Superstring Theory (A)** is a quantum theory positing particles as vibrating strings. The extended nature of strings inherently avoids the point-particle singularities of QFTs, eliminating UV divergences. Calculations in string theory naturally yield finite results without manual regularization, making it UV-complete. This aligns with its theoretical framework's design to resolve high-energy divergences.\n\n3. **Classical Electrodynamics (D)** is a classical theory without quantum effects. While it can have issues like infinite self-energy for point charges, these are not addressed via regularization in its framework. However, classical theories are not applied at high energies where quantum effects dominate, so regularization is unnecessary. Yet, the question emphasizes \"never requires regularization at high energies,\" which focuses on the theory's inherent structure rather than applicability. Since regularization is a QFT concept, classical theories like CED inherently lack the divergences requiring it, but the question likely prioritizes quantum theories given the context of high-energy physics.\n\nWhile both **A** and **D** avoid regularization, **Superstring Theory (A)** is the definitive answer because it is a quantum theory that fundamentally eliminates UV divergences through its string structure, directly addressing the question's focus on high-energy behavior in a quantum framework.\n\nAnswer: A"
