Ground-based telescopes cannot observe wavelengths below ~3000 \u00c5 due to atmospheric absorption. The observed wavelength must exceed this threshold:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 3000\\) \u00c5:  \n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{3000}{1216} \\approx 2.467 \\implies z \\approx 1.467\n\\]\n\nThe smallest option exceeding this value is **1.9** (D). However, if the optical window is strictly defined as visible light (\u22654000 \u00c5):  \n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \\approx 2.29 \\implies \\text{closest to } 2.4 \\, (\\text{C}).\n\\]\n\nThe debate hinges on whether \"optical\" includes near-UV (3000\u20134000 \u00c5) or strictly visible light. Astronomical observations of the Lyman alpha forest typically require redshifts \\(z \\gtrsim 2\\) to enter the visible range, making **2.4** (C) the more robust answer for the lower limit.\n\nAnswer: C"
