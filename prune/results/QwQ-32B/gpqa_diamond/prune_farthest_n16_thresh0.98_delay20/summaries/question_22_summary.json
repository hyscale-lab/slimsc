In basic solutions (O\u2082 + 2H\u2082O + 4e\u207b \u2192 4OH\u207b), the standard reduction potential is lower (**+0.40 V**), indicating oxygen is a **weaker oxidant** in basic conditions. Thus, the first blank is \"weaker.\"\n\n2. **Kinetic Analysis (Acidic Solutions):**  \n   The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is kinetically slow in acidic solutions due to high activation energy. Without catalysts like platinum, the reaction proceeds sluggishly, as seen in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells where catalysts are essential to lower activation energy. While thermodynamically favored in acidic conditions, the lack of catalysts results in slower kinetics compared to basic solutions. Thus, the second blank is \"slower.\"\n\nCombining these conclusions, the correct answer is **D** (weaker \u2013 slower).\n\nAnswer: D"
