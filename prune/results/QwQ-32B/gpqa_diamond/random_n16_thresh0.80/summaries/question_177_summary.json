Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength (\u03bb_max), but their radial velocities must be accounted for via Doppler shift. \n\n1. **Radius and Luminosity**:  \n   Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, so the radius ratio \\( \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \\). The luminosity ratio due to radius alone is \\( \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\).\n\n2. **Temperature Adjustment via Doppler Shift**:  \n   The observed \\( \\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\) for both stars is the same. However, Star_2's redshift (due to its 700 km/s radial velocity) means its intrinsic \\( \\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\) is shorter than observed. Using Wien's law (\\( \\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\frac{1}{T} \\)):  \n   - Star_2's intrinsic \\( T_2 \\) is higher than Star_1's \\( T_1 \\):  \n     \\( T_2 = T_1 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right) \\).  \n   - Here, \\( \\frac{v}{c} \\approx 0.00233 \\), so \\( T_2 \\approx T_1 \\cdot 1.00233 \\).\n\n3. **Luminosity with Temperature Correction**:  \n   The luminosity ratio becomes:  \n   \\( \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1.00233}\\right)^4 \\).  \n   Calculating \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{1.00233}\\right)^4 \\approx 0.9907 \\), the final ratio is:  \n   \\( 2.25 \\cdot 0.9907 \\approx 2.23 \\).\n\nThe mass of the stars does not affect the calculation here, as the problem specifies blackbody radiation and provides sufficient data through radii and Doppler-corrected temperatures.\n\nAnswer: D"
