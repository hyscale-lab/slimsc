A lower potential in basic solutions indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant there. Thus, the first blank is \"weaker.\"\n\n**Kinetic Analysis:**  \nIn acidic solutions, oxygen's reduction reaction (O\u2082 + 4H\u207a + 4e\u207b \u2192 2H\u2082O) is kinetically sluggish due to a high activation energy barrier. This is evident in applications like proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, where catalysts like platinum are required to enhance the reaction rate. Conversely, while the thermodynamic drive is stronger in acidic conditions, the kinetic rate remains slow. Therefore, oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions, making the second blank \"slower.\"\n\nCombining these conclusions:  \n- Thermodynamically weaker in basic solutions.  \n- Kinetically slower in acidic solutions.  \n\nThe correct option is **D**.  \n\nAnswer: D"
