      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the angle between the two photons after the collision. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. \n\nFirst, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy must be conserved. Since both photons have the same energy, their momenta must also be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction? Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/c, and since their energies are equal, their magnitudes of momentum would be the same. But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So maybe their momenta vectors add up to zero in the direction perpendicular to the original collision axis?\n\nWait, the problem says the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron from the left, the positron from the right. So their initial momenta are along the horizontal. Let me think about conservation of momentum. The total momentum before collision must equal the total after. Since they annihilate into two photons, the photons' momenta must add up to the total initial momentum.\n\nHmm, but the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momentum vectors have components in the vertical direction that cancel each other. Because one is upper-right, the other is lower-right. So the vertical components of their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite, so they cancel. That leaves the horizontal components to add up to the total initial momentum.\n\nWait, but the initial momentum of the system is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let me note that the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). Wait, actually, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is to the left. \n\nSo the electron has a momentum in the positive x-direction, the positron in the negative x-direction. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since their Lorentz factors are given, I can compute their energies and momenta.\n\nThe Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The total energy of each particle is gamma * m c\u00b2, where m is the rest mass (since electron and positron have the same mass). The momentum for each is gamma * beta * m c, where beta is v/c.\n\nLet me denote the electron's gamma as 4, so gamma_e =4. The positron's gamma is 2, so gamma_p =2. Since the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis, their velocities are in opposite directions, so their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nLet me calculate the total initial momentum. The electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m c. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m c, but in the opposite direction. Wait, but beta is v/c. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is negative, so the momentum would be negative. So total initial momentum is p_e (electron's direction) minus p_p (positron's direction). \n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the reference frame here. The problem might be in the center-of-momentum frame? Or is it in the lab frame? Wait, the problem doesn't specify a frame, but since the question is about the angle between the photons, maybe the collision is considered in their center-of-mass frame? Hmm, but the Lorentz factors are given for each particle. Wait, Lorentz factors are frame-dependent. So perhaps the problem is set in a particular frame, maybe the lab frame? Or the frame where the collision occurs?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use conservation of energy and momentum in the frame where the collision happens. Let me think. The total energy before collision is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. Since they annihilate into two photons, the total energy should equal the sum of the photon energies. Since the photons have equal energy, each photon's energy is half of the total initial energy. \n\nSo first, compute the total energy of the system before collision. The electron's energy is gamma_e * m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2. The positron's energy is gamma_p * m c\u00b2 = 2 m c\u00b2. So total energy is 6 m c\u00b2. Therefore each photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2. \n\nNow, the photons' momenta. The momentum of each photon is p = E/c, but in the direction of travel. Since each photon's energy is 3 m c\u00b2, their momenta are (3 m c\u00b2)/c = 3 m c each. Wait, but direction matters. Let me denote the photons as moving at angles theta above and below the x-axis. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, respectively. \n\nSo each photon's momentum vector can be broken into x and y components. For the upper photon, the momentum components are p_x = 3 m c cos(theta), p_y = 3 m c sin(theta). The lower photon has p_x = 3 m c cos(theta), p_y = -3 m c sin(theta). So when we add their momenta, the y-components cancel out. The total momentum in the y-direction is zero, which makes sense because the initial particles had no y-momentum. \n\nThe total x-momentum after collision is 2 * 3 m c cos(theta) = 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nNow, this must equal the total initial momentum of the electron and positron. Let's compute that. \n\nThe electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m c. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m c but in the opposite direction. Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left (opposite direction of the electron's motion), its momentum is negative. \n\nWait, but to find the total initial momentum, we need to know the velocities. Wait, but we don't have the velocities. Hmm. Wait, perhaps we can find the relationship between beta_e and beta_p using the Lorentz factors?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the center-of-mass frame? Wait, in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero. But here, the initial particles have different gamma factors, so their momenta might not cancel. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frame in which the problem is presented is such that the total momentum is the sum of the two particles. Let me think again. \n\nThe total initial momentum is p_total = p_e - p_p (since the positron is moving in the opposite direction). \n\nBut to compute p_e and p_p, we need to know their velocities. Since gamma is given, we can express beta in terms of gamma. \n\nRecall that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). \n\nSo for the electron (gamma_e =4):\n\nbeta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is gamma_e * beta_e * m c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m c = sqrt(15) m c.\n\nThe positron has gamma_p = 2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nThus, its momentum is gamma_p * beta_p * m c = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m c = sqrt(3) m c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction (to the left), its momentum is subtracted. So the total initial momentum is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nWait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the negative direction, so the total is p_e (positive) plus (-p_p) which is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must be equal to that. \n\nThe total x-momentum after collision is 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nSo setting them equal:\n\n6 m c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides, so:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nThen, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically. Let's compute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205. \n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.35682. \n\nSo cos(theta) \u22480.35682. \n\nThen theta is arccos(0.35682). Let me calculate that. \n\nArccos(0.3568) is approximately... Let me see, cos(67 degrees) is about 0.3907, cos(70) is ~0.3428. Hmm, so 0.3568 is between 70 and 67. Let me do a better approximation. \n\nLet me see, cos(69\u00b0) = cos(60+9) = ... Well, maybe better to use calculator steps. \n\nAlternatively, 0.3568. Let me compute:\n\nThe value is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me try 69. Let me compute cos(69\u00b0):\n\ncos(69) \u2248 0.3584. Wait, that's very close. \n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) is approximately 0.3584, which is just a bit higher than 0.3568. So the angle is a bit more than 69 degrees. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose theta \u2248 69.5 degrees. Let me compute cos(69.5):\n\nUsing linear approximation between 69 and 70. \n\nAt 69, cos=0.3584\n\nAt 70, cos=0.3428. \n\nThe difference between 69 and 70 is 1 degree, and the value drops by 0.0156. \n\nWe need to find x where cos(x)=0.3568. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is -0.0016. \n\nSo the fraction is 0.0016 / 0.0156 \u2248 0.1026. \n\nSo the angle is 69 + 0.1026*(1) \u2248 69.1 degrees. \n\nHmm, so theta is approximately 69.1 degrees. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta. \n\nAh right! The angle between the two photons is the angle from upper-right to lower-right, which would be 2 times theta. \n\nSo if theta is about 69 degrees, then the angle between them is about 138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. \n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let me check my steps again to be sure. \n\nTotal momentum after collision: 2*(3 m c cos(theta)) =6 m c cos(theta). \n\nTotal initial momentum was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nThen cos(theta)= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6. \n\nCalculating that gives approx 0.3568, leading to theta\u224869 degrees, so angle between them 138, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in the initial momentum calculation. \n\nThe electron's momentum is gamma_e * beta_e * m c. \n\nWait, beta_e is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. So gamma_e is 4, so 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) m c = sqrt(15) m c. That's correct. \n\nThe positron's momentum: gamma_p is 2. So beta_p is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So gamma_p * beta_p is 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3). Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is subtracted from the electron's. So total initial momentum is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nYes. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThen the angle between the photons is 2*theta, which would be 2*69 \u2248138 degrees. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum in vector form. Let me try that. \n\nThe total energy before collision is (4 + 2)m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2. \n\nEach photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2, so their momenta are p1 and p2 each with magnitude 3 m c / c = 3 m. Wait, wait, energy E = pc for photons. So p = E/c. So each photon's momentum magnitude is (3 m c\u00b2)/c =3 m c. \n\nWait, no, energy E = pc. So p = E/c. So the momentum of each photon is E/c = (3 m c\u00b2)/c =3 m c. So each photon's momentum is 3 m c in magnitude. \n\nSo the two photons have momentum vectors of magnitude 3 m c each, making angles +theta and -theta with the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum vector is (3 m c cos(theta) + 3 m c cos(theta)) along x, and (3 m c sin(theta) - 3 m c sin(theta)) along y, so the y component cancels. \n\nThe x component total is 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nThis must equal the initial momentum of the system. \n\nThe initial momentum was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nSo 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3). \n\nSo solving for theta gives the same as before. \n\nTherefore, angle between the photons is 2 theta. \n\nSo 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ). \n\nCalculating this angle numerically: \n\nLet me compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) first. \n\nsqrt(15)=3.872983..., sqrt(3)=1.73205..., so subtracting gives 3.87298-1.73205\u22482.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: ~0.35682. \n\nacos(0.35682) \u224869.1 degrees. \n\nMultiply by 2: ~138.2 degrees. \n\nSo the closest option is C) 138. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n",

The electron's energy is gamma_e * m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2. The positron's energy is gamma_p * m c\u00b2 = 2 m c\u00b2. So total energy is 6 m c\u00b2. Therefore each photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2. \n\nNow, the photons' momenta. The momentum of each photon is p = E/c, but in the direction of travel. Since each photon's energy is 3 m c\u00b2, their momenta are (3 m c\u00b2)/c = 3 m c each. Wait, but direction matters. Let me denote the photons as moving at angles theta above and below the x-axis.

Since gamma is given, we can express beta in terms of gamma. \n\nRecall that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). \n\nSo for the electron (gamma_e =4):\n\nbeta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682.\n\nSo the electron's momentum is gamma_e * beta_e * m c = 4*(sqrt(15)/4)*m c = sqrt(15) m c.\n\nThe positron has gamma_p = 2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660.\n\nThus, its momentum is gamma_p * beta_p * m c = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*m c = sqrt(3) m c.\n\nBut since the positron is moving in the opposite direction (to the left), its momentum is subtracted. So the total initial momentum is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nWait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the negative direction, so the total is p_e (positive) plus (-p_p) which is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nNow, the total momentum after collision must be equal to that. \n\nThe total x-momentum after collision is 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nSo setting them equal:\n\n6 m c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.\n\nWe can cancel m c from both sides, so:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)\n\nThen, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6\n\nHmm, let me compute that numerically. Let's compute sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u22481.73205. \n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 -1.73205 \u2248 2.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u22480.35682. \n\nSo cos(theta) \u22480.35682. \n\nThen theta is arccos(0.35682). Let me calculate that. \n\nArccos(0.3568) is approximately... Let me see, cos(67 degrees) is about 0.3907, cos(70) is ~0.3428. Hmm, so 0.3568 is between 70 and 67. Let me do a better approximation. \n\nLet me see, cos(69\u00b0) = cos(60+9) = ... Well, maybe better to use calculator steps. \n\nAlternatively, 0.3568. Let me compute:\n\nThe value is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let me try 69. Let me compute cos(69\u00b0):\n\ncos(69) \u2248 0.3584. Wait, that's very close. \n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0) is approximately 0.3584, which is just a bit higher than 0.3568. So the angle is a bit more than 69 degrees. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose theta \u2248 69.5 degrees. Let me compute cos(69.5):\n\nUsing linear approximation between 69 and 70. \n\nAt 69, cos=0.3584\n\nAt 70, cos=0.3428. \n\nThe difference between 69 and 70 is 1 degree, and the value drops by 0.0156. \n\nWe need to find x where cos(x)=0.3568. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is -0.0016. \n\nSo the fraction is 0.0016 / 0.0156 \u2248 0.1026. \n\nSo the angle is 69 + 0.1026*(1) \u2248 69.1 degrees. \n\nHmm, so theta is approximately 69.1 degrees. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta. \n\nAh right! The angle between the two photons is the angle from upper-right to lower-right, which would be 2 times theta. \n\nSo if theta is about 69 degrees, then the angle between them is about 138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. \n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let me check my steps again to be sure. \n\nTotal momentum after collision: 2*(3 m c cos(theta)) =6 m c cos(theta). \n\nTotal initial momentum was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nThen cos(theta)= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6. \n\nCalculating that gives approx 0.3568, leading to theta\u224869 degrees, so angle between them 138, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in the initial momentum calculation. \n\nThe electron's momentum is gamma_e * beta_e * m c. \n\nWait, beta_e is sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4. So gamma_e is 4, so 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) m c = sqrt(15) m c. That's correct. \n\nThe positron's momentum: gamma_p is 2. So beta_p is sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So gamma_p * beta_p is 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3). Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is subtracted from the electron's. So total initial momentum is sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c. \n\nYes. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThen the angle between the photons is 2*theta, which would be 2*69 \u2248138 degrees. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum in vector form. Let me try that. \n\nThe total energy before collision is (4 + 2)m c\u00b2 =6 m c\u00b2. \n\nEach photon has energy 3 m c\u00b2, so their momenta are p1 and p2 each with magnitude 3 m c / c = 3 m. Wait, wait, energy E = pc for photons. So p = E/c. So each photon's momentum magnitude is (3 m c\u00b2)/c =3 m c. \n\nWait, no, energy E = pc. So p = E/c. So the momentum of each photon is E/c = (3 m c\u00b2)/c =3 m c. So each photon's momentum is 3 m c in magnitude. \n\nSo the two photons have momentum vectors of magnitude 3 m c each, making angles +theta and -theta with the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum vector is (3 m c cos(theta) + 3 m c cos(theta)) along x, and (3 m c sin(theta) - 3 m c sin(theta)) along y, so the y component cancels. \n\nThe x component total is 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nThis must equal the initial momentum of the system. \n\nThe initial momentum was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c. \n\nSo 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3). \n\nSo solving for theta gives the same as before. \n\nTherefore, angle between the photons is 2 theta. \n\nSo 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ). \n\nCalculating this angle numerically: \n\nLet me compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) first. \n\nsqrt(15)=3.872983..., sqrt(3)=1.73205..., so subtracting gives 3.87298-1.73205\u22482.14093. \n\nDivide by 6: ~0.35682. \n\nacos(0.35682) \u224869.1 degrees. \n\nMultiply by 2: ~138.2 degrees. \n\nSo the closest option is C) 138. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe problem involves an electron and positron annihilating into two photons with equal energy. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of their energies, which is \\(6mc^2\\). Each photon thus has energy \\(3mc^2\\), giving each a momentum of \\(3mc\\). The photons move at angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\) from the horizontal axis, so their vertical components cancel. The horizontal momentum after collision must equal the initial total momentum.\n\nThe electron's momentum is \\(\\gamma_e \\beta_e mc = \\sqrt{15}mc\\) (since \\(\\beta_e = \\sqrt{1 - 1/16}\\)), and the positron's momentum (opposite direction) is \\(\\gamma_p \\beta_p mc = \\sqrt{3}mc\\). The net initial momentum is \\((\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})mc\\).\n\nSetting this equal to the photons' horizontal momentum:  \n\\(6mc \\cos\\theta = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})mc\\).  \nSolving gives \\(\\cos\\theta \\approx 0.3568\\), so \\(\\theta \\approx 69^\\circ\\). The angle between the photons is \\(2\\theta \\approx 138^\\circ\\), corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the two photons. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when particles annihilate, they have to conserve momentum and energy. Since both photons are produced, their momenta must add up to zero because the initial total momentum has to be conserved. Wait, but the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions. \n\nThe Lorentz factors given are 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Lorentz factor (gamma) is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), right? But maybe I need their velocities? Or perhaps their energies? Because energy is gamma times rest mass energy. Since they're annihilating, their total energy should equal the energy of the photons. But the problem says the energies of both photons are the same. That might be a clue.\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's denote the rest mass of electron and positron as m. The total energy before collision is the sum of their relativistic energies. The electron has energy gamma_e * m c\u00b2, and the positron similarly gamma_p * m c\u00b2. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite in direction. The momentum of each is gamma * m v. Wait, but I need to calculate the vector sum of their momenta. Since they are moving along the same axis (horizontal), their momenta are along that axis. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the electron moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron moving to the left. Wait, no, the problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, so its direction is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so direction to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's take right as positive direction.\n\nTotal initial momentum is (gamma_e * m v_e) - (gamma_p * m v_p). Wait, but their velocities? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work in terms of energy and momentum since gamma is given. The energy for each is gamma * m c\u00b2. The momentum for each is gamma * m v. But since v = (beta)c, so momentum is gamma * m * beta c. Alternatively, the magnitude of momentum can be written as sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. Hmm, maybe that's a better way.\n\nWait, the energy of each particle is E = gamma m c\u00b2. The magnitude of momentum p is (gamma m v). Since v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. Alternatively, p = E/c * beta. But beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Hmm, perhaps I can express the momentum in terms of gamma.\n\nAlternatively, since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c? Wait, maybe I should compute the initial momenta.\n\nLet me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum is p_e - p_p. Wait, but the problem states that after collision, the two photons are moving at upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta must add up to the total initial momentum. Since photons travel at speed c, their momentum is E_photon/(c^2) in the direction of travel.\n\nBut the problem says that the energies of both photons are the same. Let me denote each photon's energy as E. Since the total energy must be conserved, the sum of the photon energies equals the sum of the initial particles' energies. So 2E = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c\u00b2. So E = [(gamma_e + gamma_p)/2] m c\u00b2. But that's just the energy part.\n\nNow, for momentum conservation. The total initial momentum must equal the vector sum of the photons' momenta. Let me denote the two photons as moving at angles theta above and below the horizontal axis (since one is upper-right and lower-right). Since they are symmetric in energy, their angles with respect to the horizontal might be symmetrical?\n\nWait, but the initial momentum of the system is not zero. Because the electron and positron have different gamma factors, so their momenta might not cancel. Let me compute the initial momentum.\n\nLet me define the electron moving to the right (positive x-direction) with momentum p_e = gamma_e m v_e. The positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction) with momentum p_p = gamma_p m v_p (but in the negative x direction, so total initial momentum is p_e - p_p. Wait, but I need to find the velocities in terms of gamma?\n\nAlternatively, since gamma is given, perhaps we can express the momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass. The momentum of each particle is gamma m v. Since v = (beta)c, and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Let me compute the momentum for each.\n\nLet me compute p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e c, where beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e\u00b2). Similarly for the positron, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p\u00b2), so p_p = gamma_p * m * beta_p c. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -p_p in the x-direction.\n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum in the x-direction is p_e - p_p. Let me compute the actual values.\n\nGiven gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.\n\nFirst, compute beta_e for electron:\n\nbeta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 \u2248 0.9682. So p_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m c sqrt(15). Wait, because 4*(sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15). So p_e = m c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly for positron: gamma_p=2, so beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. So p_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2)c = m c sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's) minus p_p (positron's in opposite direction). Wait, actually, since the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's momentum to the right) + (-p_p) (positron's to the left). So total p_initial = p_e - p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, let me compute the numerical values. sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is approx 1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) \u2248 3.872 -1.732 \u2248 2.14. So the total initial momentum is positive, meaning to the right.\n\nNow, the two photons must have their momenta vectors adding up to this total momentum. The photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. Let's consider their directions. Let me assume that each photon is at angle theta above and below the x-axis. Let me denote the angle between each photon's direction and the x-axis as theta. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their angles with the x-axis are theta and -theta, respectively. \n\nEach photon's momentum vector will have components. The x-component of each photon's momentum should add up to the total initial momentum, and the y-components must cancel out (since the initial momentum had no y-component). Because the total momentum must be conserved. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet each photon have energy E. Since their energies are equal, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p_photon = E/(c^2) * c = E/c). So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. Let me denote the momentum of each photon as a vector. The upper-right photon has an angle theta above x-axis, the lower-right has angle theta below. \n\nThe x-components of the two photons' momenta are (E/c) cos(theta) each, so adding up to 2*(E/c) cos(theta). The y-components are (E/c) sin(theta) and -(E/c) sin(theta), which cancel each other. So the total momentum of the photons is 2*(E/c) cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum p_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can also use energy conservation. The total energy of the two photons is 2E = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c\u00b2. Therefore, E = [(gamma_e + gamma_p)/2] m c\u00b2. Plugging gamma_e =4 and gamma_p=2, so E = (6/2) m c\u00b2 = 3 m c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, substituting E into the momentum equation:\n\n2*(3 m c\u00b2 / c ) * cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify left side: 2*(3 m c) cos(theta) = 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nRight side: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nThus cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6.\n\nCompute that value numerically. Let me compute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Their difference is 3.872 -1.732 \u22482.14. Divided by 6 gives approx 0.3567. \n\nSo cos(theta) \u22480.3567. Then theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567). Let me compute that. \n\nArccos(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees? Wait, let me check:\n\ncos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0)= approx cos(60+9)= cos60 cos9 - sin60 sin9 \u22480.5*0.9877 -0.866*0.1564\u22480.4939 -0.135\u22480.3589. Oh, that's very close. So theta \u224869 degrees. \n\nWait, so each photon makes 69 degrees with the x-axis. The angle between the two photons would be the angle between upper-right (theta above x) and lower-right (theta below x). So the angle between them is theta + theta = 2 theta. So 2 *69 = 138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. That seems to fit. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again. Let me recompute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15)= approx 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. Subtract: 3.87298-1.73205=2.14093. Divided by 6: 2.14093/6\u22480.3568. \n\nThen arccos(0.3568)= approximately 69 degrees. So 2*69 is 138. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. That's option C. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. Let me think if there's another angle. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the angle with the x-axis? Let me confirm the setup again.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So the angle between each and the x-axis is theta, so between them it's 2 theta. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the direction of momentum. Let me check the momentum calculation again. The total initial momentum was p_e - p_p. Wait, p_e is the electron's momentum to the right, and p_p is the positron's momentum to the left. So the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left's magnitude). So yes, the initial momentum is to the right, and the photons must have their x-components adding to that. The y-components cancel. \n\nAnother thing: the energy conservation. The total energy of the photons is 2E = (4 +2)* m c\u00b2, so yes, E=3 m c\u00b2. Correct. Then the momentum equation is correct. \n\nSo I think the answer is C) 138.\n",

So p_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m c sqrt(15). Wait, because 4*(sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15).

So p_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2)c = m c sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's) minus p_p (positron's in opposite direction). Wait, actually, since the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's momentum to the right) + (-p_p) (positron's to the left).

So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) \u2248 3.872 -1.732 \u2248 2.14. So the total initial momentum is positive, meaning to the right.\n\nNow, the two photons must have their momenta vectors adding up to this total momentum. The photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. Let's consider their directions. Let me assume that each photon is at angle theta above and below the x-axis. Let me denote the angle between each photon's direction and the x-axis as theta. Since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, their angles with the x-axis are theta and -theta, respectively. \n\nEach photon's momentum vector will have components. The x-component of each photon's momentum should add up to the total initial momentum, and the y-components must cancel out (since the initial momentum had no y-component). Because the total momentum must be conserved. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet each photon have energy E. Since their energies are equal, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p_photon = E/(c^2) * c = E/c). So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. Let me denote the momentum of each photon as a vector. The upper-right photon has an angle theta above x-axis, the lower-right has angle theta below. \n\nThe x-components of the two photons' momenta are (E/c) cos(theta) each, so adding up to 2*(E/c) cos(theta). The y-components are (E/c) sin(theta) and -(E/c) sin(theta), which cancel each other. So the total momentum of the photons is 2*(E/c) cos(theta) in the x-direction. This must equal the initial momentum p_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSo 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWe can also use energy conservation. The total energy of the two photons is 2E = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c\u00b2. Therefore, E = [(gamma_e + gamma_p)/2] m c\u00b2. Plugging gamma_e =4 and gamma_p=2, so E = (6/2) m c\u00b2 = 3 m c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, substituting E into the momentum equation:\n\n2*(3 m c\u00b2 / c ) * cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimplify left side: 2*(3 m c) cos(theta) = 6 m c cos(theta). \n\nRight side: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).\n\nThus cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6.\n\nCompute that value numerically. Let me compute sqrt(15) \u22483.872, sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Their difference is 3.872 -1.732 \u22482.14. Divided by 6 gives approx 0.3567. \n\nSo cos(theta) \u22480.3567. Then theta \u2248 arccos(0.3567). Let me compute that. \n\nArccos(0.3567) is approximately 69 degrees? Wait, let me check:\n\ncos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(69\u00b0)= approx cos(60+9)= cos60 cos9 - sin60 sin9 \u22480.5*0.9877 -0.866*0.1564\u22480.4939 -0.135\u22480.3589. Oh, that's very close. So theta \u224869 degrees. \n\nWait, so each photon makes 69 degrees with the x-axis. The angle between the two photons would be the angle between upper-right (theta above x) and lower-right (theta below x). So the angle between them is theta + theta = 2 theta. So 2 *69 = 138 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. That seems to fit. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again. Let me recompute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(15)= approx 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. Subtract: 3.87298-1.73205=2.14093. Divided by 6: 2.14093/6\u22480.3568. \n\nThen arccos(0.3568)= approximately 69 degrees. So 2*69 is 138. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees. That's option C. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. Let me think if there's another angle. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the angle with the x-axis? Let me confirm the setup again.\n\nThe problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So the angle between each and the x-axis is theta, so between them it's 2 theta. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the direction of momentum. Let me check the momentum calculation again. The total initial momentum was p_e - p_p. Wait, p_e is the electron's momentum to the right, and p_p is the positron's momentum to the left. So the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left's magnitude). So yes, the initial momentum is to the right, and the photons must have their x-components adding to that. The y-components cancel. \n\nAnother thing: the energy conservation. The total energy of the photons is 2E = (4 +2)* m c\u00b2, so yes, E=3 m c\u00b2. Correct. Then the momentum equation is correct. \n\nSo I think the answer is C) 138.\n\n\nTo determine the angle between the photons produced after the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we use conservation of momentum and energy. The electron (\u03b3=4) and positron (\u03b3=2) move in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. \n\n**Energy Conservation**:  \nThe total energy of the photons must equal the sum of the particles' relativistic energies:  \n\\[\n2E = (\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p) m c^2 \\implies E = \\frac{(4 + 2)}{2} m c^2 = 3 m c^2.\n\\]\n\n**Momentum Conservation**:  \nThe initial momenta of the electron and positron are calculated using their Lorentz factors:  \n- Electron momentum: \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m v_e = \\gamma_e m c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_e^2}} = 4m c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = m c \\sqrt{15} \\).  \n- Positron momentum: \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m v_p = 2m c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = m c \\sqrt{3} \\).  \n\nTotal initial momentum (to the right):  \n\\[\np_{\\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}).\n\\]\n\nThe photons' momenta must sum to this value. Each photon has momentum magnitude \\( \\frac{E}{c} = \\frac{3m c^2}{c} = 3m c \\). Let \\( \\theta \\) be the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis. The horizontal components of their momenta must equal \\( p_{\\text{initial}} \\):  \n\\[\n2 \\cdot 3m c \\cos\\theta = m c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\implies 6 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\theta \\):  \n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\approx 0.3567 \\implies \\theta \\approx 69^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nThe angle between the photons is \\( 2\\theta \\approx 138^\\circ \\).\n\nAnswer: C) 138.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\nAnswer: C",
