      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with different lifetimes. The problem gives me two lifetimes: one is 10^-9 seconds and the other is 10^-8 seconds. The question is asking which energy difference (from the options) would let us resolve these two energy levels.\n\nHmm, I remember there's something about the energy-time uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the uncertainty principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. But maybe for resolving energy levels, the key idea is that the energy difference between the states must be larger than the uncertainty in energy due to their finite lifetimes. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart.\n\nWait, the lifetime (\u03c4) is related to the energy uncertainty. The formula I think is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u03c4). Or maybe it's just \u0394E \u2248 1/(\u03c4) multiplied by some constants. Let me recall. The uncertainty principle says \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/(2), so the minimum uncertainty would be when they're equal. So \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). But maybe for practical purposes, people approximate \u0394E ~ \u0127/\u03c4. Let me check the constants here. \n\nAlternatively, the energy uncertainty of a state with lifetime \u03c4 is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u03c4). Because the lifetime is the time uncertainty. Since \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s, but maybe in eV\u00b7seconds, we can use a different value. Wait, perhaps in these problems they use the relation where \u0394E \u2248 1/(\u03c4) in some units? Or maybe the formula is written as \u0394E \u2248 h/(4\u03c0\u03c4), which would be the same as \u0127/(\u03c4), since h/(2\u03c0) is \u0127. So yeah, \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u03c4).\n\nBut the key point here is that to resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because each state has its own energy uncertainty. So the total uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties from each state. \n\nSo, the energy difference \u0394E between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Let me write that down:\n\nRequired: |E1 - E2| > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2\n\nWhere \u0394E1 is the uncertainty in E1, which is \u0127/(\u03c41), and similarly for \u0394E2. \n\nSo the minimum resolvable energy difference would be the sum of those two uncertainties. Let me compute that.\n\nGiven \u03c41 is 1e-9 s, \u03c42 is 1e-8 s. \n\nFirst, let's compute each \u0394E.\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u03c41), \u0394E2 = \u0127/(\u03c42)\n\nSo sum is \u0127 (1/\u03c41 + 1/\u03c42). \n\nBut wait, actually, perhaps the uncertainties are each about \u0127/(2\u03c4), because the uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/(2). So if \u0394t is the lifetime \u03c4, then \u0394E is at least \u0127/(2\u03c4). So the minimum uncertainty for each would be that. \n\nTherefore, the total uncertainty to overcome would be (\u0127/(2\u03c41) + \u0127/(2\u03c42)). \n\nHmm, but maybe the question is considering that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of each uncertainty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dominant term is the larger uncertainty? Wait, but let me think again.\n\nSuppose each state has an uncertainty in energy. For E1, its energy is E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1, and similarly E2 is E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. To resolve the two, the separation between the two must be more than the sum of their uncertainties. So the minimal required separation is \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nSo the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than that. \n\nTherefore, let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Let's compute each using \u0127/(2\u03c4) as the minimum uncertainty. \n\nBut I need to get the numerical value here. Since the options are given in eV, I need to compute \u0394E in eV. Let me see:\n\nFirst, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's convert that to eV\u00b7s. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is (1.0545718e-34)/(1.602e-19) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo, for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) \u2248 (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.291e-7 eV. \n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, so \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV. \n\nAdding these two uncertainties: 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 \u2248 3.291e-7 + 0.3291e-7 = 3.62e-7 eV. \n\nSo the total required energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 way too small, since 1e-9 is much less than 3.6e-7. \n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. \n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. The required is ~3.6e-7, which is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is much bigger, so that would work. \n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. Because 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is less than 0.00000036. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up the exponents. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 again. \n\nFor \u03c41 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) \u2192 denominator is 2e-9. \n\nSo 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. That's correct. \n\n\u03c42 =1e-8 s:\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) \u2192 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-8 is (6.582/2)*1e-8. Wait, no: 1e-16 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-8. Wait, let me compute:\n\n6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * (1e-16 / 1e-8) ) \n\n= 3.291 * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV. \n\nYes, so the sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV. \n\nSo the required energy difference must be larger than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 (which is 0.00000036 eV). So that would work. \n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 3.6e-7, so that's not enough. \n\nWait, but the options don't have 3.6e-7. So the closest is option C, which is way larger. But the question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". So any energy difference larger than the required would work. So the possible answers are C and maybe another? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait the options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, the required is ~3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7 (since 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036, 1e-4 is 0.0001). So 0.0001 is bigger than 0.00000036. So that's okay. \n\nThe other options are smaller. So the only option that's bigger than the required is option C. \n\nWait but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the approach again. \n\nAlternative approach: the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of either state. For instance, if one state has a much larger uncertainty than the other, then you need to overcome the larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the two lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. The longer lifetime (\u03c4=1e-8 s) corresponds to a smaller energy uncertainty. Wait, because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u03c4. So the state with the shorter lifetime (\u03c4=1e-9 s) has a larger \u0394E. \n\nWait, so the uncertainty for \u03c41 (1e-9) is 3.29e-7 eV, and \u03c42 (1e-8) is 3.29e-8 eV. So the dominant uncertainty is from \u03c41. \n\nTherefore, if the energy difference is greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, that would suffice. Because if the energy difference is larger than the bigger uncertainty, then even considering the spread of the states, they can be distinguished. \n\nWait, maybe that's another way to think. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the energy levels are E1 and E2. The first has an uncertainty \u0394E1 = 3.29e-7 eV, the second has \u0394E2 = 3.29e-8 eV. \n\nThe separation between the two must be more than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nAlternatively, if one has a much larger uncertainty than the other, the main contribution is the larger one. \n\nWait, but the sum is 3.6e-7, so the energy difference must be larger than that. \n\nSo, the required energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C (1e-4 eV). The others are smaller. \n\nSo the answer should be option C. \n\nWait but let me think again. Let me check with the actual numbers. \n\nWait, let me compute the required \u0394E again using a different approach. \n\nThe uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t ~ h/(2\u03c0). \n\nSo for each state, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately h/(2\u03c0\u0394t). \n\nSo h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nSo for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s: \n\n\u0394E1 = 6.626e-34 / (2\u03c0 * 1e-9) \n\nBut converting to eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so dividing by that:\n\n\u0394E1 (in eV) = (6.626e-34 / 1.6e-19) / (2\u03c0 *1e-9) \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, compute 6.626e-34 / 1.6e-19 = (6.626 / 1.6) * 1e-15 \u2248 4.141 * 1e-15 = 4.141e-15 J\u00b7s per eV? Wait, no, sorry, perhaps better to compute all together. \n\nWait, \u0394E (in eV) = (h / (2\u03c0 \u03c4)) / (eV conversion factor). \n\nWait, let me think of it as:\n\nThe energy uncertainty in Joules is \u0394E_J = h/(2\u03c0\u03c4), so to get eV, divide by the charge of an electron (in J\u00b7s/(eV))?\n\nWait, actually, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert \u0394E_J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo:\n\n\u0394E1 (eV) = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2\u03c0 * 1e-9 s) ) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \n\nCalculating numerator first: 6.626e-34 / (2\u03c0 *1e-9) = 6.626e-34 / 6.283e-9 \u2248 1.054e-25 J. \n\nThen divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV: \n\n1.054e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nWait, so that's different from before? Wait, because previously I used \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) so that's why. Let me see. \n\nWait, in my first calculation, I used \u0127 \u2248 1.054e-34 J\u00b7s, so when I used \u0127/(2\u03c4), that would be (1.054e-34)/(2*1e-9) = 5.27e-26 J. Then converting to eV by dividing by 1.6e-19 gives 5.27e-26 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 3.29e-7 eV, which matches the first result. \n\nBut in this second way, using h/(2\u03c0*tau) divided by eV conversion, gives 6.58e-7 eV? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nLet me recompute:\n\n\u0394E_J (for \u03c41) = h/(2\u03c0\u03c4) = (6.626e-34) / (2 * \u03c0 * 1e-9) \n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * \u03c0 * 1e-9 \u2248 6.283e-9. \n\nSo numerator / denominator = 6.626e-34 / 6.283e-9 \u2248 (6.626 /6.283)*1e-25 \u2248 1.054 * 1e-25 \u2248 1.054e-25 J. \n\nThen converting to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV:\n\n1.054e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 (1.054 / 1.602) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.658 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nWait, so here I get 6.58e-7 eV, but in the first calculation with \u0127/(2\u03c4) I had 3.29e-7. \n\nAh, because in the first approach I used \u0127/(2\u03c4), which is h/(2\u03c0)/(2\u03c4) \u2192 h/(4\u03c0\u03c4), but here I used h/(2\u03c0\u03c4). \n\nAh, so the discrepancy comes from whether the uncertainty is \u0394E ~ \u0127/(\u03c4) or \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nWait, the uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/(2). So the minimal uncertainty would be when \u0394E \u0394t = \u0127/(2). So \u0394E = \u0127/(2\u0394t). \n\nTherefore, the first approach was correct. \n\nSo in that case, the first calculation where \u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV is correct. \n\nThe second approach miscalculation was because I used h/(2\u03c0 \u03c4) instead of \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nSo the correct calculation gives \u0394E1 ~ 3.29e-7 eV. \n\nTherefore, the sum with \u0394E2 (3.29e-8) is 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nThus, the energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C: 1e-4 eV. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the lifetime is the inverse of the energy uncertainty. Like, \u03c4 = \u0394t = 1/\u0394E? \n\nWait, if \u03c4 is the lifetime, then the uncertainty in time is \u03c4. So according to \u0394E * \u03c4 \u2265 \u0127/(2). \n\nThus, \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nTherefore, the minimum energy difference needed is the sum of each's uncertainty. \n\nSo the energy difference must be bigger than the sum. \n\nSo the required is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nSo options:\n\nA: 1e-9 is 1e-9, which is way smaller. \n\nB: 1e-11 even worse. \n\nC: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. \n\n3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. \n\nYes, 1e-4 is much larger. \n\nThus, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because 1e-4 eV is a pretty large energy difference. But in atomic scales, maybe that's reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum. \n\n\u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV. \n\n\u0394E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. \n\nAdding them: \n\n3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nSo the minimal required is ~3.6e-7. \n\nSo the options given are:\n\nC is 1e-4 eV (which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 vs 3.6e-7. \n\nSince 1e-4 is 1e3 times bigger than 3.6e-7, so that's okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see another way. \n\nSuppose the energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty in each is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of uncertainties. \n\nSuppose the energy difference is \u0394E. Then, if \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two states can be distinguished. \n\nSo in this case, since the required sum is ~3.6e-7, any \u0394E larger than that is okay. \n\nLooking at the options, only option C is bigger. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

Wait, but let me think again.\n\nSuppose each state has an uncertainty in energy. For E1, its energy is E1 \u00b1 \u0394E1, and similarly E2 is E2 \u00b1 \u0394E2. To resolve the two, the separation between the two must be more than the sum of their uncertainties. So the minimal required separation is \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nSo the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than that. \n\nTherefore, let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. Let's compute each using \u0127/(2\u03c4) as the minimum uncertainty. \n\nBut I need to get the numerical value here. Since the options are given in eV, I need to compute \u0394E in eV. Let me see:\n\nFirst, \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. Let's convert that to eV\u00b7s. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is (1.0545718e-34)/(1.602e-19) \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo, for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) \u2248 (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.291e-7 eV. \n\nSimilarly, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s, so \u0394E2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV. \n\nAdding these two uncertainties: 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 \u2248 3.291e-7 + 0.3291e-7 = 3.62e-7 eV. \n\nSo the total required energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 way too small, since 1e-9 is much less than 3.6e-7. \n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller. \n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. The required is ~3.6e-7, which is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is much bigger, so that would work. \n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. Because 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is less than 0.00000036. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up the exponents. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 again. \n\nFor \u03c41 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 = (6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) \u2192 denominator is 2e-9. \n\nSo 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV. That's correct. \n\n\u03c42 =1e-8 s:\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) \u2192 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-8 is (6.582/2)*1e-8. Wait, no: 1e-16 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-8. Wait, let me compute:\n\n6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * (1e-16 / 1e-8) ) \n\n= 3.291 * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV. \n\nYes, so the sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = 3.62e-7 eV. \n\nSo the required energy difference must be larger than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 (which is 0.00000036 eV). So that would work. \n\nOption D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 3.6e-7, so that's not enough. \n\nWait, but the options don't have 3.6e-7. So the closest is option C, which is way larger. But the question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". So any energy difference larger than the required would work. So the possible answers are C and maybe another? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait the options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, the required is ~3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7 (since 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036, 1e-4 is 0.0001). So 0.0001 is bigger than 0.00000036. So that's okay. \n\nThe other options are smaller. So the only option that's bigger than the required is option C. \n\nWait but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the approach again. \n\nAlternative approach: the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of either state. For instance, if one state has a much larger uncertainty than the other, then you need to overcome the larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the two lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. The longer lifetime (\u03c4=1e-8 s) corresponds to a smaller energy uncertainty. Wait, because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u03c4. So the state with the shorter lifetime (\u03c4=1e-9 s) has a larger \u0394E. \n\nWait, so the uncertainty for \u03c41 (1e-9) is 3.29e-7 eV, and \u03c42 (1e-8) is 3.29e-8 eV. So the dominant uncertainty is from \u03c41. \n\nTherefore, if the energy difference is greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, that would suffice. Because if the energy difference is larger than the bigger uncertainty, then even considering the spread of the states, they can be distinguished. \n\nWait, maybe that's another way to think. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the energy levels are E1 and E2. The first has an uncertainty \u0394E1 = 3.29e-7 eV, the second has \u0394E2 = 3.29e-8 eV. \n\nThe separation between the two must be more than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nAlternatively, if one has a much larger uncertainty than the other, the main contribution is the larger one. \n\nWait, but the sum is 3.6e-7, so the energy difference must be larger than that. \n\nSo, the required energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C (1e-4 eV). The others are smaller. \n\nSo the answer should be option C. \n\nWait but let me think again. Let me check with the actual numbers. \n\nWait, let me compute the required \u0394E again using a different approach. \n\nThe uncertainty principle is \u0394E * \u0394t ~ h/(2\u03c0). \n\nSo for each state, the energy uncertainty \u0394E is approximately h/(2\u03c0\u0394t). \n\nSo h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nSo for \u03c41 = 1e-9 s: \n\n\u0394E1 = 6.626e-34 / (2\u03c0 * 1e-9) \n\nBut converting to eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so dividing by that:\n\n\u0394E1 (in eV) = (6.626e-34 / 1.6e-19) / (2\u03c0 *1e-9) \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, compute 6.626e-34 / 1.6e-19 = (6.626 / 1.6) * 1e-15 \u2248 4.141 * 1e-15 = 4.141e-15 J\u00b7s per eV? Wait, no, sorry, perhaps better to compute all together. \n\nWait, \u0394E (in eV) = (h / (2\u03c0 \u03c4)) / (eV conversion factor). \n\nWait, let me think of it as:\n\nThe energy uncertainty in Joules is \u0394E_J = h/(2\u03c0\u03c4), so to get eV, divide by the charge of an electron (in J\u00b7s/(eV))?\n\nWait, actually, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert \u0394E_J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.\n\nSo:\n\n\u0394E1 (eV) = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2\u03c0 * 1e-9 s) ) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \n\nCalculating numerator first: 6.626e-34 / (2\u03c0 *1e-9) = 6.626e-34 / 6.283e-9 \u2248 1.054e-25 J. \n\nThen divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV: \n\n1.054e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nWait, so that's different from before? Wait, because previously I used \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) so that's why. Let me see. \n\nWait, in my first calculation, I used \u0127 \u2248 1.054e-34 J\u00b7s, so when I used \u0127/(2\u03c4), that would be (1.054e-34)/(2*1e-9) = 5.27e-26 J. Then converting to eV by dividing by 1.6e-19 gives 5.27e-26 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 3.29e-7 eV, which matches the first result. \n\nBut in this second way, using h/(2\u03c0*tau) divided by eV conversion, gives 6.58e-7 eV? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nLet me recompute:\n\n\u0394E_J (for \u03c41) = h/(2\u03c0\u03c4) = (6.626e-34) / (2 * \u03c0 * 1e-9) \n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 * \u03c0 * 1e-9 \u2248 6.283e-9. \n\nSo numerator / denominator = 6.626e-34 / 6.283e-9 \u2248 (6.626 /6.283)*1e-25 \u2248 1.054 * 1e-25 \u2248 1.054e-25 J. \n\nThen converting to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV:\n\n1.054e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 (1.054 / 1.602) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.658 * 1e-6 \u2248 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nWait, so here I get 6.58e-7 eV, but in the first calculation with \u0127/(2\u03c4) I had 3.29e-7. \n\nAh, because in the first approach I used \u0127/(2\u03c4), which is h/(2\u03c0)/(2\u03c4) \u2192 h/(4\u03c0\u03c4), but here I used h/(2\u03c0\u03c4). \n\nAh, so the discrepancy comes from whether the uncertainty is \u0394E ~ \u0127/(\u03c4) or \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nWait, the uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/(2). So the minimal uncertainty would be when \u0394E \u0394t = \u0127/(2). So \u0394E = \u0127/(2\u0394t). \n\nTherefore, the first approach was correct. \n\nSo in that case, the first calculation where \u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV is correct. \n\nThe second approach miscalculation was because I used h/(2\u03c0 \u03c4) instead of \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nSo the correct calculation gives \u0394E1 ~ 3.29e-7 eV. \n\nTherefore, the sum with \u0394E2 (3.29e-8) is 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nThus, the energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is option C: 1e-4 eV. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the lifetime is the inverse of the energy uncertainty. Like, \u03c4 = \u0394t = 1/\u0394E? \n\nWait, if \u03c4 is the lifetime, then the uncertainty in time is \u03c4. So according to \u0394E * \u03c4 \u2265 \u0127/(2). \n\nThus, \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(2\u03c4). \n\nTherefore, the minimum energy difference needed is the sum of each's uncertainty. \n\nSo the energy difference must be bigger than the sum. \n\nSo the required is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nSo options:\n\nA: 1e-9 is 1e-9, which is way smaller. \n\nB: 1e-11 even worse. \n\nC: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. \n\n3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. \n\nYes, 1e-4 is much larger. \n\nThus, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because 1e-4 eV is a pretty large energy difference. But in atomic scales, maybe that's reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum. \n\n\u0394E1 is 3.29e-7 eV. \n\n\u0394E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. \n\nAdding them: \n\n3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nSo the minimal required is ~3.6e-7. \n\nSo the options given are:\n\nC is 1e-4 eV (which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 vs 3.6e-7. \n\nSince 1e-4 is 1e3 times bigger than 3.6e-7, so that's okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see another way. \n\nSuppose the energy levels are E1 and E2. The uncertainty in each is \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of uncertainties. \n\nSuppose the energy difference is \u0394E. Then, if \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, then the two states can be distinguished. \n\nSo in this case, since the required sum is ~3.6e-7, any \u0394E larger than that is okay. \n\nLooking at the options, only option C is bigger. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \\(10^{-9}\\) sec and \\(10^{-8}\\) sec, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle: \\(\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\hbar/2\\). The energy uncertainty for each state is \\(\\Delta E \\approx \\hbar/(2\\tau)\\). \n\nCalculations:\n- For \\(\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\\) sec:  \n  \\(\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot 10^{-9}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{eV}\\).\n- For \\(\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\\) sec:  \n  \\(\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot 10^{-8}} \\approx 3.29 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{eV}\\).\n\nThe total uncertainty to overcome is \\(\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2 = 3.62 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{eV}\\). The energy difference must exceed this value. Among the options, only **C) \\(10^{-4}\\ \\text{eV}\\)** is significantly larger than \\(3.62 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{eV}\\), ensuring distinguishability.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about distinguishing two quantum states based on their energy difference and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle here. The uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t), right? The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use the approximate form \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t?\n\nWait, the question says we need to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between them (\u0394E) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states would be blurred together because of the uncertainty. So the key idea is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is related to the lifetime of the states.\n\nThe lifetime given here is the time each state exists. Since the states have different lifetimes, maybe we need to consider the larger of the two lifetimes? Or perhaps the minimum uncertainty from both? Let me think. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be inversely proportional to their respective lifetimes. So for the first state, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1), and similarly for the second, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t2). But since we want to distinguish between the two, the energy difference between them (E2 - E1) should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe just larger than the larger uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total uncertainty is the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me see. Suppose the two states have different lifetimes. The one with the shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 sec) would have a larger uncertainty in energy. Because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u0394t. So if the lifetime is shorter, the energy uncertainty is bigger. So the first state (lifetime 1e-9 s) has a larger \u0394E uncertainty than the second (1e-8 s, so longer lifetime, smaller \u0394E). So the bigger uncertainty comes from the first state. So the minimum required energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this largest uncertainty (from the first state's \u0394E).\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than \u0127/(\u0394t1). Let me compute the numerical value here. Let's recall that \u0127 is approximately 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But maybe it's easier to use some standard approximation here. The energy uncertainty in eV can be estimated using the relation between eV and seconds. Wait, perhaps there's a standard formula for energy uncertainty in terms of inverse time?\n\nAlternatively, I might need to remember that the energy uncertainty \u0394E is about h/(2\u03c0\u0394t), so \u0394E \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u0394t). Since h is Planck's constant (~6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), so h/(2\u03c0) is \u0127. Let's see.\n\nLet me calculate for the first state with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 seconds:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t1. Let's compute this in eV. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should recall that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules. So first compute \u0394E in joules and then convert to eV.\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute \u0394E1 (from the first state's lifetime):\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert that to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV. So 1.05457e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 \u2248 ~0.658 * 1e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for the second state with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s, the uncertainty is \u0394E2 = \u0127/(1e-8) = 1.05457e-34/(1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05457e-26 /1.6e-19 \u2248 ~6.58e-8 eV, so about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the two uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV. The larger of these is the first one (6.58e-7 eV). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than that value (the larger uncertainty) to be distinguishable.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 6.58e-7 \u2192 no, that's too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, worse.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is way bigger than 6.5e-7, so that's okay. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, and 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065, so 1e-4 is larger, so that would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.5e-7 (0.00000065). So D is smaller than the required uncertainty. So the correct answer must be C?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The energy difference has to be greater than the uncertainty. The uncertainty here is about 6.6e-7 eV (from the first state's lifetime). So the energy difference must be larger than that. The options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is way bigger than 10^-6.6 (since 6.6e-7 is ~1e-6.19). So 1e-4 is definitely bigger. So C would work. But let me check the other options again.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8.\n\nHmm, so 1e-8 is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 1e-7, so 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 10^-7, which is larger than 1e-8). So D's energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than the uncertainty. So that's not enough. The required minimum is ~6.6e-7 eV. So the answer should be C, because 1e-4 is bigger. But wait, the options might have a better fit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the uncertainty. Let me do the math again.\n\nFirst, for the first state with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2248 6.24e18 eV. Therefore, 1.05e-25 J * 6.24e18 eV/J = 1.05 *6.24e-7 \u2248 6.55e-7 eV. So that's correct.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than about 6.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, which one is bigger than that?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 (which is ~10^-6.2). So yes, that's good.\n\nWait, but the options have D as 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 10^-8, which is even smaller than the required 1e-6. So that's not. Then why is option C the answer?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nC) 1e-4 eV is way bigger, so that would work. But perhaps I made a mistake in considering which lifetime to use. The question says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\".\n\nWait, but perhaps the total uncertainty is the sum of both uncertainties? Let's think again. The two states each have their own energy uncertainties. The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Like sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 )? Or maybe just the maximum?\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach is that to resolve two energy levels, their separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because each has an uncertainty, so the total uncertainty between them would be the sum. Let me think. Suppose one state has an uncertainty of \u0394E1 and the other \u0394E2, then the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. But perhaps for simplicity, they just take the sum of the two uncertainties. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Let's compute that. The two uncertainties are 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV. So the sum would be approximately 7.23e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. Then the required minimum is around 7e-7 eV. So the options are:\n\nLooking at the options, the next possible is C (1e-4 eV) which is way larger. But maybe I'm missing a better option here. Wait, the options given are A through D. Let me check again the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy uncertainty. Let me check again. Let me think in terms of the formula \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. But sometimes the uncertainty is written as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t), but maybe the exact coefficient doesn't matter here because we are looking for an order of magnitude.\n\nSo using \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Let me see:\n\nFor the first state (\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1eV = 1.6e-19 J \u2192 1 J = 6.24e18 eV. So 1.05e-25 J * 6.24e18 eV/J \u2248 6.55e-7 eV.\n\nSecond state (\u0394t2 = 1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 1.05e-34 /1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 1.05e-26 *6.24e18 \u2248 6.55e-8 eV.\n\nSo the two uncertainties are 6.55e-7 and 6.55e-8. The maximum is 6.55e-7. So the energy difference must be greater than this maximum value. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that, then the uncertainties would overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nTherefore, the minimal required energy difference is ~6.6e-7 eV. Now looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV (1e-4 = 1 x 10^-4 eV). 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 (which is 0.00000066 eV). So yes, that's way bigger. So option C would work.\n\nWait, but the options also have D as 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 6.6e-7. So D is too small. Option B is even smaller. Option A is 1e-9, which is even worse. So the correct answer must be C?\n\nWait, but the answer options don't have an option between 1e-7 and 1e-6? Let me check the options again. The options given are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8. Wait, so the closest is C. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference must be larger than the inverse of the sum of the lifetimes or something else? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime? Because the shorter lifetime has the larger uncertainty. So the energy difference must be bigger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. So yes, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle where \u0394E \u0394t ~ h, so \u0394E ~ h / \u0394t. But even if using h instead of \u0127, the difference would be a factor of 2\u03c0, which is about 6.28. So even if I use h, the value would be 6.6e-7 * 2\u03c0 \u2248 ~4.1e-6 eV. Wait, but that's different. Wait, let me recalculate using h instead of \u0127.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong in the formula. Let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t ~ \u0127, so \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. So the calculation I did before is correct. So the first uncertainty is indeed ~6.6e-7 eV.\n\nHmm, so then the answer is C. But why is option C 1e-4? That's four orders of magnitude higher. But maybe the question is looking for the closest option that is larger than the required value. So 1e-4 is the only one bigger than 6.6e-7. The next one is D:1e-8 which is smaller. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the first calculation:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2192 1eV is 1.6e-19 J. So:\n\n1.05e-25 J / (1.6e-19 J/eV) = (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-6 eV \u2248 0.656 * 1e-6 eV = 6.56e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 6.56e-7 eV is 6.56 \u00d7 10^-7 eV, which is 6.56e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than that. Looking at the options:\n\nC is 1e-4 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-4 eV. Which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 1e-7. So that's way bigger. So that would work. So the answer is C. But let me see if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula \u0394E = h / (\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant. Let me try that. Then:\n\n\u0394E1 = h/(\u0394t1) = 6.626e-34 / 1e-9 = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 in eV, that's 6.626e-25 /1.6e-19 \u2248 4.14e-6 eV. Then that's 4.14e-6 eV. Then the required \u0394E would have to be larger than that. So in that case, the required \u0394E is ~4e-6 eV. Then looking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4 eV). So even if I use h instead of \u0127, the answer is still C.\n\nSo regardless of whether the formula uses \u0127 or h, the correct answer is C. So the options given must have C as the answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have something like 1e-6 or 1e-5. But given the options, C is the only one that's bigger than the required ~6.6e-7 eV. So the answer must be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about distinguishing two quantum states based on their energy difference and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle here. The uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t), right? The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use the approximate form \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t?\n\nWait, the question says we need to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference between them (\u0394E) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states would be blurred together because of the uncertainty. So the key idea is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is related to the lifetime of the states.\n\nThe lifetime given here is the time each state exists. Since the states have different lifetimes, maybe we need to consider the larger of the two lifetimes? Or perhaps the minimum uncertainty from both? Let me think. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be inversely proportional to their respective lifetimes. So for the first state, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1), and similarly for the second, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t2). But since we want to distinguish between the two, the energy difference between them (E2 - E1) should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe just larger than the larger uncertainty?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total uncertainty is the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me see. Suppose the two states have different lifetimes. The one with the shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 sec) would have a larger uncertainty in energy. Because \u0394E is inversely proportional to \u0394t. So if the lifetime is shorter, the energy uncertainty is bigger. So the first state (lifetime 1e-9 s) has a larger \u0394E uncertainty than the second (1e-8 s, so longer lifetime, smaller \u0394E). So the bigger uncertainty comes from the first state. So the minimum required energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this largest uncertainty (from the first state's \u0394E).\n\nSo the energy difference \u0394E must be greater than \u0127/(\u0394t1). Let me compute the numerical value here. Let's recall that \u0127 is approximately 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But maybe it's easier to use some standard approximation here. The energy uncertainty in eV can be estimated using the relation between eV and seconds. Wait, perhaps there's a standard formula for energy uncertainty in terms of inverse time?\n\nAlternatively, I might need to remember that the energy uncertainty \u0394E is about h/(2\u03c0\u0394t), so \u0394E \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u0394t). Since h is Planck's constant (~6.626e-34 J\u00b7s), so h/(2\u03c0) is \u0127. Let's see.\n\nLet me calculate for the first state with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 seconds:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t1. Let's compute this in eV. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should recall that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 joules. So first compute \u0394E in joules and then convert to eV.\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute \u0394E1 (from the first state's lifetime):\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. So \u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = (1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert that to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV. So 1.05457e-25 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 \u2248 ~0.658 * 1e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for the second state with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s, the uncertainty is \u0394E2 = \u0127/(1e-8) = 1.05457e-34/(1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05457e-26 /1.6e-19 \u2248 ~6.58e-8 eV, so about 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the two uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV. The larger of these is the first one (6.58e-7 eV). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than that value (the larger uncertainty) to be distinguishable.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 6.58e-7 \u2192 no, that's too small.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 even smaller, worse.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 1e-4 is way bigger than 6.5e-7, so that's okay. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, and 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065, so 1e-4 is larger, so that would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.5e-7 (0.00000065). So D is smaller than the required uncertainty. So the correct answer must be C?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The energy difference has to be greater than the uncertainty. The uncertainty here is about 6.6e-7 eV (from the first state's lifetime). So the energy difference must be larger than that. The options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is way bigger than 10^-6.6 (since 6.6e-7 is ~1e-6.19). So 1e-4 is definitely bigger. So C would work. But let me check the other options again.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8.\n\nHmm, so 1e-8 is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 1e-7, so 6.58e-7 is 6.58 * 10^-7, which is larger than 1e-8). So D's energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than the uncertainty. So that's not enough. The required minimum is ~6.6e-7 eV. So the answer should be C, because 1e-4 is bigger. But wait, the options might have a better fit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the uncertainty. Let me do the math again.\n\nFirst, for the first state with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2248 6.24e18 eV. Therefore, 1.05e-25 J * 6.24e18 eV/J = 1.05 *6.24e-7 \u2248 6.55e-7 eV. So that's correct.\n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than about 6.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options, which one is bigger than that?\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 (which is ~10^-6.2). So yes, that's good.\n\nWait, but the options have D as 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 10^-8, which is even smaller than the required 1e-6. So that's not. Then why is option C the answer?\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nC) 1e-4 eV is way bigger, so that would work. But perhaps I made a mistake in considering which lifetime to use. The question says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\".\n\nWait, but perhaps the total uncertainty is the sum of both uncertainties? Let's think again. The two states each have their own energy uncertainties. The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Like sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 )? Or maybe just the maximum?\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach is that to resolve two energy levels, their separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because each has an uncertainty, so the total uncertainty between them would be the sum. Let me think. Suppose one state has an uncertainty of \u0394E1 and the other \u0394E2, then the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. But perhaps for simplicity, they just take the sum of the two uncertainties. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Let's compute that. The two uncertainties are 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV. So the sum would be approximately 7.23e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. Then the required minimum is around 7e-7 eV. So the options are:\n\nLooking at the options, the next possible is C (1e-4 eV) which is way larger. But maybe I'm missing a better option here. Wait, the options given are A through D. Let me check again the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy uncertainty. Let me check again. Let me think in terms of the formula \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. But sometimes the uncertainty is written as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t), but maybe the exact coefficient doesn't matter here because we are looking for an order of magnitude.\n\nSo using \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Let me see:\n\nFor the first state (\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1eV = 1.6e-19 J \u2192 1 J = 6.24e18 eV. So 1.05e-25 J * 6.24e18 eV/J \u2248 6.55e-7 eV.\n\nSecond state (\u0394t2 = 1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 1.05e-34 /1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 1.05e-26 *6.24e18 \u2248 6.55e-8 eV.\n\nSo the two uncertainties are 6.55e-7 and 6.55e-8. The maximum is 6.55e-7. So the energy difference must be greater than this maximum value. Because if the energy difference is smaller than that, then the uncertainties would overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nTherefore, the minimal required energy difference is ~6.6e-7 eV. Now looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1e-4 eV (1e-4 = 1 x 10^-4 eV). 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 (which is 0.00000066 eV). So yes, that's way bigger. So option C would work.\n\nWait, but the options also have D as 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than the required 6.6e-7. So D is too small. Option B is even smaller. Option A is 1e-9, which is even worse. So the correct answer must be C?\n\nWait, but the answer options don't have an option between 1e-7 and 1e-6? Let me check the options again. The options given are A:1e-9, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8. Wait, so the closest is C. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference must be larger than the inverse of the sum of the lifetimes or something else? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime? Because the shorter lifetime has the larger uncertainty. So the energy difference must be bigger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. So yes, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle where \u0394E \u0394t ~ h, so \u0394E ~ h / \u0394t. But even if using h instead of \u0127, the difference would be a factor of 2\u03c0, which is about 6.28. So even if I use h, the value would be 6.6e-7 * 2\u03c0 \u2248 ~4.1e-6 eV. Wait, but that's different. Wait, let me recalculate using h instead of \u0127.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong in the formula. Let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle is \u0394E \u0394t ~ \u0127, so \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. So the calculation I did before is correct. So the first uncertainty is indeed ~6.6e-7 eV.\n\nHmm, so then the answer is C. But why is option C 1e-4? That's four orders of magnitude higher. But maybe the question is looking for the closest option that is larger than the required value. So 1e-4 is the only one bigger than 6.6e-7. The next one is D:1e-8 which is smaller. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the first calculation:\n\n\u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV \u2192 1eV is 1.6e-19 J. So:\n\n1.05e-25 J / (1.6e-19 J/eV) = (1.05 / 1.6) * 1e-6 eV \u2248 0.656 * 1e-6 eV = 6.56e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 6.56e-7 eV is 6.56 \u00d7 10^-7 eV, which is 6.56e-7. So the energy difference must be larger than that. Looking at the options:\n\nC is 1e-4 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-4 eV. Which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 1e-7. So that's way bigger. So that would work. So the answer is C. But let me see if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula \u0394E = h / (\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant. Let me try that. Then:\n\n\u0394E1 = h/(\u0394t1) = 6.626e-34 / 1e-9 = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 in eV, that's 6.626e-25 /1.6e-19 \u2248 4.14e-6 eV. Then that's 4.14e-6 eV. Then the required \u0394E would have to be larger than that. So in that case, the required \u0394E is ~4e-6 eV. Then looking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4 eV). So even if I use h instead of \u0127, the answer is still C.\n\nSo regardless of whether the formula uses \u0127 or h, the correct answer is C. So the options given must have C as the answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have something like 1e-6 or 1e-5. But given the options, C is the only one that's bigger than the required ~6.6e-7 eV. So the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \\(10^{-9}\\) sec and \\(10^{-8}\\) sec, their energy difference must exceed the energy uncertainty associated with the shorter lifetime (since shorter lifetimes correspond to larger uncertainties).
