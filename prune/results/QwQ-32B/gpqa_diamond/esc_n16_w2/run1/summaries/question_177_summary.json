      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about the luminosities of two stars. Let's see what it's asking. The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. They both have the same peak wavelength, which probably means their temperatures are the same because of Wien's Law. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s, but I'm not sure how that plays into it. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 or so. \n\nHmm, first, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature through the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, right? So luminosity depends on the surface area (which is proportional to radius squared) and the fourth power of the temperature. \n\nThe problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. If their peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be equal. So T1 = T2. \n\nWait, so if temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio would be (R1\u00b2 / R2\u00b2) * (T1\u2074 / T2\u2074). But since T1 = T2, that part cancels out, so the ratio is just (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 times R2, that ratio squared would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest answer A, 2.25? But wait, the options have A as 2.25 and others like B 2.32, etc. Hmm, but the problem mentions mass. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times Star_2. But if they're using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass doesn't directly affect luminosity unless maybe through some other relation?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, so the Stefan-Boltzmann law should be sufficient. But why is mass mentioned then? Maybe there's another factor here. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the radial velocities. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that come into play?\n\nHmm, radial velocity relates to the Doppler effect, which might affect the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found them to be the same. So maybe the actual peak wavelength is adjusted by the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed peak would be longer. But since the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, perhaps the actual temperatures are different, and the Doppler shift accounts for that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The Doppler shift formula would adjust the observed wavelength. The peak wavelength observed would be \u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * sqrt((c + v)/(c - v)), but maybe for small velocities compared to c, it's approximately \u03bb_observed \u2248 \u03bb_emitted*(1 + v/c). Wait, but 700 km/s is like 0.0023c (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So maybe the difference is small. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed peak wavelength is the same for both. But according to Wien's law, the emitted peak wavelength is proportional to 1/T. So if their observed peaks are the same, then (\u03bb1_emitted)*(1 + v1/c) = (\u03bb2_emitted)*(1 + v2/c). Since v1 is 0 and v2 is 700 km/s, then \u03bb1_emitted = \u03bb2_emitted*(1 + v2/c)/(1 + v1/c). Since v1 is zero, denominator is 1. So \u03bb1_emitted = \u03bb2_emitted*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut since \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature, then T is inversely proportional to \u03bb_max. So T1 / T2 = (\u03bb2_emitted / \u03bb1_emitted) * (1 + v2/c). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write equations properly. \n\nLet me denote the observed peak wavelength as \u03bb_obs. For Star_1, since its velocity is 0, the observed peak is the same as the emitted peak. So \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_emitted. For Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, so the observed peak is redshifted. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emitted * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) ) for radial velocity v away from the observer. But since v << c, we can approximate this as \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_emitted*(1 + v/c). \n\nSince the observed peaks are the same, \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs. Therefore, \u03bb1_emitted = \u03bb2_emitted*(1 + v2/c). \n\nBut the temperatures are related via Wien's law: \u03bb_emitted = b / T. So substituting:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)\n\nSolving for T1:\n\nT1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )\n\nWait, but this would mean that the actual temperature of Star_1 is less than that of Star_2? Because if v2 is positive (moving away), then (1 + v/c) is greater than 1, so T1 is T2 divided by something bigger, so T1 < T2. But the problem says the astronomers found the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed peaks are same, but their actual temperatures differ because of the Doppler shift. Therefore, the actual temperatures are different. So I can't assume T1 = T2. \n\nHmm, so this complicates things. So the initial thought that T is the same is wrong. Because the observed peak is same, but the actual temperatures are different. Therefore, I need to account for that. \n\nSo first, let's compute the Doppler shift for Star_2. Let me compute the factor (1 + v/c). v is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. So the observed wavelength of Star_2 is \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_emitted * 1.002333. \n\nBut the observed wavelengths are the same, so \u03bb1_emitted = \u03bb2_emitted * 1.002333. \n\nFrom Wien's law, \u03bb_emitted is b / T. So \u03bb1_emitted = b / T1, \u03bb2_emitted = b / T2. \n\nSetting \u03bb1_emitted = (\u03bb2_emitted) * 1.002333 gives (b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.002333. \n\nCancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333 \u2192 T1 = T2 / 1.002333 \u2248 T2 * 0.997666. \n\nSo T1 is approximately 0.997666 times T2. \n\nNow, luminosity L is proportional to R\u00b2 T^4. \n\nSo the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). \n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R ratio squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe temperature ratio (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997666)^4. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.997666 is approximately 1 - 0.002334. Let's compute (1 - x)^4 where x =0.002334. \n\nApproximate using binomial expansion: (1 - x)^4 \u2248 1 -4x +6x\u00b2 -4x\u00b3 +x^4. Since x is small (0.0023), higher terms can be neglected. \n\nSo 1 -4*(0.002334) = 1 -0.009336 \u2248 0.990664. Then 6x\u00b2 is 6*(0.002334)^2 \u2248 6*(0.00000545) \u2248 0.0000327, so adding that gives 0.990664 +0.0000327 \u2248 0.9906967. The other terms are negligible. So approximately 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, the temperature term is ~0.9907. \n\nThus, the total ratio L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907. \n\nCalculating that: 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 *0.0007 is 0.001575, so total \u2248 2.2275 + (0.9907-0.99)*2.25? Wait, maybe better to just do 2.25 * 0.9907. \n\nLet me compute 2.25 * 0.9907:\n\nFirst, 2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814, and 0.25 *0.9907 = 0.247675. Adding them gives 1.9814 +0.247675 = 2.229075. So approximately 2.229. \n\nHmm, so about 2.23. Looking at the options, D is ~2.23. \n\nWait, but I approximated (1 - 0.002334)^4 as ~0.9907. Let me check with a calculator approach. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute (0.997666)^4:\n\nTake natural log: ln(0.997666) \u2248 -0.002337 (since ln(1-x) \u2248 -x for small x). So ln(0.997666)^4 = 4*(-0.002337) \u2248 -0.009348. Exponentiate: e^-0.009348 \u2248 1 -0.009348 + (0.009348)^2/2. Let's see:\n\n1 -0.009348 = 0.990652. The next term is (0.009348)^2 /2 \u2248 (0.0000873) /2 \u2248 0.0000436. So total \u2248 0.990652 +0.0000436 \u2248 0.990695. So same as before. \n\nSo the temperature ratio to the 4th power is ~0.9907. \n\nThus, the total ratio is 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229. So approximately 2.23. So the answer would be D. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the mass is also 1.5 times. But in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass isn't directly involved. So maybe mass is a red herring here? The question states that the mass is larger by the same factor, but unless there's another factor involving mass, like maybe luminosity vs. mass-luminosity relation? But the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't needed here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radial velocity affects something else? Wait, but the key was that the observed peak is the same, so we had to adjust the temperatures. So the mass is irrelevant here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, 2.23. Let me check the options again. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So D matches the calculation. \n\nSo the initial thought of 2.25 was wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift affecting the temperature. Once you factor in the velocity difference, the temperature of Star1 is slightly lower than Star2, reducing the luminosity ratio from 2.25 to ~2.23. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n",

So 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333. So the observed wavelength of Star_2 is \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_emitted * 1.002333. \n\nBut the observed wavelengths are the same, so \u03bb1_emitted = \u03bb2_emitted * 1.002333. \n\nFrom Wien's law, \u03bb_emitted is b / T. So \u03bb1_emitted = b / T1, \u03bb2_emitted = b / T2. \n\nSetting \u03bb1_emitted = (\u03bb2_emitted) * 1.002333 gives (b / T1) = (b / T2) * 1.002333. \n\nCancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333 \u2192 T1 = T2 / 1.002333 \u2248 T2 * 0.997666. \n\nSo T1 is approximately 0.997666 times T2. \n\nNow, luminosity L is proportional to R\u00b2 T^4. \n\nSo the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). \n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R ratio squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. \n\nThe temperature ratio (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997666)^4.

Then 6x\u00b2 is 6*(0.002334)^2 \u2248 6*(0.00000545) \u2248 0.0000327, so adding that gives 0.990664 +0.0000327 \u2248 0.9906967. The other terms are negligible.

Using the Doppler shift approximation:  \n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} \\approx \\lambda_{\\text{emitted,2}} \\cdot (1 + v/c)\n\\]  \nEquating observed peaks:  \n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{emitted,1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted,2}} \\cdot (1 + v/c)\n\\]  \nBy Wien's law (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} \\propto 1/T\\)):  \n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{emitted,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emitted,1}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v/c} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.00233} \\approx 0.99767\n\\]  \nThe temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 \\approx (0.99767)^4 \\approx 0.9907\n\\]  \nCombining the radius and temperature terms:  \n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.229\n\\]  \nThis value aligns with option **D** (~2.23). The mass difference is irrelevant here since luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not mass.  \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about two stars and their luminosities. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question says that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, and its mass is also 1.5 times that of Star 2. Both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest, which probably relates to Wien's Law. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. The problem asks by what factor the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than Star 2. The options are all around 2.2 or so, so I need to calculate it properly.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Since they're treated as black bodies, the luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.\n\nThe key here is that the peak wavelengths (\u03bb_max) are the same for both stars. Wien's displacement law states that \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since their peak wavelengths are equal, their temperatures must be equal. Wait, because if \u03bb_max is the same, then T would be the same for both stars. Because \u03bb_max1 = \u03bb_max2 implies T1 = T2, right? Because b is a constant. So that simplifies things. If their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio would just depend on the radius squared. But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Hmm. Wait, how does radial velocity affect this?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's a redshift involved. The radial velocity of Star 2 is 700 km/s, while Star 1 is at rest (0 km/s). But since the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, does that mean that the observed peak wavelength is the same, taking into account the Doppler shift? Or are they saying that the intrinsic peak wavelengths (without any Doppler shift) are the same? The wording says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same\". So that's the observed wavelength. Therefore, the Doppler effect must be considered here.\n\nAh, so if the stars are moving, the observed peak wavelength would be different from their intrinsic peak wavelengths. Let me think. Let me denote the intrinsic peak wavelength of Star 1 as \u03bb1_0 and Star 2 as \u03bb2_0. The observed peak wavelength for Star 1 would be \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_0 (since it's not moving, velocity is zero). For Star 2, moving at 700 km/s, the observed peak wavelength would be redshifted or blueshifted? Since the velocity is given as radial velocity, if Star 2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift), if moving towards, shorter. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So, the observed \u03bb_max for both is the same, so \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs. \n\nBut according to Wien's law, the intrinsic \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature. But the observed \u03bb_max is shifted by the Doppler effect. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Star 1: \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_0 (since no motion). Wien's law says \u03bb1_0 = b / T1.\n\nFor Star 2: \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )? Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula? But since the velocities are 700 km/s, which is much less than the speed of light (c is 3e5 km/s), so 700 is negligible compared to that. So we can approximate the Doppler shift using the non-relativistic formula: \n\nFor a star moving away, the observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_0 (1 + v/c). But actually, the exact formula is (1 + v/c) for velocity away. Wait, maybe better to use the formula for small velocities:\n\nThe Doppler shift formula for wavelength is approximately \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_0 (1 + v/c). Since v is much smaller than c, so v/c is negligible, but maybe it's significant here?\n\nWait, let me think again. The exact Doppler shift formula for radial velocity v (assuming v << c) is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_0 * (1 + v/c). \n\nWait, actually, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So for a velocity v in the direction away, the observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_0 * (1 + v/c). \n\nAlternatively, if the velocity is given as a radial velocity, then the Doppler shift is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) \n\nBut when v << c, this can be approximated as \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_0 (1 + v/c). Since v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c is about 7e5 / 3e8 \u2248 0.00233. So the square root term would be approximately 1 + (v/c). So maybe the approximation is okay here. \n\nGiven that the observed wavelengths are equal, we can write:\n\n\u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs \n\nBut \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_0 (since Star1 is not moving) and \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_0*(1 + v/c) (assuming it's moving away; the direction might matter here, but since the problem states the radial velocity is 700 km/s, which could be either positive or negative, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Hmm, maybe it's moving away, so the Doppler shift increases the wavelength. Wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same, so to have the same observed \u03bb_max, the intrinsic \u03bb_max must differ so that after shifting, they are the same. \n\nLet me write equations:\n\n\u03bb1_0 = \u03bb_max observed of Star1 (since it's not moving)\n\n\u03bb2_0 * (1 + v/c) = \u03bb_max observed of Star2 (assuming moving away, so +v)\n\nSince both observed \u03bb_max are equal, so:\n\n\u03bb1_0 = \u03bb2_0 * (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, \u03bb1_0 / \u03bb2_0 = 1 + v/c.\n\nBut from Wien's law, \u03bb_max = b / T, so \u03bb1_0 = b / T1 and \u03bb2_0 = b / T2.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n(b / T1) / (b / T2) ) = 1 + v/c \u2192 (T2 / T1) = 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nWait, solving that equation:\n\n\u03bb1_0 / \u03bb2_0 = (b / T1) / (b / T2) ) = T2 / T1 \n\nSet equal to 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 / T1 = 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nHmm. So the temperature of Star 2 is higher than Star1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me check again. \n\nWait, if Star 2 is moving away (positive v), then its observed wavelength is longer. To have observed \u03bb equal, the intrinsic \u03bb2 must be shorter so that when it's redshifted, it becomes equal to \u03bb1's. \n\nWait, let me see: suppose Star2's intrinsic \u03bb_max_2 is shorter than Star1's \u03bb_max_1. Then, when redshifted by (1 + v/c), it becomes equal to Star1's observed \u03bb_max (since Star1's is at rest). \n\nSo, \u03bb_max_2 * (1 + v/c) = \u03bb_max_1. \n\nTherefore, \u03bb_max_2 = \u03bb_max_1 / (1 + v/c). \n\nThen, using Wien's law:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T \u2192 (b / T2) = (b / T1) / (1 + v/c) \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the temperature of Star2 is higher by (1 + v/c). \n\nWait, but the problem states that the astronomers found the observed wavelengths to be the same. So the observed \u03bb_max for both stars is the same. So that's why the intrinsic temperatures are different. \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are related by T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nNow, we can get the luminosities. \n\nLuminosity L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074)/( R2\u00b2 T2\u2074 ) \n\nWe know R1 = 1.5 R2. \n\nAlso, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nL1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2\u00b2 ) * ( T1^4 / ( T1*(1 + v/c) )^4 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\n( (2.25 R2\u00b2)/R2\u00b2 ) * (1 / (1 + v/c)^4 )\n\nSo 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)^4 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute 1/(1 + v/c)^4. \n\nFirst, compute v/c. \n\nv is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. \n\nv/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 \u2248 (1.002333)^4. \n\nCalculating this. Let me compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.002333 squared is approximately (1 + 0.002333)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.0000054 \u2248 ~1.0046716. \n\nThen, squaring that again (since to the 4th power is (square)^2):\n\n(1.0046716)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.0046716 + (0.0046716)^2 \u2248 1 + 0.0093432 + 0.0000218 \u2248 ~1.009365.\n\nSo (1.002333)^4 \u2248 ~1.009365. \n\nTherefore, 1/(1.009365) \u2248 0.9907. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 1.009365 is the value of (1 + v/c)^4. So 1 divided by that is approximately 0.9907. \n\nWait, but let me compute this more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm approximation. Let me see:\n\nln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + ... for small x. \n\nSo ln(1 + v/c) = ln(1.002333) \u2248 0.002333 - (0.002333)^2 / 2 \u2248 0.002333 - 0.0000027 \u2248 0.00233. \n\nThen ln( (1 + v/c)^4 ) = 4 * 0.00233 \u2248 0.00932. \n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 \u2248 e^0.00932 \u2248 1 + 0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 \u2248 1.00932 + ~0.000043 \u2248 1.00936. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. \n\nThus, 1/(1.00936) \u2248 1 / 1.00936. Let's compute that: 1 divided by 1.00936.\n\nApproximate division: 1 / 1.00936. Let's see, 1.00936 is 1 + 0.00936. \n\nSo 1/(1+x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2 - x\u00b3... \n\nSo 1/(1.00936) \u2248 1 - 0.00936 + (0.00936)^2 - ... \n\nFirst term: 1 - 0.00936 = 0.99064 \n\nSecond term: (0.00936)^2 \u2248 0.0000876, so adding that gives 0.99064 + 0.0000876 \u2248 0.9907276. \n\nSo the approximation gives about 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, the L1/L2 ratio is 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907. \n\nLet me compute 2.25 * 0.9907: \n\n2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.25*(1 - 0.0093) \u2248 2.25 - 2.25*0.0093 \u2248 2.25 - 0.020925 \u2248 2.229075. \n\nSo approximately 2.229, which is around 2.23. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again for possible mistakes. \n\nFirst, the Doppler shift part. The key is that Star2's intrinsic \u03bb_max is shorter so that when redshifted, the observed \u03bb matches Star1's. So T2 is higher than T1 by (1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio T1/T2 would be 1/(1 + v/c), so when we plug into the luminosity ratio:\n\n(L1/L2) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \n\nWait, yes. Because L is proportional to R\u00b2 T^4. So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) \n\nWhich is ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )\n\nSince T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nSo that gives (2.25) * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 ), which is exactly what I had before. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nCalculating (1 + v/c)^4 with v=700 km/s. \n\nWait, 700 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700/300,000 = 0.002333333...\n\nSo 1.002333333... to the 4th power. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute (1.0023333)^4 step by step. \n\nFirst, compute 1.0023333 squared:\n\n1.0023333 * 1.0023333. Let's do this multiplication:\n\n1.0023333 * 1.0023333 = \n\n1 * 1 = 1\n\n1 * 0.0023333 = 0.0023333\n\n0.0023333 * 1 = 0.0023333\n\n0.0023333 * 0.0023333 \u2248 0.000005444\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1 + 0.0023333 + 0.0023333 + 0.000005444 \u2248 1.0046666 + 0.0000054 \u2248 1.004672. \n\nSo that's the square. Now square that result to get to the 4th power:\n\n1.004672 squared:\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.004672)^2 = 1 + 2*0.004672 + (0.004672)^2 \n\n= 1 + 0.009344 + ~0.0000218 \n\n\u2248 1.009344 + 0.0000218 \u2248 1.0093658 \n\nTherefore, (1.0023333)^4 \u2248 1.0093658. \n\nThus, 1 divided by that is \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.229, so ~2.23. \n\nThe options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any other factor I might have missed. \n\nThe problem states that the mass of Star 1 is also 1.5 times that of Star 2. But in the calculation, I didn't use the mass. Since the question is about luminosity, which for a star's luminosity, the Stefan-Boltzmann law depends on radius and temperature. Mass might be a distractor here, unless there's another relation. \n\nWait, but maybe the mass is relevant in determining the temperature? But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same (so temperatures are related via Doppler shift as we did). So perhaps the mass is given but not needed here. The question says \"assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies\", so the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws are sufficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the mass is irrelevant here. The answer should be D) ~2.23. \n\nWait, but let me check the question again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...\" \n\nWait, in our calculation, L1/L2 is approximately 2.23. So that would be a factor of ~2.23, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n",

Since v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c is about 7e5 / 3e8 \u2248 0.00233. So the square root term would be approximately 1 + (v/c). So maybe the approximation is okay here. \n\nGiven that the observed wavelengths are equal, we can write:\n\n\u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs \n\nBut \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_0 (since Star1 is not moving) and \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_0*(1 + v/c) (assuming it's moving away; the direction might matter here, but since the problem states the radial velocity is 700 km/s, which could be either positive or negative, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Hmm, maybe it's moving away, so the Doppler shift increases the wavelength. Wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same, so to have the same observed \u03bb_max, the intrinsic \u03bb_max must differ so that after shifting, they are the same. \n\nLet me write equations:\n\n\u03bb1_0 = \u03bb_max observed of Star1 (since it's not moving)\n\n\u03bb2_0 * (1 + v/c) = \u03bb_max observed of Star2 (assuming moving away, so +v)\n\nSince both observed \u03bb_max are equal, so:\n\n\u03bb1_0 = \u03bb2_0 * (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, \u03bb1_0 / \u03bb2_0 = 1 + v/c.\n\nBut from Wien's law, \u03bb_max = b / T, so \u03bb1_0 = b / T1 and \u03bb2_0 = b / T2.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n(b / T1) / (b / T2) ) = 1 + v/c \u2192 (T2 / T1) = 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nWait, solving that equation:\n\n\u03bb1_0 / \u03bb2_0 = (b / T1) / (b / T2) ) = T2 / T1 \n\nSet equal to 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 / T1 = 1 + v/c \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c)\n\nHmm. So the temperature of Star 2 is higher than Star1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me check again. \n\nWait, if Star 2 is moving away (positive v), then its observed wavelength is longer. To have observed \u03bb equal, the intrinsic \u03bb2 must be shorter so that when it's redshifted, it becomes equal to \u03bb1's. \n\nWait, let me see: suppose Star2's intrinsic \u03bb_max_2 is shorter than Star1's \u03bb_max_1. Then, when redshifted by (1 + v/c), it becomes equal to Star1's observed \u03bb_max (since Star1's is at rest). \n\nSo, \u03bb_max_2 * (1 + v/c) = \u03bb_max_1. \n\nTherefore, \u03bb_max_2 = \u03bb_max_1 / (1 + v/c). \n\nThen, using Wien's law:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T \u2192 (b / T2) = (b / T1) / (1 + v/c) \u2192 T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the temperature of Star2 is higher by (1 + v/c). \n\nWait, but the problem states that the astronomers found the observed wavelengths to be the same. So the observed \u03bb_max for both stars is the same. So that's why the intrinsic temperatures are different. \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are related by T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nNow, we can get the luminosities. \n\nLuminosity L = 4\u03c0 R\u00b2 \u03c3 T\u2074. \n\nSo the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074)/( R2\u00b2 T2\u2074 ) \n\nWe know R1 = 1.5 R2. \n\nAlso, T2 = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nL1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2\u00b2 ) * ( T1^4 / ( T1*(1 + v/c) )^4 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\n( (2.25 R2\u00b2)/R2\u00b2 ) * (1 / (1 + v/c)^4 )\n\nSo 2.25 * [1/(1 + v/c)^4 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute 1/(1 + v/c)^4. \n\nFirst, compute v/c. \n\nv is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. \n\nv/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333\n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 \u2248 (1.002333)^4. \n\nCalculating this. Let me compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.002333 squared is approximately (1 + 0.002333)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.0000054 \u2248 ~1.0046716. \n\nThen, squaring that again (since to the 4th power is (square)^2):\n\n(1.0046716)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.0046716 + (0.0046716)^2 \u2248 1 + 0.0093432 + 0.0000218 \u2248 ~1.009365.\n\nSo (1.002333)^4 \u2248 ~1.009365. \n\nTherefore, 1/(1.009365) \u2248 0.9907. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 1.009365 is the value of (1 + v/c)^4. So 1 divided by that is approximately 0.9907. \n\nWait, but let me compute this more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm approximation. Let me see:\n\nln(1+x) \u2248 x - x\u00b2/2 + ... for small x. \n\nSo ln(1 + v/c) = ln(1.002333) \u2248 0.002333 - (0.002333)^2 / 2 \u2248 0.002333 - 0.0000027 \u2248 0.00233. \n\nThen ln( (1 + v/c)^4 ) = 4 * 0.00233 \u2248 0.00932. \n\nTherefore, (1 + v/c)^4 \u2248 e^0.00932 \u2248 1 + 0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 \u2248 1.00932 + ~0.000043 \u2248 1.00936. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. \n\nThus, 1/(1.00936) \u2248 1 / 1.00936. Let's compute that: 1 divided by 1.00936.\n\nApproximate division: 1 / 1.00936. Let's see, 1.00936 is 1 + 0.00936. \n\nSo 1/(1+x) \u2248 1 - x + x\u00b2 - x\u00b3... \n\nSo 1/(1.00936) \u2248 1 - 0.00936 + (0.00936)^2 - ... \n\nFirst term: 1 - 0.00936 = 0.99064 \n\nSecond term: (0.00936)^2 \u2248 0.0000876, so adding that gives 0.99064 + 0.0000876 \u2248 0.9907276. \n\nSo the approximation gives about 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, the L1/L2 ratio is 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907. \n\nLet me compute 2.25 * 0.9907: \n\n2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.25*(1 - 0.0093) \u2248 2.25 - 2.25*0.0093 \u2248 2.25 - 0.020925 \u2248 2.229075. \n\nSo approximately 2.229, which is around 2.23. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again for possible mistakes. \n\nFirst, the Doppler shift part. The key is that Star2's intrinsic \u03bb_max is shorter so that when redshifted, the observed \u03bb matches Star1's. So T2 is higher than T1 by (1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio T1/T2 would be 1/(1 + v/c), so when we plug into the luminosity ratio:\n\n(L1/L2) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \n\nWait, yes. Because L is proportional to R\u00b2 T^4. So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) \n\nWhich is ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )\n\nSince T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), so T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nSo that gives (2.25) * (1/(1 + v/c)^4 ), which is exactly what I had before. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nCalculating (1 + v/c)^4 with v=700 km/s. \n\nWait, 700 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700/300,000 = 0.002333333...\n\nSo 1.002333333... to the 4th power. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute (1.0023333)^4 step by step. \n\nFirst, compute 1.0023333 squared:\n\n1.0023333 * 1.0023333. Let's do this multiplication:\n\n1.0023333 * 1.0023333 = \n\n1 * 1 = 1\n\n1 * 0.0023333 = 0.0023333\n\n0.0023333 * 1 = 0.0023333\n\n0.0023333 * 0.0023333 \u2248 0.000005444\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1 + 0.0023333 + 0.0023333 + 0.000005444 \u2248 1.0046666 + 0.0000054 \u2248 1.004672. \n\nSo that's the square. Now square that result to get to the 4th power:\n\n1.004672 squared:\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.004672)^2 = 1 + 2*0.004672 + (0.004672)^2 \n\n= 1 + 0.009344 + ~0.0000218 \n\n\u2248 1.009344 + 0.0000218 \u2248 1.0093658 \n\nTherefore, (1.0023333)^4 \u2248 1.0093658. \n\nThus, 1 divided by that is \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, 2.25 * 0.9907 = 2.229, so ~2.23. \n\nThe options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any other factor I might have missed. \n\nThe problem states that the mass of Star 1 is also 1.5 times that of Star 2. But in the calculation, I didn't use the mass. Since the question is about luminosity, which for a star's luminosity, the Stefan-Boltzmann law depends on radius and temperature. Mass might be a distractor here, unless there's another relation. \n\nWait, but maybe the mass is relevant in determining the temperature? But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same (so temperatures are related via Doppler shift as we did). So perhaps the mass is given but not needed here. The question says \"assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies\", so the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws are sufficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the mass is irrelevant here. The answer should be D) ~2.23. \n\nWait, but let me check the question again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...\" \n\nWait, in our calculation, L1/L2 is approximately 2.23. So that would be a factor of ~2.23, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we start by noting that both stars have the same observed peak wavelength due to Wien's Law. The Doppler shift must be considered for Star_2 (moving at 700 km/s). \n\nUsing Wien's Law, the intrinsic peak wavelengths relate to temperatures as \\( \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T} \\). For observed wavelengths to be equal, the intrinsic wavelengths must differ by the Doppler factor. Let \\( v = 700 \\, \\text{km/s} \\) and \\( c = 3 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{km/s} \\). The Doppler factor \\( 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\approx 1.00233 \\). \n\nThe temperature relation is \\( T_2 = T_1 \\times (1 + \\frac{v}{c}) \\). \n\nLuminosity \\( L \\propto R^2 T^4 \\). Given \\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\), the luminosity ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left( \\frac{R_1}{R_2} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1.00233} \\right)^4 \n\\]\nCalculating \\( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\) and \\( (1.00233)^4 \\approx 1.00936 \\), the inverse gives \\( \\frac{1}{1.00936} \\approx 0.9907 \\). Multiplying:\n\\[\n2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.229\n\\]\nThe closest option is **D** (~2.23).\n\nAnswer: D",
