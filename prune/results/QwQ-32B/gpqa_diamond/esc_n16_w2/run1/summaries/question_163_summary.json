      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a solution with a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic acid required and the resulting pH. \n\nFirst, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a base. When you dissolve it in an acid, the acid will neutralize the hydroxide ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ from the acid. Since it's a monobasic acid, each molecule donates one H+.\n\nThe formula for Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. The reaction would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh right, because each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize them. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 to 3 moles H+.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. \n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol \u2248 0.000936 mol (since 0.1 divided by approx 106.85). Let me check that calculation again. Let me compute 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's see, 106.85 is about 107, so 0.1/107 is about 0.0009346... so approximately 9.346e-4 mol.\n\nSince the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the total moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.346e-4 \u2248 0.0028038 mol. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.0028038 / 0.1 = 0.028038 liters, which is 28.038 cm3. Hmm, so that's about 28.04 cm3. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm3, which is close. But let me check the options again. Option C's volume is 28.05 cm3, so that's probably the correct volume. \n\nNow, the pH part. After neutralization, the solution should have excess acid? Wait, but if we use exactly the right amount of acid to neutralize Fe(OH)3, then all the OH- from Fe(OH)3 would be neutralized, but the resulting solution would have Fe^3+ ions. But Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water. Wait, so maybe the pH isn't just from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the excess H+ from the acid determines the pH. Wait, but if the acid is exactly the amount needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, then there's no excess H+? Wait, but maybe the question is saying the minimum volume needed so that all Fe(OH)3 dissolves. So that would require at least enough acid to neutralize all the OH- in the Fe(OH)3. Because if you don't have enough acid, the Fe(OH)3 would precipitate. So the minimum volume is exactly the stoichiometric amount. \n\nIn that case, the H+ is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+ left. But then, what determines the pH?\n\nWait, but maybe after neutralization, the Fe^3+ will react with water. The hydrolysis reaction would be Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the Fe^3+ is acting as an acid, releasing H+ ions. Therefore, the solution would be acidic because of the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the pH considering the hydrolysis. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's recap:\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.85 \u2248 0.000935 mol.\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 0.002805 mol.\n\nVolume of acid: 28.05 cm\u00b3 (since 0.002805 / 0.1 = 0.02805 L = 28.05 cm3). That matches option C's volume. So the volume part is likely option C.\n\nNow pH: Since the acid is just enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, there's no excess H+. The solution contains Fe^3+ in water. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, producing H+ ions. So the pH will depend on the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ in solution: total volume is 100 cm3. The moles of Fe^3+ are same as moles of Fe(OH)3, since each Fe(OH)3 gives one Fe^3+.\n\nSo concentration of Fe^3+ is (0.000935 mol) / 0.1 L = 0.00935 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be calculated from the Kb of Fe(OH)3. Wait, since Fe(OH)3 is a base, its Kb is related to the Ka of its conjugate acid. Alternatively, the solubility product Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known, but maybe we can use that here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Let me recall that the solubility product for Fe(OH)3 is very small, which means it's not very soluble. But in this case, we are dissolving it in acid, so it's already dissolved. However, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would depend on its concentration. Alternatively, maybe the pH can be found using the hydrolysis equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, the pH can be calculated using the formula for the acidity of a salt of a weak base. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, Fe^3+ is its conjugate acid.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be Kw / Ka, but perhaps more straightforward to use the Ksp.\n\nWait, let's think again. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-\n\nThe Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nBut in our case, the solution is made by adding acid to dissolve it. The resulting solution has Fe^3+ in solution, and the H+ from the acid. However, if we used exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, then the solution is just Fe^3+ in water. The H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Ka = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAlternatively, since Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, then the Kb (base dissociation) for Fe(OH)3 would be Ksp / Kw? Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the Fe^3+ is acting as an acid. The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe^3+ can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe relation between Ksp and Ka for the conjugate acid:\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is given by:\n\nKsp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.\n\nThe conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(H2O)6^3+, which can lose a proton to form Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+ and H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+] / [Fe(H2O)6^3+]\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the hydrolysis equilibrium of Fe^3+:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be related to the Ksp and Kw. Let me see.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is equal to the product of the concentration of Fe^3+ and (OH^-)^3. \n\nThe solubility of Fe(OH)3 in pure water would be determined by Ksp, but in our case, the solution has excess H+ from the acid, so the Fe^3+ is in solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can calculate the pH using the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base. \n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa - log C)\n\nWait, perhaps the pKa here is for the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. Let me think:\n\nThe Fe(OH)3 is a base, so its conjugate acid is Fe(OH)2+ (since when it gains a H+, it becomes Fe(OH)2+? Not sure, but perhaps the pKa is related to the Ksp and Kw.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka for Fe^3+ can be found by:\n\nKa = Kw / Kb(Fe(OH)3)\n\nWait, Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be the base dissociation. Since Fe(OH)3 is a base, it can accept a proton?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Wait, since this is a problem-solving scenario, maybe I need to recall that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is around 4e-38? Wait, no, maybe 2.79\u00d710^-39? Let me see, but perhaps I can use the Ksp value here.\n\nAssuming Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 4e-38 (I think the exact value might be needed here. Wait, maybe I should derive the pH in terms of Ksp.\n\nLet me suppose that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known. Let me denote Ksp as K. Then, when Fe^3+ is in solution, the hydrolysis is such that:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+\n\nWait, that's another way to write the reverse of the dissolution. So the equilibrium is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-\n\nBut if we have Fe^3+ in solution, and we're considering the hydrolysis, then the reverse reaction would be:\n\nFe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s)\n\nBut in solution, the presence of H+ from acid would shift the equilibrium. Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is as follows:\n\nFe^3+ (aq) + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Ka = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nThe Ka here can be related to the Ksp and Kw. Let me see:\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nThe reaction for the dissolution is Fe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-.\n\nThe reverse reaction (precipitation) would require that [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 exceeds Ksp. \n\nBut in the solution, to keep Fe^3+ dissolved, the concentration of OH^- must be low enough so that [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 < Ksp. \n\nAlternatively, considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the hydrolysis steps can be considered in multiple steps, but maybe it's easier to think of the overall reaction.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might expect a simpler approach, perhaps the pH can be found by considering the excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but in this case, the acid was exactly the amount needed to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume\". To dissolve it, you need to add enough acid to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So the minimum volume of acid is exactly the stoichiometric amount. But then, after that, the solution contains Fe^3+ in water. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis will produce H+, so the pH will be acidic.\n\nTo calculate the pH, we can use the formula for the hydrolysis of a metal ion. For a salt of a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + pC - log C)\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis equation is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nBut since the Fe(OH)^2+ is in solution, the concentration of Fe^3+ and Fe(OH)^2+ are related. Let's assume that the concentration of Fe^3+ is approximately equal to the initial concentration (since hydrolysis is small?), but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka here can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 (as a base) would be Ksp / Kw, but perhaps I'm mixing things up here.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction Fe(OH)3 \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^- has Ksp. \n\nThe conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)2+ (since adding a proton to Fe(OH)3 would give Fe(OH)2+ plus H2O?), but maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nBecause:\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^- (Ksp).\n\nThe reverse reaction (hydrolysis) is Fe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s), with K = 1/Ksp.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction as written (Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)3 + 3H+) can be seen as combining the reverse dissolution with 3 H2O \u2192 3 H+ + 3 OH^- (from Kw). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+\n\nThis can be considered as the sum of:\n\n1. Fe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) (K1 = 1/Ksp)\n\n2. 3H2O \u21cc 3H+ + 3OH^- (K2 = (Kw)^3 )\n\nSo the overall K is (K1)*(K2) = (1/Ksp)*(Kw)^3.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis is Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nTherefore, K = (1.0e-14)^3 / Ksp.\n\nAssuming Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 4e-38 (since I remember that Fe(OH)3 has a very low solubility), then:\n\nK = (1e-42) / (4e-38) = (1/4) * 1e-4 = 2.5e-5.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. If Ksp is 4e-38, then 1e-42 divided by 4e-38 is (1/4) * 1e-4 = 2.5e-5. Hmm, so the equilibrium constant K for the hydrolysis is 2.5e-5. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the hydrolysis reaction has a small K, meaning it doesn't proceed much. Wait, but if K is 2.5e-5, then the reaction is not very favorable. Hmm, maybe I made an error in the K calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is different. Let me recall: The solubility product for iron(III) hydroxide is around 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 at 25\u00b0C. Let me use that value.\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42) / (2.79e-39) \u2248 (1 / 2.79) * 1e-3 \u2248 0.358e-3 \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nSo K \u2248 3.58e-4. That's the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nSo the reaction Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ has K \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the reverse of this reaction? Let me clarify:\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would produce H+ ions, so the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.\n\nBut the K for this is 3.58e-4. Since K is small, the reaction doesn't proceed much, meaning that the concentration of H+ produced is small. Wait, but since K is the equilibrium constant, perhaps we can model this using an ICE table.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentration of Fe^3+ as C = 0.00935 M (since 0.1g / 106.85g/mol \u2248 0.000935 mol in 0.1 L \u2192 0.00935 M).\n\nLet me let x be the concentration of H+ produced. Then, for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, we get 3x H+ (since each reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up variables properly. Let me think:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nLet the change be: suppose that a small amount 'a' of Fe^3+ reacts. Then:\n\n[Fe^3+] = C - a\n\n[H+] = 3a (since each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+)\n\nBut since the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's not in the expression. The equilibrium expression is:\n\nK = [H+]^3 / ([Fe^3+]) \n\nBecause the reaction's K is [Fe(OH)3(s) is not included, so the expression is ( [H+]^3 ) / ([Fe^3+]) = K.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nK = ( (3a)^3 ) / (C - a) \n\nWe can assume that a is small compared to C (since K is small?), so that (C - a) \u2248 C.\n\nThen:\n\nK \u2248 (27 a^3) / C \u2192 a^3 \u2248 (K*C)/27 \u2192 a \u2248 cube root( (K*C)/27 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK = 3.58e-4\n\nC = 0.00935 M.\n\nSo:\n\na^3 = (3.58e-4 * 0.00935) / 27 \u2248 (3.58e-4 * 0.00935) = let's compute that first.\n\n3.58e-4 * 0.00935 \u2248 3.58 * 0.00935 * 1e-4 \u2248 (0.033437) * 1e-4 = 3.3437e-6.\n\nDivide by 27: 3.3437e-6 / 27 \u2248 1.238e-7.\n\nSo a^3 \u2248 1.238e-7 \u2192 a \u2248 (1.238e-7)^(1/3).\n\nLet me compute the cube root of 1.238e-7.\n\nCube root of 1e-7 is 1e-7^(1/3) \u2248 4.64e-3 (since (4.64)^3 \u2248 100, so 4.64e-3^3 = ~1e-7).\n\n1.238e-7 is about 1.238 times that. So cube root of 1.238 is about 1.07, so total a \u2248 1.07 * 4.64e-3 \u2248 4.92e-3 M.\n\nWait, but that would mean a is ~0.00492 M, which is not negligible compared to C (0.00935). Hmm, so my initial assumption that a << C may not hold. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to solve it more accurately.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nK = ( (3a)^3 ) / (C - a) \n\nWe can write this as:\n\n27 a^3 / (C - a) = K\n\n=> 27 a^3 = K (C - a)\n\n=> 27 a^3 + K a - K C = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation. Maybe approximate?\n\nAlternatively, let's plug in K = 3.58e-4 and C = 0.00935.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n27 a^3 + (3.58e-4) a - (3.58e-4)(0.00935) = 0\n\nLet me compute the last term:\n\n3.58e-4 * 0.00935 \u2248 3.58e-4 * 9.35e-3 = (3.58 * 9.35) * 1e-7 \u2248 33.4 * 1e-7 \u2248 3.34e-6.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n27 a^3 + 0.000358 a - 0.00000334 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps this is manageable numerically.\n\nLet me try a = 0.001 (1e-3):\n\n27*(1e-9) + 0.000358*(0.001) - 0.00000334\n\n= 2.7e-8 + 3.58e-7 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 3.85e-7 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -2.95e-6 (negative)\n\na=0.002:\n\n27*(8e-9) + 0.000358*(0.002) - 3.34e-6\n\n= 2.16e-7 + 7.16e-7 - 3.34e-6 = (9.32e-7) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -2.4e-6 (still negative)\n\na=0.003:\n\n27*(27e-9) + 0.000358*(0.003) - 3.34e-6\n\n= 7.29e-7 + 1.074e-6 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 (1.8e-6) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -1.54e-6 (still negative)\n\na=0.004:\n\n27*(64e-9) + 0.000358*0.004 - 3.34e-6\n\n= 1.728e-6 + 1.432e-6 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 (3.16e-6) -3.34e-6 \u2248 -1.8e-7 (closer)\n\na=0.0045:\n\n27*(0.0045)^3 + ... \n\nWait, let me compute a=0.0045:\n\na^3 = (0.0045)^3 = 9.1125e-8.\n\n27 *9.1125e-8 = 2.46e-6\n\n0.000358 *0.0045 = 1.611e-6\n\nTotal: 2.46e-6 +1.611e-6 -3.34e-6 = (4.071e-6) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 7.31e-7 (positive)\n\nSo between 0.004 and 0.0045.\n\nLet's try a=0.0043:\n\na=0.0043:\n\na^3 = (0.0043)^3 = (4.3e-3)^3 = 79.507e-9 = 7.95e-7\n\n27 *7.95e-7 \u2248 2.146e-5 ?\n\nWait, 27 *7.95e-7 = 27 * 7.95 = 214.65; times 1e-7 \u2192 2.1465e-5?\n\nWait, 27 *7.95e-7: 7.95e-7 *27 = (7.95 *27) * 1e-7 = 214.65 *1e-7 = 2.1465e-5.\n\nThen, 0.000358 *0.0043 = 0.000358 *4.3e-3 = 1.5394e-6.\n\nTotal equation: 2.1465e-5 + 1.5394e-6 -3.34e-6.\n\nWait, 2.1465e-5 is 2.1465e-5, which is 21.465e-6. Adding 1.5394e-6 gives 23e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 gives 19.66e-6? Wait, no, perhaps I messed up exponents.\n\nWait, 2.1465e-5 is 21,465e-7? Wait, perhaps better to convert all terms to same exponent:\n\n2.1465e-5 = 2.1465 x 10^-5\n\n1.5394e-6 = 0.15394 x 10^-5\n\n3.34e-6 = 0.334 x10^-5\n\nSo total equation:\n\n2.1465e-5 + 0.15394e-5 -0.334e-5 = (2.1465 +0.15394 -0.334) x10^-5 = (2.1465 +0.15394 is ~2.3004 -0.334)= ~1.9664e-5. Which is positive. Hmm, but I need to find when the total is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recast all terms in terms of 1e-6:\n\n2.1465e-5 = 21.465e-6,\n\nso 21.465e-6 + 1.5394e-6 = 23.0044e-6,\n\nthen subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 23.0044 -3.34 = 19.6644e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at a=0.0043, the total is positive. At a=0.004, the total was:\n\na=0.004:\n\na^3 = (0.004)^3 = 6.4e-8 \u2192 27 *6.4e-8 = 1.728e-6 (1.728e-6)\n\n0.000358 *0.004 = 1.432e-6\n\nTotal: 1.728e-6 +1.432e-6 -3.34e-6 = (3.16e-6 -3.34e-6) = -1.8e-7.\n\nSo between a=0.004 and 0.0043, the value crosses zero. Let's try a=0.0042:\n\na=0.0042:\n\na^3 = (0.0042)^3 = 0.0042*0.0042*0.0042 = 0.0042^2=0.00001764; *0.0042 \u2192 7.359e-8.\n\n27 *7.359e-8 = 27 *7.359e-8 = (27*7.359)= 198.693e-8 \u2192 1.98693e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.0042 = 0.0000015036 (1.5036e-6)\n\nAdding: 1.98693e-6 +1.5036e-6 = 3.4905e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 0.1505e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at 0.0042, the total is positive. \n\nAt a=0.0041:\n\na^3 = (0.0041)^3 = (4.1e-3)^3 = 68.921e-9 =6.8921e-7.\n\nWait, 4.1^3 = 68.921, so 4.1e-3^3 =68.921e-9 = 6.8921e-8.\n\n27 *6.8921e-8 = 186.0867e-8 =1.860867e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.0041 =0.000358 *4.1e-3 =1.4678e-6.\n\nTotal: 1.860867e-6 +1.4678e-6 = 3.3286e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 -1.14e-7. Close to zero.\n\nSo between 0.0041 and 0.0042.\n\nLet me try a=0.00415:\n\na=0.00415:\n\na\u00b3 = (0.00415)^3 \u2248 (0.004)^3 + 3*(0.004)^2*(0.00015) + ... but maybe compute directly:\n\n0.00415^3 = (4.15e-3)^3 = (4.15)^3 *1e-9 \u2192 4.15\u00b3 = 4.15*4.15=17.2225; 17.2225 *4.15 \u2248 71.43. So 71.43e-9 \u2192 7.143e-8.\n\n27 *7.143e-8 = 1.9286e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.00415 =0.000358 *4.15e-3 \u2248 (0.000358*4) + (0.000358*0.15e-3) \u2192 0.001432 + 0.0000537 \u2192 0.0014857 \u2192 1.4857e-3? Wait no, sorry:\n\nWait 0.00415 is 4.15e-3, so 0.000358 *0.00415 = 0.000358 *4.15e-3 = (0.000358 *4.15) *1e-3 \u2192 0.0014857 *1e-3 \u2192 1.4857e-6.\n\nSo adding to the previous term:\n\n1.9286e-6 +1.4857e-6 = 3.4143e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 0.0743e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at a=0.00415, total is +0.0743e-6.\n\nWe need to find a where total is zero. Between a=0.0041 (total -1.14e-7) and a=0.00415 (total +0.0743e-6). Let me use linear approximation.\n\nBetween a=0.0041 and a=0.00415:\n\nAt a=0.0041 \u2192 delta = -1.14e-7.\n\nAt a=0.00415 \u2192 delta = +7.43e-8 (since 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8).\n\nWait, sorry: 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8? Wait no, 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8? Let me see:\n\n0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8. Yes.\n\nSo the change in a is 0.00005 (0.00415 -0.0041 = 0.00005).\n\nThe delta goes from -1.14e-7 to +7.43e-8. The total change is 7.43e-8 +1.14e-7 = 1.883e-7 over 0.00005.\n\nWe need to find the a where delta=0. Let x be the fraction between 0.0041 and 0.00415.\n\nLet delta = -1.14e-7 + ( (7.43e-8 +1.14e-7)/0.00005 ) * (a -0.0041) ) =0.\n\nWait, perhaps simpler:\n\nLet me set up the linear equation between a=0.0041 (D1=-1.14e-7) and a=0.00415 (D2=+7.43e-8).\n\nThe desired a is where D=0.\n\nThe slope is (D2 - D1)/(\u0394a) = (7.43e-8 - (-1.14e-7)) / 0.00005 = (1.883e-7)/0.00005 = 1.883e-7 /5e-5 = (1.883/5)*1e-2 = 0.3766e-2 = 0.003766 per unit a.\n\nWait, slope is delta_D per delta_a: 1.883e-7 / 0.00005 = 3.766e-3 per 1 unit a?\n\nWait, let me compute slope: (7.43e-8 - (-1.14e-7)) / (0.00005) \n\nThat's (7.43e-8 +1.14e-7) = 1.883e-7 divided by 0.00005 \u2192 1.883e-7 / 5e-5 = (1.883/5) * 1e-2 = 0.3766 * 0.01 = 0.003766 per 1 a unit? Wait, no, units are in terms of a in 0.00005 increments. \n\nAlternatively, the required delta is to cover from D1 to D=0. The fraction needed is (0 - D1)/(D2 - D1) = (1.14e-7)/(1.883e-7) \u2248 0.605.\n\nSo the a needed is 0.0041 + 0.605*(0.00005) \u2248 0.0041 + 0.00003025 = 0.00413025.\n\nSo approximately a \u22480.00413 M.\n\nThus, the [H+] is 3a = 3 *0.00413 \u22480.0124 M.\n\nWait, but wait: in the reaction equation, each Fe^3+ that reacts gives 3 H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. So the H+ concentration is 3a. \n\nWait, but according to the equation setup, the H+ is 3a, yes. So if a is ~0.00413 M, then [H+] is 3 *0.00413 \u22480.0124 M. \n\nThe pH would be -log(0.0124) \u2248 1.907. \n\nHmm, which is close to option C's pH of 2.04 or B's 2.69. \n\nHmm, but perhaps my Ksp value was incorrect. Let me check Ksp of Fe(OH)3 again. \n\nWait, perhaps I used the wrong Ksp. Let me confirm. A quick recall: the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is actually around 2.79\u00d710^-39 at 25\u00b0C. Let me recalculate with that exact value.\n\nSo Ksp = 2.79e-39.\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) \u2248 3.58e-4 (same as before). So my earlier calculation holds.\n\nHmm, but then the pH came out to around 1.9, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C (pH 2.04) or B (2.69). \n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that [Fe^3+] is C - a is leading to inaccuracies. Let me try another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of a metal ion. The general formula for the pH of a solution of a metal salt is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nWait, the formula for a metal ion (acting as an acid) is:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / [Fe^3+] \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAssuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)^2+ is equal to the concentration of H+ (since each Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes produces one H+?), but actually each Fe^3+ produces one H+ per hydrolysis step. Wait, but the reaction is producing one H+ per Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes. So for each mole of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, you get one mole of H+. \n\nWait, but the reaction as written produces one H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. So if x is the amount of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, then:\n\n[Fe^3+] = C - x,\n\n[H+] = x,\n\n[Fe(OH)^2+] = x,\n\nSo the Ka expression is:\n\nKa = (x)(x)/(C -x) = x\u00b2/(C -x)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nKa = x\u00b2/(C -x)\n\nBut earlier approach considered a different reaction (the full hydrolysis to Fe(OH)3), which might have different stoichiometry. So perhaps this is a better way.\n\nWait, this is a different approach. Let me see:\n\nAssuming the hydrolysis is stepwise, and the first proton is released, then:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+ \n\nThe Ka here is for this first proton.\n\nIf I can find the Ka for this reaction, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3 + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)2+ + OH^- \n\nWait, but that's not the right reaction. \n\nAlternatively, the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)2+H, so the Ka would be:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAnd the relation between Ka and Ksp:\n\nThe Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 \n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3 \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- \u2192 Ksp.\n\nThe conjugate acid would be Fe(OH)2+ (since adding a proton to Fe^3+ would form Fe(OH)^2+?), so the Ka for the conjugate acid is Kw * Ksp^(1/3) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ka can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe reaction for the hydrolysis is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nThe reverse reaction (the dissolution of Fe(OH)3) is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- \u2192 Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.\n\nThe reaction for hydrolysis can be seen as the sum of the reverse dissolution and the protonation of OH-:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + H+ \n\nWhich is the same as the dissolution reversed plus H2O \u2192 H+ + OH^-.\n\nWait, the hydrolysis reaction can be written as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nThis has the equilibrium constant K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] \n\nWhich is the same as before. So this gives us the same expression as before. \n\nThus, the previous calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the pH came out to around 1.9, which is close to option C (2.04). Maybe I made a calculation mistake in the approximation.\n\nAlternatively, let's try using the first approach with the a value.\n\nIf the [H+] is 3a = 0.0124 M, then pH = -log(0.0124) \u2248 1.907. But option C says pH 2.04. Hmm, maybe the Ksp value I used was incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Suppose the Ksp is actually 2.79e-38 instead of 39. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Ksp = 2.79e-38:\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-38) = 1e-42 / 2.79e-38 \u2248 3.58e-5.\n\nSo K is 3.58e-5. \n\nThen redo the equation with K=3.58e-5 and C=0.00935.\n\nEquation:\n\n27a^3/(C -a) = K \u2192 27a\u00b3/(0.00935 -a) = 3.58e-5.\n\nAssume a is small compared to C (0.00935), then:\n\n27a\u00b3 \u2248 3.58e-5 *0.00935 \u2192 a\u00b3 \u2248 (3.58e-5 * 0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-7)/27 \u2248 1.237e-8 \u2192 a \u2248 cube root(1.237e-8) \u2248 2.31e-3 M.\n\nThus, a \u22480.00231 M. Then [H+] =3a =0.00693 M \u2192 pH = -log(0.00693) \u22482.16, which matches option A's pH of 3.16? No, 2.16 is close to option C's 2.04.\n\nWait, 0.00693 M H+ gives pH of log(1/0.00693) \u2248 log(144) \u22482.16. \n\nHmm, so if the Ksp was 1e-38, then the pH would be 2.16, which is still close to option C's 2.04. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that the Fe^3+ is a weak acid with a certain Ka. The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak acid.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00935 M. The Ka for Fe^3+ is given by Ka = Kw * Ksp^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is Ksp / Kw.\n\nWait, the Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be Ksp / [H+]^3 ?\n\nAlternatively, the relation between Ka and Ksp is:\n\nFor the hydrolysis Fe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+,\n\nthe Ka is (Kw * Ksp)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, here's an alternative method:\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = (Kw)^3 / Ksp.\n\nSo, K = (1e-14)^3 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39:\n\nK = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) = ~3.58e-4.\n\nThe reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. Let\u2019s let x be the amount of Fe^3+ that reacts.\n\nThen:\n\nK = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] = ( (3x)^3 ) / (C -x) = 27x^3/(C -x).\n\nAssuming x is small compared to C (0.00935), then:\n\n27x^3 \u2248 K*C \u2192 x^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u2248 1.237e-7 \u2192 x \u2248 (1.237e-7)^(1/3) \u2248 0.00498 M.\n\nThen [H+] =3x \u2248 0.0149 M \u2192 pH \u2248-log(0.0149) \u22481.83. Which is still around 1.83, but the options don't have this. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the question says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume\". So the total volume is 100 cm3. The acid's volume plus the Fe(OH)3's volume (but probably negligible) should add to 100 cm3. So the volume of acid must be less than 100 cm3. \n\nThe options give volumes like 28, 30, 32 cm3, which add up to under 100, so that's okay.\n\nNow the pH options are 2.04 (C), 2.69 (B), 3.16 (A), etc. \n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid?\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the acid is exactly the stoichiometric amount. Because if you add a monobasic acid, say HCl, then each mole of HCl provides one mole of H+.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe^3+ + 3H2O. \n\nThe moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1g / molar mass. \n\nAs before, moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.85 \u22480.000935 mol. \n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 *0.000935 = 0.002805 mol. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002805 /0.1 =0.02805 L =28.05 cm3. That matches option C's volume.\n\nNow, the total volume is 100 cm3. The acid contributes 28.05 cm3, so the rest is water. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm3. So when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume becomes 100 cm3. Therefore, the volume of acid must be such that when you add it to the solution, the total is 100 cm3. \n\nBut in any case, the calculation of the volume is correct as 28.05 cm3. \n\nNow, the pH. \n\nThe question is, after adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and no excess H+ (since the acid was just enough to neutralize the OH-). But the Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze to produce H+, thus lowering the pH below neutral. \n\nSo the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. \n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base. \n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nWait, but what's the pKa here?\n\nThe pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the Fe^3+ ion. \n\nThe Ka for Fe^3+ can be calculated using the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nKb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3(s)] \u2192 but since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, the Kb is simply [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nWait, the Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is actually the same as Ksp. \n\nThen, the conjugate acid's Ka is Kw / Kb = Kw / Ksp.\n\nWait, the conjugate acid here would be Fe(OH)2+, so:\n\nKa = Kw / Kb = (1e-14)/ (Ksp).\n\nWait, but Kb here is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3, which is equal to Ksp. \n\nThus, Ka = 1e-14 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39:\n\nKa = 1e-14 / 2.79e-39 \u2248 3.58e+25. \n\nWait, that's a very large Ka, which makes sense because Fe^3+ is a strong acid. \n\nWait, but how does this help us?\n\nThe Ka is so large that the Fe^3+ will almost completely hydrolyze. \n\nWait, but if the Ka is 3.58e+25, which is extremely large, then the Fe^3+ will almost fully react to form H+ and Fe(OH)^2+. \n\nThe concentration of H+ would then be approximately sqrt(Ka * C).\n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe expression is Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+] \n\nAssuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)^2+ is equal to [H+], and that [Fe^3+] \u2248 C - [H+]. \n\nIf Ka is very large (like 1e+25), then the reaction goes to completion. \n\nSo [Fe^3+] \u22480, and [H+] \u2248 sqrt(Ka * C) ?\n\nWait, no, if Ka is very large, the reaction goes to completion, so [H+] \u2248 C. \n\nWait, but this might not be correct. Let's consider:\n\nIf Ka is very large (like 1e25), then the reaction proceeds until the reactants are almost gone. \n\nThe initial concentration of Fe^3+ is C =0.00935 M.\n\nAt equilibrium, let x be the concentration of H+ produced. \n\nThen:\n\nKa = (x)(x)/(C -x) = x\u00b2/(C -x) \u2248 x\u00b2/C (since x ~ C)\n\nSet to Ka:\n\nx\u00b2 / C \u2248 Ka \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt( C * Ka )\n\nPlugging in:\n\nC =0.00935 M,\n\nKa = 3.58e25,\n\nSo x = sqrt( 0.00935 * 3.58e25 ) = sqrt(3.35e23) \u2248 5.79e11 M.\n\nWhich is impossible, because that's way too high. So this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the error is in the relation between Ka and Ksp. \n\nWait, let's re-derive this properly.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this is:\n\nK = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] \n\nThis K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39,\n\nthen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nSo the equilibrium constant K is 3.58e-4.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 3.58e-4.\n\nAssuming that the initial [Fe^3+] is 0.00935 M, and that the change in [Fe^3+] is -x, then:\n\n[H+] = (3x), and [Fe^3+] =0.00935 -x.\n\nThus:\n\n( (3x)^3 ) / (0.00935 -x) =3.58e-4.\n\nAssuming that x is small compared to 0.00935:\n\nApproximate to:\n\n27x^3 /0.00935 \u22483.58e-4 \u2192 x^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u22481.237e-7 \u2192 x \u2248 cube root(1.237e-7) \u2248 0.00498 M.\n\nThus, [H+] =3x \u22480.0149 M \u2192 pH =-log(0.0149) \u22481.83.\n\nThis is the same result as before. \n\nBut none of the options have pH around 1.8. The closest is option C (2.04) or B (2.69). \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of Fe(OH)3?\n\nLet me recheck that. \n\nFe: 55.85 g/mol,\n\nO: 16*3 =48,\n\nH:3*1=3 \u2192 total 55.85+48+3 = 106.85 g/mol. That's correct.\n\n0.1 g /106.85 g/mol =0.000935 mol. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question assumes that the acid is in excess? Or that the Fe^3+ doesn't hydrolyze? That can't be because then the pH would be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that the solution is simply the acid in water, so the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that can't be, because the acid is exactly neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3.\n\nWait, let's calculate the total H+:\n\nThe acid provides n_H+ =0.1 M *V. \n\nThe Fe(OH)3 requires n_H+ =3*0.000935 mol.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n0.1 *V = 0.002805 \u2192 V=28.05 cm3. So no excess H+.\n\nThus, the solution contains Fe^3+ and water. The pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which we calculated as pH ~1.83. \n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the pH to be calculated from the excess H+ after neutralization, but that would require adding more acid than stoichiometric, which would give a lower pH. \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum volume\". The minimum is exactly the stoichiometric amount, so there is no excess H+. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Fe^3+ concentration is diluted to 100 cm3, so the initial assumption of C is correct. \n\nHmm. Let me look at the answer options again:\n\nOption C is pH 2.04, which would correspond to [H+] = 1e-2.04 \u22480.0091 M \u2192 pH of 2.04.\n\nIf I have an error in the cube root calculation, perhaps.\n\nLet me recalculate the a value:\n\nWith K=3.58e-4, C=0.00935.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a) =3.58e-4.\n\nAssume a is small, so denominator \u22480.00935.\n\nThus:\n\n27a^3 \u2248 3.58e-4 *0.00935 \u2192 a^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u22481.237e-7 \u2192 a \u2248 (1.237e-7)^(1/3).\n\nCube root of 1.237e-7:\n\nLet me compute 1e-7's cube root is 4.64e-3,\n\n1.237 times that is 4.64e-3 * cube_root(1.237).\n\nCube root of 1.237 is approx 1.07 (since 1.07^3 = 1.225), so:\n\na \u22484.64e-3 *1.07 \u22485.0e-3 M.\n\nThus, a is 0.005 M, so [H+] =3a =0.015 M \u2192 pH is -log(0.015) =1.823. Still around 1.82.\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question uses a different Ksp value. \n\nFor instance, if Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is taken as 4e-38, then:\n\nK = (1e-14)^3 /4e-38 = 1e-42/(4e-38)=2.5e-5.\n\nThen, K=2.5e-5.\n\nThe equation:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a)=2.5e-5.\n\nAssuming a is small,\n\n27a^3 \u22482.5e-5 *0.00935 \u2192a^3 \u2248 (2.5e-5 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (2.3375e-7)/27 \u22488.657e-9 \u2192 a\u2248 cube root(8.657e-9)= approx 0.00205 M.\n\nThus, [H+]=3*0.00205=0.00615 M \u2192 pH =-log(0.00615)=2.21.\n\nStill not matching any option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ksp is taken as 1e-38:\n\nThen K=1e-42/1e-38 =1e-4.\n\nEquation:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a)=1e-4.\n\nAssuming a small:\n\na^3\u2248 (1e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u22489.35e-7/27\u22483.46e-8 \u2192 a\u2248cube root(3.46e-8)\u22483.26e-3 M.\n\n[H+]=3*0.00326=0.00978 \u2192 pH ~2.01. \n\nAh! That's very close to option C's pH of 2.04. \n\nSo if Ksp is taken as 1e-38, the pH is around 2.01, which is close to option C's 2.04. \n\nPerhaps the problem uses a different Ksp value, like 1e-38. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be option C: pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated as follows:\n\nThe Fe^3+ concentration is 0.00935 M. The hydrolysis produces H+.\n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a metal salt is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nBut pKa is for the Fe^3+ as an acid. \n\npKa = -log(Ka).\n\nKa = Kw / Kb.\n\nBut Kb for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp. So:\n\nKa = 1e-14 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 1e-38, then Ka =1e-14/1e-38 =1e24.\n\npKa = -log(1e24) =-24.\n\nThus, pH =1/2*(-24 + log(0.00935)).\n\nlog(0.00935)= log(9.35e-3)= ~-2.03.\n\nThus,\n\npH =1/2*(-24 -2.03)=1/2*(-26.03)= -13.015. That's impossible. \n\nHmm, that approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula when the hydrolysis is of a metal ion:\n\nThe concentration of H+ is sqrt( (Kw * Ksp)/[Fe^3+] )\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nK = [H+]^3/[Fe^3+] = Kw^3/Ksp \u2192 rearranged:\n\n[H+]^3 = (Kw^3/Ksp)*[Fe^3+]\n\nThus,\n\n[H+] = (Kw^(3/3) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3)) / (Ksp^(1/3)) ?\n\nWait:\n\n[H+]^3 = (Kw^3/Ksp)*[Fe^3+] \u2192 \n\n[H+] = ( Kw * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3) )\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+]^3 = ( (Kw^3)/Ksp ) * [Fe^3+] \n\n=> [H+] = [ (Kw^3 * [Fe^3+]) / Ksp ]^(1/3)\n\n= Kw * ( [Fe^3+]/Ksp )^(1/3) \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKw = 1e-14,\n\n[Fe^3+] =0.00935 M,\n\nKsp = let's assume 1e-38 for this calculation.\n\n[H+] = (1e-14) * (0.00935 / 1e-38)^(1/3) \n\n=1e-14 * (9.35e-3 /1e-38)^(1/3)\n\n=1e-14 * (9.35e35)^(1/3)\n\n9.35e35^(1/3)= (9.35)^(1/3) * (1e35)^(1/3)\n\n\u22482.11 * 1e11.666 \u2192 1e11.666 is approx 4.6e11.\n\nThus, 2.11 *4.6e11 \u22489.7e11.\n\nThus, [H+] =1e-14 *9.7e11 =9.7e-3 \u2192 pH =-log(9.7e-3)= 2.01.\n\nAh! That's exactly the calculation I did earlier with Ksp=1e-38 gives pH\u22482.01, which matches option C's 2.04. \n\nSo if the Ksp used in the problem is 1e-38, then the pH is ~2.01, which rounds to 2.04 (maybe with more precise calculation). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a solution with a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic acid required and the resulting pH. \n\nFirst, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a base. When you dissolve it in an acid, the acid will neutralize the hydroxide ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ from the acid. Since it's a monobasic acid, each molecule donates one H+.\n\nThe formula for Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. The reaction would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh right, because each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize them. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 to 3 moles H+.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. \n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol \u2248 0.000936 mol (since 0.1 divided by approx 106.85). Let me check that calculation again. Let me compute 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's see, 106.85 is about 107, so 0.1/107 is about 0.0009346... so approximately 9.346e-4 mol.\n\nSince the reaction requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, the total moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.346e-4 \u2248 0.0028038 mol. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.0028038 / 0.1 = 0.028038 liters, which is 28.038 cm3. Hmm, so that's about 28.04 cm3. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm3, which is close. But let me check the options again. Option C's volume is 28.05 cm3, so that's probably the correct volume. \n\nNow, the pH part. After neutralization, the solution should have excess acid? Wait, but if we use exactly the right amount of acid to neutralize Fe(OH)3, then all the OH- from Fe(OH)3 would be neutralized, but the resulting solution would have Fe^3+ ions. But Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water. Wait, so maybe the pH isn't just from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the excess H+ from the acid determines the pH. Wait, but if the acid is exactly the amount needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, then there's no excess H+? Wait, but maybe the question is saying the minimum volume needed so that all Fe(OH)3 dissolves. So that would require at least enough acid to neutralize all the OH- in the Fe(OH)3. Because if you don't have enough acid, the Fe(OH)3 would precipitate. So the minimum volume is exactly the stoichiometric amount. \n\nIn that case, the H+ is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+ left. But then, what determines the pH?\n\nWait, but maybe after neutralization, the Fe^3+ will react with water. The hydrolysis reaction would be Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the Fe^3+ is acting as an acid, releasing H+ ions. Therefore, the solution would be acidic because of the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the pH considering the hydrolysis. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's recap:\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.85 \u2248 0.000935 mol.\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 0.002805 mol.\n\nVolume of acid: 28.05 cm\u00b3 (since 0.002805 / 0.1 = 0.02805 L = 28.05 cm3). That matches option C's volume. So the volume part is likely option C.\n\nNow pH: Since the acid is just enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, there's no excess H+. The solution contains Fe^3+ in water. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, producing H+ ions. So the pH will depend on the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ in solution: total volume is 100 cm3. The moles of Fe^3+ are same as moles of Fe(OH)3, since each Fe(OH)3 gives one Fe^3+.\n\nSo concentration of Fe^3+ is (0.000935 mol) / 0.1 L = 0.00935 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be calculated from the Kb of Fe(OH)3. Wait, since Fe(OH)3 is a base, its Kb is related to the Ka of its conjugate acid. Alternatively, the solubility product Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known, but maybe we can use that here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Let me recall that the solubility product for Fe(OH)3 is very small, which means it's not very soluble. But in this case, we are dissolving it in acid, so it's already dissolved. However, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would depend on its concentration. Alternatively, maybe the pH can be found using the hydrolysis equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, the pH can be calculated using the formula for the acidity of a salt of a weak base. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, Fe^3+ is its conjugate acid.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be Kw / Ka, but perhaps more straightforward to use the Ksp.\n\nWait, let's think again. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-\n\nThe Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nBut in our case, the solution is made by adding acid to dissolve it. The resulting solution has Fe^3+ in solution, and the H+ from the acid. However, if we used exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, then the solution is just Fe^3+ in water. The H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Ka = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAlternatively, since Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, then the Kb (base dissociation) for Fe(OH)3 would be Ksp / Kw? Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the Fe^3+ is acting as an acid. The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe^3+ can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe relation between Ksp and Ka for the conjugate acid:\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is given by:\n\nKsp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.\n\nThe conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(H2O)6^3+, which can lose a proton to form Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+ and H+.\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(H2O)5(OH)^2+] / [Fe(H2O)6^3+]\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the hydrolysis equilibrium of Fe^3+:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)^2+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be related to the Ksp and Kw. Let me see.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is equal to the product of the concentration of Fe^3+ and (OH^-)^3. \n\nThe solubility of Fe(OH)3 in pure water would be determined by Ksp, but in our case, the solution has excess H+ from the acid, so the Fe^3+ is in solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can calculate the pH using the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base. \n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa - log C)\n\nWait, perhaps the pKa here is for the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. Let me think:\n\nThe Fe(OH)3 is a base, so its conjugate acid is Fe(OH)2+ (since when it gains a H+, it becomes Fe(OH)2+? Not sure, but perhaps the pKa is related to the Ksp and Kw.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka for Fe^3+ can be found by:\n\nKa = Kw / Kb(Fe(OH)3)\n\nWait, Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be the base dissociation. Since Fe(OH)3 is a base, it can accept a proton?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Wait, since this is a problem-solving scenario, maybe I need to recall that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is around 4e-38? Wait, no, maybe 2.79\u00d710^-39? Let me see, but perhaps I can use the Ksp value here.\n\nAssuming Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 4e-38 (I think the exact value might be needed here. Wait, maybe I should derive the pH in terms of Ksp.\n\nLet me suppose that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known. Let me denote Ksp as K. Then, when Fe^3+ is in solution, the hydrolysis is such that:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+\n\nWait, that's another way to write the reverse of the dissolution. So the equilibrium is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-\n\nBut if we have Fe^3+ in solution, and we're considering the hydrolysis, then the reverse reaction would be:\n\nFe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s)\n\nBut in solution, the presence of H+ from acid would shift the equilibrium. Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is as follows:\n\nFe^3+ (aq) + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+ (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this is Ka = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nThe Ka here can be related to the Ksp and Kw. Let me see:\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. \n\nThe reaction for the dissolution is Fe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^-.\n\nThe reverse reaction (precipitation) would require that [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 exceeds Ksp. \n\nBut in the solution, to keep Fe^3+ dissolved, the concentration of OH^- must be low enough so that [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 < Ksp. \n\nAlternatively, considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the hydrolysis steps can be considered in multiple steps, but maybe it's easier to think of the overall reaction.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might expect a simpler approach, perhaps the pH can be found by considering the excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but in this case, the acid was exactly the amount needed to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume\". To dissolve it, you need to add enough acid to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So the minimum volume of acid is exactly the stoichiometric amount. But then, after that, the solution contains Fe^3+ in water. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis will produce H+, so the pH will be acidic.\n\nTo calculate the pH, we can use the formula for the hydrolysis of a metal ion. For a salt of a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + pC - log C)\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis equation is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nBut since the Fe(OH)^2+ is in solution, the concentration of Fe^3+ and Fe(OH)^2+ are related. Let's assume that the concentration of Fe^3+ is approximately equal to the initial concentration (since hydrolysis is small?), but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka here can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 (as a base) would be Ksp / Kw, but perhaps I'm mixing things up here.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction Fe(OH)3 \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^- has Ksp. \n\nThe conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)2+ (since adding a proton to Fe(OH)3 would give Fe(OH)2+ plus H2O?), but maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nBecause:\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3OH^- (Ksp).\n\nThe reverse reaction (hydrolysis) is Fe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s), with K = 1/Ksp.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction as written (Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)3 + 3H+) can be seen as combining the reverse dissolution with 3 H2O \u2192 3 H+ + 3 OH^- (from Kw). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+\n\nThis can be considered as the sum of:\n\n1. Fe^3+ + 3OH^- \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) (K1 = 1/Ksp)\n\n2. 3H2O \u21cc 3H+ + 3OH^- (K2 = (Kw)^3 )\n\nSo the overall K is (K1)*(K2) = (1/Ksp)*(Kw)^3.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis is Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nTherefore, K = (1.0e-14)^3 / Ksp.\n\nAssuming Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 4e-38 (since I remember that Fe(OH)3 has a very low solubility), then:\n\nK = (1e-42) / (4e-38) = (1/4) * 1e-4 = 2.5e-5.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. If Ksp is 4e-38, then 1e-42 divided by 4e-38 is (1/4) * 1e-4 = 2.5e-5. Hmm, so the equilibrium constant K for the hydrolysis is 2.5e-5. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the hydrolysis reaction has a small K, meaning it doesn't proceed much. Wait, but if K is 2.5e-5, then the reaction is not very favorable. Hmm, maybe I made an error in the K calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is different. Let me recall: The solubility product for iron(III) hydroxide is around 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 at 25\u00b0C. Let me use that value.\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42) / (2.79e-39) \u2248 (1 / 2.79) * 1e-3 \u2248 0.358e-3 \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nSo K \u2248 3.58e-4. That's the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis reaction.\n\nSo the reaction Fe^3+ + 3H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ has K \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the reverse of this reaction? Let me clarify:\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would produce H+ ions, so the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.\n\nBut the K for this is 3.58e-4. Since K is small, the reaction doesn't proceed much, meaning that the concentration of H+ produced is small. Wait, but since K is the equilibrium constant, perhaps we can model this using an ICE table.\n\nLet me denote the initial concentration of Fe^3+ as C = 0.00935 M (since 0.1g / 106.85g/mol \u2248 0.000935 mol in 0.1 L \u2192 0.00935 M).\n\nLet me let x be the concentration of H+ produced. Then, for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, we get 3x H+ (since each reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up variables properly. Let me think:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nLet the change be: suppose that a small amount 'a' of Fe^3+ reacts. Then:\n\n[Fe^3+] = C - a\n\n[H+] = 3a (since each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+)\n\nBut since the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's not in the expression. The equilibrium expression is:\n\nK = [H+]^3 / ([Fe^3+]) \n\nBecause the reaction's K is [Fe(OH)3(s) is not included, so the expression is ( [H+]^3 ) / ([Fe^3+]) = K.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nK = ( (3a)^3 ) / (C - a) \n\nWe can assume that a is small compared to C (since K is small?), so that (C - a) \u2248 C.\n\nThen:\n\nK \u2248 (27 a^3) / C \u2192 a^3 \u2248 (K*C)/27 \u2192 a \u2248 cube root( (K*C)/27 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK = 3.58e-4\n\nC = 0.00935 M.\n\nSo:\n\na^3 = (3.58e-4 * 0.00935) / 27 \u2248 (3.58e-4 * 0.00935) = let's compute that first.\n\n3.58e-4 * 0.00935 \u2248 3.58 * 0.00935 * 1e-4 \u2248 (0.033437) * 1e-4 = 3.3437e-6.\n\nDivide by 27: 3.3437e-6 / 27 \u2248 1.238e-7.\n\nSo a^3 \u2248 1.238e-7 \u2192 a \u2248 (1.238e-7)^(1/3).\n\nLet me compute the cube root of 1.238e-7.\n\nCube root of 1e-7 is 1e-7^(1/3) \u2248 4.64e-3 (since (4.64)^3 \u2248 100, so 4.64e-3^3 = ~1e-7).\n\n1.238e-7 is about 1.238 times that. So cube root of 1.238 is about 1.07, so total a \u2248 1.07 * 4.64e-3 \u2248 4.92e-3 M.\n\nWait, but that would mean a is ~0.00492 M, which is not negligible compared to C (0.00935). Hmm, so my initial assumption that a << C may not hold. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to solve it more accurately.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nK = ( (3a)^3 ) / (C - a) \n\nWe can write this as:\n\n27 a^3 / (C - a) = K\n\n=> 27 a^3 = K (C - a)\n\n=> 27 a^3 + K a - K C = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation. Maybe approximate?\n\nAlternatively, let's plug in K = 3.58e-4 and C = 0.00935.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n27 a^3 + (3.58e-4) a - (3.58e-4)(0.00935) = 0\n\nLet me compute the last term:\n\n3.58e-4 * 0.00935 \u2248 3.58e-4 * 9.35e-3 = (3.58 * 9.35) * 1e-7 \u2248 33.4 * 1e-7 \u2248 3.34e-6.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n27 a^3 + 0.000358 a - 0.00000334 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps this is manageable numerically.\n\nLet me try a = 0.001 (1e-3):\n\n27*(1e-9) + 0.000358*(0.001) - 0.00000334\n\n= 2.7e-8 + 3.58e-7 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 3.85e-7 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -2.95e-6 (negative)\n\na=0.002:\n\n27*(8e-9) + 0.000358*(0.002) - 3.34e-6\n\n= 2.16e-7 + 7.16e-7 - 3.34e-6 = (9.32e-7) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -2.4e-6 (still negative)\n\na=0.003:\n\n27*(27e-9) + 0.000358*(0.003) - 3.34e-6\n\n= 7.29e-7 + 1.074e-6 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 (1.8e-6) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 -1.54e-6 (still negative)\n\na=0.004:\n\n27*(64e-9) + 0.000358*0.004 - 3.34e-6\n\n= 1.728e-6 + 1.432e-6 - 3.34e-6 \u2248 (3.16e-6) -3.34e-6 \u2248 -1.8e-7 (closer)\n\na=0.0045:\n\n27*(0.0045)^3 + ... \n\nWait, let me compute a=0.0045:\n\na^3 = (0.0045)^3 = 9.1125e-8.\n\n27 *9.1125e-8 = 2.46e-6\n\n0.000358 *0.0045 = 1.611e-6\n\nTotal: 2.46e-6 +1.611e-6 -3.34e-6 = (4.071e-6) - 3.34e-6 \u2248 7.31e-7 (positive)\n\nSo between 0.004 and 0.0045.\n\nLet's try a=0.0043:\n\na=0.0043:\n\na^3 = (0.0043)^3 = (4.3e-3)^3 = 79.507e-9 = 7.95e-7\n\n27 *7.95e-7 \u2248 2.146e-5 ?\n\nWait, 27 *7.95e-7 = 27 * 7.95 = 214.65; times 1e-7 \u2192 2.1465e-5?\n\nWait, 27 *7.95e-7: 7.95e-7 *27 = (7.95 *27) * 1e-7 = 214.65 *1e-7 = 2.1465e-5.\n\nThen, 0.000358 *0.0043 = 0.000358 *4.3e-3 = 1.5394e-6.\n\nTotal equation: 2.1465e-5 + 1.5394e-6 -3.34e-6.\n\nWait, 2.1465e-5 is 2.1465e-5, which is 21.465e-6. Adding 1.5394e-6 gives 23e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 gives 19.66e-6? Wait, no, perhaps I messed up exponents.\n\nWait, 2.1465e-5 is 21,465e-7? Wait, perhaps better to convert all terms to same exponent:\n\n2.1465e-5 = 2.1465 x 10^-5\n\n1.5394e-6 = 0.15394 x 10^-5\n\n3.34e-6 = 0.334 x10^-5\n\nSo total equation:\n\n2.1465e-5 + 0.15394e-5 -0.334e-5 = (2.1465 +0.15394 -0.334) x10^-5 = (2.1465 +0.15394 is ~2.3004 -0.334)= ~1.9664e-5. Which is positive. Hmm, but I need to find when the total is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recast all terms in terms of 1e-6:\n\n2.1465e-5 = 21.465e-6,\n\nso 21.465e-6 + 1.5394e-6 = 23.0044e-6,\n\nthen subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 23.0044 -3.34 = 19.6644e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at a=0.0043, the total is positive. At a=0.004, the total was:\n\na=0.004:\n\na^3 = (0.004)^3 = 6.4e-8 \u2192 27 *6.4e-8 = 1.728e-6 (1.728e-6)\n\n0.000358 *0.004 = 1.432e-6\n\nTotal: 1.728e-6 +1.432e-6 -3.34e-6 = (3.16e-6 -3.34e-6) = -1.8e-7.\n\nSo between a=0.004 and 0.0043, the value crosses zero. Let's try a=0.0042:\n\na=0.0042:\n\na^3 = (0.0042)^3 = 0.0042*0.0042*0.0042 = 0.0042^2=0.00001764; *0.0042 \u2192 7.359e-8.\n\n27 *7.359e-8 = 27 *7.359e-8 = (27*7.359)= 198.693e-8 \u2192 1.98693e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.0042 = 0.0000015036 (1.5036e-6)\n\nAdding: 1.98693e-6 +1.5036e-6 = 3.4905e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 0.1505e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at 0.0042, the total is positive. \n\nAt a=0.0041:\n\na^3 = (0.0041)^3 = (4.1e-3)^3 = 68.921e-9 =6.8921e-7.\n\nWait, 4.1^3 = 68.921, so 4.1e-3^3 =68.921e-9 = 6.8921e-8.\n\n27 *6.8921e-8 = 186.0867e-8 =1.860867e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.0041 =0.000358 *4.1e-3 =1.4678e-6.\n\nTotal: 1.860867e-6 +1.4678e-6 = 3.3286e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 -1.14e-7. Close to zero.\n\nSo between 0.0041 and 0.0042.\n\nLet me try a=0.00415:\n\na=0.00415:\n\na\u00b3 = (0.00415)^3 \u2248 (0.004)^3 + 3*(0.004)^2*(0.00015) + ... but maybe compute directly:\n\n0.00415^3 = (4.15e-3)^3 = (4.15)^3 *1e-9 \u2192 4.15\u00b3 = 4.15*4.15=17.2225; 17.2225 *4.15 \u2248 71.43. So 71.43e-9 \u2192 7.143e-8.\n\n27 *7.143e-8 = 1.9286e-6.\n\n0.000358 *0.00415 =0.000358 *4.15e-3 \u2248 (0.000358*4) + (0.000358*0.15e-3) \u2192 0.001432 + 0.0000537 \u2192 0.0014857 \u2192 1.4857e-3? Wait no, sorry:\n\nWait 0.00415 is 4.15e-3, so 0.000358 *0.00415 = 0.000358 *4.15e-3 = (0.000358 *4.15) *1e-3 \u2192 0.0014857 *1e-3 \u2192 1.4857e-6.\n\nSo adding to the previous term:\n\n1.9286e-6 +1.4857e-6 = 3.4143e-6. Subtract 3.34e-6 \u2192 0.0743e-6 \u2192 positive.\n\nHmm, so at a=0.00415, total is +0.0743e-6.\n\nWe need to find a where total is zero. Between a=0.0041 (total -1.14e-7) and a=0.00415 (total +0.0743e-6). Let me use linear approximation.\n\nBetween a=0.0041 and a=0.00415:\n\nAt a=0.0041 \u2192 delta = -1.14e-7.\n\nAt a=0.00415 \u2192 delta = +7.43e-8 (since 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8).\n\nWait, sorry: 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8? Wait no, 0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8? Let me see:\n\n0.0743e-6 is 7.43e-8. Yes.\n\nSo the change in a is 0.00005 (0.00415 -0.0041 = 0.00005).\n\nThe delta goes from -1.14e-7 to +7.43e-8. The total change is 7.43e-8 +1.14e-7 = 1.883e-7 over 0.00005.\n\nWe need to find the a where delta=0. Let x be the fraction between 0.0041 and 0.00415.\n\nLet delta = -1.14e-7 + ( (7.43e-8 +1.14e-7)/0.00005 ) * (a -0.0041) ) =0.\n\nWait, perhaps simpler:\n\nLet me set up the linear equation between a=0.0041 (D1=-1.14e-7) and a=0.00415 (D2=+7.43e-8).\n\nThe desired a is where D=0.\n\nThe slope is (D2 - D1)/(\u0394a) = (7.43e-8 - (-1.14e-7)) / 0.00005 = (1.883e-7)/0.00005 = 1.883e-7 /5e-5 = (1.883/5)*1e-2 = 0.3766e-2 = 0.003766 per unit a.\n\nWait, slope is delta_D per delta_a: 1.883e-7 / 0.00005 = 3.766e-3 per 1 unit a?\n\nWait, let me compute slope: (7.43e-8 - (-1.14e-7)) / (0.00005) \n\nThat's (7.43e-8 +1.14e-7) = 1.883e-7 divided by 0.00005 \u2192 1.883e-7 / 5e-5 = (1.883/5) * 1e-2 = 0.3766 * 0.01 = 0.003766 per 1 a unit? Wait, no, units are in terms of a in 0.00005 increments. \n\nAlternatively, the required delta is to cover from D1 to D=0. The fraction needed is (0 - D1)/(D2 - D1) = (1.14e-7)/(1.883e-7) \u2248 0.605.\n\nSo the a needed is 0.0041 + 0.605*(0.00005) \u2248 0.0041 + 0.00003025 = 0.00413025.\n\nSo approximately a \u22480.00413 M.\n\nThus, the [H+] is 3a = 3 *0.00413 \u22480.0124 M.\n\nWait, but wait: in the reaction equation, each Fe^3+ that reacts gives 3 H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. So the H+ concentration is 3a. \n\nWait, but according to the equation setup, the H+ is 3a, yes. So if a is ~0.00413 M, then [H+] is 3 *0.00413 \u22480.0124 M. \n\nThe pH would be -log(0.0124) \u2248 1.907. \n\nHmm, which is close to option C's pH of 2.04 or B's 2.69. \n\nHmm, but perhaps my Ksp value was incorrect. Let me check Ksp of Fe(OH)3 again. \n\nWait, perhaps I used the wrong Ksp. Let me confirm. A quick recall: the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is actually around 2.79\u00d710^-39 at 25\u00b0C. Let me recalculate with that exact value.\n\nSo Ksp = 2.79e-39.\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) \u2248 3.58e-4 (same as before). So my earlier calculation holds.\n\nHmm, but then the pH came out to around 1.9, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C (pH 2.04) or B (2.69). \n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that [Fe^3+] is C - a is leading to inaccuracies. Let me try another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of a metal ion. The general formula for the pH of a solution of a metal salt is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nWait, the formula for a metal ion (acting as an acid) is:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / [Fe^3+] \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H3O+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [H3O+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAssuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)^2+ is equal to the concentration of H+ (since each Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes produces one H+?), but actually each Fe^3+ produces one H+ per hydrolysis step. Wait, but the reaction is producing one H+ per Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes. So for each mole of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, you get one mole of H+. \n\nWait, but the reaction as written produces one H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. So if x is the amount of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, then:\n\n[Fe^3+] = C - x,\n\n[H+] = x,\n\n[Fe(OH)^2+] = x,\n\nSo the Ka expression is:\n\nKa = (x)(x)/(C -x) = x\u00b2/(C -x)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nKa = x\u00b2/(C -x)\n\nBut earlier approach considered a different reaction (the full hydrolysis to Fe(OH)3), which might have different stoichiometry. So perhaps this is a better way.\n\nWait, this is a different approach. Let me see:\n\nAssuming the hydrolysis is stepwise, and the first proton is released, then:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+ \n\nThe Ka here is for this first proton.\n\nIf I can find the Ka for this reaction, then I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka can be calculated from the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3 + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)2+ + OH^- \n\nWait, but that's not the right reaction. \n\nAlternatively, the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)2+H, so the Ka would be:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nAnd the relation between Ka and Ksp:\n\nThe Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 \n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3 \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- \u2192 Ksp.\n\nThe conjugate acid would be Fe(OH)2+ (since adding a proton to Fe^3+ would form Fe(OH)^2+?), so the Ka for the conjugate acid is Kw * Ksp^(1/3) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ka can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe reaction for the hydrolysis is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+]\n\nThe reverse reaction (the dissolution of Fe(OH)3) is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- \u2192 Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.\n\nThe reaction for hydrolysis can be seen as the sum of the reverse dissolution and the protonation of OH-:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + H+ \n\nWhich is the same as the dissolution reversed plus H2O \u2192 H+ + OH^-.\n\nWait, the hydrolysis reaction can be written as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nThis has the equilibrium constant K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] \n\nWhich is the same as before. So this gives us the same expression as before. \n\nThus, the previous calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the pH came out to around 1.9, which is close to option C (2.04). Maybe I made a calculation mistake in the approximation.\n\nAlternatively, let's try using the first approach with the a value.\n\nIf the [H+] is 3a = 0.0124 M, then pH = -log(0.0124) \u2248 1.907. But option C says pH 2.04. Hmm, maybe the Ksp value I used was incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Suppose the Ksp is actually 2.79e-38 instead of 39. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Ksp = 2.79e-38:\n\nThen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-38) = 1e-42 / 2.79e-38 \u2248 3.58e-5.\n\nSo K is 3.58e-5. \n\nThen redo the equation with K=3.58e-5 and C=0.00935.\n\nEquation:\n\n27a^3/(C -a) = K \u2192 27a\u00b3/(0.00935 -a) = 3.58e-5.\n\nAssume a is small compared to C (0.00935), then:\n\n27a\u00b3 \u2248 3.58e-5 *0.00935 \u2192 a\u00b3 \u2248 (3.58e-5 * 0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-7)/27 \u2248 1.237e-8 \u2192 a \u2248 cube root(1.237e-8) \u2248 2.31e-3 M.\n\nThus, a \u22480.00231 M. Then [H+] =3a =0.00693 M \u2192 pH = -log(0.00693) \u22482.16, which matches option A's pH of 3.16? No, 2.16 is close to option C's 2.04.\n\nWait, 0.00693 M H+ gives pH of log(1/0.00693) \u2248 log(144) \u22482.16. \n\nHmm, so if the Ksp was 1e-38, then the pH would be 2.16, which is still close to option C's 2.04. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that the Fe^3+ is a weak acid with a certain Ka. The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak acid.\n\nThe concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00935 M. The Ka for Fe^3+ is given by Ka = Kw * Ksp^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is Ksp / Kw.\n\nWait, the Kb for Fe(OH)3 would be Ksp / [H+]^3 ?\n\nAlternatively, the relation between Ka and Ksp is:\n\nFor the hydrolysis Fe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+,\n\nthe Ka is (Kw * Ksp)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, here's an alternative method:\n\nThe hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = (Kw)^3 / Ksp.\n\nSo, K = (1e-14)^3 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39:\n\nK = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) = ~3.58e-4.\n\nThe reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+ consumed. Let\u2019s let x be the amount of Fe^3+ that reacts.\n\nThen:\n\nK = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] = ( (3x)^3 ) / (C -x) = 27x^3/(C -x).\n\nAssuming x is small compared to C (0.00935), then:\n\n27x^3 \u2248 K*C \u2192 x^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u2248 1.237e-7 \u2192 x \u2248 (1.237e-7)^(1/3) \u2248 0.00498 M.\n\nThen [H+] =3x \u2248 0.0149 M \u2192 pH \u2248-log(0.0149) \u22481.83. Which is still around 1.83, but the options don't have this. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the question says \"dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume\". So the total volume is 100 cm3. The acid's volume plus the Fe(OH)3's volume (but probably negligible) should add to 100 cm3. So the volume of acid must be less than 100 cm3. \n\nThe options give volumes like 28, 30, 32 cm3, which add up to under 100, so that's okay.\n\nNow the pH options are 2.04 (C), 2.69 (B), 3.16 (A), etc. \n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid?\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the acid is exactly the stoichiometric amount. Because if you add a monobasic acid, say HCl, then each mole of HCl provides one mole of H+.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe^3+ + 3H2O. \n\nThe moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1g / molar mass. \n\nAs before, moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.85 \u22480.000935 mol. \n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 *0.000935 = 0.002805 mol. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002805 /0.1 =0.02805 L =28.05 cm3. That matches option C's volume.\n\nNow, the total volume is 100 cm3. The acid contributes 28.05 cm3, so the rest is water. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm3. So when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume becomes 100 cm3. Therefore, the volume of acid must be such that when you add it to the solution, the total is 100 cm3. \n\nBut in any case, the calculation of the volume is correct as 28.05 cm3. \n\nNow, the pH. \n\nThe question is, after adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and no excess H+ (since the acid was just enough to neutralize the OH-). But the Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze to produce H+, thus lowering the pH below neutral. \n\nSo the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. \n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base. \n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak base is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nWait, but what's the pKa here?\n\nThe pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the Fe^3+ ion. \n\nThe Ka for Fe^3+ can be calculated using the Ksp and Kw.\n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nThe Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nKb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3(s)] \u2192 but since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, the Kb is simply [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp.\n\nWait, the Kb for the base Fe(OH)3 is actually the same as Ksp. \n\nThen, the conjugate acid's Ka is Kw / Kb = Kw / Ksp.\n\nWait, the conjugate acid here would be Fe(OH)2+, so:\n\nKa = Kw / Kb = (1e-14)/ (Ksp).\n\nWait, but Kb here is the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3, which is equal to Ksp. \n\nThus, Ka = 1e-14 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39:\n\nKa = 1e-14 / 2.79e-39 \u2248 3.58e+25. \n\nWait, that's a very large Ka, which makes sense because Fe^3+ is a strong acid. \n\nWait, but how does this help us?\n\nThe Ka is so large that the Fe^3+ will almost completely hydrolyze. \n\nWait, but if the Ka is 3.58e+25, which is extremely large, then the Fe^3+ will almost fully react to form H+ and Fe(OH)^2+. \n\nThe concentration of H+ would then be approximately sqrt(Ka * C).\n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)^2+\n\nThe expression is Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)^2+] / [Fe^3+] \n\nAssuming that the concentration of Fe(OH)^2+ is equal to [H+], and that [Fe^3+] \u2248 C - [H+]. \n\nIf Ka is very large (like 1e+25), then the reaction goes to completion. \n\nSo [Fe^3+] \u22480, and [H+] \u2248 sqrt(Ka * C) ?\n\nWait, no, if Ka is very large, the reaction goes to completion, so [H+] \u2248 C. \n\nWait, but this might not be correct. Let's consider:\n\nIf Ka is very large (like 1e25), then the reaction proceeds until the reactants are almost gone. \n\nThe initial concentration of Fe^3+ is C =0.00935 M.\n\nAt equilibrium, let x be the concentration of H+ produced. \n\nThen:\n\nKa = (x)(x)/(C -x) = x\u00b2/(C -x) \u2248 x\u00b2/C (since x ~ C)\n\nSet to Ka:\n\nx\u00b2 / C \u2248 Ka \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt( C * Ka )\n\nPlugging in:\n\nC =0.00935 M,\n\nKa = 3.58e25,\n\nSo x = sqrt( 0.00935 * 3.58e25 ) = sqrt(3.35e23) \u2248 5.79e11 M.\n\nWhich is impossible, because that's way too high. So this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps the error is in the relation between Ka and Ksp. \n\nWait, let's re-derive this properly.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this is:\n\nK = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] \n\nThis K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 2.79e-39,\n\nthen K = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) = (1e-42)/(2.79e-39) \u2248 3.58e-4.\n\nSo the equilibrium constant K is 3.58e-4.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 3.58e-4.\n\nAssuming that the initial [Fe^3+] is 0.00935 M, and that the change in [Fe^3+] is -x, then:\n\n[H+] = (3x), and [Fe^3+] =0.00935 -x.\n\nThus:\n\n( (3x)^3 ) / (0.00935 -x) =3.58e-4.\n\nAssuming that x is small compared to 0.00935:\n\nApproximate to:\n\n27x^3 /0.00935 \u22483.58e-4 \u2192 x^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u22481.237e-7 \u2192 x \u2248 cube root(1.237e-7) \u2248 0.00498 M.\n\nThus, [H+] =3x \u22480.0149 M \u2192 pH =-log(0.0149) \u22481.83.\n\nThis is the same result as before. \n\nBut none of the options have pH around 1.8. The closest is option C (2.04) or B (2.69). \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of Fe(OH)3?\n\nLet me recheck that. \n\nFe: 55.85 g/mol,\n\nO: 16*3 =48,\n\nH:3*1=3 \u2192 total 55.85+48+3 = 106.85 g/mol. That's correct.\n\n0.1 g /106.85 g/mol =0.000935 mol. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question assumes that the acid is in excess? Or that the Fe^3+ doesn't hydrolyze? That can't be because then the pH would be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that the solution is simply the acid in water, so the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that can't be, because the acid is exactly neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3.\n\nWait, let's calculate the total H+:\n\nThe acid provides n_H+ =0.1 M *V. \n\nThe Fe(OH)3 requires n_H+ =3*0.000935 mol.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n0.1 *V = 0.002805 \u2192 V=28.05 cm3. So no excess H+.\n\nThus, the solution contains Fe^3+ and water. The pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which we calculated as pH ~1.83. \n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the pH to be calculated from the excess H+ after neutralization, but that would require adding more acid than stoichiometric, which would give a lower pH. \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum volume\". The minimum is exactly the stoichiometric amount, so there is no excess H+. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Fe^3+ concentration is diluted to 100 cm3, so the initial assumption of C is correct. \n\nHmm. Let me look at the answer options again:\n\nOption C is pH 2.04, which would correspond to [H+] = 1e-2.04 \u22480.0091 M \u2192 pH of 2.04.\n\nIf I have an error in the cube root calculation, perhaps.\n\nLet me recalculate the a value:\n\nWith K=3.58e-4, C=0.00935.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a) =3.58e-4.\n\nAssume a is small, so denominator \u22480.00935.\n\nThus:\n\n27a^3 \u2248 3.58e-4 *0.00935 \u2192 a^3 \u2248 (3.58e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (3.34e-6)/27 \u22481.237e-7 \u2192 a \u2248 (1.237e-7)^(1/3).\n\nCube root of 1.237e-7:\n\nLet me compute 1e-7's cube root is 4.64e-3,\n\n1.237 times that is 4.64e-3 * cube_root(1.237).\n\nCube root of 1.237 is approx 1.07 (since 1.07^3 = 1.225), so:\n\na \u22484.64e-3 *1.07 \u22485.0e-3 M.\n\nThus, a is 0.005 M, so [H+] =3a =0.015 M \u2192 pH is -log(0.015) =1.823. Still around 1.82.\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question uses a different Ksp value. \n\nFor instance, if Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is taken as 4e-38, then:\n\nK = (1e-14)^3 /4e-38 = 1e-42/(4e-38)=2.5e-5.\n\nThen, K=2.5e-5.\n\nThe equation:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a)=2.5e-5.\n\nAssuming a is small,\n\n27a^3 \u22482.5e-5 *0.00935 \u2192a^3 \u2248 (2.5e-5 *0.00935)/27 \u2248 (2.3375e-7)/27 \u22488.657e-9 \u2192 a\u2248 cube root(8.657e-9)= approx 0.00205 M.\n\nThus, [H+]=3*0.00205=0.00615 M \u2192 pH =-log(0.00615)=2.21.\n\nStill not matching any option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ksp is taken as 1e-38:\n\nThen K=1e-42/1e-38 =1e-4.\n\nEquation:\n\n27a^3/(0.00935 -a)=1e-4.\n\nAssuming a small:\n\na^3\u2248 (1e-4 *0.00935)/27 \u22489.35e-7/27\u22483.46e-8 \u2192 a\u2248cube root(3.46e-8)\u22483.26e-3 M.\n\n[H+]=3*0.00326=0.00978 \u2192 pH ~2.01. \n\nAh! That's very close to option C's pH of 2.04. \n\nSo if Ksp is taken as 1e-38, the pH is around 2.01, which is close to option C's 2.04. \n\nPerhaps the problem uses a different Ksp value, like 1e-38. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be option C: pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated as follows:\n\nThe Fe^3+ concentration is 0.00935 M. The hydrolysis produces H+.\n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a metal salt is:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKa + log C)\n\nBut pKa is for the Fe^3+ as an acid. \n\npKa = -log(Ka).\n\nKa = Kw / Kb.\n\nBut Kb for Fe(OH)3 is Ksp. So:\n\nKa = 1e-14 / Ksp.\n\nIf Ksp is 1e-38, then Ka =1e-14/1e-38 =1e24.\n\npKa = -log(1e24) =-24.\n\nThus, pH =1/2*(-24 + log(0.00935)).\n\nlog(0.00935)= log(9.35e-3)= ~-2.03.\n\nThus,\n\npH =1/2*(-24 -2.03)=1/2*(-26.03)= -13.015. That's impossible. \n\nHmm, that approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula when the hydrolysis is of a metal ion:\n\nThe concentration of H+ is sqrt( (Kw * Ksp)/[Fe^3+] )\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe^3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nK = [H+]^3/[Fe^3+] = Kw^3/Ksp \u2192 rearranged:\n\n[H+]^3 = (Kw^3/Ksp)*[Fe^3+]\n\nThus,\n\n[H+] = (Kw^(3/3) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3)) / (Ksp^(1/3)) ?\n\nWait:\n\n[H+]^3 = (Kw^3/Ksp)*[Fe^3+] \u2192 \n\n[H+] = ( Kw * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3) )\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+]^3 = ( (Kw^3)/Ksp ) * [Fe^3+] \n\n=> [H+] = [ (Kw^3 * [Fe^3+]) / Ksp ]^(1/3)\n\n= Kw * ( [Fe^3+]/Ksp )^(1/3) \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nKw = 1e-14,\n\n[Fe^3+] =0.00935 M,\n\nKsp = let's assume 1e-38 for this calculation.\n\n[H+] = (1e-14) * (0.00935 / 1e-38)^(1/3) \n\n=1e-14 * (9.35e-3 /1e-38)^(1/3)\n\n=1e-14 * (9.35e35)^(1/3)\n\n9.35e35^(1/3)= (9.35)^(1/3) * (1e35)^(1/3)\n\n\u22482.11 * 1e11.666 \u2192 1e11.666 is approx 4.6e11.\n\nThus, 2.11 *4.6e11 \u22489.7e11.\n\nThus, [H+] =1e-14 *9.7e11 =9.7e-3 \u2192 pH =-log(9.7e-3)= 2.01.\n\nAh! That's exactly the calculation I did earlier with Ksp=1e-38 gives pH\u22482.01, which matches option C's 2.04. \n\nSo if the Ksp used in the problem is 1e-38, then the pH is ~2.01, which rounds to 2.04 (maybe with more precise calculation). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm3.\n\n\nThe problem requires dissolving 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083 in 100 cm\u00b3 by neutralizing it with a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. \n\n**Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)\u2083**  \nMolar mass of Fe(OH)\u2083 = 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16 + 1) = 106.85 g/mol  \nMoles of Fe(OH)\u2083 = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol \u2248 0.000935 mol  \n\n**Step 2: Determine moles of H\u207a needed**  \nReaction: Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O  \nMoles of H\u207a = 3 * 0.000935 \u2248 0.002805 mol  \n\n**Step 3: Calculate volume of acid required**  \nVolume = moles / concentration = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02805 L = 28.05 cm\u00b3  \n\n**Step 4: Calculate pH of the solution**  \nThe resulting solution contains Fe\u00b3\u207a, which hydrolyzes:  \nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083(s) + 3H\u207a  \nThe equilibrium constant \\( K = \\frac{[H^+]^3}{[Fe^{3+}]} = \\frac{(K_w)^3}{K_{sp}} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 of solution, and then find the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's start by breaking this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound. To dissolve it, we need to add an acid because the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3 will react with the acid's H+ ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O. Right, because each Fe(OH)3 has three hydroxide ions, so it would need three H+ ions to neutralize them. \n\nSo, the first thing is to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The given mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol approximately. Let me check that again. Wait, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1, so each OH is 17. So three OH groups would be 3*17=51. Then Fe is about 55.85. So total is 55.85+51=106.85 g/mol. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me see: 106.85 times 0.0009 is about 0.096, so 0.000936 is around 0.000936 mol. Let's write that as 9.36 x 10^-4 mol.\n\nNow, since each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ ions, the total moles of H+ needed would be 3 times that. So 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol of H+ required. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters. Converting that to cm\u00b3 (since 1 L = 1000 cm\u00b3), that's 28.08 cm\u00b3. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm\u00b3, which is close. But let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a rounding error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 more precisely. 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85:\n\nLet me compute 106.85 * 0.000936 = 100*0.000936 = 0.0936, plus 6.85*0.000936. Wait, perhaps better to do 0.1 / 106.85. Let me compute that.\n\n0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately:\n\n106.85 goes into 0.1 how many times? 106.85 * 0.000936 is roughly 0.1, but maybe more precise:\n\nLet me compute 1/106.85 first. 1/100 is 0.01, so 1/106.85 is a bit less, like approximately 0.00936 (since 106.85 is about 100 + 6.85, so 1/(100*(1+0.0685)) \u2248 0.01/(1.0685) \u2248 0.00936). So 0.1 grams is 0.1 * (1/106.85) = 0.1 * 0.00936 \u2248 0.000936 moles. So that part is okay.\n\nSo 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol H+. \n\n0.1 M acid gives 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3. The closest option is C (28.05 cm\u00b3) but the numbers are very close. Wait, maybe the molar mass is slightly different? Let me check the exact molar mass of Fe(OH)3 again.\n\nIron's atomic weight is about 55.845 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00, Hydrogen is 1.008.\n\nSo Fe: 55.845, O: 16*3 =48, H: 3*(1.008) = 3.024. Total molar mass = 55.845 + 48 +3.024 = 55.845 +51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nSo 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009357 mol. So 3 * that is 0.002807 mol. Divided by 0.1 M gives 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3. Hmm, so the options have 28.05 cm\u00b3 for option C, which is very close. Maybe the question uses approximate molar masses. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry?\n\nWait, the question says \"monobasic strong acid\". A monobasic acid would donate one H+ per molecule. So each molecule of the acid gives one H+ ion. So the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. So, yes, the stoichiometry is correct: 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the required volume is approximately 28.07 cm\u00b3, which is closest to option C's 28.05. So the first part of the answer is option C's volume. But let's check the pH part.\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution. Hmm. Once the acid is added, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the excess H+ will determine the pH. Wait, but also, after neutralization, maybe there's some Fe\u00b3+ which can act as an acid? Or maybe the solution is just the excess H+?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me consider the steps.\n\nTotal volume of the solution is 100 cm\u00b3, but the acid is added to that total volume. Wait, the problem says \"prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution\" with a total volume of 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid is being diluted to 100 cm\u00b3 total. Wait, perhaps the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm\u00b3. So the volume of acid added plus the volume of water (or other solvent) makes up 100 cm\u00b3. But when they ask for the minimum volume of acid needed, it's the volume before dilution? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait the question says: \"the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\" The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid is part of that 100 cm\u00b3. So the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid volume is part of it, and the rest is water. Wait, but when you mix the acid with water to make 100 cm\u00b3, the total volume is the sum. But the problem is to find the minimum volume of the acid (the 0.1 M solution) needed so that when you mix it with water (or whatever) to make 100 cm\u00b3, the Fe(OH)3 dissolves completely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total volume is exactly 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid volume plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution? Hmm, but maybe the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in the acid solution, and then total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid must be in sufficient quantity to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and then the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid's volume is part of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and then water is added to reach 100 cm\u00b3. The minimum volume of acid needed would be the volume required to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and then the rest is water. Therefore, the H+ concentration after dilution would be the key for the pH.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the minimum volume of the acid. So we need just enough acid to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and then the rest is water. Because if you add more acid, you can dissolve it but you're not asked for excess. So the minimum volume is exactly the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction. But then, when you dilute to 100 cm\u00b3, the H+ concentration will be (moles of H+ from acid - moles consumed?) Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. To dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, we need to supply exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. But if we add exactly that amount, then all H+ is consumed, and there's no excess H+ left. Wait, but then where would the H+ come from for the pH?\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because if we add exactly enough acid to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, then there would be no excess H+ in solution, so the solution would be neutral? But that can't be, because Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid, but in solution, it might hydrolyze. Wait, maybe the Fe\u00b3+ is in solution and contributes H+ ions?\n\nWait, perhaps when Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ to form Fe\u00b3+ and water, the Fe\u00b3+ can then hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. So even if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the Fe\u00b3+ might act as an acid, leading to an acidic solution. Therefore, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the excess H+ is the only contributor. Wait, but if we add exactly 3 moles H+ per Fe(OH)3, then there's no excess H+. So the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+?\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-calculate the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 0.0009357 mol.\n\nEach mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to neutralize. So total H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009357 \u2248 0.002807 mol.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's the volume of acid required. So the closest option is C's 28.05 cm\u00b3. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, for the pH. The problem is, after adding exactly that volume, there's no excess H+ (since all H+ was consumed in neutralizing the Fe(OH)3). Therefore, the solution would contain Fe\u00b3+ ions and water. The Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ \n\nThis hydrolysis would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH would be determined by this hydrolysis.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nWe need the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ and then find the pH based on its hydrolysis.\n\nThe total volume is 100 cm\u00b3 (0.1 L). The moles of Fe\u00b3+ is the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009357 mol. Therefore, the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\n\nNow, to find the pH, we can model the hydrolysis. Let me denote the initial concentration of Fe\u00b3+ as 0.009357 M. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 H+ + Fe(OH)\u00b2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression would be:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)\u00b2+] / [Fe\u00b3+]\n\nBut we need to find the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, the hydrolysis constant can be related to the Kb of the conjugate base, Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ is given by the relation Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant for Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the pH of a metal ion solution. The general approach is:\n\nThe hydrolysis produces H+ ions, so the pH can be calculated by considering the hydrolysis equilibrium.\n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a metal ion (like Fe\u00b3+) is given by:\n\npH = \u00bd (pKa + pC)\n\nWhere pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the H+ from the hydrolysis, and pC is the concentration term. Wait, perhaps I need to look up the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)\u00b2+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe\u00b3+. Let me look up the Ka for Fe\u00b3+.\n\nWait, I might not have exact values here, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the H+ comes only from the excess acid?\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, if the acid is added in exactly the stoichiometric amount, then there's no excess H+, so the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here and there is actually some excess H+?\n\nWait, perhaps the question allows for the acid to be in slight excess to ensure complete dissolution, but the minimal volume would be just enough to neutralize, so no excess. Hmm, the question says \"minimum volume\", so that would be exactly the amount needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, so no excess. So the H+ comes from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Fe(OH)3 is completely dissolved, so the solution is saturated with Fe\u00b3+, but the question says \"dissolve\" so maybe it's in solution, so the hydrolysis is the key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 and the acid's effect on it.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Let me think of the dissolution in terms of the solubility product.\n\nThe solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is a known value. Let me recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 4.0 \u00d7 10^-38 (some sources say 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 or similar, but let's assume a value here). Wait, I might need to use the exact value, but since I don't have it, perhaps the problem expects using the hydrolysis approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me see the options given. The pH options are 3.16, 2.69, 2.04, 4.94. Let me see if these correspond to any simple calculations.\n\nWait, if the solution had a concentration of H+ from the excess acid, but in our case, there's no excess acid. Alternatively, maybe the question expects that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved by the acid, but the acid is in excess, so that the pH is determined by the excess H+.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose that to dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to add enough acid to provide H+ so that the pH is low enough. The reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. To dissolve the solid, the H+ must be sufficient to shift the equilibrium.\n\nThe solubility of Fe(OH)3 in pure water is very low due to its Ksp. To dissolve it, adding H+ lowers the pH, shifting the equilibrium to the right.\n\nThe minimum amount of acid needed is exactly the amount to provide the H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So, the moles of H+ required are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So that's the same as before, 0.002807 mol. So the volume is 28.07 cm\u00b3, so option C's volume is correct.\n\nNow, for the pH, the solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)3 will have the Fe\u00b3+ and the remaining H+ concentration. Wait, but if we added exactly the H+ needed, there's no excess H+ left. So the H+ must come from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. So the pH would be determined by that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: when you add the acid, the H+ from the acid is consumed in neutralizing the Fe(OH)3. The remaining solution contains Fe\u00b3+ and the excess H+? Wait, no, if you added exactly the required H+, then the H+ from the acid is all used up. But wait, the acid is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Let's think in terms of stoichiometry.\n\nSuppose the acid is HA, a monobasic strong acid. So each mole of HA gives one H+.\n\nTotal moles of H+ added = 0.1 M * V (volume in liters) = 0.1 * (V/1000) where V is in cm\u00b3. Wait, actually, if V is in cm\u00b3, then liters would be V / 1000. So moles H+ = 0.1 * (V / 1000). \n\nWe need this to be equal to 3 * moles Fe(OH)3.\n\nSo:\n\n0.1 * (V / 1000) = 3 * (0.1 / 106.869)\n\nSolving for V gives:\n\nV = (3 * 0.1 / 106.869) * (1000 / 0.1) ) \n\nWait, let me compute that again. \n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nmoles H+ = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3\n\n=> 0.1 * (V / 1000) = 3*(0.1 / 106.869)\n\nMultiply both sides by 1000:\n\n0.1 * V = 3 * 0.1 * (1000 / 106.869)\n\nWait, maybe better to rearrange:\n\nV = (3 * moles Fe(OH)3) / (0.1 M) * 1000 (to convert liters to cm\u00b3).\n\nYes, so that gives the same as before.\n\nSo the volume is correct. Now, the pH.\n\nThe Fe\u00b3+ is in solution. Let's consider its hydrolysis:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)\u00b2+] / [Fe\u00b3+]\n\nThe Ka here is the acid dissociation constant for Fe\u00b3+. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product Ksp, which is equal to [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 4.0 \u00d7 10^-38 (I think it's around that, but let me see).\n\nLet me recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is about 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, I might need to use the relation between Ksp and the hydrolysis. Let me think.\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. \n\nWait, maybe that's a better way to write it. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe\u00b3+ + 3 OH-\n\nThe Ksp is [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3.\n\nWhen we add H+, the H+ reacts with OH- to form H2O, shifting the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Fe(OH)3. \n\nTo dissolve all Fe(OH)3, the solution must have enough H+ so that the [OH-] is low enough. The minimum H+ required is such that when all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution has [Fe\u00b3+] = n(Fe(OH)3)/V, and the [OH-] is such that Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the correct approach. Let's try this.\n\nAfter adding the acid, all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, so the Fe\u00b3+ concentration is 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\n\nThe Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nWe can solve for [OH-]:\n\n[OH-] = (Ksp / [Fe\u00b3+])^(1/3)\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Let's assume Ksp is 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 (as per some references).\n\nSo:\n\n[OH-] = ( (2.79e-39) / (0.009357) )^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the numerator divided by denominator:\n\n2.79e-39 / 0.009357 \u2248 2.79e-39 / 9.357e-3 = (2.79 / 9.357) * 1e-36 \u2248 0.298 * 1e-36 = 2.98e-37.\n\nTaking the cube root: (2.98e-37)^(1/3) \u2248 (2.98)^(1/3) * (1e-37)^(1/3)\n\nCube root of 2.98 is approx 1.44, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12 (since (1e-12)^3 = 1e-36). Wait, but 1e-37 is 1e-36 * 10^-1, so cube root would be (1e-37)^(1/3) = 1e-12.333..., so approx 4.64e-13? Wait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nCube root of 2.98e-37:\n\nLet me write 2.98e-37 as 2.98 \u00d7 10^-37.\n\nThe cube root of 10^-37 is 10^(-37/3) \u2248 10^-12.333..., so 10^-12.333 is approx 4.64 \u00d710^-13 (since 10^0.333 is about 2.15, so 1/2.15 \u22480.465).\n\nSo cube root of 2.98 is approx 1.44. So total is 1.44 \u00d7 4.64e-13 \u2248 6.67e-13 M OH-.\n\nThen [OH-] \u22486.67e-13. \n\nThen [H+] = 1e-14 / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 6.67e-13 \u2248 0.01498 M. \n\nSo pH = -log10(0.01498) \u2248 1.823. \n\nHmm, that's around pH 1.82. But the options given are 3.16, 2.69, 2.04, 4.94. The closest would be option C's pH 2.04. \n\nWait, but my calculation here gives pH ~1.82, but the option C is 2.04, which is close. Maybe I used a different Ksp value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ksp value I used is incorrect. Let me check another source.\n\nWait, perhaps the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 2.79 \u00d710^-39 (from some sources), but others might say 4e-38 or different. Let me see. Let me try with Ksp = 4e-38. Then:\n\n[OH-] = (4e-38 / 0.009357)^(1/3) \n\n4e-38 / 0.009357 \u2248 4e-38 / 9.357e-3 \u2248 4.275e-36 \n\nCube root of that is (4.275e-36)^(1/3). \n\nCube root of 4.275 is ~1.62, cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So total is 1.62e-12. \n\nThen [OH-] is 1.62e-12, so [H+] = 1e-14 / 1.62e-12 = 6.17e-3, so pH \u2248 2.21. \n\nHmm, that's closer to 2.21. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ksp is 1e-38?\n\nLet me try Ksp =1e-38:\n\n[OH-] = (1e-38 /0.009357)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.069e-36)^(1/3)\n\nCube root of 1.069e-36 is approx 4.74e-12 (since (4.74)^3 \u2248 106, so 4.74e-12^3 is ~1e-35, but maybe my math is off. Let me compute more accurately:\n\n1.069e-36^(1/3) = (1.069)^(1/3) \u00d7 10^(-36/3) = approx 1.02 \u00d7 10^-12. \n\nThus [OH-] \u22481.02e-12, so [H+] = 1e-14 /1.02e-12 \u2248 0.0098, pH\u22482.01.\n\nAh, so that's about pH 2.01, which is very close to option C's 2.04. So probably the Ksp used here is around 1e-38. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the excess H+ comes from the acid and that there's some excess H+ left. Wait, but that would mean that the acid was added in excess. But the question says minimum volume, which would be exactly the amount needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that after adding the acid, the Fe\u00b3+ is in solution and the solution is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3. The acid's contribution to H+ would be (moles of H+ added - moles consumed) divided by total volume. \n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nTotal moles of H+ added is 0.1 * (V/1000), where V is the volume in cm\u00b3. \n\nThe moles of H+ consumed is 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. \n\nThus, excess H+ = (0.1 * V/1000) - 3 * (0.1 / 106.869) \n\nThe total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the concentration of excess H+ is [H+] = (excess moles) / 0.1 L.\n\nThe minimum volume is when excess H+ is zero. But that would give pH determined by Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis, as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Fe(OH)3 is completely dissolved, and the solution is just the acid and Fe\u00b3+, and the pH is from the H+ from the acid minus what was used. But if exactly the right amount is used, then the H+ is zero. That can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try the alternative approach where the H+ comes from the excess acid. \n\nSuppose that to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, the acid must provide enough H+ to neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3. But perhaps in reality, the reaction goes to completion, so the H+ added is exactly 3x the moles of Fe(OH)3. But the acid is a strong acid, so all H+ is available. Thus, the H+ from the acid is all consumed, leaving no excess. \n\nThus, the only H+ comes from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. So my initial calculation using Ksp gives pH ~2.0, which matches option C's pH 2.04. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm\u00b3. \n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. The volume in option C is 28.05, which is very close to our calculation of 28.07 cm\u00b3. The pH is 2.04, which aligns with the Ksp calculation. So I think the correct answer is option C.\n",

Hmm, let's start by breaking this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble compound. To dissolve it, we need to add an acid because the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3 will react with the acid's H+ ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O. Right, because each Fe(OH)3 has three hydroxide ions, so it would need three H+ ions to neutralize them. \n\nSo, the first thing is to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The given mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol approximately. Let me check that again. Wait, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1, so each OH is 17. So three OH groups would be 3*17=51. Then Fe is about 55.85. So total is 55.85+51=106.85 g/mol. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me see: 106.85 times 0.0009 is about 0.096, so 0.000936 is around 0.000936 mol. Let's write that as 9.36 x 10^-4 mol.\n\nNow, since each Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ ions, the total moles of H+ needed would be 3 times that. So 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol of H+ required. \n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters. Converting that to cm\u00b3 (since 1 L = 1000 cm\u00b3), that's 28.08 cm\u00b3. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm\u00b3, which is close. But let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a rounding error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 more precisely. 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85:\n\nLet me compute 106.85 * 0.000936 = 100*0.000936 = 0.0936, plus 6.85*0.000936. Wait, perhaps better to do 0.1 / 106.85. Let me compute that.\n\n0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately:\n\n106.85 goes into 0.1 how many times? 106.85 * 0.000936 is roughly 0.1, but maybe more precise:\n\nLet me compute 1/106.85 first. 1/100 is 0.01, so 1/106.85 is a bit less, like approximately 0.00936 (since 106.85 is about 100 + 6.85, so 1/(100*(1+0.0685)) \u2248 0.01/(1.0685) \u2248 0.00936). So 0.1 grams is 0.1 * (1/106.85) = 0.1 * 0.00936 \u2248 0.000936 moles. So that part is okay.\n\nSo 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol H+. \n\n0.1 M acid gives 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3. The closest option is C (28.05 cm\u00b3) but the numbers are very close. Wait, maybe the molar mass is slightly different? Let me check the exact molar mass of Fe(OH)3 again.\n\nIron's atomic weight is about 55.845 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00, Hydrogen is 1.008.\n\nSo Fe: 55.845, O: 16*3 =48, H: 3*(1.008) = 3.024. Total molar mass = 55.845 + 48 +3.024 = 55.845 +51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.\n\nSo 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.1 / 106.869 \u2248 0.0009357 mol. So 3 * that is 0.002807 mol. Divided by 0.1 M gives 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3. Hmm, so the options have 28.05 cm\u00b3 for option C, which is very close. Maybe the question uses approximate molar masses. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry?\n\nWait, the question says \"monobasic strong acid\". A monobasic acid would donate one H+ per molecule. So each molecule of the acid gives one H+ ion. So the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. So, yes, the stoichiometry is correct: 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the required volume is approximately 28.07 cm\u00b3, which is closest to option C's 28.05. So the first part of the answer is option C's volume. But let's check the pH part.\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution. Hmm. Once the acid is added, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the excess H+ will determine the pH. Wait, but also, after neutralization, maybe there's some Fe\u00b3+ which can act as an acid? Or maybe the solution is just the excess H+?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me consider the steps.\n\nTotal volume of the solution is 100 cm\u00b3, but the acid is added to that total volume. Wait, the problem says \"prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution\" with a total volume of 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid is being diluted to 100 cm\u00b3 total. Wait, perhaps the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm\u00b3. So the volume of acid added plus the volume of water (or other solvent) makes up 100 cm\u00b3. But when they ask for the minimum volume of acid needed, it's the volume before dilution? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait the question says: \"the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\" The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid is part of that 100 cm\u00b3. So the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid volume is part of it, and the rest is water. Wait, but when you mix the acid with water to make 100 cm\u00b3, the total volume is the sum. But the problem is to find the minimum volume of the acid (the 0.1 M solution) needed so that when you mix it with water (or whatever) to make 100 cm\u00b3, the Fe(OH)3 dissolves completely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total volume is exactly 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid volume plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution? Hmm, but maybe the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in the acid solution, and then total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. So the acid must be in sufficient quantity to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and then the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the acid's volume is part of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and then water is added to reach 100 cm\u00b3. The minimum volume of acid needed would be the volume required to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and then the rest is water. Therefore, the H+ concentration after dilution would be the key for the pH.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the minimum volume of the acid. So we need just enough acid to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, and then the rest is water. Because if you add more acid, you can dissolve it but you're not asked for excess. So the minimum volume is exactly the stoichiometric amount needed for the reaction. But then, when you dilute to 100 cm\u00b3, the H+ concentration will be (moles of H+ from acid - moles consumed?) Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. To dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, we need to supply exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. But if we add exactly that amount, then all H+ is consumed, and there's no excess H+ left. Wait, but then where would the H+ come from for the pH?\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because if we add exactly enough acid to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, then there would be no excess H+ in solution, so the solution would be neutral? But that can't be, because Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid, but in solution, it might hydrolyze. Wait, maybe the Fe\u00b3+ is in solution and contributes H+ ions?\n\nWait, perhaps when Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ to form Fe\u00b3+ and water, the Fe\u00b3+ can then hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. So even if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the Fe\u00b3+ might act as an acid, leading to an acidic solution. Therefore, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the excess H+ is the only contributor. Wait, but if we add exactly 3 moles H+ per Fe(OH)3, then there's no excess H+. So the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+?\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-calculate the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 0.0009357 mol.\n\nEach mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to neutralize. So total H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009357 \u2248 0.002807 mol.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3. So that's the volume of acid required. So the closest option is C's 28.05 cm\u00b3. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, for the pH. The problem is, after adding exactly that volume, there's no excess H+ (since all H+ was consumed in neutralizing the Fe(OH)3). Therefore, the solution would contain Fe\u00b3+ ions and water. The Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ \n\nThis hydrolysis would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH would be determined by this hydrolysis.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nWe need the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ and then find the pH based on its hydrolysis.\n\nThe total volume is 100 cm\u00b3 (0.1 L). The moles of Fe\u00b3+ is the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009357 mol. Therefore, the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\n\nNow, to find the pH, we can model the hydrolysis. Let me denote the initial concentration of Fe\u00b3+ as 0.009357 M. The hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 H+ + Fe(OH)\u00b2+\n\nThe equilibrium expression would be:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)\u00b2+] / [Fe\u00b3+]\n\nBut we need to find the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, the hydrolysis constant can be related to the Kb of the conjugate base, Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nAlternatively, the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ is given by the relation Kw / Kb, where Kb is the base dissociation constant for Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the pH of a metal ion solution. The general approach is:\n\nThe hydrolysis produces H+ ions, so the pH can be calculated by considering the hydrolysis equilibrium.\n\nThe formula for the pH of a solution of a metal ion (like Fe\u00b3+) is given by:\n\npH = \u00bd (pKa + pC)\n\nWhere pKa is the acid dissociation constant of the H+ from the hydrolysis, and pC is the concentration term. Wait, perhaps I need to look up the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc H+ + Fe(OH)\u00b2+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for Fe\u00b3+. Let me look up the Ka for Fe\u00b3+.\n\nWait, I might not have exact values here, but perhaps the problem expects an approximate approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the H+ comes only from the excess acid?\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, if the acid is added in exactly the stoichiometric amount, then there's no excess H+, so the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here and there is actually some excess H+?\n\nWait, perhaps the question allows for the acid to be in slight excess to ensure complete dissolution, but the minimal volume would be just enough to neutralize, so no excess. Hmm, the question says \"minimum volume\", so that would be exactly the amount needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, so no excess. So the H+ comes from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Fe(OH)3 is completely dissolved, so the solution is saturated with Fe\u00b3+, but the question says \"dissolve\" so maybe it's in solution, so the hydrolysis is the key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 and the acid's effect on it.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Let me think of the dissolution in terms of the solubility product.\n\nThe solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is a known value. Let me recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 4.0 \u00d7 10^-38 (some sources say 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 or similar, but let's assume a value here). Wait, I might need to use the exact value, but since I don't have it, perhaps the problem expects using the hydrolysis approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me see the options given. The pH options are 3.16, 2.69, 2.04, 4.94. Let me see if these correspond to any simple calculations.\n\nWait, if the solution had a concentration of H+ from the excess acid, but in our case, there's no excess acid. Alternatively, maybe the question expects that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved by the acid, but the acid is in excess, so that the pH is determined by the excess H+.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose that to dissolve Fe(OH)3, we need to add enough acid to provide H+ so that the pH is low enough. The reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O. To dissolve the solid, the H+ must be sufficient to shift the equilibrium.\n\nThe solubility of Fe(OH)3 in pure water is very low due to its Ksp. To dissolve it, adding H+ lowers the pH, shifting the equilibrium to the right.\n\nThe minimum amount of acid needed is exactly the amount to provide the H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So, the moles of H+ required are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So that's the same as before, 0.002807 mol. So the volume is 28.07 cm\u00b3, so option C's volume is correct.\n\nNow, for the pH, the solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)3 will have the Fe\u00b3+ and the remaining H+ concentration. Wait, but if we added exactly the H+ needed, there's no excess H+ left. So the H+ must come from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. So the pH would be determined by that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: when you add the acid, the H+ from the acid is consumed in neutralizing the Fe(OH)3. The remaining solution contains Fe\u00b3+ and the excess H+? Wait, no, if you added exactly the required H+, then the H+ from the acid is all used up. But wait, the acid is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Let's think in terms of stoichiometry.\n\nSuppose the acid is HA, a monobasic strong acid. So each mole of HA gives one H+.\n\nTotal moles of H+ added = 0.1 M * V (volume in liters) = 0.1 * (V/1000) where V is in cm\u00b3. Wait, actually, if V is in cm\u00b3, then liters would be V / 1000. So moles H+ = 0.1 * (V / 1000). \n\nWe need this to be equal to 3 * moles Fe(OH)3.\n\nSo:\n\n0.1 * (V / 1000) = 3 * (0.1 / 106.869)\n\nSolving for V gives:\n\nV = (3 * 0.1 / 106.869) * (1000 / 0.1) ) \n\nWait, let me compute that again. \n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nmoles H+ = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3\n\n=> 0.1 * (V / 1000) = 3*(0.1 / 106.869)\n\nMultiply both sides by 1000:\n\n0.1 * V = 3 * 0.1 * (1000 / 106.869)\n\nWait, maybe better to rearrange:\n\nV = (3 * moles Fe(OH)3) / (0.1 M) * 1000 (to convert liters to cm\u00b3).\n\nYes, so that gives the same as before.\n\nSo the volume is correct. Now, the pH.\n\nThe Fe\u00b3+ is in solution. Let's consider its hydrolysis:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][Fe(OH)\u00b2+] / [Fe\u00b3+]\n\nThe Ka here is the acid dissociation constant for Fe\u00b3+. Alternatively, since Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product Ksp, which is equal to [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 4.0 \u00d7 10^-38 (I think it's around that, but let me see).\n\nLet me recall that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is about 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, I might need to use the relation between Ksp and the hydrolysis. Let me think.\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is Fe\u00b3+ + 3 H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. \n\nWait, maybe that's a better way to write it. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nFe(OH)3(s) \u21cc Fe\u00b3+ + 3 OH-\n\nThe Ksp is [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3.\n\nWhen we add H+, the H+ reacts with OH- to form H2O, shifting the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Fe(OH)3. \n\nTo dissolve all Fe(OH)3, the solution must have enough H+ so that the [OH-] is low enough. The minimum H+ required is such that when all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution has [Fe\u00b3+] = n(Fe(OH)3)/V, and the [OH-] is such that Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the correct approach. Let's try this.\n\nAfter adding the acid, all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, so the Fe\u00b3+ concentration is 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\n\nThe Ksp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH-]^3. \n\nWe can solve for [OH-]:\n\n[OH-] = (Ksp / [Fe\u00b3+])^(1/3)\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Let's assume Ksp is 2.79 \u00d7 10^-39 (as per some references).\n\nSo:\n\n[OH-] = ( (2.79e-39) / (0.009357) )^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the numerator divided by denominator:\n\n2.79e-39 / 0.009357 \u2248 2.79e-39 / 9.357e-3 = (2.79 / 9.357) * 1e-36 \u2248 0.298 * 1e-36 = 2.98e-37.\n\nTaking the cube root: (2.98e-37)^(1/3) \u2248 (2.98)^(1/3) * (1e-37)^(1/3)\n\nCube root of 2.98 is approx 1.44, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12 (since (1e-12)^3 = 1e-36). Wait, but 1e-37 is 1e-36 * 10^-1, so cube root would be (1e-37)^(1/3) = 1e-12.333..., so approx 4.64e-13? Wait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nCube root of 2.98e-37:\n\nLet me write 2.98e-37 as 2.98 \u00d7 10^-37.\n\nThe cube root of 10^-37 is 10^(-37/3) \u2248 10^-12.333..., so 10^-12.333 is approx 4.64 \u00d710^-13 (since 10^0.333 is about 2.15, so 1/2.15 \u22480.465).\n\nSo cube root of 2.98 is approx 1.44. So total is 1.44 \u00d7 4.64e-13 \u2248 6.67e-13 M OH-.\n\nThen [OH-] \u22486.67e-13. \n\nThen [H+] = 1e-14 / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 6.67e-13 \u2248 0.01498 M. \n\nSo pH = -log10(0.01498) \u2248 1.823. \n\nHmm, that's around pH 1.82. But the options given are 3.16, 2.69, 2.04, 4.94. The closest would be option C's pH 2.04. \n\nWait, but my calculation here gives pH ~1.82, but the option C is 2.04, which is close. Maybe I used a different Ksp value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ksp value I used is incorrect. Let me check another source.\n\nWait, perhaps the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 2.79 \u00d710^-39 (from some sources), but others might say 4e-38 or different. Let me see. Let me try with Ksp = 4e-38. Then:\n\n[OH-] = (4e-38 / 0.009357)^(1/3) \n\n4e-38 / 0.009357 \u2248 4e-38 / 9.357e-3 \u2248 4.275e-36 \n\nCube root of that is (4.275e-36)^(1/3). \n\nCube root of 4.275 is ~1.62, cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So total is 1.62e-12. \n\nThen [OH-] is 1.62e-12, so [H+] = 1e-14 / 1.62e-12 = 6.17e-3, so pH \u2248 2.21. \n\nHmm, that's closer to 2.21. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ksp is 1e-38?\n\nLet me try Ksp =1e-38:\n\n[OH-] = (1e-38 /0.009357)^(1/3) \u2248 (1.069e-36)^(1/3)\n\nCube root of 1.069e-36 is approx 4.74e-12 (since (4.74)^3 \u2248 106, so 4.74e-12^3 is ~1e-35, but maybe my math is off. Let me compute more accurately:\n\n1.069e-36^(1/3) = (1.069)^(1/3) \u00d7 10^(-36/3) = approx 1.02 \u00d7 10^-12. \n\nThus [OH-] \u22481.02e-12, so [H+] = 1e-14 /1.02e-12 \u2248 0.0098, pH\u22482.01.\n\nAh, so that's about pH 2.01, which is very close to option C's 2.04. So probably the Ksp used here is around 1e-38. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the excess H+ comes from the acid and that there's some excess H+ left. Wait, but that would mean that the acid was added in excess. But the question says minimum volume, which would be exactly the amount needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that after adding the acid, the Fe\u00b3+ is in solution and the solution is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3. The acid's contribution to H+ would be (moles of H+ added - moles consumed) divided by total volume. \n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nTotal moles of H+ added is 0.1 * (V/1000), where V is the volume in cm\u00b3. \n\nThe moles of H+ consumed is 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. \n\nThus, excess H+ = (0.1 * V/1000) - 3 * (0.1 / 106.869) \n\nThe total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the concentration of excess H+ is [H+] = (excess moles) / 0.1 L.\n\nThe minimum volume is when excess H+ is zero. But that would give pH determined by Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis, as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Fe(OH)3 is completely dissolved, and the solution is just the acid and Fe\u00b3+, and the pH is from the H+ from the acid minus what was used. But if exactly the right amount is used, then the H+ is zero. That can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me try the alternative approach where the H+ comes from the excess acid. \n\nSuppose that to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, the acid must provide enough H+ to neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3. But perhaps in reality, the reaction goes to completion, so the H+ added is exactly 3x the moles of Fe(OH)3. But the acid is a strong acid, so all H+ is available. Thus, the H+ from the acid is all consumed, leaving no excess. \n\nThus, the only H+ comes from the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. So my initial calculation using Ksp gives pH ~2.0, which matches option C's pH 2.04. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm\u00b3. \n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. The volume in option C is 28.05, which is very close to our calculation of 28.07 cm\u00b3. The pH is 2.04, which aligns with the Ksp calculation. So I think the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083, we first calculate its moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)\u2083 is approximately 106.869 g/mol, so:\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)\u2083 = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 9.36 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol.\n\nEach mole of Fe(OH)\u2083 requires 3 moles of H\u207a for neutralization, so total H\u207a needed is:\n\n3 \u00d7 9.36 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol \u2248 2.808 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol.\n\nUsing a 0.1 M acid, the required volume is:\n\nVolume = (2.808 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3 \u2248 28.05 cm\u00b3 (closest to option C).\n\nFor the pH, after neutralization, Fe\u00b3\u207a hydrolyzes in water:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + H\u2082O \u21cc H\u207a + Fe(OH)\u00b2\u207a.\n\nUsing the solubility product (Ksp \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078), the hydroxide concentration [OH\u207b] is calculated as:\n\n[OH\u207b] = (Ksp / [Fe\u00b3\u207a])^(1/3) \u2248 (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 / 0.009357)^(1/3) \u2248 1.62 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 M.\n\n[H\u207a] = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 / (1.62 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2) \u2248 6.17 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M, giving pH \u2248 2.21. However, using a slightly different Ksp value (e.g., 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) yields pH \u2248 2.01, close to option C's 2.04.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
