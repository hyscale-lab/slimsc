      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The question mentions they're in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. And they all have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the distance from its star and the star's luminosity, right? The formula I remember is something like T = T\u2080 * (L/(4\u03c0r\u00b2\u03c3))^(1/4), but maybe there's a simpler version when comparing two planets around the same star.\n\nWait, since they're all around the same star, the luminosity L is the same. The equilibrium temperature should be proportional to (L/(r\u00b2))^(1/4), but maybe even more simplified. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the equilibrium temperature relates to the inverse square root of the distance. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4), where a is the semi-major axis. Alternatively, if two planets are around the same star, then T \u221d 1/\u221aa, because the energy received depends on 1/a\u00b2, and then taking the 1/4 power from the Stefan-Boltzmann. Wait, let me get the exact formula right.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but maybe that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, the standard formula when considering a planet's equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(-1/4), where A is the albedo. But since all the planets have the same albedo here, that term cancels out when taking the ratio. So the main factors would be the distance a from the star, and the star's parameters. Since the star is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures would depend on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes.\n\nWait, let me rederive this. The equilibrium temperature comes from balancing the incoming stellar energy with the outgoing thermal radiation. The incoming power per area is (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) * (1 - A), where L is the star's luminosity. The outgoing is \u03c3T^4. Setting them equal: \u03c3T^4 = (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))(1 - A). Solving for T gives T = [ (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))(1 - A) / \u03c3 ]^(1/4). Since L, \u03c3, and (1 - A) are the same for all planets, the temperature ratio between two planets would be (a_i / a_j)^(-1/2). Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me write T1 and T2 for two planets:\n\nT1^4 / T2^4 = ( (L/(4\u03c0a1\u00b2) ) / (L/(4\u03c0a2\u00b2) )) = (a2\u00b2 / a1\u00b2 )\n\nSo T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, so if Planet 4 is farther out than Planet 2, then its temperature would be lower. But which one is farther?\n\nWait, the orbital periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the planets are ordered from 1 to 5 with increasing orbital periods? Since orbital period increases with distance from the star (Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3). So Planet_1 has the shortest period, so closest to the star, Planet_5 is the farthest. So Planet_4 has a longer period than Planet_2, so it's farther away. So Planet_4 is farther out than Planet_2. So the temperature of Planet_4 would be lower than Planet_2. So the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Wait, because T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2). Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a4 ). \n\nBut first, I need to find the ratio of their distances a4/a2. Since their orbital periods are in a ratio of 3.5 (Planet4) to 2 (Planet2). Using Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. So (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3. Let me compute that ratio:\n\nP4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. Squaring that gives (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. Then that equals (a4/a2)^3. So (a4/a2) = (3.0625)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. Let me see, 3.0625. Let me think of cube roots. 3^3 is 27, but here it's 3.0625. Let me see, 1.44^3 is roughly (since 1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.45^3 \u2248 3.05). Wait, 1.44^3 = (1.44)*(1.44)*(1.44). Let's compute 1.44*1.44 = 2.0736, then 2.0736 * 1.44 \u2248 2.0736*1.4 = 2.903, plus 2.0736*0.04=0.0829, total \u22482.986. So 1.44^3 \u22482.986. The value we have is 3.0625, so a bit higher. Let me compute 1.45^3: 1.45*1.45 = 2.1025, then *1.45: 2.1025*1.45. Let's see: 2*1.45=2.9, 0.1025*1.45\u22480.1486, so total \u22483.0486. So 1.45^3\u22483.0486. That's very close to 3.0625. The difference is 3.0625-3.0486=0.0139. So maybe approximately 1.45 + a little. Let's see, perhaps 1.46? Let's check 1.46^3. 1.46^2 is 2.1316, times 1.46 is 2.1316*1.46. 2*1.46=2.92, 0.1316*1.46\u22480.1917, so total \u22483.1117. That's over. Hmm, so between 1.45 and 1.46. Since 3.0625 is between 3.0486 (1.45) and 3.1117 (1.46). Let's see how much. The desired value is 3.0625. The difference between 3.0486 and 3.0625 is 0.0139. The total range between 1.45 and 1.46 gives an increase of about 0.0631 (3.1117-3.0486). So to get 0.0139, the fraction is ~0.0139/0.0631 \u22480.22. So approximately 1.45 + 0.22*(0.01) = 1.4522? Wait, no, the 0.22 is of the 0.01 interval between 1.45 and 1.46? Wait, actually, the step between 1.45 and 1.46 is 0.01 in the x (the a4/a2 ratio), but the cube leads to a bigger difference. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the cube root numerically. Alternatively, just accept that (3.0625)^(1/3) \u22481.45. Let's use 1.45 as an approximate value. Therefore, a4/a2 \u22481.45. So the ratio a2/a4 is 1/1.45 \u22480.6897. Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.6897) \u22480.83. Wait, sqrt(0.69) is about 0.83. Because sqrt(0.64)=0.8, sqrt(0.69) is a bit higher. Let me compute sqrt(0.6897):\n\n0.83 squared is 0.6889. Oh! exactly. 0.83^2 is (0.8 +0.03)^2 =0.64 + 0.048 +0.0009 = 0.6889. So sqrt(0.6897) is very close to 0.83. So that would give the ratio as ~0.83, which is option C. Wait, but wait, let me confirm all steps again because sometimes I might have messed up the inverse ratios.\n\nWait, let me go step by step again:\n\nThe question is T4 over T2?\n\nYes. So, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ). \n\nWe have P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. Then, according to Kepler's third law, (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3. \n\nSo (a4/a2)^3 = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. \n\nSo a4/a2 = (3.0625)^(1/3). \n\nCalculating that cube root: as I did before, approximately 1.45, so a4/a2 \u22481.45. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u22481/1.45 \u22480.69. \n\nThen sqrt(0.69) \u22480.83. \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83, so the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. \n\nWait, T4 is the temperature of the planet that is farther away (since it has a longer period), so it's colder. So T4 should be less than T2. The ratio T4/T2 is 0.83, which is less than 1, so that makes sense. So 0.83 is option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula: T is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4) * (1 - A)^{-1/4}. Since L and (1 - A) are same for all planets, then T \u221d (1/a\u00b2)^{1/4} = 1/a^{0.5}. So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^{1/2} = sqrt(a2/a4). Which is exactly what I had. \n\nSo that's correct. So the calculation steps are correct, leading to 0.83, which is option C. \n\nHmm, the options are:\n\nA) ~0.57\n\nB) ~0.69\n\nC) ~0.83\n\nD) ~0.75\n\nSo 0.83 is option C. So the answer is C. \n\nI think that's right. Wait, let me check if maybe the question was asking for Planet_2 over Planet_4? No, the question says \"ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2\", which is T4/T2. So yes, 0.83. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The question mentions that all the planets have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is something like T = T0 * (L/(4\u03c0d\u00b2))^(1/4), where T0 is the temperature at 1 AU, but maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * (R/(2d))^(1/2), but that's when considering the star's radius and distance. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the flux. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance from the star, right?\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_sun * ( (L/L_sun)^(1/4) ) * (a_sun/a)^(1/2), where a is the semi-major axis. But since all the planets are around the same star, L (luminosity) would be the same for all, so the ratio would just depend on the distance (a) between the two planets. Since the problem states they have the same albedo, that part cancels out because albedo affects the temperature but since they're the same, the ratio won't involve that term. \n\nThe key here is that the orbital periods are given, and we need to relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis. Kepler's third law comes into play here. For a system orbiting the same star, the ratio of the orbital periods squared is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes cubed. So (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. Wait, actually, Kepler's third law is P^2 \u221d a^3. So P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3)/(a2^3), so (a1/a2) = (P1/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSince we need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, let's denote them as T4 and T2. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because T \u221d (1/a)^(1/2) when considering the star's luminosity (assuming the same L and albedo). \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 would be (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T \u221d 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio is (a2/a4)^0.5. \n\nFirst, find the ratio of their semi-major axes. The orbital periods are given as Planet_2 has period P2, Planet_4 has P4. The ratio of their orbital periods is given as the planets are in a 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 ratio. Let me check the numbering again. The planets are Planet_1 through 5, with ratios 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. So for Planet_4 (P4 = 3.5P) and Planet_2 (P2 = 2P). \n\nSo the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nNow using Kepler's third law, (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2. Therefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. \n\nSo 1.75^(2/3). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Maybe I can compute this numerically. \n\nLet me compute 1.75^(1/3) first. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately... since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2, maybe a bit more. Let's see, 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.75 - 1.728 is 0.022. So maybe 1.205? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe better to use exponents. \n\nAlternatively, take natural logs. Let me try:\n\nln(1.75) \u2248 0.5596. Multiply by (2/3): (2/3)*0.5596 \u2248 0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452. Wait, because e^0.373 is approximately 1.452? Let me check e^0.373. Since e^0.3 is about 1.349, e^0.35 is about 1.419, e^0.4 is ~1.4918. So 0.373 is between 0.35 and 0.4. Let's see:\n\n0.373 - 0.35 = 0.023. So from 0.35 (1.419) to 0.4 (1.4918), the difference is 0.05 in x gives 0.0728 in e^x. So 0.023/0.05 is about 0.46, so adding 0.46 *0.0728 \u2248 ~0.0335. So total would be 1.419 +0.0335 \u22481.4525. So approximately 1.4525. \n\nWait, but that is (1.75)^(2/3) \u2248 1.4525. So a4/a2 is ~1.4525. Therefore, the ratio a2/a4 is 1 / 1.4525 \u2248 0.688. \n\nThen the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.688). Let's compute sqrt(0.688). The square root of 0.64 is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85. 0.688 is between them. Let me calculate:\n\n0.83 squared is 0.6889. Oh! Because 0.83^2 = (0.8 +0.03)^2 = 0.64 + 0.048 +0.0009 = 0.6889. Exactly. So sqrt(0.688) is very close to 0.83. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2's equilibrium temperature. Wait, T4 / T2 is sqrt(a2/a4). Wait let me make sure. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nYes. So since a2/a4 is ~0.688, sqrt of that is ~0.83, which would be the ratio T4/T2. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. But wait, let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are: A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75. \n\nHmm, so 0.83 is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't flip anything. \n\nThe orbital period ratio P4/P2 is 3.5 /2 = 1.75. \n\nKepler's third law: (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3. \n\nSo (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3) \u22481.4525, so a2/a4 is ~0.688. \n\nThen the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: \n\nT_eq = T_sun * sqrt( (R_sun/(2a)) ) * (L_sun/(L))^(1/4) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by the formula: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4} ... Hmm, no, maybe another way. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is derived from the balance between incoming stellar flux and the planet's emitted infrared radiation. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature can be approximated by: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) \n\nBut this is when the albedo is 0 and assuming no greenhouse effect. \n\nAlternatively, the more general formula is: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4} \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the star's luminosity. \n\nThe flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). \n\nThe planet absorbs F*(1 - albedo)*\u03c0R\u00b2, where R is planet's radius. \n\nIt radiates as 4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eq^4. \n\nSetting them equal: \n\nF*(1 - albedo)*\u03c0R\u00b2 = 4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nCancel terms: \n\n(L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))*(1 - albedo) = 4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThen solving for T_eq: \n\nT_eq = [ (L (1 - albedo) )/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^{1/4} \n\nSo T_eq \u221d sqrt( (1 - albedo)^{1/2} ) / a^{1/2} \n\nWait, the exact expression is T_eq proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} times (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. \n\nSince all planets are around the same star, L is same. The albedo is same for all, so (1 - albedo)^{1/4} is same for all. Therefore, the ratio of T4 to T2 would be [ (1/a4\u00b2) / (1/a2\u00b2) ) ]^{1/4} \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nThe T_eq is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. Since L and albedo are same, the ratio T4/T2 would be [ (a2\u00b2)/(a4\u00b2) ]^{1/4} = (a2/a4)^{1/2}. \n\nWhich is the same as before. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the calculation is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again. \n\nThe ratio of P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nSo (P4/P2)^2 = (3.5/2)^2 = 3.0625 \n\nThen (a4/a2)^3 = 3.0625 \n\nTherefore, (a4/a2) = (3.0625)^{1/3}. \n\nWait, 3.0625^(1/3). Let me compute that. \n\n3.0625 is approximately 3.0625. The cube of 1.45 is 1.45^3 = 1.45*1.45=2.1025, then *1.45 \u2248 3.048. Oh, so 1.45^3 is ~3.048, which is very close to 3.0625. So (3.0625)^(1/3) \u22481.45. \n\nThus, a4/a2 is ~1.45, so a2/a4 is ~0.690. \n\nWait, hold on, because if a4/a2 is 1.45, then a2/a4 is 1/1.45 \u22480.6897. So the square root of that is sqrt(0.6897). \n\nWait, sqrt(0.6889) is exactly 0.83, since 0.83 squared is 0.6889. \n\nAh, so the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C, 0.83. \n\nSo the options have option C as ~0.83, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me just recap. \n\nThe key steps: \n\n- The temperature ratio depends on sqrt(a2/a4). \n\n- The orbital period ratio gives us (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \u2192 (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\n- So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\n- The ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, wait, let me see:\n\nWait, sqrt(a2/a4) is equal to sqrt( (a2/a4) ), which is the same as (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nBut a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is (P2/P4)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, so that's another way to compute it. \n\nSo T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nBecause:\n\nsqrt(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^{1/2} \n\nBut a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^{2/3}, so substituting:\n\n( (P2/P4)^{2/3} )^{1/2} = (P2/P4)^{1/3} \n\nYes, so that's a simpler way to compute. \n\nSo P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nP2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7 \u22480.5714 \n\nThen (4/7)^(1/3). Let me compute that. \n\nThe cube root of 4/7. \n\nAlternatively, cube root of (0.5714). \n\nCube root of 0.512 is 0.8, since 0.8^3=0.512. \n\n0.5714 is a bit higher. \n\nLet me approximate. Let me compute 0.83^3 = 0.571767. Oh, exactly! \n\n0.83 cubed is (0.8)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.03) + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3 \n\n= 0.512 + 3*(0.64)(0.03) + ... \n\nBut 0.83^3 is 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 again. \n\n0.6889 *0.8 = 0.55112, plus 0.6889 *0.03 = 0.020667. So total 0.55112+0.020667=0.571787. \n\nSo 0.83^3 \u22480.5718, which is almost exactly 4/7 (since 4/7\u22480.5714). \n\nTherefore (4/7)^(1/3) \u22480.83. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83, which is option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer must be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The question mentions that all the planets have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is something like T = T0 * (L/(4\u03c0d\u00b2))^(1/4), where T0 is the temperature at 1 AU, but maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * (R/(2d))^(1/2), but that's when considering the star's radius and distance. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the flux. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square of the distance from the star, right?\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_sun * ( (L/L_sun)^(1/4) ) * (a_sun/a)^(1/2), where a is the semi-major axis. But since all the planets are around the same star, L (luminosity) would be the same for all, so the ratio would just depend on the distance (a) between the two planets. Since the problem states they have the same albedo, that part cancels out because albedo affects the temperature but since they're the same, the ratio won't involve that term. \n\nThe key here is that the orbital periods are given, and we need to relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis. Kepler's third law comes into play here. For a system orbiting the same star, the ratio of the orbital periods squared is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes cubed. So (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. Wait, actually, Kepler's third law is P^2 \u221d a^3. So P1^2 / P2^2 = (a1^3)/(a2^3), so (a1/a2) = (P1/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSince we need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, let's denote them as T4 and T2. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because T \u221d (1/a)^(1/2) when considering the star's luminosity (assuming the same L and albedo). \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 would be (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T \u221d 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio is (a2/a4)^0.5. \n\nFirst, find the ratio of their semi-major axes. The orbital periods are given as Planet_2 has period P2, Planet_4 has P4. The ratio of their orbital periods is given as the planets are in a 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 ratio. Let me check the numbering again. The planets are Planet_1 through 5, with ratios 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. So for Planet_4 (P4 = 3.5P) and Planet_2 (P2 = 2P). \n\nSo the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nNow using Kepler's third law, (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2. Therefore, (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. \n\nSo 1.75^(2/3). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Maybe I can compute this numerically. \n\nLet me compute 1.75^(1/3) first. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately... since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2, maybe a bit more. Let's see, 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.75 - 1.728 is 0.022. So maybe 1.205? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe better to use exponents. \n\nAlternatively, take natural logs. Let me try:\n\nln(1.75) \u2248 0.5596. Multiply by (2/3): (2/3)*0.5596 \u2248 0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452. Wait, because e^0.373 is approximately 1.452? Let me check e^0.373. Since e^0.3 is about 1.349, e^0.35 is about 1.419, e^0.4 is ~1.4918. So 0.373 is between 0.35 and 0.4. Let's see:\n\n0.373 - 0.35 = 0.023. So from 0.35 (1.419) to 0.4 (1.4918), the difference is 0.05 in x gives 0.0728 in e^x. So 0.023/0.05 is about 0.46, so adding 0.46 *0.0728 \u2248 ~0.0335. So total would be 1.419 +0.0335 \u22481.4525. So approximately 1.4525. \n\nWait, but that is (1.75)^(2/3) \u2248 1.4525. So a4/a2 is ~1.4525. Therefore, the ratio a2/a4 is 1 / 1.4525 \u2248 0.688. \n\nThen the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.688). Let's compute sqrt(0.688). The square root of 0.64 is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85. 0.688 is between them. Let me calculate:\n\n0.83 squared is 0.6889. Oh! Because 0.83^2 = (0.8 +0.03)^2 = 0.64 + 0.048 +0.0009 = 0.6889. Exactly. So sqrt(0.688) is very close to 0.83. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2's equilibrium temperature. Wait, T4 / T2 is sqrt(a2/a4). Wait let me make sure. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nYes. So since a2/a4 is ~0.688, sqrt of that is ~0.83, which would be the ratio T4/T2. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. But wait, let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are: A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75. \n\nHmm, so 0.83 is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't flip anything. \n\nThe orbital period ratio P4/P2 is 3.5 /2 = 1.75. \n\nKepler's third law: (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3. \n\nSo (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3) \u22481.4525, so a2/a4 is ~0.688. \n\nThen the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: \n\nT_eq = T_sun * sqrt( (R_sun/(2a)) ) * (L_sun/(L))^(1/4) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by the formula: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4} ... Hmm, no, maybe another way. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is derived from the balance between incoming stellar flux and the planet's emitted infrared radiation. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature can be approximated by: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) \n\nBut this is when the albedo is 0 and assuming no greenhouse effect. \n\nAlternatively, the more general formula is: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4} \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the star's luminosity. \n\nThe flux at the planet's distance is F = L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). \n\nThe planet absorbs F*(1 - albedo)*\u03c0R\u00b2, where R is planet's radius. \n\nIt radiates as 4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eq^4. \n\nSetting them equal: \n\nF*(1 - albedo)*\u03c0R\u00b2 = 4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nCancel terms: \n\n(L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))*(1 - albedo) = 4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThen solving for T_eq: \n\nT_eq = [ (L (1 - albedo) )/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^{1/4} \n\nSo T_eq \u221d sqrt( (1 - albedo)^{1/2} ) / a^{1/2} \n\nWait, the exact expression is T_eq proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} times (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. \n\nSince all planets are around the same star, L is same. The albedo is same for all, so (1 - albedo)^{1/4} is same for all. Therefore, the ratio of T4 to T2 would be [ (1/a4\u00b2) / (1/a2\u00b2) ) ]^{1/4} \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nThe T_eq is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. Since L and albedo are same, the ratio T4/T2 would be [ (a2\u00b2)/(a4\u00b2) ]^{1/4} = (a2/a4)^{1/2}. \n\nWhich is the same as before. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the calculation is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again. \n\nThe ratio of P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75. \n\nSo (P4/P2)^2 = (3.5/2)^2 = 3.0625 \n\nThen (a4/a2)^3 = 3.0625 \n\nTherefore, (a4/a2) = (3.0625)^{1/3}. \n\nWait, 3.0625^(1/3). Let me compute that. \n\n3.0625 is approximately 3.0625. The cube of 1.45 is 1.45^3 = 1.45*1.45=2.1025, then *1.45 \u2248 3.048. Oh, so 1.45^3 is ~3.048, which is very close to 3.0625. So (3.0625)^(1/3) \u22481.45. \n\nThus, a4/a2 is ~1.45, so a2/a4 is ~0.690. \n\nWait, hold on, because if a4/a2 is 1.45, then a2/a4 is 1/1.45 \u22480.6897. So the square root of that is sqrt(0.6897). \n\nWait, sqrt(0.6889) is exactly 0.83, since 0.83 squared is 0.6889. \n\nAh, so the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C, 0.83. \n\nSo the options have option C as ~0.83, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me just recap. \n\nThe key steps: \n\n- The temperature ratio depends on sqrt(a2/a4). \n\n- The orbital period ratio gives us (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \u2192 (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\n- So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\n- The ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, wait, let me see:\n\nWait, sqrt(a2/a4) is equal to sqrt( (a2/a4) ), which is the same as (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nBut a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is (P2/P4)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, so that's another way to compute it. \n\nSo T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nBecause:\n\nsqrt(a2/a4) = (a2/a4)^{1/2} \n\nBut a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^{2/3}, so substituting:\n\n( (P2/P4)^{2/3} )^{1/2} = (P2/P4)^{1/3} \n\nYes, so that's a simpler way to compute. \n\nSo P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nP2/P4 is 2/3.5 = 4/7 \u22480.5714 \n\nThen (4/7)^(1/3). Let me compute that. \n\nThe cube root of 4/7. \n\nAlternatively, cube root of (0.5714). \n\nCube root of 0.512 is 0.8, since 0.8^3=0.512. \n\n0.5714 is a bit higher. \n\nLet me approximate. Let me compute 0.83^3 = 0.571767. Oh, exactly! \n\n0.83 cubed is (0.8)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.03) + 3*(0.8)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3 \n\n= 0.512 + 3*(0.64)(0.03) + ... \n\nBut 0.83^3 is 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 again. \n\n0.6889 *0.8 = 0.55112, plus 0.6889 *0.03 = 0.020667. So total 0.55112+0.020667=0.571787. \n\nSo 0.83^3 \u22480.5718, which is almost exactly 4/7 (since 4/7\u22480.5714). \n\nTherefore (4/7)^(1/3) \u22480.83. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83, which is option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis from Kepler's third law, and the equilibrium temperature dependence on distance. \n\n1. **Kepler's Third Law**: The ratio of orbital periods squared equals the ratio of semi-major axes cubed:  \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_4}{a_2}\\right)^3\n   \\]  \n   Given \\(P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75\\), solving for the semi-major axis ratio:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \\left(1.75\\right)^{2/3} \\approx 1.45\n   \\]  \n   Thus, \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\approx 0.6897 \\).\n\n2. **Equilibrium Temperature**: The temperature \\(T\\) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.6897} \\approx 0.83\n   \\]  \n   This matches the cube root of \\(P_2/P_4\\) raised to the \\(1/3\\) power, confirming the result.\n\nThe correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
