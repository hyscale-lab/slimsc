      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right? \n\nFirst, let me recall that each spin can be either +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Each state corresponds to a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. \n\nThe energy for each state depends on the products of the spins. Let me think about how to compute the energy for each possible configuration. Maybe I should list all the possible states and calculate their energies, then compute the Boltzmann factors for each and sum them up. That sounds tedious but manageable since there are only 8 states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by considering the possible values of the energy. Let me see. The energy equation can be rewritten as E = -J times the sum of all pairwise products. Let's see what possible values this sum can take. Since each term S_iS_j is either +1 or -1, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range between... Hmm, let's think about possible values.\n\nSuppose all spins are the same, say all +1. Then each product is +1, so the sum is 3, so E would be -J*3. If two are +1 and one is -1, let's see: Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So the sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So the energy would be -J*(-1) = +J. Wait, so the sum here is -1, so E is -J*(-1) = J. \n\nHmm, so maybe the possible sums can be 3, -1, or other values? Let me check another case. Suppose all spins are -1. Then each product is (-1)(-1) = +1, so sum is again 3. So that gives E = -J*3 again. \n\nAnother case: two up and one down, but different arrangement. Let's say S1 is +1, S2 and S3 are -1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So same as before, E = J. \n\nWhat about when all three spins are different? Wait, no, since each spin is either +1 or -1. So three spins can't be all different. Wait, actually, each spin is either +1 or -1, so three spins can have various combinations. Let's see another case: two down and one up, but different positions. Let me think of another scenario where the sum is different. \n\nWait maybe when the spins are arranged such that two are in one direction and one in the other, but the sum might still be the same? Let's see another configuration. Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then the sum is (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Same as before. \n\nHmm, what if the spins are arranged such that two are in one direction and one in the other but arranged differently? Wait, perhaps there's another possible value for the sum. Let me think of all possibilities.\n\nWait, let me think of all possible configurations. Let me list all 8 possibilities:\n\n1. S1=1, S2=1, S3=1:\n   Products: 1*1 =1, 1*1=1, 1*1=1. Sum=3 \u2192 E = -J*3 \u2192 \u03b2E = -3J\u03b2 \u2192 e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{3J\u03b2}\n\n2. S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1:\n   Products: 1*1=1, 1*(-1)=-1, 1*(-1)=-1. Sum=1-1-1 =-1 \u2192 E = J \u2192 e^{-\u03b2E}=e^{-J\u03b2}\n\n3. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1:\n   Similar to case 2. Products: (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) \u2192 -1 +1 -1 =-1 \u2192 same as above. E=J, so e^{-\u03b2E}=e^{-J\u03b2}\n\n4. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   Products: 1*(-1) =-1, 1*(-1)=-1, (-1)(-1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1 \u2192 E=J, same as before.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1:\n   Similar to case 4. Products: (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) \u2192 -1 -1 +1 =-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1:\n   Products: (-1)(1) =-1, (-1)(-1)=1, (1)(-1)=-1 \u2192 sum: -1+1-1 =-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1:\n   Similar to above. Products: 1 (since (-1*-1) =1, (-1*1) =-1, (-1*1) =-1 \u2192 1-1-1 =-1 \u2192 E=J.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n   All products are 1, so sum is 3 \u2192 E= -3J \u2192 e^{-\u03b2E}= e^{3J\u03b2} again.\n\nSo looking at all 8 states, the energy is either -3J (for the all +1 and all -1 cases) or +J (for the other 6 cases). \n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-\u03b2E}.\n\nFor the two states (all +1 and all -1) each contributes e^{3J\u03b2}, so together 2 * e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nThe other six states each contribute e^{-J\u03b2}, so 6 * e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nSo adding them together, Z = 2e^{3J\u03b2} + 6e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, that's option B. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z=6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo the correct expression is B. Because the two high-energy states (all up or all down) have E = -3J, so the exponent is -\u03b2*(-3J) = 3J\u03b2, so e^{3J\u03b2}, and the other 6 have E = +J, so exponent is -\u03b2*(J) = -J\u03b2, so e^{-J\u03b2} multiplied by 6. \n\nTherefore the answer must be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. Let me start by recalling that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right? Since each spin can be either +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression given: E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So the exponent in the partition function will be \u03b2E, but since Z is sum e^{-\u03b2E}, that becomes sum e^{\u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}.\n\nSo each term in the partition function is e^{\u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)} for each combination of S1, S2, S3 being \u00b11. The challenge is to compute this sum efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the terms by the possible values of the energy. Let's see. The energy E depends on the sum of the three products. Let's denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J*S, so the exponent in the partition function becomes \u03b2J*S. \n\nSo I need to find all possible values of S and how many states correspond to each value. Let me try to compute S for all possible spin configurations. Since each spin is \u00b11, let's see:\n\nFirst, note that each product term S_iS_j can be +1 or -1. Let me think of possible values of S. Let's see:\n\nThe sum S can range from -3 to +3. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor example, if all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1):\n\nTake all +1: S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1, so S = 3. So that gives S=3. Similarly for all -1: each product is still 1 (since (-1)(-1)=1), so S=3 again. So those two states have S=3.\n\nNow, if two spins are +1 and one is -1. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Similarly, other configurations where two are +1 and one -1 would give similar results. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let me compute for a case with two +1 and one -1. Let's take spins (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1 \u2192 total S =1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother configuration: (1,-1,1). Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. Same.\n\nAnother configuration: (-1,1,1). Same as first case. So all such states (there are C(3,2)=3 such states for choosing which spin is -1) would have S=-1.\n\nAlternatively, what if two spins are -1 and one is +1? Let's say (1,-1,-1). Then S1S2=1*(-1) = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. So total S is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Wait, that's also -1? Wait, let me calculate again:\n\nWait S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1? Wait no, in this case, let's take (1, -1, -1):\n\nWait S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1,\n\nso total S = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So same as before.\n\nWait, so if two spins are -1 and one +1, the sum is also -1. Hmm. Wait, so maybe when there's an even number of -1's, the sum might vary? Wait, maybe I need to check all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another case where all three spins are different? Wait, but since each spin is \u00b11, you can't have all three different. The possible configurations are based on how many are +1 or -1.\n\nWait maybe I should consider all possible numbers of up spins (since they are symmetric). Let's see:\n\nCase 1: All three spins up (S1=S2=S3=+1): Then all products are +1, so S=3. Similarly, all three down also gives S=3 because each product is (-1)(-1)=1. So two states with S=3.\n\nCase 2: Two up, one down. Let's say two up, one down. The number of such states is C(3,1)=3. Let me compute S for such a state. Let's take spins (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, any two up and one down gives S = (1+1-1) = 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sum is the sum of the three terms. Let me think again:\n\nWait, in the case of two up and one down, each pair's product: the two up spins multiplied give +1, each of the up spins multiplied with the down spin gives -1, and the two down spins (but there's only one down spin here) so the third term is between the two down spins? Wait, no. Wait the three terms are S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So in the case where two are up and one is down, say S3 is down:\n\nThen S1S2 is 1 (since both up), S1S3 is -1 (up and down), S2S3 is -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So each of these configurations (there are 3 of them) gives S=-1.\n\nCase 3: One up and two down. Let's take (1,-1,-1). The products are S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 =1 (since both down). So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So same as before. So these also give S=-1. The number here is also C(3,1)=3.\n\nCase4: All three down. As before, S=3 again. So two states here.\n\nWait, so what other cases are there? The only possibilities are 0,1,2,3 up spins. Wait when all three are down, it's equivalent to all three up in terms of the products because all the products would still be positive. So, so far, the S values are 3 and -1. Wait, but is there another possible S value?\n\nHmm, let me check another configuration. Suppose all spins are alternating, but with three spins, that can't happen. Let me see another case. Wait, maybe a different arrangement? Wait, let me take spins (1, -1, 1). Then:\n\nS1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS1S3 = (1)(1)=1,\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nSo total S = -1 +1 -1 = -1. Still -1. \n\nHmm, so all the cases with two up and one down or two down and one up give S=-1. Are there any configurations where S is different?\n\nWait, what if two spins are up and one down, but arranged differently? Wait, no, I think all such configurations give S=-1.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see if there's a case where S could be +1 or -3?\n\nWait let's try a different approach. Let's compute S for all 8 possibilities.\n\nTotal of 8 states. Let me list them all.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me represent them as triples (S1, S2, S3). Let me compute S for each:\n\n1. (1,1,1):\n\nS1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\n2. (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum 1-1-1 = -1.\n\n3. (1,-1,1):\n\nSame as above, sum is -1.\n\n4. (-1,1,1):\n\nSame, sum -1.\n\n5. (1,-1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 =1 \u2192 sum -1-1+1 = -1.\n\n6. (-1,1,-1):\n\nSame as above, sum -1.\n\n7. (-1,-1,1):\n\nSame as above, sum -1.\n\n8. (-1,-1,-1):\n\nEach product is 1, sum 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nSo indeed, all except the all up and all down cases have S=-1. The other six states (cases 2-7) all have S=-1. The two cases (1 and 8) have S=3. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of S are 3 and -1. The counts are: S=3 occurs 2 times, S=-1 occurs 6 times.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{\u03b2J*S}, because E = -J*S, so -\u03b2E = \u03b2J*S. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe partition function is Z = sum_{all states} e^{-\u03b2E}. Since E = -J(S1S2 + ...), then -\u03b2E = \u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = \u03b2J*S. So each term in the sum is e^{\u03b2J*S}.\n\nTherefore, the total Z is (number of states with S=3)*e^{\u03b2J*3} + (number with S=-1)*e^{\u03b2J*(-1)}.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 2 states for S=3 and 6 for S=-1. So:\n\nZ = 2 e^{3\u03b2J} + 6 e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nYes, B is exactly what I have. So the answer is B. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the exponents. The exponent is \u03b2J*S. For S=3, that's 3\u03b2J, so e^{3\u03b2J}, and for S=-1, it's -1*\u03b2J, so e^{-\u03b2J}. So the coefficients are 2 and 6, so B is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think that's right. The key was enumerating all the possible S values and their counts. Initially, I was worried there might be other S values, but when I listed all 8 states, it turned out only 3 and -1. So yeah, the answer must be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. Let me start by recalling that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right? Since each spin can be either +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression given: E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So the exponent in the partition function will be \u03b2E, but since Z is sum e^{-\u03b2E}, that becomes sum e^{\u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}.\n\nSo each term in the partition function is e^{\u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)} for each combination of S1, S2, S3 being \u00b11. The challenge is to compute this sum efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the terms by the possible values of the energy. Let's see. The energy E depends on the sum of the three products. Let's denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J*S, so the exponent in the partition function becomes \u03b2J*S. \n\nSo I need to find all possible values of S and how many states correspond to each value. Let me try to compute S for all possible spin configurations. Since each spin is \u00b11, let's see:\n\nFirst, note that each product term S_iS_j can be +1 or -1. Let me think of possible values of S. Let's see:\n\nThe sum S can range from -3 to +3. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor example, if all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1):\n\nTake all +1: S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1, so S = 3. So that gives S=3. Similarly for all -1: each product is still 1 (since (-1)(-1)=1), so S=3 again. So those two states have S=3.\n\nNow, if two spins are +1 and one is -1. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Similarly, other configurations where two are +1 and one -1 would give similar results. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let me compute for a case with two +1 and one -1. Let's take spins (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1 \u2192 total S =1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother configuration: (1,-1,1). Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. Same.\n\nAnother configuration: (-1,1,1). Same as first case. So all such states (there are C(3,2)=3 such states for choosing which spin is -1) would have S=-1.\n\nAlternatively, what if two spins are -1 and one is +1? Let's say (1,-1,-1). Then S1S2=1*(-1) = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. So total S is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Wait, that's also -1? Wait, let me calculate again:\n\nWait S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1? Wait no, in this case, let's take (1, -1, -1):\n\nWait S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1:\n\nS1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1,\n\nso total S = -1 -1 +1 = -1. So same as before.\n\nWait, so if two spins are -1 and one +1, the sum is also -1. Hmm. Wait, so maybe when there's an even number of -1's, the sum might vary? Wait, maybe I need to check all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another case where all three spins are different? Wait, but since each spin is \u00b11, you can't have all three different. The possible configurations are based on how many are +1 or -1.\n\nWait maybe I should consider all possible numbers of up spins (since they are symmetric). Let's see:\n\nCase 1: All three spins up (S1=S2=S3=+1): Then all products are +1, so S=3. Similarly, all three down also gives S=3 because each product is (-1)(-1)=1. So two states with S=3.\n\nCase 2: Two up, one down. Let's say two up, one down. The number of such states is C(3,1)=3. Let me compute S for such a state. Let's take spins (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, any two up and one down gives S = (1+1-1) = 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sum is the sum of the three terms. Let me think again:\n\nWait, in the case of two up and one down, each pair's product: the two up spins multiplied give +1, each of the up spins multiplied with the down spin gives -1, and the two down spins (but there's only one down spin here) so the third term is between the two down spins? Wait, no. Wait the three terms are S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So in the case where two are up and one is down, say S3 is down:\n\nThen S1S2 is 1 (since both up), S1S3 is -1 (up and down), S2S3 is -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So each of these configurations (there are 3 of them) gives S=-1.\n\nCase 3: One up and two down. Let's take (1,-1,-1). The products are S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 =1 (since both down). So sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So same as before. So these also give S=-1. The number here is also C(3,1)=3.\n\nCase4: All three down. As before, S=3 again. So two states here.\n\nWait, so what other cases are there? The only possibilities are 0,1,2,3 up spins. Wait when all three are down, it's equivalent to all three up in terms of the products because all the products would still be positive. So, so far, the S values are 3 and -1. Wait, but is there another possible S value?\n\nHmm, let me check another configuration. Suppose all spins are alternating, but with three spins, that can't happen. Let me see another case. Wait, maybe a different arrangement? Wait, let me take spins (1, -1, 1). Then:\n\nS1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1,\n\nS1S3 = (1)(1)=1,\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(1) = -1.\n\nSo total S = -1 +1 -1 = -1. Still -1. \n\nHmm, so all the cases with two up and one down or two down and one up give S=-1. Are there any configurations where S is different?\n\nWait, what if two spins are up and one down, but arranged differently? Wait, no, I think all such configurations give S=-1.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see if there's a case where S could be +1 or -3?\n\nWait let's try a different approach. Let's compute S for all 8 possibilities.\n\nTotal of 8 states. Let me list them all.\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me represent them as triples (S1, S2, S3). Let me compute S for each:\n\n1. (1,1,1):\n\nS1S2 =1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\n2. (1,1,-1):\n\nS1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 sum 1-1-1 = -1.\n\n3. (1,-1,1):\n\nSame as above, sum is -1.\n\n4. (-1,1,1):\n\nSame, sum -1.\n\n5. (1,-1,-1):\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 =1 \u2192 sum -1-1+1 = -1.\n\n6. (-1,1,-1):\n\nSame as above, sum -1.\n\n7. (-1,-1,1):\n\nSame as above, sum -1.\n\n8. (-1,-1,-1):\n\nEach product is 1, sum 3 \u2192 S=3.\n\nSo indeed, all except the all up and all down cases have S=-1. The other six states (cases 2-7) all have S=-1. The two cases (1 and 8) have S=3. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of S are 3 and -1. The counts are: S=3 occurs 2 times, S=-1 occurs 6 times.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{\u03b2J*S}, because E = -J*S, so -\u03b2E = \u03b2J*S. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe partition function is Z = sum_{all states} e^{-\u03b2E}. Since E = -J(S1S2 + ...), then -\u03b2E = \u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = \u03b2J*S. So each term in the sum is e^{\u03b2J*S}.\n\nTherefore, the total Z is (number of states with S=3)*e^{\u03b2J*3} + (number with S=-1)*e^{\u03b2J*(-1)}.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 2 states for S=3 and 6 for S=-1. So:\n\nZ = 2 e^{3\u03b2J} + 6 e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nYes, B is exactly what I have. So the answer is B. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the exponents. The exponent is \u03b2J*S. For S=3, that's 3\u03b2J, so e^{3\u03b2J}, and for S=-1, it's -1*\u03b2J, so e^{-\u03b2J}. So the coefficients are 2 and 6, so B is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think that's right.
