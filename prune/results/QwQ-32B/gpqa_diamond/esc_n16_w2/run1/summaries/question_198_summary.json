      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2+ species. The question gives me the stability constants \u03b21 through \u03b24. The concentrations are Co\u00b2+ at 10^-2 M and SCN- at 0.1 M. Hmm, stability constants... right, the \u03b2 values are for the formation of complexes with different numbers of SCN- ligands. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the stability constant \u03b2n for a complex [Co(SCN)n]^2+ would be given by the formation reaction: Co\u00b2+ + nSCN\u207b \u21cc [Co(SCN)n]^2+, and \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n]^2+ / ([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b]^n). \n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082]^0 + ... up to the fourth complex. Wait, but cobalt here is Co(II), so the charge on the complexes would be 2+ minus the number of SCN- ligands? Wait, SCN- is a monodentate ligand, each contributes -1 charge. So for each SCN- added, the charge decreases by 1? Let me think. The original Co\u00b2+ has a +2 charge. Adding one SCN- (which is -1) would make the complex +1, right? So the first complex would be [CoSCN]^+, then adding another SCN- would make it neutral? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the charge is Co\u00b2+ plus each SCN- is -1. So each SCN- subtracts 1 from the charge. So [Co(SCN)n]^2+ has charge 2+ minus (n*(-1))? Wait no, the ligands contribute their charge. Each SCN- is -1. So the overall charge would be 2+ (from Co\u00b2+) plus (n * -1) from the SCN-. So the charge is (2 - n). So for n=1, the charge is +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. But in solution, the complexes must be neutral or charged in a way that they can exist. Maybe the complexes are in solution with counterions? Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about that right now. The main point is that the stability constants are given for the formation of each complex up to four SCN- ligands. \n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Wait, but the SCN- is given as 0.1 M, but in reality, some of it is consumed in forming the complexes. However, since the SCN- is in excess (0.1 is higher than 1e-2), maybe the concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1? Or do I need to account for the consumption? Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given concentrations directly, assuming that the free SCN- is close to 0.1 M because it's in excess. Let me think. The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014maybe that's the total SCN-? Wait, but if some SCN- is in complexes, then the free SCN- would be less. But the problem might be simplifying it, perhaps stating that the total SCN- is 0.1 M. Wait, the question might be a bit ambiguous here. Wait, the wording says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014probably that's the total concentration, including both free and in complexes. Hmm, but in that case, I need to consider the distribution of SCN- between free and bound. But maybe the problem is considering that the SCN- is in such excess that the free concentration is approximately 0.1 M. Let me see. The total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- is 0.1 M. Since each complex can have up to four SCN- ligands, the maximum that could be consumed is 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M, so the free SCN- would be 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M. Wait, but that's not exactly right. The actual consumption depends on the distribution of the complexes. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me see the options. The answer choices are in the range of 16% to 42%, so perhaps the approximation is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M and that the free SCN- is approximately that because it's in large excess. Since the total Co is 0.01 M, and each complex uses up SCN-, but since SCN- is 0.1, which is ten times the Co concentration, maybe the approximation holds. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, to find the fraction of Co in the dithiocyanato complex (which is the n=2 species?), that's [Co(SCN)\u2082] divided by the total Co concentration. The total Co is the sum over all species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082] + [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b + [Co(SCN)\u2084]\u00b2\u207b. Let me denote each species as Co0 (free Co\u00b2+), Co1 (n=1), Co2 (n=2), Co3, Co4. \n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21=9 (for n=1), \u03b22=40 (n=2), \u03b23=63 (n=3), \u03b24=16 (n=4). Wait, but wait, the \u03b2 values are for the formation of each complex stepwise? Or are they cumulative? Hmm, I think \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So \u03b22 would be [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^2) = \u03b22. So each \u03b2 is the product of the stepwise formation constants. \n\nThe formula for the distribution of species is such that the concentration of each species is given by:\n\n[Co_n] = \u03b2n * [Co\u00b2+]_total * [SCN-]^n / (1 + \u03a3 (\u03b2i [SCN-]^i)), but wait, maybe the denominator is the sum over all terms \u03b2i [SCN-]^i multiplied by the initial concentration. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the distribution of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt is given by:\n\nTotal Co = [Co\u00b2+] + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^1 + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^4. Wait, no, actually each term is \u03b2n * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-]^n divided by (1 + sum terms?), no, perhaps better to think in terms of the distribution coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nThe fraction of Co in the n-ligand complex is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{i=0}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i ), multiplied by the total concentration. Wait, let me recall the general formula. \n\nThe total concentration of the metal is:\n\nc(Co) = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082] + ... \n\nEach of these can be written in terms of \u03b2 and [Co\u00b2+]:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^1 \n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nSimilarly for the others. So, substituting into the total concentration:\n\nc(Co) = [Co\u00b2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nTherefore, [Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nOnce we have [Co\u00b2+], the concentration of each species can be found by multiplying by \u03b2n [SCN-]^n. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nThe total Co is c(Co), so the fraction is [Co(SCN)\u2082]/c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 100 times that fraction.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21 =9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN-] is given as 0.1 M. Let me confirm that. The problem states \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014so that's the free SCN-? Or is that the total? Wait, in the equation above, the [SCN-] is the free concentration. But the problem might have given the total SCN- concentration. Hmm. Wait, this is a critical point. The question says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014probably that's the total concentration, including both free and bound SCN-. Because if it were the free concentration, then the total would be more, but the problem might be using the given [SCN-] as the free concentration. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous here, but in such problems, sometimes they give the total ligand concentration as the free one when it's in excess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the free SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let me proceed with that assumption, since otherwise, we would need to set up more complex equations involving both the Co and SCN- distributions, which complicates things. Let me proceed with the given [SCN-] as the free concentration, so 0.1 M.\n\nSo, let's compute the denominator first:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN-]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN-]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n1.9 +0.4 =2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n\n2.363 +0.0016 \u22482.3646\n\nSo denominator \u22482.3646\n\nThe numerator for the Co(SCN)\u2082 (n=2) is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =0.4 (as calculated above).\n\nSo the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.1691 (approx 16.91%). Wait, but that would correspond to option D, 16.9%. But the options have D as 16.9%, but wait the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, the numerator for the fraction is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 divided by the denominator. The denominator is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = let me add again:\n\n1 (from the first term)\n\nplus 0.9 (\u03b21*0.1) \u2192 total 1.9\n\nplus 0.4 (\u03b22*0.01) \u2192 2.3\n\nplus 0.063 (\u03b23*0.001) \u2192 2.363\n\nplus 0.0016 \u2192 2.3646. Correct.\n\nNumerator is \u03b22 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 =0.4. \n\nSo 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691 \u2192 ~16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\"\u2014wait, is the dithiocyanato (n=2) the blue one? Maybe I have to check if I considered the right n. Let me think. The problem states \"dithiocyanato\", which is two SCN- ligands. So n=2. So the calculation is correct. But why is the answer not matching any of the higher options? Let me see the options again. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So according to this calculation, D is the answer. But maybe I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me re-express the formula again. The fraction of the species with n ligands is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{i=0}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i ). Wait, but the denominator is actually the sum over all terms including i from 0 (the free Co\u00b2+ term, which is \u03b20=1?), right. The formula I used is correct because the total Co is [Co\u00b2+] (1 + ...). So the fraction for each species is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) divided by the total sum. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe the stability constants given here are not the overall \u03b2 but the stepwise ones? Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b21 is for the first complex (n=1), \u03b22 is for the second (n=2), etc. So they are the overall stability constants. So the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check \u03b24 term. For \u03b24, which is for n=4, so [SCN-]^4. So 16*(0.1)^4 =16*0.0001=0.0016. That's correct. \n\nHmm, so according to this calculation, the answer is D, 16.9%. But the options have A as 42.3%. Maybe I made a mistake in the assumption about the SCN- concentration. If the [SCN-] given is the total SCN- (both free and bound), then we need to adjust for that. Let's see. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let\u2019s denote [SCN-]free as x. The total SCN- is the sum of all free and bound. The bound SCN- is the sum over n=1 to 4 of n * [Co_n]. Each [Co_n] is \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^n. So total SCN- is:\n\nTotal SCN- = x + (1*[CoSCN+] + 2*[Co(SCN)\u2082] + 3*[Co(SCN)\u2083] +4*[Co(SCN)\u2084])\n\nBut substituting each term:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] x\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2083] = \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b3\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2084] = \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+] x\u2074\n\nSo total SCN-:\n\nTotal SCN- = x + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] x (1) + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2 (2) + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+]x\u00b3 (3) + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+]x^4 (4)\n\nWait, no, actually, for each term, the number of SCN- in each complex is n. So the total bound SCN- is sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co_n] = sum_{n=1}^4 n * \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^{n}\n\nThus, total SCN- is x + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^{n} = 0.1 M.\n\nBut [Co\u00b2+] is equal to c(Co) divided by the denominator (as before):\n\n[Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x\u00b2 + \u03b23 x\u00b3 + \u03b24 x^4 )\n\nSo substituting into the equation for total SCN-:\n\nx + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n (c(Co)/denom) x^n = 0.1\n\nThis becomes a complicated equation in x, since x is the free SCN- concentration. This complicates things significantly because now we have to solve for x. The initial approach assumed that x \u22480.1, but if that's not valid, then the calculation would be different.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the question expects the first approach, where [SCN-] is considered as free? Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complex and requires solving for x, which might not be feasible without more information or iterative methods. Since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe the first approach is intended. However, the answer from that gives D)16.9%, which is an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator and numerator again:\n\nDenominator: 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001)\n\nBreaking down:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total so far 2.3\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646\n\nNumerator for n=2: 40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 0.4 /2.3646 \u22480.1691 \u2192 16.9%. That's correct.\n\nSo that's D. But the options include 42.3% which is higher. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as n=2, but maybe the blue species is a different one. Wait, maybe the blue color is from a different complex? For example, maybe the trithiocyanato complex (n=3) is blue? Or maybe I have the stability constants mixed up.\n\nWait, the problem states \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\"\u2014dithiocyanato is two, so n=2. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the stability constants are given as stepwise instead of overall. Wait, if \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the overall \u03b2 for n would be \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... up to n? Let me think. \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first step (adding first SCN-), then \u03b22 would be the second step (adding the second), so the overall \u03b22 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. Wait, but the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes\"\u2014so probably they are given as overall. So the initial calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up \u03b23 and \u03b24? Wait, let me check the problem again: \"\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b23 is 63, \u03b24 is 16. So the terms in the denominator are correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, and the free [SCN-] is not 0.1. Let me try to do the calculation with that in mind. Let's denote x as the free [SCN-]. Then, the total Co is 0.01 M, and total SCN- is 0.1 M.\n\nThe total SCN- is x + (sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co_n]). \n\nEach [Co_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^n. \n\nAnd [Co\u00b2+] = (0.01) / (1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x^2 + \u03b23 x^3 + \u03b24 x^4 )\n\nLet me denote D = 1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x^2 + \u03b23 x^3 + \u03b24 x^4 \n\nSo [Co\u00b2+] = 0.01 / D \n\nThen, the total SCN- is x + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n (0.01/D) x^n =0.1 \n\nSo:\n\nx + (0.01/D) * [ \u03b21 x + 2 \u03b22 x^2 + 3 \u03b23 x^3 +4 \u03b24 x^4 ] =0.1 \n\nThis equation must be solved for x. This seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate.\n\nLet me suppose that x is close to 0.1, but perhaps a bit lower. Let me try plugging in x=0.1:\n\nCompute D first:\n\nD=1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001)+16*(0.0001)= same as before, 2.3646 \n\nThen the second term in the equation:\n\n0.01/D * [9*(0.1) + 2*40*(0.01) + 3*63*(0.001) +4*16*(0.0001)]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst part inside the brackets:\n\n9*0.1 =0.9\n\n2*40*(0.01)=2*0.4=0.8\n\n3*63*(0.001)=3*0.063=0.189\n\n4*16*(0.0001)=4*0.0016=0.0064 \n\nSum those: 0.9+0.8=1.7; +0.189=1.889; +0.0064\u22481.8954 \n\nMultiply by 0.01/D: 0.01/2.3646 *1.8954 \u2248 (0.01 *1.8954)/2.3646 \u22480.018954/2.3646\u22480.008016 \n\nSo total left-hand side (LHS) is x + 0.008016 =0.1 +0.008016=0.108016. But the total SCN- is supposed to be 0.1, so this is over by ~0.008. Thus, x must be a bit less than 0.1.

That's very close to 0.1. So x\u22480.093 gives total SCN- of ~0.1005. So x\u22480.093 is a good approximation. \n\nNow, using this x\u22480.093, let's compute the fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082 (n=2):\n\nFirst, compute [Co\u00b2+] =0.01 / D. D is approximately 2.2348 (from previous calculation at x=0.093). So [Co\u00b2+] =0.01 /2.2348 \u22480.004474 M. \n\nThe concentration of Co(SCN)\u2082 is \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2 =40 *0.004474*(0.093)^2 \n\nFirst compute x\u00b2: 0.093\u00b2=0.008649 \n\nThen 40 *0.004474 =0.17896 \n\nMultiply by 0.008649: 0.17896 *0.008649\u22480.001548 M \n\nThe total Co is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.001548 /0.01 =0.1548 \u2192 ~15.48%. \n\nHmm, which is approximately 15.5%, closer to D (16.9%) but not exactly. But this is an approximation. However, the difference from the initial calculation (16.9%) is because we considered the free SCN- to be 0.1 instead of ~0.093. \n\nWait, but this is getting into more precise calculations. The problem might expect us to use the first method where [SCN-] is given as free, leading to D)16.9%. The options given include 16.9% as D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the \u03b2 values are overall. Let me think again. Suppose that \u03b21 is the stepwise formation constant for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. Then the overall \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22, and so on. \n\nWait, the stability constants can be given in two ways: as cumulative or stepwise. If \u03b21 is the first step (adding one SCN-), then \u03b22 would be the second step (adding another), so the overall \u03b22 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. \n\nWait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So if \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc., then they are the cumulative (overall) stability constants. Because the overall stability constant \u03b2_n is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So the problem states \u03b21 to \u03b24 as the overall. \n\nTherefore, my initial calculation is correct. The answer should be D. \n\nBut why is the option A)42.3%? Let me see if I might have mixed up the terms. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for the fraction. \n\nThe fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2) divided by the denominator (sum of all terms). \n\nWait, the denominator is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4. \n\nSo in the numerator for n=2, it's \u03b22 [SCN-]^2. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, let me see what would happen if I considered the denominator as 1 + (\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b24)*[SCN-], which is not the case. No, that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake in adding up the terms? Let me re-add the denominator terms when [SCN-] is 0.1:\n\n1 (the 1 term)\n\n\u03b21 [SCN-] =9*0.1=0.9 \u2192 total 1.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total 2.3\n\n\u03b23 [SCN-]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\n\u03b24 [SCN-]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThus, the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. But why the discrepancy when considering the free SCN-? Because in that case, the value was lower (~15.5%). But the problem might not require that level of precision, assuming that SCN- is in excess and thus the free concentration is close to 0.1 M. Since the given options include D, I'll go with that.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2+ species. The question gives me the stability constants \u03b21 through \u03b24. The concentrations are Co\u00b2+ at 10^-2 M and SCN- at 0.1 M. Hmm, stability constants... right, the \u03b2 values are for the formation of complexes with different numbers of SCN- ligands. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the stability constant \u03b2n for a complex [Co(SCN)n]^2+ would be given by the formation reaction: Co\u00b2+ + nSCN\u207b \u21cc [Co(SCN)n]^2+, and \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n]^2+ / ([Co\u00b2+][SCN\u207b]^n). \n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082]^0 + ... up to the fourth complex. Wait, but cobalt here is Co(II), so the charge on the complexes would be 2+ minus the number of SCN- ligands? Wait, SCN- is a monodentate ligand, each contributes -1 charge. So for each SCN- added, the charge decreases by 1? Let me think. The original Co\u00b2+ has a +2 charge. Adding one SCN- (which is -1) would make the complex +1, right? So the first complex would be [CoSCN]^+, then adding another SCN- would make it neutral? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the charge is Co\u00b2+ plus each SCN- is -1. So each SCN- subtracts 1 from the charge. So [Co(SCN)n]^2+ has charge 2+ minus (n*(-1))? Wait no, the ligands contribute their charge. Each SCN- is -1. So the overall charge would be 2+ (from Co\u00b2+) plus (n * -1) from the SCN-. So the charge is (2 - n). So for n=1, the charge is +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. But in solution, the complexes must be neutral or charged in a way that they can exist. Maybe the complexes are in solution with counterions? Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about that right now. The main point is that the stability constants are given for the formation of each complex up to four SCN- ligands. \n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Wait, but the SCN- is given as 0.1 M, but in reality, some of it is consumed in forming the complexes. However, since the SCN- is in excess (0.1 is higher than 1e-2), maybe the concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1? Or do I need to account for the consumption? Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given concentrations directly, assuming that the free SCN- is close to 0.1 M because it's in excess. Let me think. The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014maybe that's the total SCN-? Wait, but if some SCN- is in complexes, then the free SCN- would be less. But the problem might be simplifying it, perhaps stating that the total SCN- is 0.1 M. Wait, the question might be a bit ambiguous here. Wait, the wording says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014probably that's the total concentration, including both free and in complexes. Hmm, but in that case, I need to consider the distribution of SCN- between free and bound. But maybe the problem is considering that the SCN- is in such excess that the free concentration is approximately 0.1 M. Let me see. The total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- is 0.1 M. Since each complex can have up to four SCN- ligands, the maximum that could be consumed is 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M, so the free SCN- would be 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M. Wait, but that's not exactly right. The actual consumption depends on the distribution of the complexes. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me see the options. The answer choices are in the range of 16% to 42%, so perhaps the approximation is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M and that the free SCN- is approximately that because it's in large excess. Since the total Co is 0.01 M, and each complex uses up SCN-, but since SCN- is 0.1, which is ten times the Co concentration, maybe the approximation holds. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, to find the fraction of Co in the dithiocyanato complex (which is the n=2 species?), that's [Co(SCN)\u2082] divided by the total Co concentration. The total Co is the sum over all species: [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082] + [Co(SCN)\u2083]\u207b + [Co(SCN)\u2084]\u00b2\u207b. Let me denote each species as Co0 (free Co\u00b2+), Co1 (n=1), Co2 (n=2), Co3, Co4. \n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21=9 (for n=1), \u03b22=40 (n=2), \u03b23=63 (n=3), \u03b24=16 (n=4). Wait, but wait, the \u03b2 values are for the formation of each complex stepwise? Or are they cumulative? Hmm, I think \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So \u03b22 would be [Co(SCN)\u2082]/([Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^2) = \u03b22. So each \u03b2 is the product of the stepwise formation constants. \n\nThe formula for the distribution of species is such that the concentration of each species is given by:\n\n[Co_n] = \u03b2n * [Co\u00b2+]_total * [SCN-]^n / (1 + \u03a3 (\u03b2i [SCN-]^i)), but wait, maybe the denominator is the sum over all terms \u03b2i [SCN-]^i multiplied by the initial concentration. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the distribution of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt is given by:\n\nTotal Co = [Co\u00b2+] + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^1 + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^4. Wait, no, actually each term is \u03b2n * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-]^n divided by (1 + sum terms?), no, perhaps better to think in terms of the distribution coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, the fraction of each species is given by:\n\nThe fraction of Co in the n-ligand complex is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{i=0}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i ), multiplied by the total concentration. Wait, let me recall the general formula. \n\nThe total concentration of the metal is:\n\nc(Co) = [Co\u00b2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)\u2082] + ... \n\nEach of these can be written in terms of \u03b2 and [Co\u00b2+]:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^1 \n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nSimilarly for the others. So, substituting into the total concentration:\n\nc(Co) = [Co\u00b2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nTherefore, [Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nOnce we have [Co\u00b2+], the concentration of each species can be found by multiplying by \u03b2n [SCN-]^n. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nThe total Co is c(Co), so the fraction is [Co(SCN)\u2082]/c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nTherefore, the percentage is 100 times that fraction.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21 =9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN-] is given as 0.1 M. Let me confirm that. The problem states \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014so that's the free SCN-? Or is that the total? Wait, in the equation above, the [SCN-] is the free concentration. But the problem might have given the total SCN- concentration. Hmm. Wait, this is a critical point. The question says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\"\u2014probably that's the total concentration, including both free and bound SCN-. Because if it were the free concentration, then the total would be more, but the problem might be using the given [SCN-] as the free concentration. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous here, but in such problems, sometimes they give the total ligand concentration as the free one when it's in excess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the free SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let me proceed with that assumption, since otherwise, we would need to set up more complex equations involving both the Co and SCN- distributions, which complicates things. Let me proceed with the given [SCN-] as the free concentration, so 0.1 M.\n\nSo, let's compute the denominator first:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b21 [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4\n\n\u03b23 [SCN-]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 [SCN-]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n1.9 +0.4 =2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063=2.363\n\n2.363 +0.0016 \u22482.3646\n\nSo denominator \u22482.3646\n\nThe numerator for the Co(SCN)\u2082 (n=2) is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =0.4 (as calculated above).\n\nSo the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u22480.1691 (approx 16.91%). Wait, but that would correspond to option D, 16.9%. But the options have D as 16.9%, but wait the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, the numerator for the fraction is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 divided by the denominator. The denominator is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = let me add again:\n\n1 (from the first term)\n\nplus 0.9 (\u03b21*0.1) \u2192 total 1.9\n\nplus 0.4 (\u03b22*0.01) \u2192 2.3\n\nplus 0.063 (\u03b23*0.001) \u2192 2.363\n\nplus 0.0016 \u2192 2.3646. Correct.\n\nNumerator is \u03b22 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 =0.4. \n\nSo 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691 \u2192 ~16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\"\u2014wait, is the dithiocyanato (n=2) the blue one? Maybe I have to check if I considered the right n. Let me think. The problem states \"dithiocyanato\", which is two SCN- ligands. So n=2. So the calculation is correct. But why is the answer not matching any of the higher options? Let me see the options again. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So according to this calculation, D is the answer. But maybe I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let me re-express the formula again. The fraction of the species with n ligands is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{i=0}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i ). Wait, but the denominator is actually the sum over all terms including i from 0 (the free Co\u00b2+ term, which is \u03b20=1?), right. The formula I used is correct because the total Co is [Co\u00b2+] (1 + ...). So the fraction for each species is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) divided by the total sum. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe the stability constants given here are not the overall \u03b2 but the stepwise ones? Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b21 is for the first complex (n=1), \u03b22 is for the second (n=2), etc. So they are the overall stability constants. So the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check \u03b24 term. For \u03b24, which is for n=4, so [SCN-]^4. So 16*(0.1)^4 =16*0.0001=0.0016. That's correct. \n\nHmm, so according to this calculation, the answer is D, 16.9%. But the options have A as 42.3%. Maybe I made a mistake in the assumption about the SCN- concentration. If the [SCN-] given is the total SCN- (both free and bound), then we need to adjust for that. Let's see. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let\u2019s denote [SCN-]free as x. The total SCN- is the sum of all free and bound. The bound SCN- is the sum over n=1 to 4 of n * [Co_n]. Each [Co_n] is \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^n. So total SCN- is:\n\nTotal SCN- = x + (1*[CoSCN+] + 2*[Co(SCN)\u2082] + 3*[Co(SCN)\u2083] +4*[Co(SCN)\u2084])\n\nBut substituting each term:\n\n[CoSCN+] = \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] x\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2082] = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2083] = \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b3\n\n[Co(SCN)\u2084] = \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+] x\u2074\n\nSo total SCN-:\n\nTotal SCN- = x + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] x (1) + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2 (2) + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+]x\u00b3 (3) + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+]x^4 (4)\n\nWait, no, actually, for each term, the number of SCN- in each complex is n. So the total bound SCN- is sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co_n] = sum_{n=1}^4 n * \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^{n}\n\nThus, total SCN- is x + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^{n} = 0.1 M.\n\nBut [Co\u00b2+] is equal to c(Co) divided by the denominator (as before):\n\n[Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x\u00b2 + \u03b23 x\u00b3 + \u03b24 x^4 )\n\nSo substituting into the equation for total SCN-:\n\nx + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n (c(Co)/denom) x^n = 0.1\n\nThis becomes a complicated equation in x, since x is the free SCN- concentration. This complicates things significantly because now we have to solve for x. The initial approach assumed that x \u22480.1, but if that's not valid, then the calculation would be different.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the question expects the first approach, where [SCN-] is considered as free? Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complex and requires solving for x, which might not be feasible without more information or iterative methods. Since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe the first approach is intended. However, the answer from that gives D)16.9%, which is an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator and numerator again:\n\nDenominator: 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001)\n\nBreaking down:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total so far 2.3\n\n63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\n16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646\n\nNumerator for n=2: 40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 0.4 /2.3646 \u22480.1691 \u2192 16.9%. That's correct.\n\nSo that's D. But the options include 42.3% which is higher. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex as n=2, but maybe the blue species is a different one. Wait, maybe the blue color is from a different complex? For example, maybe the trithiocyanato complex (n=3) is blue? Or maybe I have the stability constants mixed up.\n\nWait, the problem states \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\"\u2014dithiocyanato is two, so n=2. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the stability constants are given as stepwise instead of overall. Wait, if \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the overall \u03b2 for n would be \u03b21 * \u03b22 * ... up to n? Let me think. \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first step (adding first SCN-), then \u03b22 would be the second step (adding the second), so the overall \u03b22 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. Wait, but the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes\"\u2014so probably they are given as overall. So the initial calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up \u03b23 and \u03b24? Wait, let me check the problem again: \"\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b23 is 63, \u03b24 is 16. So the terms in the denominator are correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, and the free [SCN-] is not 0.1. Let me try to do the calculation with that in mind. Let's denote x as the free [SCN-]. Then, the total Co is 0.01 M, and total SCN- is 0.1 M.\n\nThe total SCN- is x + (sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co_n]). \n\nEach [Co_n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+] x^n. \n\nAnd [Co\u00b2+] = (0.01) / (1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x^2 + \u03b23 x^3 + \u03b24 x^4 )\n\nLet me denote D = 1 + \u03b21 x + \u03b22 x^2 + \u03b23 x^3 + \u03b24 x^4 \n\nSo [Co\u00b2+] = 0.01 / D \n\nThen, the total SCN- is x + sum_{n=1}^4 n \u03b2n (0.01/D) x^n =0.1 \n\nSo:\n\nx + (0.01/D) * [ \u03b21 x + 2 \u03b22 x^2 + 3 \u03b23 x^3 +4 \u03b24 x^4 ] =0.1 \n\nThis equation must be solved for x. This seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate.\n\nLet me suppose that x is close to 0.1, but perhaps a bit lower. Let me try plugging in x=0.1:\n\nCompute D first:\n\nD=1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001)+16*(0.0001)= same as before, 2.3646 \n\nThen the second term in the equation:\n\n0.01/D * [9*(0.1) + 2*40*(0.01) + 3*63*(0.001) +4*16*(0.0001)]\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst part inside the brackets:\n\n9*0.1 =0.9\n\n2*40*(0.01)=2*0.4=0.8\n\n3*63*(0.001)=3*0.063=0.189\n\n4*16*(0.0001)=4*0.0016=0.0064 \n\nSum those: 0.9+0.8=1.7; +0.189=1.889; +0.0064\u22481.8954 \n\nMultiply by 0.01/D: 0.01/2.3646 *1.8954 \u2248 (0.01 *1.8954)/2.3646 \u22480.018954/2.3646\u22480.008016 \n\nSo total left-hand side (LHS) is x + 0.008016 =0.1 +0.008016=0.108016. But the total SCN- is supposed to be 0.1, so this is over by ~0.008. Thus, x must be a bit less than 0.1. Let me try x=0.09.\n\nCompute D at x=0.09:\n\nD=1 +9*(0.09) +40*(0.09)^2 +63*(0.09)^3 +16*(0.09)^4 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n9*0.09=0.81\n\n40*(0.0081)=0.324\n\n63*(0.000729)=approx 63*0.000729\u22480.0459\n\n16*(0.09)^4: 0.09^4 is 0.0006561, 16*0.0006561\u22480.0105 \n\nAdding up: 1+0.81=1.81; +0.324=2.134; +0.0459=2.1799; +0.0105\u22482.1904 \n\nSo D\u22482.1904 \n\nNow compute the second term:\n\n[ \u03b21 x +2\u03b22x\u00b2 +3\u03b23x\u00b3 +4\u03b24x^4 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\u03b21 x =9*0.09=0.81\n\n2\u03b22x\u00b2 =2*40*(0.0081)=2*40*0.0081= 2*0.324=0.648 \n\n3\u03b23x\u00b3 =3*63*(0.09)^3=3*63*(0.000729)=3*0.045927\u22480.1378 \n\n4\u03b24x^4=4*16*(0.09)^4=4*16*(0.0006561)=4*0.010498\u22480.04199 \n\nTotal inside the brackets: 0.81 +0.648=1.458; +0.1378=1.5958; +0.04199\u22481.6378 \n\nMultiply by 0.01/D: 0.01 /2.1904 *1.6378 \u2248 (0.016378)/2.1904 \u22480.007475 \n\nThus, LHS =x +0.007475 =0.09 +0.007475\u22480.097475. Which is less than 0.1. \n\nWe need to find x such that LHS=0.1. \n\nAt x=0.095:\n\nLet me compute D:\n\nx=0.095\n\nFirst terms:\n\n9*0.095 =0.855\n\n40*(0.095)^2 =40*(0.009025)=0.361\n\n63*(0.095)^3=63*(0.000857)= approx 63*0.000857\u22480.0539 \n\n16*(0.095)^4=16*(0.095)^4. Let's compute (0.095)^4: 0.095^2=0.009025, squared again: ~0.00008145, so 16*0.00008145\u22480.001303 \n\nAdding up D terms:\n\n1 +0.855=1.855; +0.361=2.216; +0.0539\u22482.2699; +0.0013\u22482.2712 \n\nNow compute the bracketed term:\n\n\u03b21x=9*0.095=0.855\n\n2\u03b22x\u00b2=2*40*(0.095)^2=2*40*0.009025=2*0.361=0.722 \n\n3\u03b23x\u00b3=3*63*(0.095)^3=3*63*(0.000857)=3*0.0539\u22480.1617 \n\n4\u03b24x^4=4*16*(0.095)^4=4*16*(0.00008145)=4*0.001303\u22480.00521 \n\nSum: 0.855+0.722=1.577; +0.1617=1.7387; +0.0052\u22481.7439 \n\nMultiply by 0.01/D: 0.01/2.2712 *1.7439 \u2248 (0.017439)/2.2712\u22480.00768 \n\nThus LHS =0.095 +0.00768\u22480.10268. \n\nThis is closer to 0.1. The target is 0.1. \n\nSo at x=0.095, LHS is ~0.10268 (over by ~0.00268)\n\nAt x=0.093:\n\nCompute D:\n\nx=0.093\n\n9x=0.837\n\n40x\u00b2=40*(0.008649)=0.34596 \n\n63x\u00b3=63*(0.093)^3. Let's compute 0.093^3: 0.093*0.093=0.008649, then *0.093\u22480.000804. 63*0.000804\u22480.05065 \n\n16x\u2074=16*(0.093)^4. 0.093^4= (0.093^2)^2 \u2248(0.008649)^2\u22480.0000748, so 16*0.0000748\u22480.001197 \n\nTotal D: 1 +0.837=1.837; +0.34596\u22482.18296; +0.05065\u22482.2336; +0.001197\u22482.2348 \n\nThe bracketed term:\n\n\u03b21x=0.837 \n\n2\u03b22x\u00b2=2*40*(0.008649)=2*0.34596\u22480.6919 \n\n3\u03b23x\u00b3=3*63*(0.000804)=3*0.05065\u22480.15195 \n\n4\u03b24x\u2074=4*16*(0.0000748)=4*0.001197\u22480.004788 \n\nTotal: 0.837 +0.6919\u22481.5289 +0.15195\u22481.68085 +0.004788\u22481.6856 \n\nMultiply by 0.01/D: 0.01/2.2348 *1.6856 \u2248 (0.016856)/2.2348\u22480.007545 \n\nThus LHS =0.093 +0.007545\u22480.100545. That's very close to 0.1. So x\u22480.093 gives total SCN- of ~0.1005. So x\u22480.093 is a good approximation. \n\nNow, using this x\u22480.093, let's compute the fraction of Co(SCN)\u2082 (n=2):\n\nFirst, compute [Co\u00b2+] =0.01 / D. D is approximately 2.2348 (from previous calculation at x=0.093). So [Co\u00b2+] =0.01 /2.2348 \u22480.004474 M. \n\nThe concentration of Co(SCN)\u2082 is \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] x\u00b2 =40 *0.004474*(0.093)^2 \n\nFirst compute x\u00b2: 0.093\u00b2=0.008649 \n\nThen 40 *0.004474 =0.17896 \n\nMultiply by 0.008649: 0.17896 *0.008649\u22480.001548 M \n\nThe total Co is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.001548 /0.01 =0.1548 \u2192 ~15.48%. \n\nHmm, which is approximately 15.5%, closer to D (16.9%) but not exactly. But this is an approximation. However, the difference from the initial calculation (16.9%) is because we considered the free SCN- to be 0.1 instead of ~0.093. \n\nWait, but this is getting into more precise calculations. The problem might expect us to use the first method where [SCN-] is given as free, leading to D)16.9%. The options given include 16.9% as D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the \u03b2 values are overall. Let me think again. Suppose that \u03b21 is the stepwise formation constant for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. Then the overall \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22, and so on. \n\nWait, the stability constants can be given in two ways: as cumulative or stepwise. If \u03b21 is the first step (adding one SCN-), then \u03b22 would be the second step (adding another), so the overall \u03b22 would be \u03b21 * \u03b22. \n\nWait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So if \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc., then they are the cumulative (overall) stability constants. Because the overall stability constant \u03b2_n is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So the problem states \u03b21 to \u03b24 as the overall. \n\nTherefore, my initial calculation is correct. The answer should be D. \n\nBut why is the option A)42.3%? Let me see if I might have mixed up the terms. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck the formula for the fraction. \n\nThe fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2) divided by the denominator (sum of all terms). \n\nWait, the denominator is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4. \n\nSo in the numerator for n=2, it's \u03b22 [SCN-]^2. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, let me see what would happen if I considered the denominator as 1 + (\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b24)*[SCN-], which is not the case. No, that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake in adding up the terms? Let me re-add the denominator terms when [SCN-] is 0.1:\n\n1 (the 1 term)\n\n\u03b21 [SCN-] =9*0.1=0.9 \u2192 total 1.9\n\n\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total 2.3\n\n\u03b23 [SCN-]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\n\u03b24 [SCN-]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThus, the calculation gives 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. But why the discrepancy when considering the free SCN-? Because in that case, the value was lower (~15.5%). But the problem might not require that level of precision, assuming that SCN- is in excess and thus the free concentration is close to 0.1 M. Since the given options include D, I'll go with that.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u00b2\u207a) among all cobalt species, we use the given stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and concentrations (c(Co)=10\u207b\u00b2 M, [SCN\u207b]=0.1 M). \n\nThe fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of } [Co(SCN)_n] = \\frac{\\beta_n [SCN^-]^n}{1 + \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\beta_i [SCN^-]^i}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the denominator**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Denominator} &= 1 + \\beta_1 [SCN^-] + \\beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [SCN^-]^4 \\\\\n&= 1 + (9 \\times 0.1) + (40 \\times 0.1^2) + (63 \\times 0.1^3) + (16 \\times 0.1^4) \\\\\n&= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \\\\\n&= 2.3646\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerator for [Co(SCN)\u2082]**\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator} = \\beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Compute the fraction**\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.1691 \\quad (\\text{or } 16.91\\%)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:** The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN\u207b) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN\u207b concentration is 0.1 M. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Wait, the numbering here is important. Let me think: usually, \u03b2 values correspond to the formation constants for complexes with different numbers of ligands. So \u03b21 would be for the first complex (Co(SCN)+?), \u03b22 for the second (Co(SCN)2^0?), and so on up to \u03b24 for the fourth (Co(SCN)4^2-?), maybe? But the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the Co(SCN)2^0 complex. Because I remember that the blue color comes from the Co(II) complex with two SCN\u207b ligands. The other complexes might have different colors. \n\nSo first, I need to determine the distribution of all the cobalt species present in the solution. The species would be Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2^0, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2\u2212. Each of these has a stability constant \u03b2 given here. The problem is to find the fraction of the Co(SCN)2^0 species (the blue one) out of the total cobalt species.\n\nThe approach here is to use the stability constants (\u03b2 values) and the concentrations to set up equations for the distribution of the species. Since the total cobalt concentration is given, we can use the formula for the distribution coefficients. \n\nThe general formula for the fraction of a species with n SCN\u207b ligands is:\n\n\u03b1_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN-]^n) / (\u03a3 (\u03b2_k * [SCN-]^k) for k from 0 to 4)\n\nWait, but actually, the denominator here would be the sum over all possible complexes (including the free Co^2+ which is the case when n=0, but \u03b20 is 1 by definition). Wait, but let me confirm the exact formula. The sum should be the sum over all species, so the denominator is the sum from n=0 to 4 of \u03b2_n [SCN-]^n. Since \u03b20 is 1, the term for n=0 is 1* [SCN-]^0 =1. \n\nWait, but the \u03b2 values given here are for the formation constants of the complexes. The stability constant \u03b2_n is equal to the formation constant for the reaction Co^2+ + n SCN\u207b \u2192 [Co(SCN)n]^2\u2212 (or whatever charge depending on n). So the total concentration of all cobalt species is c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212]. \n\nThe fraction of each species is then \u03b1_n = [Co(SCN)n]^charge / c(Co). To find \u03b1_n, we can use the formula that relates the fractions to the \u03b2 values and [SCN-]. \n\nAlternatively, the distribution coefficient \u03b1_n can be written as (\u03b2_n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4). Because each term in the denominator corresponds to the \u03b2_k multiplied by [SCN-]^k, summed over k from 0 to 4. Since \u03b20 is 1 (because the formation constant for zero ligands is just 1), the denominator is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... up to \u03b24 [SCN-]^4. \n\nTherefore, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) would be:\n\n\u03b12 = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4)\n\nGiven the values in the problem, let's plug in the numbers. \n\nThe SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Let's compute each term in the denominator:\n\nFirst, let's note the \u03b2 values given:\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, but hold on, the problem states \u03b24 is 16. Hmm, so the fourth complex's \u03b2 is 16? That seems lower than \u03b23. Interesting. So the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nWait a second, that might be a typo in my understanding? Because usually, the stability constants might increase up to a point and then decrease, but let's just take them as given. \n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nTerm for n=0: 1 (since \u03b20 is 1, [SCN-]^0 is 1).\n\nTerm n=1: \u03b21 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm n=2: \u03b22*(0.1)^2 = 40*(0.01) = 0.4\n\nTerm n=3: \u03b23*(0.1)^3 = 63*(0.001) = 0.063\n\nTerm n=4: \u03b24*(0.1)^4 =16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nNow, adding all these terms together for the denominator:\n\n1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's compute step by step:\n\n1 +0.9 =1.9\n\n1.9 +0.4 =2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063 =2.363\n\n2.363 +0.0016 \u2248 2.3646\n\nSo denominator is approximately 2.3646.\n\nThe numerator for \u03b12 is \u03b22*(0.1)^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4.\n\nTherefore, \u03b12=0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute that division. \n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let's see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.17 = approx 0.402 (since 2.3646 *0.17 = 0.402). Wait, exactly:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.17 \u2248 (2 \u00d70.17)=0.34, (0.3646\u00d70.17)=approx 0.062, so total ~0.402. So 0.17 gives ~0.402. \n\nBut 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is exactly:\n\n0.4 /2.3646 \u2248 0.1691. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646:\n\nLet me do this division properly. Let's see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 ?\n\n0.1 times 2.3646 =0.23646\n\n0.06 times 2.3646 =0.141876\n\n0.009 times 2.3646 =0.0212814\n\nAdding those: 0.23646 +0.141876 =0.378336 +0.0212814 \u22480.4. So 0.169 *2.3646 \u22480.4. \n\nTherefore, the value of \u03b12 is approximately 0.169 or 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options include 16.9% (option D). However, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)2^0. But according to this calculation, the fraction is ~16.9%. So option D would be the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation steps again because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents or the \u03b2 values. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator again step by step:\n\nTerm0: 1\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 * [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1 =0.9 \u2192 total so far 1.9\n\nTerm2: \u03b22*(0.1)^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total 2.3\n\nTerm3: \u03b23*(0.1)^3 =63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\nTerm4: \u03b24*(0.1)^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646. So that's correct.\n\nNumerator for \u03b12 is 0.4. So 0.4 divided by 2.3646 equals approximately 0.169, so 16.9%. That's D. \n\nHmm. But wait, the problem states the blue complex is the dithiocyanato (n=2), which we found to be 16.9%. But let me think again: sometimes the stability constants might be given as log \u03b2, but in the problem it says \u03b21=9, so they are already the stability constants (not their logs). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different? Let me think again. \n\nThe distribution coefficient for species n is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) divided by the sum over all k (\u03b2_k [SCN]^k). So that's exactly what I did. \n\nWait, but another possible mistake: the \u03b2 values here are for the formation of each complex. For example, \u03b21 would be the formation constant for Co^2+ + SCN- \u2192 Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1?), then \u03b22 would be for adding another SCN- to form Co(SCN)2^0, and so on. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charge of the complex affects the actual concentrations? Wait, but the formula using the \u03b2 values already accounts for that. Because the formation constants (\u03b2) already include the stoichiometry and charges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u03b2 values given are for each stepwise formation? Wait, stability constants can be expressed as stepwise or overall. Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So these are the overall stability constants. \n\nThe overall stability constant \u03b2_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nCo\u00b2\u207a + n SCN\u207b \u2192 [Co(SCN)n]^2\u2212+ (charge depends on n, but the \u03b2 is the overall constant). \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct as used. \n\nHmm. So according to this calculation, the answer is D) 16.9%. \n\nBut wait, the options include 42.3% (A), which is much higher. Did I make a mistake in the denominator's terms? Let me check the exponents again. \n\nWait, the term for \u03b24 is (SCN^-)^4, so with 0.1^4 = 0.0001, multiplied by 16 gives 0.0016. Correct. \n\nTerm3 is 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 =0.063. Correct. \n\nTerm2 is 40*(0.1)^2 =40*0.01=0.4. \n\nTerm1 is 9*(0.1)=0.9. \n\nAdding all terms gives 1+0.9=1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 gives 2.363, plus 0.0016 gives 2.3646. \n\nYes, so denominator is correct. \n\nThe numerator for the second complex (n=2) is 0.4. \n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, so D. \n\nHmm. But maybe I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one? Let me think again. The problem says \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\", which is two SCN- ligands. \n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the color of the cobalt complexes with SCN- might vary. For example, Co(II) with four SCN- might form a pink complex, and lower ones might be blue. Alternatively, maybe the blue is for the +2 charge? Let me check my memory. \n\nWait, actually, I think that the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) has a charge of zero, and is blue, while the tetrathiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)4^2-) is pink. So the blue one is indeed the n=2 complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the trithiocyanato? No, the question says dithiocyanato (two). \n\nHmm. So the calculation seems correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nWait, another way to think: the total concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, but in the formula for \u03b1_n, the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. The formula for \u03b1_n doesn't depend on the total cobalt concentration because it's a ratio. So the fractions are independent of the total concentration, which makes sense because they depend only on the equilibrium constants and the ligand concentration. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the answer should be D) 16.9%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN\u207b) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN\u207b concentration is 0.1 M. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Wait, the numbering here is important. Let me think: usually, \u03b2 values correspond to the formation constants for complexes with different numbers of ligands. So \u03b21 would be for the first complex (Co(SCN)+?), \u03b22 for the second (Co(SCN)2^0?), and so on up to \u03b24 for the fourth (Co(SCN)4^2-?), maybe? But the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the Co(SCN)2^0 complex. Because I remember that the blue color comes from the Co(II) complex with two SCN\u207b ligands. The other complexes might have different colors. \n\nSo first, I need to determine the distribution of all the cobalt species present in the solution. The species would be Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2^0, Co(SCN)3^-, and Co(SCN)4^2\u2212. Each of these has a stability constant \u03b2 given here. The problem is to find the fraction of the Co(SCN)2^0 species (the blue one) out of the total cobalt species.\n\nThe approach here is to use the stability constants (\u03b2 values) and the concentrations to set up equations for the distribution of the species. Since the total cobalt concentration is given, we can use the formula for the distribution coefficients. \n\nThe general formula for the fraction of a species with n SCN\u207b ligands is:\n\n\u03b1_n = (\u03b2_n * [SCN-]^n) / (\u03a3 (\u03b2_k * [SCN-]^k) for k from 0 to 4)\n\nWait, but actually, the denominator here would be the sum over all possible complexes (including the free Co^2+ which is the case when n=0, but \u03b20 is 1 by definition). Wait, but let me confirm the exact formula. The sum should be the sum over all species, so the denominator is the sum from n=0 to 4 of \u03b2_n [SCN-]^n. Since \u03b20 is 1, the term for n=0 is 1* [SCN-]^0 =1. \n\nWait, but the \u03b2 values given here are for the formation constants of the complexes. The stability constant \u03b2_n is equal to the formation constant for the reaction Co^2+ + n SCN\u207b \u2192 [Co(SCN)n]^2\u2212 (or whatever charge depending on n). So the total concentration of all cobalt species is c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212]. \n\nThe fraction of each species is then \u03b1_n = [Co(SCN)n]^charge / c(Co).

Because each term in the denominator corresponds to the \u03b2_k multiplied by [SCN-]^k, summed over k from 0 to 4. Since \u03b20 is 1 (because the formation constant for zero ligands is just 1), the denominator is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... up to \u03b24 [SCN-]^4. \n\nTherefore, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) would be:\n\n\u03b12 = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4)\n\nGiven the values in the problem, let's plug in the numbers. \n\nThe SCN- concentration is 0.1 M.

Let's see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.17 = approx 0.402 (since 2.3646 *0.17 = 0.402). Wait, exactly:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.17 \u2248 (2 \u00d70.17)=0.34, (0.3646\u00d70.17)=approx 0.062, so total ~0.402. So 0.17 gives ~0.402. \n\nBut 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is exactly:\n\n0.4 /2.3646 \u2248 0.1691. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.4 divided by 2.3646:\n\nLet me do this division properly. Let's see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 ?\n\n0.1 times 2.3646 =0.23646\n\n0.06 times 2.3646 =0.141876\n\n0.009 times 2.3646 =0.0212814\n\nAdding those: 0.23646 +0.141876 =0.378336 +0.0212814 \u22480.4. So 0.169 *2.3646 \u22480.4. \n\nTherefore, the value of \u03b12 is approximately 0.169 or 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options include 16.9% (option D). However, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)2^0. But according to this calculation, the fraction is ~16.9%. So option D would be the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation steps again because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents or the \u03b2 values. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator again step by step:\n\nTerm0: 1\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 * [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1 =0.9 \u2192 total so far 1.9\n\nTerm2: \u03b22*(0.1)^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4 \u2192 total 2.3\n\nTerm3: \u03b23*(0.1)^3 =63*(0.001)=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\nTerm4: \u03b24*(0.1)^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646. So that's correct.\n\nNumerator for \u03b12 is 0.4. So 0.4 divided by 2.3646 equals approximately 0.169, so 16.9%. That's D. \n\nHmm. But wait, the problem states the blue complex is the dithiocyanato (n=2), which we found to be 16.9%. But let me think again: sometimes the stability constants might be given as log \u03b2, but in the problem it says \u03b21=9, so they are already the stability constants (not their logs). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different? Let me think again. \n\nThe distribution coefficient for species n is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) divided by the sum over all k (\u03b2_k [SCN]^k). So that's exactly what I did. \n\nWait, but another possible mistake: the \u03b2 values here are for the formation of each complex. For example, \u03b21 would be the formation constant for Co^2+ + SCN- \u2192 Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1?), then \u03b22 would be for adding another SCN- to form Co(SCN)2^0, and so on. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the charge of the complex affects the actual concentrations? Wait, but the formula using the \u03b2 values already accounts for that. Because the formation constants (\u03b2) already include the stoichiometry and charges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u03b2 values given are for each stepwise formation? Wait, stability constants can be expressed as stepwise or overall. Wait, the problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So these are the overall stability constants. \n\nThe overall stability constant \u03b2_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:\n\nCo\u00b2\u207a + n SCN\u207b \u2192 [Co(SCN)n]^2\u2212+ (charge depends on n, but the \u03b2 is the overall constant). \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct as used. \n\nHmm. So according to this calculation, the answer is D) 16.9%. \n\nBut wait, the options include 42.3% (A), which is much higher. Did I make a mistake in the denominator's terms? Let me check the exponents again. \n\nWait, the term for \u03b24 is (SCN^-)^4, so with 0.1^4 = 0.0001, multiplied by 16 gives 0.0016. Correct. \n\nTerm3 is 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 =0.063. Correct. \n\nTerm2 is 40*(0.1)^2 =40*0.01=0.4. \n\nTerm1 is 9*(0.1)=0.9. \n\nAdding all terms gives 1+0.9=1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 gives 2.363, plus 0.0016 gives 2.3646. \n\nYes, so denominator is correct. \n\nThe numerator for the second complex (n=2) is 0.4. \n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, so D. \n\nHmm. But maybe I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one? Let me think again. The problem says \"dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\", which is two SCN- ligands. \n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the color of the cobalt complexes with SCN- might vary. For example, Co(II) with four SCN- might form a pink complex, and lower ones might be blue. Alternatively, maybe the blue is for the +2 charge? Let me check my memory. \n\nWait, actually, I think that the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2) has a charge of zero, and is blue, while the tetrathiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)4^2-) is pink. So the blue one is indeed the n=2 complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the trithiocyanato? No, the question says dithiocyanato (two). \n\nHmm. So the calculation seems correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nWait, another way to think: the total concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, but in the formula for \u03b1_n, the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. The formula for \u03b1_n doesn't depend on the total cobalt concentration because it's a ratio. So the fractions are independent of the total concentration, which makes sense because they depend only on the equilibrium constants and the ligand concentration. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the answer should be D) 16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070) among all cobalt species, we use the stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN\u207b] = 0.1 M). The fraction of each species is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\beta_k [\\text{SCN}^-]^k}\n\\]\n\nFor the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the numerator is \u03b2\u2082[SCN\u207b]\u00b2 = 40 \u00d7 (0.1)\u00b2 = 0.4. The denominator is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n1 + (9 \\times 0.1) + (40 \\times 0.01) + (63 \\times 0.001) + (16 \\times 0.0001) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_2 = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.169 \\quad (16.9\\%)\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
