      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the probability that measuring an observable P on a system in a given state will yield the value 0. Let's see. The system's state at time t is represented by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row of P is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second row is (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). \n\nHmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. Wait, but maybe first I need to find the eigenvalues of the operator P. The question is asking specifically about the probability of getting 0, so I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and then find the corresponding eigenvector. Then, the probability would be the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. Let me think. Since the question is about the probability of the measurement yielding 0, perhaps I can compute the expectation value or use some properties of the operator. Wait, no, the standard approach is indeed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors first.\n\nFirst step: Find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Let's write down the matrix again to make sure I have it right.\n\nP is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo it's a symmetric matrix. That means its eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors are orthogonal. That might help.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me set up the determinant for the matrix P - \u03bbI:\n\n| -\u03bb    1/\u221a2    0    |\n\n|1/\u221a2  -\u03bb     1/\u221a2  |\n\n| 0    1/\u221a2   -\u03bb    |\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ determinant of the minor matrix for the (1,1) element ]\n\nplus terms from the other elements in the first row.\n\nWait, let me write it out properly. The determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] \n\nminus (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ]\n\nplus 0 * [ ... ]\n\nWait, actually, the cofactor expansion for the first row would be:\n\nelement (1,1): -\u03bb multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column1:\n\nWhich is the minor for the (1,1) entry:\n\n[ -\u03bb   1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant of that is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)^2 = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)\n\nThen the first term is (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nNext, the element (1,2) is 1/\u221a2. The cofactor here is (-1)^(1+2) times the minor. So the sign is negative. The minor is the determinant of the submatrix removing row1 and column2:\n\n[1/\u221a2  1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0    -\u03bb ]\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nSo the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, let's be precise. The cofactor for element (i,j) is (-1)^(i+j) times the minor. So for (1,2):\n\nsign is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nThe minor is determinant of:\n\nRow2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when removing row 1 and column 2, the minor matrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1,3? Wait, the original matrix after removing row1 and column2 would be:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1, 3?\n\nWait, let me see. The original matrix is:\n\nRow1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo if we remove column 2 (the second column), then the remaining columns are 1 and 3. So for the minor when removing row1 and column2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2] (columns 1 and 3)\n\nRow3: [0, 0] (columns 1 and 3?)\n\nWait, row3, column1 is 0, column3 is 0? Wait, row3's elements are [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], so columns 1,3 are 0 and 0. So the submatrix for minor (1,2) is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 0]\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, row3, columns 1 and 3 are 0 and 0. So the minor matrix is:\n\nFirst row (from row2) columns 1 and 3: [1/\u221a2 (column1), 1/\u221a2 (column3)]\n\nSecond row (from row3) columns 1 and 3: [0 (column1), 0 (column3)]\n\nSo the determinant of that is (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = 0.\n\nWait, so the minor's determinant is zero. Therefore, the second term in the expansion is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) * 0 = 0. \n\nThird term in the first row's expansion is the (1,3) element which is 0, so that term is 0.\n\nSo the total determinant is the first term plus the others. So determinant = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + 0 + 0.\n\nTherefore determinant is -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2).\n\nSet that equal to zero for eigenvalues:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1/2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb=0 or -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1/2 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = 1/2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a(1/2) = \u00b1(\u221a2)/2 \u2248 \u00b10.707.\n\nSo eigenvalues are 0, \u221a2/2, and -\u221a2/2.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring 0. So 0 is indeed an eigenvalue, so that's good.\n\nNow, to find the probability, we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the squared inner product of the state vector with that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the operator is Hermitian (symmetric in this case), eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are orthogonal, so the eigenspace for 0 is the set of vectors v such that Pv = 0*v = 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 satisfy the equation Pv = 0. Let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.\n\nWe need to solve P*v = 0, where v is a column vector (v1, v2, v3)^T.\n\nSo writing the equations:\n\nFirst row of P: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 = 0 \u21d2 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2 must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T, where v1 is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Let me see. Let's see if these are all the solutions.\n\nYes, so the general solution is v2=0, v3 = -v1, so vectors like (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number (or complex, but since the problem seems to be in real matrices, probably real).\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Wait, because if a is the parameter, then choosing a=1 gives (1,0,-1). So the basis vector is (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me plug into P:\n\nTake vector (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nMultiply by P:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2)=0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. So yes, it works. So that vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nAnother vector would be (2,0,-2), but that's just a scalar multiple. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Wait, but to form an orthonormal basis, but maybe we don't need that here.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let me note that as a vector v = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWe need to find the component of this vector in the direction of the eigenvector (1,0,-1). The probability is the squared magnitude of this component divided by the squared norm of the eigenvector (since the eigenvector isn't normalized).\n\nAlternatively, since we need the projection, perhaps better to normalize the eigenvector first.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the eigenvector. The eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe projection of the state vector v onto this eigenvector is the inner product of v with the normalized eigenvector, then squared.\n\nSo let's compute the inner product:\n\nv \u2022 e_0 = (-1)*(1/\u221a2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/\u221a2) = [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe square of the absolute value is ( (-\u221a2)^2 ) = 2.\n\nWait, but hold on. The state vector's norm squared is important here. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1. So the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of the original vector?\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. Wait, is the given vector normalized?\n\nLet me check the norm of the state vector v. The given state is (-1,2,1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Since in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, but perhaps in this problem, they didn't specify that. Hmm, but maybe we have to assume it's normalized, or perhaps the question expects us to proceed regardless. Wait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", so in quantum mechanics, that would usually mean it's a ket vector, which is normalized. But here, the vector (-1, 2, 1) has norm sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6), so not normalized. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is using a non-normalized state, and we just proceed as per the math?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they just want the probability as the square of the inner product divided by the norm squared of the state? Let me think.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb is the squared norm of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace, divided by the norm squared of the original state. Since the state here isn't normalized, we have to do that.\n\nSo the formula is: probability = |\u27e8e_0 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / ||v||\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's be precise.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |e_0\u27e9 = (1, 0, -1)^T, normalized to be a unit vector: |e_0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T.\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto |e_0\u27e9 is \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 |e_0\u27e9.\n\nThe probability is |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula is: if the system is in the state |\u03c8\u27e9 (not necessarily normalized), then the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb is (\u27e8\u03c8 | P_\u03bb | \u03c8\u27e9 ) / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9, where P_\u03bb is the projection onto the eigenspace for \u03bb. Alternatively, since P_\u03bb is the projection operator, then the probability is the expectation value of P_\u03bb divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the observable is given by the operator P, which is a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are 0, \u221a2/2, and -\u221a2/2, then the probability of getting 0 is the squared norm of the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in the eigenspace of 0, divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is spanned by (1,0,-1). So to find the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in that direction:\n\nThe projection is [ (\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 / ||e_0||\u00b2 ) ] * e_0, but since e_0 is normalized, it's just \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 * e_0.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the inner product between the non-normalized eigenvector and the state, then divide by the norm of the eigenvector squared?\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), the component of \u03c8 in that direction (without normalizing) would be (\u03c8 \u2022 e_0) / ||e_0||\u00b2 * e_0.\n\nThe squared norm of the component is [(\u03c8 \u2022 e_0)^2] / ||e_0||\u00b2. \n\nThen, the probability is that divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2? Hmm, maybe I need to step back.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the state with the normalized eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the state is not normalized. The probability to be in the eigenstate e_0 is |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the total probability must be 1, so you have to normalize the state first. So the formula is:\n\nProbability = |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBecause the state is not normalized, so you have to normalize it by dividing by its norm squared.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9. Since e_0 is normalized, it's (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute square of this is (-\u221a2)^2 = 2.\n\nThe norm squared of the state vector is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2 /6 = 1/3.\n\nSo that's 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Because the eigenspace could have higher dimension, but in our case, the solution was v2=0 and v3=-v1, so the eigenvectors are one-dimensional. So the entire eigenspace is just that direction. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me confirm again.\n\nThe equations for eigenvalue 0 are:\n\nFrom the first equation: (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u21d2 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (v1 + v3)/\u221a2=0 \u21d2 v1 +v3=0 \u21d2 v3= -v1.\n\nThird equation same as first. So the eigenvectors are indeed of the form (a, 0, -a). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So the projection is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach: the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0. The projection operator P_0 is the outer product of the normalized eigenvector with itself. So P_0 = |e_0\u27e9\u27e8e_0|. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c8| P_0 |\u03c8\u27e9 is |\u27e8e_0|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, and then divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2 gives the probability. Which is exactly what I did. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, which is option C. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2/3\n\nB) 1\n\nC) 1/3\n\nD) sqrt(2/3)\n\nYes, so C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me think if I made an error in the inner product.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state vector is (-1,2,1). The inner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1 -1)/\u221a2 = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. Squared is 2. Divided by 6 gives 1/3. That's correct.\n\nHmm. So I think the answer is C.\n",

The cofactor for element (i,j) is (-1)^(i+j) times the minor. So for (1,2):\n\nsign is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.\n\nThe minor is determinant of:\n\nRow2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when removing row 1 and column 2, the minor matrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1,3? Wait, the original matrix after removing row1 and column2 would be:\n\nRow 2 and 3, columns 1, 3?\n\nWait, let me see. The original matrix is:\n\nRow1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo if we remove column 2 (the second column), then the remaining columns are 1 and 3. So for the minor when removing row1 and column2, the submatrix is:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2] (columns 1 and 3)\n\nRow3: [0, 0] (columns 1 and 3?)\n\nWait, row3, column1 is 0, column3 is 0? Wait, row3's elements are [0, 1/\u221a2, 0], so columns 1,3 are 0 and 0. So the submatrix for minor (1,2) is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 0]\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, row3, columns 1 and 3 are 0 and 0. So the minor matrix is:\n\nFirst row (from row2) columns 1 and 3: [1/\u221a2 (column1), 1/\u221a2 (column3)]\n\nSecond row (from row3) columns 1 and 3: [0 (column1), 0 (column3)]\n\nSo the determinant of that is (1/\u221a2)(0) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = 0.\n\nWait, so the minor's determinant is zero. Therefore, the second term in the expansion is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) * 0 = 0. \n\nThird term in the first row's expansion is the (1,3) element which is 0, so that term is 0.\n\nSo the total determinant is the first term plus the others. So determinant = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + 0 + 0.\n\nTherefore determinant is -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb)(1/2).\n\nSet that equal to zero for eigenvalues:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1/2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb=0 or -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1/2 =0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 = 1/2 \u2192 \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a(1/2) = \u00b1(\u221a2)/2 \u2248 \u00b10.707.\n\nSo eigenvalues are 0, \u221a2/2, and -\u221a2/2.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring 0. So 0 is indeed an eigenvalue, so that's good.\n\nNow, to find the probability, we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the squared inner product of the state vector with that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Since the operator is Hermitian (symmetric in this case), eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are orthogonal, so the eigenspace for 0 is the set of vectors v such that Pv = 0*v = 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 satisfy the equation Pv = 0. Let's find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.\n\nWe need to solve P*v = 0, where v is a column vector (v1, v2, v3)^T.\n\nSo writing the equations:\n\nFirst row of P: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 = 0 \u21d2 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2 must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T, where v1 is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Let me see. Let's see if these are all the solutions.\n\nYes, so the general solution is v2=0, v3 = -v1, so vectors like (a, 0, -a) where a is any real number (or complex, but since the problem seems to be in real matrices, probably real).\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). Wait, because if a is the parameter, then choosing a=1 gives (1,0,-1). So the basis vector is (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me plug into P:\n\nTake vector (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nMultiply by P:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2)=0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. So yes, it works. So that vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nAnother vector would be (2,0,-2), but that's just a scalar multiple. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Wait, but to form an orthonormal basis, but maybe we don't need that here.\n\nNow, the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let me note that as a vector v = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nWe need to find the component of this vector in the direction of the eigenvector (1,0,-1). The probability is the squared magnitude of this component divided by the squared norm of the eigenvector (since the eigenvector isn't normalized).\n\nAlternatively, since we need the projection, perhaps better to normalize the eigenvector first.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the eigenvector. The eigenvector is (1,0,-1). Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe projection of the state vector v onto this eigenvector is the inner product of v with the normalized eigenvector, then squared.\n\nSo let's compute the inner product:\n\nv \u2022 e_0 = (-1)*(1/\u221a2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/\u221a2) = [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe square of the absolute value is ( (-\u221a2)^2 ) = 2.\n\nWait, but hold on. The state vector's norm squared is important here. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1. So the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of the original vector?\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. Wait, is the given vector normalized?\n\nLet me check the norm of the state vector v. The given state is (-1,2,1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Since in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, but perhaps in this problem, they didn't specify that. Hmm, but maybe we have to assume it's normalized, or perhaps the question expects us to proceed regardless. Wait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", so in quantum mechanics, that would usually mean it's a ket vector, which is normalized. But here, the vector (-1, 2, 1) has norm sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6), so not normalized. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is using a non-normalized state, and we just proceed as per the math?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they just want the probability as the square of the inner product divided by the norm squared of the state? Let me think.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb is the squared norm of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace, divided by the norm squared of the original state. Since the state here isn't normalized, we have to do that.\n\nSo the formula is: probability = |\u27e8e_0 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / ||v||\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's be precise.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |e_0\u27e9 = (1, 0, -1)^T, normalized to be a unit vector: |e_0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T.\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto |e_0\u27e9 is \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 |e_0\u27e9.\n\nThe probability is |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula is: if the system is in the state |\u03c8\u27e9 (not necessarily normalized), then the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb is (\u27e8\u03c8 | P_\u03bb | \u03c8\u27e9 ) / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9, where P_\u03bb is the projection onto the eigenspace for \u03bb. Alternatively, since P_\u03bb is the projection operator, then the probability is the expectation value of P_\u03bb divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the observable is given by the operator P, which is a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are 0, \u221a2/2, and -\u221a2/2, then the probability of getting 0 is the squared norm of the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in the eigenspace of 0, divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is spanned by (1,0,-1). So to find the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in that direction:\n\nThe projection is [ (\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 / ||e_0||\u00b2 ) ] * e_0, but since e_0 is normalized, it's just \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 * e_0.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the inner product between the non-normalized eigenvector and the state, then divide by the norm of the eigenvector squared?\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), the component of \u03c8 in that direction (without normalizing) would be (\u03c8 \u2022 e_0) / ||e_0||\u00b2 * e_0.\n\nThe squared norm of the component is [(\u03c8 \u2022 e_0)^2] / ||e_0||\u00b2. \n\nThen, the probability is that divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2? Hmm, maybe I need to step back.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the state with the normalized eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the state is not normalized. The probability to be in the eigenstate e_0 is |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the total probability must be 1, so you have to normalize the state first. So the formula is:\n\nProbability = |\u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nBecause the state is not normalized, so you have to normalize it by dividing by its norm squared.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u27e8e_0 | \u03c8\u27e9. Since e_0 is normalized, it's (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state is (-1, 2, 1).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute square of this is (-\u221a2)^2 = 2.\n\nThe norm squared of the state vector is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2 /6 = 1/3.\n\nSo that's 1/3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Because the eigenspace could have higher dimension, but in our case, the solution was v2=0 and v3=-v1, so the eigenvectors are one-dimensional. So the entire eigenspace is just that direction. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Let me confirm again.\n\nThe equations for eigenvalue 0 are:\n\nFrom the first equation: (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u21d2 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (v1 + v3)/\u221a2=0 \u21d2 v1 +v3=0 \u21d2 v3= -v1.\n\nThird equation same as first. So the eigenvectors are indeed of the form (a, 0, -a). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So the projection is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach: the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0. The projection operator P_0 is the outer product of the normalized eigenvector with itself. So P_0 = |e_0\u27e9\u27e8e_0|. The expectation value \u27e8\u03c8| P_0 |\u03c8\u27e9 is |\u27e8e_0|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, and then divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2 gives the probability. Which is exactly what I did. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, which is option C. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2/3\n\nB) 1\n\nC) 1/3\n\nD) sqrt(2/3)\n\nYes, so C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me think if I made an error in the inner product.\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state vector is (-1,2,1). The inner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = (-1 -1)/\u221a2 = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. Squared is 2. Divided by 6 gives 1/3. That's correct.\n\nHmm. So I think the answer is C.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) as 0, we first find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The matrix \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSolving \\( P \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\mathbf{v} \\), we find the eigenvectors must satisfy:\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{v_1 + v_3}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0 \\implies v_3 = -v_1 \\)\n\nThus, eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are scalar multiples of \\( (1, 0, -1)^T \\). The normalized eigenvector is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \\).\n\nThe state vector is \\( \\mathbf{v} = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\). The inner product with the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right| (-1, 2, 1) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe squared magnitude of this inner product is \\( (-\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\). The norm squared of the state vector is \\( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \\). The probability is thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system's state at time t gives 0. The system's state is given as a column matrix [-1, 2, 1]^T. The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me try to recall how to approach this.\n\nHmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue of an observable is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector. Wait, but first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the operator P. The question asks for the probability of getting 0, so I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and then find the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace.\n\nFirst step: Find the eigenvalues of the matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P properly. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let me write this matrix:\n\nP = \n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2     0        1/\u221a2  ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n\nSo it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observable matrices should be Hermitian, and real symmetric matrices are Hermitian. The eigenvalues will be real.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me set up the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nThe determinant of the matrix:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n| 0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nHmm, calculating this determinant might be a bit involved, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let's see if I can find the eigenvalues through some other method, perhaps noticing patterns in the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that this matrix is similar to some known form. Let me think of possible eigenvectors. Since the matrix is symmetric, eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\nLooking at the structure, maybe the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let's consider possible candidates.\n\nFirst, let's see if there's an eigenvector that's a multiple of (1, 0, -1). Wait, let me try some vectors. Let me suppose a vector v = (a, b, c)^T.\n\nSuppose I take the vector (1, 0, 1). Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP*(1,0,1)^T would be:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) = \u221a2\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nHmm, so the result is (0, \u221a2, 0)^T. That's not a scalar multiple of (1,0,1). Not helpful. Maybe another vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (1,1,1). Let's try that.\n\nP*(1,1,1):\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) = \u221a2\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2\n\nSo the result is (1/\u221a2, \u221a2, 1/\u221a2). Not a scalar multiple of (1,1,1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1, -2, 1) or something else? Not sure. Maybe trying eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, which are all zero, so trace is 0. That tells me that the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, then \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 =0.\n\nHmm, that might help. Also, maybe the matrix has some symmetry so that eigenvalues can be found by considering the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0, sqrt(2), and -sqrt(2). Let me check that.\n\nSuppose \u03bb = sqrt(2). Let's see if that works.\n\nWe set up (P - sqrt(2) I) and see if determinant is zero.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too involved. Let me try another approach. Since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by assuming some form.\n\nLooking at the first and third rows: the first and third rows are similar except for the middle element. Maybe the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let me think of vectors where the first and third components are equal or negatives.\n\nSuppose we take a vector v where the first and third components are equal, say (a, b, a). Let's see what P does to this vector.\n\nP*v = [0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*a, (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*b + (1/\u221a2)*a, 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*a]^T\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*b\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(a + a) = (2a)/\u221a2 = \u221a2 a\n\nThird component: (1/\u221a2)*b\n\nSo the result is ( (b/\u221a2), \u221a2 a, (b/\u221a2) )^T.\n\nIf this is an eigenvector, then the result must be a scalar multiple of (a, b, a)^T. Let's set up equations:\n\nFirst component: (b/\u221a2) = \u03bb a\n\nThird component: same as first, so that's okay.\n\nSecond component: \u221a2 a = \u03bb b\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. b/\u221a2 = \u03bb a\n\n2. \u221a2 a = \u03bb b\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, b = \u03bb a * \u221a2.\n\nPlugging into equation 2:\n\n\u221a2 a = \u03bb (\u03bb a * \u221a2 )\n\n=> \u221a2 a = \u03bb\u00b2 a \u221a2\n\nAssuming a \u22600, divide both sides by \u221a2 a:\n\n1 = \u03bb\u00b2 => \u03bb\u00b2 =1 => \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nHmm, so for this case, possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1?\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \u03bb =1. Then from equation 1: b = \u221a2 a. Let\u2019s pick a =1, then b=\u221a2. So the vector would be (1, \u221a2, 1). Let me check if this is an eigenvector with \u03bb=1.\n\nCompute P*(1, \u221a2, 1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = 1. So first component is 1, which is 1*1, so that's good.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1+1) = (2/\u221a2)=\u221a2. Which is 1*(\u221a2) (since \u03bb=1, so \u221a2 is the second component). Wait, but \u221a2 is indeed equal to 1*(\u221a2). So that works.\n\nThird component same as first: 1. So yes, the result is (1, \u221a2, 1), which is exactly the original vector. So yes, that's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if \u03bb = -1:\n\nFrom equation1, b = -\u221a2 a. Let\u2019s choose a=1, then b= -\u221a2. The vector is (1, -\u221a2, 1).\n\nCheck P*(1, -\u221a2,1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*(-\u221a2) = -1. So first component is -1, which should be -1*(1). That's okay.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1 +1) = \u221a2. But the eigenvalue is -1, so the second component should be -1*(-\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nWait, the second component is (1/\u221a2)*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 (since the middle element is 0 and the third component is 1). Wait, the second component of P*v would be (1/\u221a2)*1 (from first element) + 0*(-\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*1 (from third element). So yes, (2/\u221a2) = \u221a2. But the eigenvalue equation would require that this component equals -1 * (-\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, the eigenvalue is -1. So the entire vector after P should be (-1)*v. Let me see:\n\nThe resulting vector after P is (-1, \u221a2, -1). Wait, original v is (1, -\u221a2, 1). So P*v is (-1, \u221a2, -1). Which is indeed -1*(1, -\u221a2, 1) = (-1, \u221a2, -1). So yes, that works. So that vector is an eigenvector with \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo those two vectors are eigenvectors with eigenvalues +1 and -1. \n\nNow, since the trace of the matrix is zero, the third eigenvalue must be zero, because the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. The trace was 0, so 1 + (-1) + \u03bb3 =0 \u21d2 \u03bb3=0. So the third eigenvalue is zero.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0. The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's find the kernel of P, since P*v =0*v=0.\n\nSo solve P*v =0. Let me set up the equations.\n\nLet v = (x, y, z)^T. Then,\n\nFirst equation: 0*x + (1/\u221a2)y +0*z =0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2)y =0 \u21d2 y=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)x +0*y + (1/\u221a2)z =0 \u21d2 (x + z)/\u221a2 =0 \u21d2 x + z =0.\n\nThird equation: 0*x + (1/\u221a2)y +0*z =0 \u21d2 same as first, so y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy y=0 and x = -z. So the eigenvectors are all vectors of the form (a, 0, -a)^T where a is any real number. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since it's a line in R^3). Wait, but let me check the dimension. Since the equations give two conditions (y=0 and x + z=0), so two equations, so the solution space is 3-2=1 dimension. So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For example, if I take a =1, then (1,0,-1). Let me check P*(1,0,-1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*0 =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 =0.\n\nThird component: (1/\u221a2)*0 =0. So yes, that works. So that's an eigenvector for 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for 0 is spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nSo to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to project the state vector onto this eigenspace and then find the squared norm of that projection.\n\nThe state vector is given as a column matrix: \n\n| -1 |\n|  2 |\n|  1 |\n\nWait, the problem says \"the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\", so yes, that's the vector v = (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nWait, but first, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector. Wait, but the problem didn't mention normalization. Wait, is the given vector normalized? Let me check.\n\nThe norm squared of the vector is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Since the question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", I think it's implied that this is a normalized vector, but perhaps not. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, so maybe they expect us to assume that the given vector is normalized? But according to the calculation, the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the question is in the context of quantum mechanics where vectors are normalized? Or maybe it's a different context?\n\nWait, maybe the question is using bra-ket notation where the vector is not necessarily normalized, but the probability is calculated as the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of the original vector? Or perhaps the given vector is already normalized. Wait, let me check again. The question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So in standard quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is not normalized, so we have to normalize it first?\n\nHmm, this is an important point. The problem might be assuming that the vector is normalized, but in reality, it's not. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in the context of linear algebra, not necessarily quantum mechanics, but the term \"observable\" and \"probability\" suggests quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the problem expects us to first normalize the vector, then compute the projection?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different context where normalization isn't required. Hmm. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says \"Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.\" So in standard QM, that's the squared modulus of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, but only if the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Wait, but the eigenspace here is one-dimensional (since the eigenvalue 0 has only one eigenvector direction). So the probability is the squared absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state vector (if it's not normalized). Wait, but perhaps the question is treating the vector as already normalized?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed assuming that the given vector is not normalized, so first normalize it, then compute the probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that even without normalization, the answer comes out to one of the options. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me first proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the projection of the given vector onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0, which is spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is v = [1; 0; -1]. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto this eigenspace is the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in the direction of v.\n\nThe projection formula is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / ||v||\u00b2) * v.\n\nBut the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9. Wait, let me recall the formula.\n\nThe probability P is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2, since the state vector might not be normalized. Alternatively, if the state vector is already normalized, then it's just |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. Hmm.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector (assuming the eigenvector is normalized). So first, we need to normalize the eigenvector v.\n\nThe eigenvector v is [1;0;-1], its norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2, so its norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2)[1;0;-1].\n\nThen, the inner product between the state vector and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)( (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ) = (1/\u221a2)( -1 -1 ) = (1/\u221a2)(-2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe squared modulus is (|-\u221a2|)^2 = ( \u221a2 )\u00b2 = 2.\n\nBut then, the probability would be this divided by the norm squared of the state vector. Since the state vector's norm squared is 6, then the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nWait, but that gives 1/3, which is option C. Hmm. Alternatively, if the state vector is already normalized, but in that case, the norm squared is 6, which would mean that the given vector wasn't normalized. So the calculation above must be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,-1). Let me compute the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector (without normalizing the eigenvector first).\n\nThe inner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. \n\nThe norm of the eigenvector v is sqrt(1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). \n\nThe norm of the state vector is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2\u00b2 +1\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6).\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto the eigenvector v is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / ||v||\u00b2) v. But the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, no, actually in quantum mechanics, the probability to get eigenvalue 0 is the sum over all eigenvectors in the eigenspace of |\u27e8e_i | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, where e_i are orthonormal basis vectors for the eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, we can compute the probability as |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is the normalized eigenvector. So:\n\nLet me compute the normalized eigenvector e = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThen the inner product \u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9 is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1 +0 -1) = (1/sqrt(2))*(-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). The squared modulus is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2. \n\nBut then the probability is 2 divided by the norm squared of the state vector, which is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3. So that gives option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the state vector is already normalized, then that would be a mistake, but perhaps the question is designed that way. Wait, but the given vector is not normalized. So I think the correct calculation must be as above, leading to 1/3, so option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me check the steps once more.\n\nThe probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared overlap between the state and the eigenspace for 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's the squared norm of the projection of the state onto that eigenvector. \n\nThe projection of vector \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v (non-normalized) is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / \u27e8v | v\u27e9 ) v.\n\nThe squared norm of this projection is (|\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / |\u27e8v | v\u27e9| ) \n\nThen, to get the probability, we divide by the squared norm of \u03c8 (if \u03c8 isn't normalized). Wait, no: the probability is (|\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8v | v\u27e9 ) divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is: the probability is |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is the normalized eigenvector. Since the eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), then:\n\n\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u2022 [-1, 2, 1]^T \n\n= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 \n\n= (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) \n\n= -2/sqrt(2) \n\nThe magnitude squared is ( (-2/sqrt(2))^2 ) = (4)/(2) = 2.\n\nThen, since the state vector must be normalized, but the given vector has norm sqrt(6), so the actual probability is 2 divided by 6, which is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me see if the problem states that the system is in the given state, so maybe the vector is already normalized. If so, then that would be a mistake in the problem's setup. But since the norm squared is 6, which is not 1, so that can't be. Therefore, the correct approach is to take the inner product with the normalized eigenvector, square it, and then divide by the norm squared of the state vector. Wait, actually, the standard formula in QM is that the probability is |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is normalized and \u03c8 is normalized. So if \u03c8 is not normalized, then first normalize it, compute the inner product, then square it.\n\nSo let me do that:\n\nFirst, normalize the state vector. The norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThen, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].\n\nThe inner product between them is (1/sqrt(6))( -1 ) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(6))(2)*0 + (1/sqrt(6))(1)*( -1/sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ (-1/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6)\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe first term: (-1)*(1) comes from the first components: (-1) *1 (from state) times (1/sqrt(2)) (from eigenvector), but with the normalization factors.\n\nWait, maybe better to write:\n\n\u27e8e | \u03c8_normalized\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2))[-1, 0, -1/sqrt(2)]? Wait no.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nThe normalized eigenvector e is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe normalized state vector \u03c8 is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) - 1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ]\n\n= [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ]\n\nsqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so:\n\n-2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3). \n\nThe squared modulus is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. So that's the probability. So that gives the same result, 1/3. So that's option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. I think that's correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system's state at time t gives 0. The system's state is given as a column matrix [-1, 2, 1]^T. The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me try to recall how to approach this.\n\nHmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue of an observable is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector. Wait, but first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the operator P. The question asks for the probability of getting 0, so I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P, and then find the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace.\n\nFirst step: Find the eigenvalues of the matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P properly. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let me write this matrix:\n\nP = \n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2     0        1/\u221a2  ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n\nSo it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observable matrices should be Hermitian, and real symmetric matrices are Hermitian. The eigenvalues will be real.\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me set up the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nThe determinant of the matrix:\n\n| -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     |\n|1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    |\n| 0      1/\u221a2     -\u03bb     |\n\nHmm, calculating this determinant might be a bit involved, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let's see if I can find the eigenvalues through some other method, perhaps noticing patterns in the matrix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that this matrix is similar to some known form. Let me think of possible eigenvectors. Since the matrix is symmetric, eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\nLooking at the structure, maybe the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let's consider possible candidates.\n\nFirst, let's see if there's an eigenvector that's a multiple of (1, 0, -1). Wait, let me try some vectors. Let me suppose a vector v = (a, b, c)^T.\n\nSuppose I take the vector (1, 0, 1). Let's see what P does to it.\n\nP*(1,0,1)^T would be:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) = \u221a2\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nHmm, so the result is (0, \u221a2, 0)^T. That's not a scalar multiple of (1,0,1). Not helpful. Maybe another vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (1,1,1). Let's try that.\n\nP*(1,1,1):\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 = (1/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) = \u221a2\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*1 = 1/\u221a2\n\nSo the result is (1/\u221a2, \u221a2, 1/\u221a2). Not a scalar multiple of (1,1,1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (1, -2, 1) or something else? Not sure. Maybe trying eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, which are all zero, so trace is 0. That tells me that the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if the eigenvalues are \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, then \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 =0.\n\nHmm, that might help. Also, maybe the matrix has some symmetry so that eigenvalues can be found by considering the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0, sqrt(2), and -sqrt(2). Let me check that.\n\nSuppose \u03bb = sqrt(2). Let's see if that works.\n\nWe set up (P - sqrt(2) I) and see if determinant is zero.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too involved. Let me try another approach. Since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps I can find eigenvectors by assuming some form.\n\nLooking at the first and third rows: the first and third rows are similar except for the middle element. Maybe the eigenvectors have some symmetry. Let me think of vectors where the first and third components are equal or negatives.\n\nSuppose we take a vector v where the first and third components are equal, say (a, b, a). Let's see what P does to this vector.\n\nP*v = [0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*a, (1/\u221a2)*a + 0*b + (1/\u221a2)*a, 0*a + (1/\u221a2)*b + 0*a]^T\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*b\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(a + a) = (2a)/\u221a2 = \u221a2 a\n\nThird component: (1/\u221a2)*b\n\nSo the result is ( (b/\u221a2), \u221a2 a, (b/\u221a2) )^T.\n\nIf this is an eigenvector, then the result must be a scalar multiple of (a, b, a)^T. Let's set up equations:\n\nFirst component: (b/\u221a2) = \u03bb a\n\nThird component: same as first, so that's okay.\n\nSecond component: \u221a2 a = \u03bb b\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. b/\u221a2 = \u03bb a\n\n2. \u221a2 a = \u03bb b\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, b = \u03bb a * \u221a2.\n\nPlugging into equation 2:\n\n\u221a2 a = \u03bb (\u03bb a * \u221a2 )\n\n=> \u221a2 a = \u03bb\u00b2 a \u221a2\n\nAssuming a \u22600, divide both sides by \u221a2 a:\n\n1 = \u03bb\u00b2 => \u03bb\u00b2 =1 => \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nHmm, so for this case, possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1?\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \u03bb =1. Then from equation 1: b = \u221a2 a. Let\u2019s pick a =1, then b=\u221a2. So the vector would be (1, \u221a2, 1). Let me check if this is an eigenvector with \u03bb=1.\n\nCompute P*(1, \u221a2, 1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*\u221a2 = 1. So first component is 1, which is 1*1, so that's good.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1+1) = (2/\u221a2)=\u221a2. Which is 1*(\u221a2) (since \u03bb=1, so \u221a2 is the second component). Wait, but \u221a2 is indeed equal to 1*(\u221a2). So that works.\n\nThird component same as first: 1. So yes, the result is (1, \u221a2, 1), which is exactly the original vector. So yes, that's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nSimilarly, if \u03bb = -1:\n\nFrom equation1, b = -\u221a2 a. Let\u2019s choose a=1, then b= -\u221a2. The vector is (1, -\u221a2, 1).\n\nCheck P*(1, -\u221a2,1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*(-\u221a2) = -1. So first component is -1, which should be -1*(1). That's okay.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)(1 +1) = \u221a2. But the eigenvalue is -1, so the second component should be -1*(-\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nWait, the second component is (1/\u221a2)*1 + (1/\u221a2)*1 (since the middle element is 0 and the third component is 1). Wait, the second component of P*v would be (1/\u221a2)*1 (from first element) + 0*(-\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*1 (from third element). So yes, (2/\u221a2) = \u221a2. But the eigenvalue equation would require that this component equals -1 * (-\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, the eigenvalue is -1. So the entire vector after P should be (-1)*v. Let me see:\n\nThe resulting vector after P is (-1, \u221a2, -1). Wait, original v is (1, -\u221a2, 1). So P*v is (-1, \u221a2, -1). Which is indeed -1*(1, -\u221a2, 1) = (-1, \u221a2, -1). So yes, that works. So that vector is an eigenvector with \u03bb=-1.\n\nSo those two vectors are eigenvectors with eigenvalues +1 and -1. \n\nNow, since the trace of the matrix is zero, the third eigenvalue must be zero, because the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. The trace was 0, so 1 + (-1) + \u03bb3 =0 \u21d2 \u03bb3=0. So the third eigenvalue is zero.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0. So the possible measurement outcomes are 1, -1, and 0. The question is about the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's find the kernel of P, since P*v =0*v=0.\n\nSo solve P*v =0. Let me set up the equations.\n\nLet v = (x, y, z)^T. Then,\n\nFirst equation: 0*x + (1/\u221a2)y +0*z =0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2)y =0 \u21d2 y=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)x +0*y + (1/\u221a2)z =0 \u21d2 (x + z)/\u221a2 =0 \u21d2 x + z =0.\n\nThird equation: 0*x + (1/\u221a2)y +0*z =0 \u21d2 same as first, so y=0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy y=0 and x = -z. So the eigenvectors are all vectors of the form (a, 0, -a)^T where a is any real number. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional (since it's a line in R^3). Wait, but let me check the dimension. Since the equations give two conditions (y=0 and x + z=0), so two equations, so the solution space is 3-2=1 dimension. So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1)^T.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For example, if I take a =1, then (1,0,-1). Let me check P*(1,0,-1):\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)*0 =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/\u221a2 =0.\n\nThird component: (1/\u221a2)*0 =0. So yes, that works. So that's an eigenvector for 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for 0 is spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nSo to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to project the state vector onto this eigenspace and then find the squared norm of that projection.\n\nThe state vector is given as a column matrix: \n\n| -1 |\n|  2 |\n|  1 |\n\nWait, the problem says \"the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\", so yes, that's the vector v = (-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nWait, but first, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector. Wait, but the problem didn't mention normalization. Wait, is the given vector normalized? Let me check.\n\nThe norm squared of the vector is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Since the question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", I think it's implied that this is a normalized vector, but perhaps not. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, so maybe they expect us to assume that the given vector is normalized? But according to the calculation, the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the question is in the context of quantum mechanics where vectors are normalized? Or maybe it's a different context?\n\nWait, maybe the question is using bra-ket notation where the vector is not necessarily normalized, but the probability is calculated as the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of the original vector? Or perhaps the given vector is already normalized. Wait, let me check again. The question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So in standard quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. Therefore, perhaps the given vector is not normalized, so we have to normalize it first?\n\nHmm, this is an important point. The problem might be assuming that the vector is normalized, but in reality, it's not. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in the context of linear algebra, not necessarily quantum mechanics, but the term \"observable\" and \"probability\" suggests quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the problem expects us to first normalize the vector, then compute the projection?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different context where normalization isn't required. Hmm. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says \"Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.\" So in standard QM, that's the squared modulus of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, but only if the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Wait, but the eigenspace here is one-dimensional (since the eigenvalue 0 has only one eigenvector direction). So the probability is the squared absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the state vector (if it's not normalized). Wait, but perhaps the question is treating the vector as already normalized?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed assuming that the given vector is not normalized, so first normalize it, then compute the probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that even without normalization, the answer comes out to one of the options. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me first proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the projection of the given vector onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue 0, which is spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is v = [1; 0; -1]. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto this eigenspace is the component of |\u03c8\u27e9 in the direction of v.\n\nThe projection formula is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / ||v||\u00b2) * v.\n\nBut the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9. Wait, let me recall the formula.\n\nThe probability P is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2, since the state vector might not be normalized. Alternatively, if the state vector is already normalized, then it's just |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. Hmm.\n\nWait, in quantum mechanics, the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector (assuming the eigenvector is normalized). So first, we need to normalize the eigenvector v.\n\nThe eigenvector v is [1;0;-1], its norm squared is 1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2, so its norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2)[1;0;-1].\n\nThen, the inner product between the state vector and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)( (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ) = (1/\u221a2)( -1 -1 ) = (1/\u221a2)(-2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe squared modulus is (|-\u221a2|)^2 = ( \u221a2 )\u00b2 = 2.\n\nBut then, the probability would be this divided by the norm squared of the state vector. Since the state vector's norm squared is 6, then the probability is 2/6 = 1/3. \n\nWait, but that gives 1/3, which is option C. Hmm. Alternatively, if the state vector is already normalized, but in that case, the norm squared is 6, which would mean that the given vector wasn't normalized. So the calculation above must be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1,0,-1). Let me compute the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector (without normalizing the eigenvector first).\n\nThe inner product is (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 0 -1 = -2. \n\nThe norm of the eigenvector v is sqrt(1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). \n\nThe norm of the state vector is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2\u00b2 +1\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6).\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto the eigenvector v is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / ||v||\u00b2) v. But the probability is the squared norm of the projection divided by the squared norm of |\u03c8\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, no, actually in quantum mechanics, the probability to get eigenvalue 0 is the sum over all eigenvectors in the eigenspace of |\u27e8e_i | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, where e_i are orthonormal basis vectors for the eigenspace.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, we can compute the probability as |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is the normalized eigenvector. So:\n\nLet me compute the normalized eigenvector e = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).\n\nThen the inner product \u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9 is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1 +0 -1) = (1/sqrt(2))*(-2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). The squared modulus is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2. \n\nBut then the probability is 2 divided by the norm squared of the state vector, which is 6, so 2/6 = 1/3. So that gives option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the state vector is already normalized, then that would be a mistake, but perhaps the question is designed that way. Wait, but the given vector is not normalized. So I think the correct calculation must be as above, leading to 1/3, so option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me check the steps once more.\n\nThe probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the squared overlap between the state and the eigenspace for 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's the squared norm of the projection of the state onto that eigenvector. \n\nThe projection of vector \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v (non-normalized) is (\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9 / \u27e8v | v\u27e9 ) v.\n\nThe squared norm of this projection is (|\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / |\u27e8v | v\u27e9| ) \n\nThen, to get the probability, we divide by the squared norm of \u03c8 (if \u03c8 isn't normalized). Wait, no: the probability is (|\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8v | v\u27e9 ) divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is: the probability is |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is the normalized eigenvector. Since the eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), then:\n\n\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] \u2022 [-1, 2, 1]^T \n\n= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 \n\n= (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) \n\n= -2/sqrt(2) \n\nThe magnitude squared is ( (-2/sqrt(2))^2 ) = (4)/(2) = 2.\n\nThen, since the state vector must be normalized, but the given vector has norm sqrt(6), so the actual probability is 2 divided by 6, which is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me see if the problem states that the system is in the given state, so maybe the vector is already normalized. If so, then that would be a mistake in the problem's setup. But since the norm squared is 6, which is not 1, so that can't be. Therefore, the correct approach is to take the inner product with the normalized eigenvector, square it, and then divide by the norm squared of the state vector. Wait, actually, the standard formula in QM is that the probability is |\u27e8e | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where e is normalized and \u03c8 is normalized. So if \u03c8 is not normalized, then first normalize it, compute the inner product, then square it.\n\nSo let me do that:\n\nFirst, normalize the state vector. The norm squared is 6, so the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].\n\nThen, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1;0;-1].\n\nThe inner product between them is (1/sqrt(6))( -1 ) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(6))(2)*0 + (1/sqrt(6))(1)*( -1/sqrt(2) )\n\n= [ (-1/sqrt(2) ) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) ] / sqrt(6)\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe first term: (-1)*(1) comes from the first components: (-1) *1 (from state) times (1/sqrt(2)) (from eigenvector), but with the normalization factors.\n\nWait, maybe better to write:\n\n\u27e8e | \u03c8_normalized\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(2))[-1, 0, -1/sqrt(2)]? Wait no.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nThe normalized eigenvector e is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nThe normalized state vector \u03c8 is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6))\n\n= [ -1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) - 1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ]\n\n= [ -2/(sqrt(12)) ]\n\nsqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so:\n\n-2/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3). \n\nThe squared modulus is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. So that's the probability. So that gives the same result, 1/3. So that's option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. I think that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) as 0 for the given state vector \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we first identify the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of \\( P \\). The matrix \\( P \\) is symmetric, so its eigenvalues are real. By analyzing the structure of \\( P \\), we find the eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0. The eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nNext, we compute the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector. The norm of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is \\( \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6} \\). The normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nThe inner product between the normalized state vector and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\bigg| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{6}} \\left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\nThe squared magnitude of this inner product is \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nThus, the probability of measuring 0 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
