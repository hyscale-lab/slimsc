      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, right. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So we don't have to worry about acceleration or non-inertial effects. The key here might be relating the time experienced by the ejecta to the time in the Galaxy's frame because of time dilation from special relativity. Oh wait, right, because if the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the Galaxy, then time would dilate, so the time experienced by the ejecta (proper time?) would be different from the Galaxy's time.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that speed is v = 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for easier handling with the speed of light. 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So that's 20% the speed of light. \n\nSo the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, right? Wait, actually, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 0.2c. Since the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, their relative velocity should be the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c as well. \n\nThe question is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nWait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes would be different because of time dilation. Let me recall the time dilation formula. The proper time (\u03c4) is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta here), and the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) would be t = \u03c4 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The proper time is the time between two events that happen at the same location in the moving frame. In this case, the two events might be, for example, the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Since those events occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, the proper time is indeed 50 seconds. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. \n\nSo first, calculate gamma (\u03b3), which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute that. Since v is 0.2c, then v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25)*sqrt(4) Hmm, wait, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) which is sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. Wait, actually sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy frame would be t = \u03b3 * \u03c4 = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but then the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is just v multiplied by that time. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's frame. Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But in the Galaxy's frame, that same period of the ejecta's time corresponds to a longer time. So the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy frame would be v multiplied by the Galaxy's time (t), which is longer than 50 seconds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it using the Lorentz transformation. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the ejecta's frame as S' and the Galaxy's frame as S. \n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at v = 6e4 km/s (0.2c). The time interval \u0394t' in S' is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in S frame, which would be the position difference of the ejecta in S over the time interval in S frame. \n\nBut in S frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the Galaxy center. Wait, actually, the velocity in S (Galaxy) is v = 0.2c towards the center. \n\nThe distance traveled in S frame would be v multiplied by the time in S frame. \n\nSo first, find the time in S frame (\u0394t) corresponding to \u0394t' =50 s. Using time dilation: \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t' (since the events are at the same place in S'). \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), which as before is approx 1.0206. \n\nThus \u0394t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance is v * \u0394t. \n\nv is 0.2c. Let's compute that. \n\nc is 3e5 km/s (since 3e8 m/s is 3e5 km/s). \n\nSo 0.2c is 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s, which matches the given value. \n\nSo distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 51.03. \n\nCalculating that: 6 *51.03 is 306.18, so 306.18e4 km, which is 3,061,800 km. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, the closest is option D) 3,060,000 km. \n\nWait but let me check my calculations again for precision. \n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nv = 0.2c, so v/c = 0.2. \n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25 * 4) ? Wait, no. Let me just compute sqrt(0.96). \n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.97979589759. \n\nSo 1 / 0.97979589759 \u2248 1.02062072615. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nThus \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 50 *1.02062 = 51.031036 seconds. \n\nThen the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.031036 s. \n\n60,000 * 51.031036 = let's compute 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000, plus 60,000 *1.031036. \n\n60,000 *1.031036 = 61,862.16. \n\nTotal is 3,000,000 + 61,862.16 \u2248 3,061,862.16 km. \n\nThe options given are: \n\nA) 2,940,000 \n\nB) 3,000,000 \n\nC) 2,880,000 \n\nD) 3,060,000 \n\nSo the closest is D. The exact value is around 3,061,862, which would round to 3,060,000 if they're using approximate values, or maybe they used a slightly different gamma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Since in the ejecta's frame, the distance the ejecta moves is zero (since it's at rest), but the Galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. Wait, but that's not the question. The question is in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick and the distance is just v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, but that would ignore time dilation. Wait no, because in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but the distance in the Galaxy's frame would require using the longer time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use length contraction? Wait, no. The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by the time in that frame. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of it from the Galaxy's perspective: the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds is gamma * 50. \n\nSo that's exactly what I did. \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but let me check if the velocity is correct. The problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it [the ejecta]\" in the ejecta's frame. \n\nWait, that is correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at that speed. So the relative speed between the two frames is indeed 6e4 km/s. Since both are inertial, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the speed of the Galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame. So yes, that's 0.2c. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, so D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider the distance as seen in the ejecta's frame. But no, the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time in the ejecta's frame and the distance in their own frame, but that would be different. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, they are stationary, so the distance the center moves would be v * t', but the question is about the ejecta moving in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nTherefore, I think D is correct. Let me check the options again. The options are A to D, with D being 3,060,000. The calculation gives approximately 3,061,862, which is very close. So the answer must be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy.

So that speed is v = 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for easier handling with the speed of light. 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 6e7 / 3e8 = 0.2. So that's 20% the speed of light. \n\nSo the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, right? Wait, actually, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 0.2c. Since the ejecta and Galaxy are inertial frames, their relative velocity should be the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c as well. \n\nThe question is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nWait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes would be different because of time dilation. Let me recall the time dilation formula. The proper time (\u03c4) is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta here), and the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) would be t = \u03c4 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The proper time is the time between two events that happen at the same location in the moving frame. In this case, the two events might be, for example, the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Since those events occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, the proper time is indeed 50 seconds. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. \n\nSo first, calculate gamma (\u03b3), which is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute that. Since v is 0.2c, then v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25)*sqrt(4) Hmm, wait, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) which is sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. Wait, actually sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy frame would be t = \u03b3 * \u03c4 = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but then the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is just v multiplied by that time. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's frame. Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But in the Galaxy's frame, that same period of the ejecta's time corresponds to a longer time. So the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy frame would be v multiplied by the Galaxy's time (t), which is longer than 50 seconds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it using the Lorentz transformation. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the ejecta's frame as S' and the Galaxy's frame as S. \n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at v = 6e4 km/s (0.2c). The time interval \u0394t' in S' is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in S frame, which would be the position difference of the ejecta in S over the time interval in S frame. \n\nBut in S frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the Galaxy center. Wait, actually, the velocity in S (Galaxy) is v = 0.2c towards the center. \n\nThe distance traveled in S frame would be v multiplied by the time in S frame. \n\nSo first, find the time in S frame (\u0394t) corresponding to \u0394t' =50 s. Using time dilation: \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t' (since the events are at the same place in S'). \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), which as before is approx 1.0206. \n\nThus \u0394t \u2248 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance is v * \u0394t. \n\nv is 0.2c. Let's compute that. \n\nc is 3e5 km/s (since 3e8 m/s is 3e5 km/s). \n\nSo 0.2c is 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4 km/s, which matches the given value. \n\nSo distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 51.03. \n\nCalculating that: 6 *51.03 is 306.18, so 306.18e4 km, which is 3,061,800 km. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, the closest is option D) 3,060,000 km. \n\nWait but let me check my calculations again for precision. \n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nv = 0.2c, so v/c = 0.2. \n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25 * 4) ? Wait, no. Let me just compute sqrt(0.96). \n\nsqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.97979589759. \n\nSo 1 / 0.97979589759 \u2248 1.02062072615. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nThus \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 50 *1.02062 = 51.031036 seconds. \n\nThen the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.031036 s. \n\n60,000 * 51.031036 = let's compute 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000, plus 60,000 *1.031036. \n\n60,000 *1.031036 = 61,862.16. \n\nTotal is 3,000,000 + 61,862.16 \u2248 3,061,862.16 km. \n\nThe options given are: \n\nA) 2,940,000 \n\nB) 3,000,000 \n\nC) 2,880,000 \n\nD) 3,060,000 \n\nSo the closest is D. The exact value is around 3,061,862, which would round to 3,060,000 if they're using approximate values, or maybe they used a slightly different gamma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Since in the ejecta's frame, the distance the ejecta moves is zero (since it's at rest), but the Galaxy is moving towards it at 6e4 km/s. Wait, but that's not the question.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it [the ejecta]\" in the ejecta's frame. \n\nWait, that is correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at that speed. So the relative speed between the two frames is indeed 6e4 km/s. Since both are inertial, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the speed of the Galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame. So yes, that's 0.2c. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, so D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider the distance as seen in the ejecta's frame. But no, the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time in the ejecta's frame and the distance in their own frame, but that would be different. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, they are stationary, so the distance the center moves would be v * t', but the question is about the ejecta moving in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nTherefore, I think D is correct. Let me check the options again. The options are A to D, with D being 3,060,000. The calculation gives approximately 3,061,862, which is very close. So the answer must be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to account for time dilation in special relativity. The ejecta is moving at 0.2c (60,000 km/s) relative to the Galaxy.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and reference frames. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. The given speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s towards the center. But since they're both inertial frames, I think I need to consider relativity here, specifically time dilation maybe?\n\nWait, the problem mentions that both frames are inertial. Since the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s in its own frame, but from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center as well. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means the ejecta is moving away from the center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nIf the ejecta is moving towards the center in the Galaxy's frame, then from the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching it. The speed given here is in the ejecta's frame. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Since they are inertial frames, the speed of the center in the ejecta's frame is the same as the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame but in the opposite direction, right? So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center. Wait, but maybe there's a relativistic effect here. Because the question is about time in the ejecta's frame and distance in the Galaxy's frame. So time dilation would come into play here.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during a time interval that is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Since the ejecta is moving at high speed (60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c because c is about 300,000 km/s), relativistic effects can't be ignored here. \n\nSo, the key here is to convert the time measured in the ejecta's frame (proper time?) to the time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But here, the 50 seconds is the time that passes in the ejecta's frame. So from the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t = \u03b3t0, where t0 is the proper time (in the ejecta's frame here?), but wait, which frame is the proper time in?\n\nActually, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same place. Since in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary, so the two events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same location. Therefore, 50 seconds is the proper time (t0). So in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be t = \u03b3t0. \n\nThe gamma factor (\u03b3) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute that. First, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me write that in terms of c. Since c is 3e5 km/s, v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = \u03b3 * t0 = 1.0206 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but then the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would be v * t. Since the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is v = 0.2c = 6e4 km/s. \n\nSo, distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 51.03 \u2248 let's calculate that. \n\n60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, so 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,000,000 + 60,000*(1.03) = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I mixed up which frame's velocity to use. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nThe ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is v = 60,000 km/s. The time in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t0. Then, the distance is v * t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and we can use the relation between the distances. Wait, maybe I need to think about length contraction? Wait, no, because the distance here is being measured in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center moves is v * t0 (since the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds). But the question is asking for the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, the ejecta's movement in the Galaxy's frame would be over the time t in the Galaxy's frame. So that's what I did earlier. \n\nHmm. Let me recalculate the gamma. Let's see:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s. So v/c is 0.2. \n\nGamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) * sqrt(4) no, wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798 as before. So 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.02062. So gamma is approximately 1.02062. \n\nSo t = 50 * 1.02062 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = v * t = 60000 * 51.031 \u2248 60000 * 51 = 3,060,000 plus 60000*0.031=1860, so total 3,061,860 km. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. But perhaps the question expects to use an exact value for gamma?\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate sqrt(0.96) more accurately. Let me do it more precisely. \n\n0.96 squared: Let me think of sqrt(0.96) as sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9797959. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0206207. \n\nSo 50 * 1.0206207 = 51.031035 seconds. \n\nSo 51.031035 * 60,000 = let's compute 51.031035 * 6e4. \n\n51 * 6e4 = 3,060,000. \n\n0.031035 *6e4 = 0.031035 *60,000 = 1,862.1. \n\nSo total is 3,061,862.1 km. \n\nHmm, so that's about 3,061,862 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km, but there's also option A, B, C. Wait, the options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nSo the exact answer would be approximately 3,061,862 km, which is very close to D. But perhaps the question is using a different approximation for gamma?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the frames. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, which is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the velocity as given and not consider relativistic effects? But the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, so that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. So relativistic effects should be considered. Otherwise, if we ignore relativity, then the distance would be v * t0 = 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation. Since the problem states both are inertial frames, and since the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame over a time that's in the ejecta's frame, we have to use time dilation. So the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but the options have D as 3,060,000. Let me see if my calculation is correct. Let me recompute gamma again. Let me see:\n\nv = 0.2c. \n\ngamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)) = 1/sqrt(0.96). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should rationalize sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(24/25):\n\nsqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.9798. So reciprocal is 1.02062. \n\nThus, gamma is approximately 1.02062, so t = 50 * 1.02062 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, 51.031 * 60,000 = 3,061,860 km. \n\nThe closest option is D, which is 3,060,000. The difference is about 1,860 km, which is due to rounding. Since the question might be expecting using an approximate gamma value, perhaps they used sqrt(0.96) as sqrt(24/25) and maybe simplified?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in which frame's velocity is considered. Wait, let me think again. The ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 60,000 km/s, because the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at that speed. Since in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction. Wait, no. Let me think: \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is simply v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the direction of time dilation. Wait, time dilation formula is that moving clocks run slower. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame would correspond to a longer time in the Galaxy's frame. Which is what I did. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where you don't need relativity? Like, if you just multiply 60,000 by 50, getting 3,000,000 km (option B). But that would ignore time dilation. The problem mentions that both are inertial frames, so relativistic effects must be considered. \n\nWait, but the question says \"when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\". So the time in the ejecta's frame is 50s. To find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. Since in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, but the time experienced by the Galaxy would be longer. \n\nYes, so the correct approach is to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame as gamma * t0, then multiply by velocity. \n\nSo the result is approximately 3,060,000 km. So the answer is D. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. Let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\"\n\nYes, so the ejecta's own clock shows 50 seconds, but the Galaxy frame sees a longer time, so the distance is v*(gamma * t0). \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nThe options given have D as 3,060,000, so that's the closest. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and reference frames. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. The given speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s towards the center. But since they're both inertial frames, I think I need to consider relativity here, specifically time dilation maybe?\n\nWait, the problem mentions that both frames are inertial. Since the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s in its own frame, but from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center as well. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means the ejecta is moving away from the center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nIf the ejecta is moving towards the center in the Galaxy's frame, then from the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching it. The speed given here is in the ejecta's frame. So the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Since they are inertial frames, the speed of the center in the ejecta's frame is the same as the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame but in the opposite direction, right? So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center. Wait, but maybe there's a relativistic effect here. Because the question is about time in the ejecta's frame and distance in the Galaxy's frame. So time dilation would come into play here.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during a time interval that is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Since the ejecta is moving at high speed (60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c because c is about 300,000 km/s), relativistic effects can't be ignored here. \n\nSo, the key here is to convert the time measured in the ejecta's frame (proper time?) to the time in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nWait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But here, the 50 seconds is the time that passes in the ejecta's frame. So from the Galaxy's frame, the time would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t = \u03b3t0, where t0 is the proper time (in the ejecta's frame here?), but wait, which frame is the proper time in?\n\nActually, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same place. Since in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary, so the two events (the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same location. Therefore, 50 seconds is the proper time (t0). So in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be t = \u03b3t0. \n\nThe gamma factor (\u03b3) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me compute that. First, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me write that in terms of c. Since c is 3e5 km/s, v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = \u03b3 * t0 = 1.0206 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but then the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would be v * t. Since the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is v = 0.2c = 6e4 km/s. \n\nSo, distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 51.03 \u2248 let's calculate that. \n\n60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000, so 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,000,000 + 60,000*(1.03) = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.
