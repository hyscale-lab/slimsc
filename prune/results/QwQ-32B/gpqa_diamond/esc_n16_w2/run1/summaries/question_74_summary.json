      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, the question mentions that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, that sounds like the half-life or something related to exponential decay. Let me think.\n\nFirst, radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability of decay in a certain time depends on the decay constant. The formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. \n\nThe problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). From this, I can solve for \u03bb. Let me rearrange that equation: e^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives -\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68). Therefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, maybe I can just keep it symbolic for now. The key point here is that the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed yet after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from now. Because the memoryless property means the past doesn't affect future probabilities once it's survived up to now.\n\nWait, but the given data is for 100 minutes giving 32% chance. So maybe I need to find the probability for 150 minutes, but adjusted for the fact that it's been 50 already. Wait, no, because the memoryless property says the probability from now on is the same as if it just started. So the time already elapsed (50 minutes) doesn't affect the future probability. But wait, the problem is asking for the next 150 minutes, so total time from now is 150, but how does that relate to the given 100-minute probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the decay constant first. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03bb. \n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32, so:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100)\n\nSo e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 let me calculate that. \n\nln(0.68) is approximately. Let's see, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is between those. Let me compute ln(0.68). \n\nUsing a calculator (since I can't compute this exactly in my head), but maybe approximate:\n\nLet me recall that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. Let me check that:\n\ne^-0.38566 \u2248 e^-0.385 is approximately 0.68? Let me see: e^-0.38 is about 0.684, so yes, so ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, the probability is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from now. So the time elapsed (50 minutes) doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to think of the total time? Or perhaps the question is asking for the probability from now (after 50 minutes) to 150 minutes from now, which is a total of 150 minutes. So the time from now is 150 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes would be P = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, compute \u03bb * 150: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.5785. \n\nSo e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Since 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6, let's interpolate. \n\nThe difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in exponent, leading to a difference of 0.6065 - 0.5488 \u2248 0.0577. \n\n0.5785 - 0.5 = 0.0785. So 0.0785/0.1 = 0.785 of the interval. So subtract 0.785 * 0.0577 from 0.6065? Wait, actually, since the exponent is higher, the value is lower. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute more accurately. Let's see:\n\ne^-0.5785: Let me think. Let me write 0.5785 as 0.5 + 0.0785. \n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion around 0.5, but maybe it's easier to approximate:\n\nAlternatively, note that ln(0.56) is approximately?\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula:\n\nWe know that ln(0.5488) is about -0.6, so e^-0.5785 is e^-(0.6 - 0.0215) = e^-0.6 * e^0.0215. Since e^0.0215 \u2248 1.0217. \n\nSo e^-0.6 is 0.5488, so multiply by 1.0217 gives 0.5488 * 1.0217 \u2248 0.5488 *1.02 = approx 0.56 (since 0.5488*1.02 = 0.5488 + 0.5488*0.02 \u2248 0.5488 +0.011= ~0.56). So maybe around 0.56?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use calculator-like steps. Let me think of 0.5785:\n\nAlternatively, let me think of 0.5785 is approximately 0.5785. Let me see, e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm tables... but this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using the given data. Let me think differently.\n\nWe know that the half-life T1/2 is related to \u03bb by T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. But maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%. The survival function is S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). So S(100) = 0.68. \n\nWe need the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, starting now (after 50 minutes). The survival probability after another 150 minutes is S(150) = e^(-\u03bb *150). Therefore, the probability of decaying in that time is 1 - S(150).\n\nAlternatively, since S(150) = [S(1)]^150, but that's the same as e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nAlternatively, let me note that the ratio between S(150) and S(100):\n\nS(150) = S(100) * S(50) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, S(150) = e^(-\u03bb *150) = [e^(-\u03bb*100)] * [e^(-\u03bb*50)] = S(100) * S(50). \n\nSo S(150) = S(100) * S(50). \n\nBut since S(100) is 0.68, and S(50) would be e^(-\u03bb*50). \n\nBut we can compute S(50) as sqrt(S(100))? Because S(100) is S(50)^2. \n\nWait, yes, because 50 +50 is 100. So S(100) = (S(50))^2. So S(50) = sqrt(S(100)) = sqrt(0.68). \n\nSo sqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64) = 0.8, so sqrt(0.68) is a bit higher. Let me compute sqrt(0.68):\n\n0.8246^2 = 0.8246*0.8246: 0.8*0.8=0.64, 0.8*0.0246*2=0.03936, 0.0246\u00b2\u22480.0006, total \u22480.64+0.03936+0.0006\u22480.67996. So sqrt(0.68) \u22480.8246. \n\nTherefore, S(50)= ~0.8246. \n\nSo S(150) = S(100)*S(50) = 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 *0.8246. Let's compute that:\n\n0.68 *0.8 = 0.544, 0.68 *0.0246 = ~0.0167. Total \u22480.544 +0.0167 = 0.5607. \n\nSo the survival probability after 150 minutes from now is ~0.5607. Therefore, the probability of decay is 1 -0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, so about 44%. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option A) 44%. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the memoryless property says that the probability of surviving another t time given that it has survived until now is equal to the survival probability for t. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150). \n\nBut since we have to start from now, the 50 minutes already passed don't affect it. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb is known from the 100-minute data. Let me recalculate \u03bb again to check. \n\nGiven that after 100 minutes, the survival probability is 0.68. So S(100) = e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. \n\nSo let me compute that again. \n\nln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. \n\nThus, \u03bb = 0.385662 /100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute. \n\nThen, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). \n\nLet's compute \u03bb *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493. \n\ne^-0.578493 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me see, e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u22480.5488. \n\nThe value 0.578493 is 0.5 +0.078493. \n\nLet me see, using linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nThe difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, which corresponds to a decrease in e^-x from 0.6065 to 0.5488, a difference of about -0.0577 over 0.1 x. \n\nThe value 0.578493 is 0.078493 above 0.5. So the fraction is 0.078493 /0.1 = 0.78493. \n\nSo the decrease from the e^-0.5 value is 0.78493 * (-0.0577) \u2248-0.0453. \n\nThus, e^-0.578493 \u22480.6065 -0.0453 \u22480.5612. \n\nThus, the survival probability is ~0.5612, so decay probability is 1 -0.5612 =0.4388, so about 43.88%, which rounds to 44%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the fact that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life is longer than 100 minutes. But maybe there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the decay probability over time t is linear, but that's not correct. Radioactive decay is exponential. The 32% in 100 minutes is not linear, so the answer must use exponential decay. \n\nAnother way: the problem says \"decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes\". So the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. The question is, after 50 minutes with no decay, what is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. \n\nThe memoryless property tells us that the remaining time is treated as a new start. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a freshly obtained atom decays within 150 minutes. \n\nWait, but how do we calculate that? Since we know the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, we can find the decay constant, then compute for 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way. Let me think in terms of the survival fractions. \n\nLet me denote the survival probability after time t as S(t) = e^{-\u03bbt}. \n\nWe know that 1 - S(100) = 0.32 \u2192 S(100) = 0.68. \n\nWe need to find 1 - S(150), since the decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival after 150. \n\nBut to compute S(150), we can express it in terms of S(100). Since 150 = 100 +50, but the survival over 150 minutes is S(150) = S(100)*S(50). \n\nBut we don't know S(50). But since S(100) = [S(50)]^2, because 100 is two times 50. So S(50) = sqrt(S(100)) = sqrt(0.68). \n\nSo S(50) is sqrt(0.68) \u22480.8246. \n\nTherefore, S(150) = S(100)*S(50) = 0.68 *0.8246 \u22480.5607, so 1 -0.5607 = ~0.4393 or 43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A) 44%.\n",

Because S(100) is S(50)^2. \n\nWait, yes, because 50 +50 is 100. So S(100) = (S(50))^2. So S(50) = sqrt(S(100)) = sqrt(0.68). \n\nSo sqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64) = 0.8, so sqrt(0.68) is a bit higher.

So sqrt(0.68) \u22480.8246. \n\nTherefore, S(50)= ~0.8246. \n\nSo S(150) = S(100)*S(50) = 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 *0.8246. Let's compute that:\n\n0.68 *0.8 = 0.544, 0.68 *0.0246 = ~0.0167.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the memoryless property says that the probability of surviving another t time given that it has survived until now is equal to the survival probability for t. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150). \n\nBut since we have to start from now, the 50 minutes already passed don't affect it. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb is known from the 100-minute data. Let me recalculate \u03bb again to check. \n\nGiven that after 100 minutes, the survival probability is 0.68. So S(100) = e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68 \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. \n\nSo let me compute that again. \n\nln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. \n\nThus, \u03bb = 0.385662 /100 \u2248 0.00385662 per minute. \n\nThen, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). \n\nLet's compute \u03bb *150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493. \n\ne^-0.578493 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me see, e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 \u22480.5488. \n\nThe value 0.578493 is 0.5 +0.078493. \n\nLet me see, using linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nThe difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, which corresponds to a decrease in e^-x from 0.6065 to 0.5488, a difference of about -0.0577 over 0.1 x. \n\nThe value 0.578493 is 0.078493 above 0.5. So the fraction is 0.078493 /0.1 = 0.78493. \n\nSo the decrease from the e^-0.5 value is 0.78493 * (-0.0577) \u2248-0.0453. \n\nThus, e^-0.578493 \u22480.6065 -0.0453 \u22480.5612. \n\nThus, the survival probability is ~0.5612, so decay probability is 1 -0.5612 =0.4388, so about 43.88%, which rounds to 44%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the fact that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life is longer than 100 minutes. But maybe there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the decay probability over time t is linear, but that's not correct. Radioactive decay is exponential. The 32% in 100 minutes is not linear, so the answer must use exponential decay. \n\nAnother way: the problem says \"decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes\". So the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. The question is, after 50 minutes with no decay, what is the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. \n\nThe memoryless property tells us that the remaining time is treated as a new start. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a freshly obtained atom decays within 150 minutes. \n\nWait, but how do we calculate that? Since we know the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, we can find the decay constant, then compute for 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way. Let me think in terms of the survival fractions. \n\nLet me denote the survival probability after time t as S(t) = e^{-\u03bbt}. \n\nWe know that 1 - S(100) = 0.32 \u2192 S(100) = 0.68. \n\nWe need to find 1 - S(150), since the decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival after 150. \n\nBut to compute S(150), we can express it in terms of S(100). Since 150 = 100 +50, but the survival over 150 minutes is S(150) = S(100)*S(50). \n\nBut we don't know S(50). But since S(100) = [S(50)]^2, because 100 is two times 50. So S(50) = sqrt(S(100)) = sqrt(0.68). \n\nSo S(50) is sqrt(0.68) \u22480.8246. \n\nTherefore, S(150) = S(100)*S(50) = 0.68 *0.8246 \u22480.5607, so 1 -0.5607 = ~0.4393 or 43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A) 44%.\n\n\nThe decay of a radioactive atom follows an exponential distribution, which is memoryless. This means the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, depends only on the decay constant \u03bb. \n\nGiven the 32% decay probability over 100 minutes, we calculate the survival probability \\( S(100) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68 \\). Solving for \u03bb:  \n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:  \n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the exponent:  \n\\[\n\\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.0038566 \\times 150 \\approx 0.5785.\n\\]\n\nThus,  \n\\[\ne^{-0.5785} \\approx 0.5607 \\implies P(150) \\approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 \\, (43.93\\%).\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest option, the closest is **44%**.  \n\nAnswer: A) 44%  \n\n\\boxed{A}\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about radioactive decay. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking for the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability of decay in a given time interval depends on the half-life or the decay constant. The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that's the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes? But since we're dealing with a single atom, this must be the probability over that time. \n\nThe key here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. That means the probability of decay in the next time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh right! So even though 50 minutes have already passed without decay, the remaining probability isn't just adjusted based on that time. Instead, the process resets, so to speak. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm. Let me think again. The memoryless property of exponential distributions says that the probability of an event happening in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't happened up to now, is the same as the initial probability over t minutes. But maybe the 32% over 100 minutes is given, so I need to find the decay constant first.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let the decay constant be \u03bb. The probability that the atom decays within time T is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). The problem states that when T is 100 minutes, this probability is 32%, so:\n\n1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32  \nTherefore, e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68  \nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:  \n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)  \nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100  \n\nLet me calculate ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is a bit less negative. Let me compute it numerically. Let's see, using calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So then \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes with no decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? Since the process is memoryless, the remaining time is 150 minutes, but starting from the current time (after 50 minutes). The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a freshly observed atom would decay in 150 minutes. Wait, no, actually, the memoryless property says that the probability of surviving an additional time t given that it has already survived s is the same as the probability of surviving t. So the probability of decay in the next t minutes after s is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). \n\nAlternatively, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, but since we know it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, the probability that it decays between t = 50 and t = 200 minutes is equal to the probability of surviving 50 minutes multiplied by (1 - probability of surviving another 150 minutes). But since the memoryless property says that after surviving 50, the remaining time is like starting over. \n\nLet me clarify. Let me denote the survival function S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). The probability that it has not decayed by time t. Then, the probability that it decays between t1 and t2 is S(t1) - S(t2). \n\nBut given that it has already survived up to t1 = 50, the conditional probability that it decays between t1 and t1 + 150 (i.e., 200) is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(150)/S(50). \n\nAlternatively, since S(200) = S(50)*S(150), because exponential is memoryless. Wait, actually, S(t1 + t2) = S(t1) * S(t2). Therefore, the probability that it survives 50 + 150 minutes is the product of surviving 50 then 150. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (after surviving 50) is 1 - S(150). Wait, no. Because given that it has already survived 50, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 is equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0. So yes, the memoryless property. So that probability is exactly 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The conditional probability P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived 50) = P( decay between 0 and 150 ) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nTherefore, I just need to calculate 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nWe know that \u03bb is -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03bb: \n\n\u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2248 ln(1.470588)/100. Wait, because ln(1/0.68) is -ln(0.68). Alternatively, maybe better to just use the numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\nWe can compute 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150} = 1 - [e^{-\u03bb*100}]^(150/100) \n\nWait, because e^{-\u03bb * 150} = (e^{-\u03bb * 100})^(1.5). Since 150 is 1.5 times 100. Since e^{-\u03bb*100} is 0.68, then e^{-\u03bb*150} = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nAh, this might be a smarter way. Let me try that.\n\nBecause, from the given data, e^{-\u03bb * 100} = 0.68. So then e^{-\u03bb *150} = (e^{-\u03bb *100})^ (150/100) ) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.68^1.5. Let me compute 0.68 squared first, then take the square root and multiply? Wait, 1.5 is 3/2, so 0.68^(3/2) is sqrt(0.68^3). \n\nCompute 0.68^3: 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624 * 0.68 \u2248 0.314432. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.314432) \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 0.68^1.5. Let me think of it as (0.68)^1 * sqrt(0.68). Let's compute sqrt(0.68) first. sqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.68) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 0.826^2 = 0.682, so sqrt(0.68) is about 0.8246. Then 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 * 0.8246. Let's compute that: 0.68 * 0.8 is 0.544, 0.68*0.0246 \u2248 0.0167. So total is approx 0.544 +0.0167 = 0.5607. So same as before. So 1-0.5607 is ~0.4393, so 43.93%, which is 44%, so answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's compute the decay constant more precisely.\n\nFirst, given that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. Let me compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856624. So \u03bb = (0.3856624)/100 \u2248 0.003856624 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Let's compute \u03bb*150 = 0.003856624 * 150 \u2248 0.5784936. Then e^(-0.5784936) \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating e^-0.5785. Let's see, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is ~0.5488. Let me use a better approximation. Let me use the Taylor series or linear approx between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAlternatively, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785. Let me compute e^-0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using a calculator-like approach. Let me note that:\n\ne^-0.5784936 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me see, 0.5785 is approximately equal to 0.5785. Let me recall that ln(0.56) is ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Oh! Wait a minute, because ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, so e^-0.5798 is 0.56. So if the exponent is -0.5785, which is slightly less negative than -0.5798, so e^-0.5785 is slightly higher than 0.56. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute ln(0.56) = ?\n\nWell, ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(56) - ln(100). ln(56) is ln(7*8) = ln7 + 3ln2 \u2248 1.9459 + 3*0.6931 \u2248 1.9459 + 2.0794 \u2248 4.0253. Wait no, that can't be. Wait, ln(56) is ln(8*7) = ln(8)+ln7 = 3ln2 + ln7 \u2248 3*0.6931 + 1.9459 \u2248 2.0794 +1.9459 \u2248 4.0253? Wait, no, that would be ln(512) because 8*7 is 56. Wait, 56 is 8*7. So ln(56) \u2248 4.025. But ln(100) is about 4.6052. So ln(0.56) = ln(56) - ln(100) \u2248 4.025 -4.605 \u2248 -0.580, yes. So e^-0.5785 is e^(0.0013) higher than e^-0.5798, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.56 * e^(0.0013). Since 0.0013 is small, e^0.0013 \u2248 1 + 0.0013, so 0.56 * 1.0013 \u2248 0.5607. Therefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 is ~0.4393, so 43.93%, which is ~44%. So that's answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do a more precise calculation. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute \u03bb * 150 = (ln(1/0.68)/100)*150 = (ln(1.470588)/100)*150. \n\nWait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588235) \u2248 0.3856624. Multiply by 150: 0.3856624 *150 = 57.84936. Wait no, that can't be. Wait no, sorry, the \u03bb was (ln(1/0.68)/100) per minute. So 150 minutes gives 150 * \u03bb = (150 /100)* ln(1/0.68) = 1.5 * 0.38566 \u2248 0.5785. So exponent is -0.5785. \n\nTherefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator for better precision. Let me think of 0.5785:\n\nWe can use a calculator function here. Let me see, e^-0.5785:\n\nFirst, 0.5785. Let me note that:\n\ne^-0.5 = 0.60653066\n\ne^-0.5785 = ?\n\nLet me compute the difference between 0.5 and 0.5785 is 0.0785. So:\n\ne^-(0.5 +0.0785) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * (1 -0.0785 + 0.0785\u00b2/2 - ...) \n\nApproximate e^-0.0785 using Taylor series around 0:\n\ne^-x \u22481 -x + x\u00b2/2 - x^3/6. \n\nx=0.0785:\n\n1 -0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 - (0.0785)^3/6.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term: 1 -0.0785 = 0.9215\n\nSecond term: (0.006162)/2 \u2248 0.003081 \u2192 0.9215 +0.003081 = 0.924581? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expansion is 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6.\n\nWait, so the first term is 1 -x = 0.9215.\n\nThen adding x\u00b2/2: (0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2 is ~0.003081. So 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581.\n\nThen subtract x^3/6: (0.0785)^3 = approx 0.0785 * 0.00616225 \u2248 0.000484. Divided by 6 is ~0.0000807. So subtract that: 0.924581 - 0.0000807 \u2248 0.9245. \n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 ~0.9245. \n\nTherefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 ?\n\n0.6 * 0.9245 = 0.5547, plus 0.0065*0.9245 \u2248 0.0060. Total \u2248 0.5547+0.006=0.5607. \n\nSo same as before. So 0.5607. \n\nSo 1-0.5607 is 0.4393, so 43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nWait, but the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. So that would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach? Let me think again. Maybe they consider the half-life? Wait, but the problem says the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so that's the survival probability?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem states: \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability that it decays within the first 100 minutes. So that is indeed 1 - e^{-\u03bb*100} = 0.32. So my approach was correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us into thinking that the probability is cumulative, but no, the memoryless property should apply here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, like a constant probability per unit time, but that's the same as exponential decay. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps someone might think that since after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability is 32% over the next 100 minutes (since 50+100=150?), but that's not correct because the time intervals are additive. Wait, but the next 150 minutes would be after 50, so the total time would be 200, but that approach would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the probability over 150 minutes is (32%)*(150/100) = 48%, but that's linear, which is wrong. Because the decay is exponential. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach where they model it as a binomial distribution, but that's not applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 - (probability of surviving another 150 minutes). \n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the answer is ~44%, which is option A. \n\nHmm, but let me see if there's another way. Let's compute the half-life. \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb can be found from the given data. Let me see: \n\nThe half-life T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. But perhaps not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, since after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed, so 68% remain. So the half-life can be calculated if needed, but perhaps not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the fact that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of decay in the next 100 minutes (after 50) would be 32%, but since we need 150 minutes, which is 1.5 times 100. So maybe the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5, which is what I did before. \n\nYes, that gives 44%. So I think that is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)44%.\n",

But maybe the 32% over 100 minutes is given, so I need to find the decay constant first.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let the decay constant be \u03bb. The probability that the atom decays within time T is 1 - e^(-\u03bbT). The problem states that when T is 100 minutes, this probability is 32%, so:\n\n1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32  \nTherefore, e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68  \nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:  \n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)  \nSo \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100  \n\nLet me calculate ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is a bit less negative. Let me compute it numerically. Let's see, using calculator: ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So then \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes with no decay, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? Since the process is memoryless, the remaining time is 150 minutes, but starting from the current time (after 50 minutes). The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a freshly observed atom would decay in 150 minutes. Wait, no, actually, the memoryless property says that the probability of surviving an additional time t given that it has already survived s is the same as the probability of surviving t. So the probability of decay in the next t minutes after s is 1 - e^(-\u03bb t). \n\nAlternatively, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, but since we know it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, the probability that it decays between t = 50 and t = 200 minutes is equal to the probability of surviving 50 minutes multiplied by (1 - probability of surviving another 150 minutes). But since the memoryless property says that after surviving 50, the remaining time is like starting over. \n\nLet me clarify. Let me denote the survival function S(t) = e^(-\u03bb t). The probability that it has not decayed by time t. Then, the probability that it decays between t1 and t2 is S(t1) - S(t2). \n\nBut given that it has already survived up to t1 = 50, the conditional probability that it decays between t1 and t1 + 150 (i.e., 200) is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(150)/S(50). \n\nAlternatively, since S(200) = S(50)*S(150), because exponential is memoryless. Wait, actually, S(t1 + t2) = S(t1) * S(t2). Therefore, the probability that it survives 50 + 150 minutes is the product of surviving 50 then 150. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (after surviving 50) is 1 - S(150). Wait, no. Because given that it has already survived 50, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 is equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0. So yes, the memoryless property. So that probability is exactly 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The conditional probability P(decay between 50 and 200 | survived 50) = P( decay between 0 and 150 ) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nTherefore, I just need to calculate 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150}.\n\nWe know that \u03bb is -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03bb: \n\n\u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100 \u2248 ln(1.470588)/100. Wait, because ln(1/0.68) is -ln(0.68). Alternatively, maybe better to just use the numbers.\n\nWe have:\n\nWe can compute 1 - e^{-\u03bb * 150} = 1 - [e^{-\u03bb*100}]^(150/100) \n\nWait, because e^{-\u03bb * 150} = (e^{-\u03bb * 100})^(1.5). Since 150 is 1.5 times 100. Since e^{-\u03bb*100} is 0.68, then e^{-\u03bb*150} = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nAh, this might be a smarter way. Let me try that.\n\nBecause, from the given data, e^{-\u03bb * 100} = 0.68. So then e^{-\u03bb *150} = (e^{-\u03bb *100})^ (150/100) ) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.68^1.5. Let me compute 0.68 squared first, then take the square root and multiply? Wait, 1.5 is 3/2, so 0.68^(3/2) is sqrt(0.68^3). \n\nCompute 0.68^3: 0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624, then 0.4624 * 0.68 \u2248 0.314432. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.314432) \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 0.68^1.5. Let me think of it as (0.68)^1 * sqrt(0.68). Let's compute sqrt(0.68) first. sqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.68) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 0.826^2 = 0.682, so sqrt(0.68) is about 0.8246. Then 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 * 0.8246. Let's compute that: 0.68 * 0.8 is 0.544, 0.68*0.0246 \u2248 0.0167. So total is approx 0.544 +0.0167 = 0.5607. So same as before. So 1-0.5607 is ~0.4393, so 43.93%, which is 44%, so answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's compute the decay constant more precisely.\n\nFirst, given that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68. Let me compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856624. So \u03bb = (0.3856624)/100 \u2248 0.003856624 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 150). Let's compute \u03bb*150 = 0.003856624 * 150 \u2248 0.5784936. Then e^(-0.5784936) \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating e^-0.5785. Let's see, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is ~0.5488. Let me use a better approximation. Let me use the Taylor series or linear approx between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAlternatively, 0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785. Let me compute e^-0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using a calculator-like approach. Let me note that:\n\ne^-0.5784936 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me see, 0.5785 is approximately equal to 0.5785. Let me recall that ln(0.56) is ln(0.56) \u2248 -0.5798. Oh! Wait a minute, because ln(0.56) is about -0.5798, so e^-0.5798 is 0.56. So if the exponent is -0.5785, which is slightly less negative than -0.5798, so e^-0.5785 is slightly higher than 0.56. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute ln(0.56) = ?\n\nWell, ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(56) - ln(100). ln(56) is ln(7*8) = ln7 + 3ln2 \u2248 1.9459 + 3*0.6931 \u2248 1.9459 + 2.0794 \u2248 4.0253. Wait no, that can't be. Wait, ln(56) is ln(8*7) = ln(8)+ln7 = 3ln2 + ln7 \u2248 3*0.6931 + 1.9459 \u2248 2.0794 +1.9459 \u2248 4.0253? Wait, no, that would be ln(512) because 8*7 is 56. Wait, 56 is 8*7. So ln(56) \u2248 4.025. But ln(100) is about 4.6052. So ln(0.56) = ln(56) - ln(100) \u2248 4.025 -4.605 \u2248 -0.580, yes. So e^-0.5785 is e^(0.0013) higher than e^-0.5798, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.56 * e^(0.0013). Since 0.0013 is small, e^0.0013 \u2248 1 + 0.0013, so 0.56 * 1.0013 \u2248 0.5607. Therefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 is ~0.4393, so 43.93%, which is ~44%. So that's answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do a more precise calculation. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute \u03bb * 150 = (ln(1/0.68)/100)*150 = (ln(1.470588)/100)*150. \n\nWait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588235) \u2248 0.3856624. Multiply by 150: 0.3856624 *150 = 57.84936. Wait no, that can't be. Wait no, sorry, the \u03bb was (ln(1/0.68)/100) per minute. So 150 minutes gives 150 * \u03bb = (150 /100)* ln(1/0.68) = 1.5 * 0.38566 \u2248 0.5785. So exponent is -0.5785. \n\nTherefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator for better precision. Let me think of 0.5785:\n\nWe can use a calculator function here. Let me see, e^-0.5785:\n\nFirst, 0.5785. Let me note that:\n\ne^-0.5 = 0.60653066\n\ne^-0.5785 = ?\n\nLet me compute the difference between 0.5 and 0.5785 is 0.0785. So:\n\ne^-(0.5 +0.0785) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * (1 -0.0785 + 0.0785\u00b2/2 - ...) \n\nApproximate e^-0.0785 using Taylor series around 0:\n\ne^-x \u22481 -x + x\u00b2/2 - x^3/6. \n\nx=0.0785:\n\n1 -0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 - (0.0785)^3/6.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term: 1 -0.0785 = 0.9215\n\nSecond term: (0.006162)/2 \u2248 0.003081 \u2192 0.9215 +0.003081 = 0.924581? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expansion is 1 - x + x\u00b2/2 - x\u00b3/6.\n\nWait, so the first term is 1 -x = 0.9215.\n\nThen adding x\u00b2/2: (0.0785)^2 = 0.00616225, divided by 2 is ~0.003081. So 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581.\n\nThen subtract x^3/6: (0.0785)^3 = approx 0.0785 * 0.00616225 \u2248 0.000484. Divided by 6 is ~0.0000807. So subtract that: 0.924581 - 0.0000807 \u2248 0.9245. \n\nSo e^-0.0785 \u2248 ~0.9245. \n\nTherefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 ?\n\n0.6 * 0.9245 = 0.5547, plus 0.0065*0.9245 \u2248 0.0060. Total \u2248 0.5547+0.006=0.5607. \n\nSo same as before. So 0.5607. \n\nSo 1-0.5607 is 0.4393, so 43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nWait, but the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. So that would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach? Let me think again. Maybe they consider the half-life? Wait, but the problem says the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so that's the survival probability?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem states: \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So that's the probability that it decays within the first 100 minutes. So that is indeed 1 - e^{-\u03bb*100} = 0.32. So my approach was correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us into thinking that the probability is cumulative, but no, the memoryless property should apply here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, like a constant probability per unit time, but that's the same as exponential decay. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps someone might think that since after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed, the remaining probability is 32% over the next 100 minutes (since 50+100=150?), but that's not correct because the time intervals are additive. Wait, but the next 150 minutes would be after 50, so the total time would be 200, but that approach would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the probability over 150 minutes is (32%)*(150/100) = 48%, but that's linear, which is wrong. Because the decay is exponential. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach where they model it as a binomial distribution, but that's not applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 - (probability of surviving another 150 minutes). \n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the answer is ~44%, which is option A. \n\nHmm, but let me see if there's another way. Let's compute the half-life. \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb can be found from the given data. Let me see: \n\nThe half-life T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. But perhaps not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, since after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed, so 68% remain. So the half-life can be calculated if needed, but perhaps not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the fact that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of decay in the next 100 minutes (after 50) would be 32%, but since we need 150 minutes, which is 1.5 times 100. So maybe the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5, which is what I did before. \n\nYes, that gives 44%. So I think that is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)44%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of a radioactive decay occurring in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential distribution with a memoryless property, meaning the probability of decay in the next interval depends only on the decay constant and the time interval, not on prior time.\n\nGiven that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, we first calculate the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\). The survival probability after 100 minutes is \\( e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \\). Solving for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the memoryless property. The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[\n1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[\ne^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{1.5} = (0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 0.5607.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[\n1 - 0.5607 \\approx 0.4393 \\, \\text{or} \\, 43.93\\%,\n\\]\n\nwhich rounds to **44%** (Option A).\n\nAnswer: A",
