      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Pauli spin matrices \u03c3 are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a unit vector, like \u03c3\u00b7n, that's basically the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix. \n\nWait, the Hamiltonian here is \u03b5 times that dot product. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of H. I recall that for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin operator in any direction (like \u03c3\u00b7n) are \u00b1\u00bd\u0127, right? But wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues \u00b11. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me step back. The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, but since n is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n should still be \u00b11. Because for any direction, the spin component's eigenvalues are \u00b11/2 in units of \u0127, but maybe here the Pauli matrices are in units where \u0127 is included or not?\n\nWait, hold on. The standard Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so their eigenvalues are \u00b11. So if you have an operator like \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a combination of the Pauli matrices, then its eigenvalues would be \u00b11. Then, the Hamiltonian H is \u03b5 times that operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. So that would be \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), so the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. That would be option B. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing a factor here. Let me think again. In quantum mechanics, the spin operator along a direction is often written as S\u00b7n, where S is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the actual spin operator in that case would be (\u0127/2)\u03c3\u00b7n. Then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u0127/2. But in the problem, the Hamiltonian given is H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, not including that \u0127/2 factor. \n\nAh! So in this problem's Hamiltonian, the operator is \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3\u00b7n (without the \u0127/2). Since \u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H's eigenvalues are \u03b5*1 and \u03b5*(-1). So the answer would be B: +\u03b5, -\u03b5. \n\nBut let me check the options again. Option C has \u03b5 multiplied by \u0127/2, but that would be the case if the Hamiltonian had included the (\u0127/2) factor. Since the problem states that H is \u03b5 times \u03c3\u00b7n, the \u0127 is not part of the operator here. The constant \u03b5 has units of energy, so when multiplied by a dimensionless operator (since Pauli matrices are dimensionless), the units work out. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues should be \u00b1\u03b5. So the correct answer is B.\n",
