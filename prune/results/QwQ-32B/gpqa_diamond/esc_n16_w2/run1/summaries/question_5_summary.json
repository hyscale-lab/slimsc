      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a muon's spin operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z of the operator P, each as matrices multiplied by \u210f/2. The eigenvector should correspond to the eigenvalue +\u210f/2. \n\nFirst, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are used, and each component of the spin operator (like S_x, S_y, S_z) is proportional to these. The given matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z look exactly like the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u210f/2. So P_x is (\u03c3_x)*(\u210f/2), right? Let me confirm the matrices:\n\nP_x matrix:\nFirst row [0 1], second [1 0]. Yeah, that's \u03c3_x scaled by \u210f/2. Similarly, P_y is \u03c3_y scaled by \u210f/2, since the first row is [0 -i], second [i 0], which matches \u03c3_y. And P_z is \u03c3_z scaled by \u210f/2. So the operator P is essentially the spin operator for the muon, analogous to the Pauli matrices.\n\nNow the problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) perhaps? Since it's in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Let me think: an arbitrary direction in x-z would have spherical coordinates where the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and since there's no phi component (because it's in x-z), phi would be 0 or \u03c0, but maybe we can just parametrize it with theta only. Wait, maybe they parametrize it as n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. \n\nThe operator along direction n would then be P_n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y =0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Let me write that as P_n = (n_x)(P_x) + (n_z)(P_z). Each of these P components is (\u210f/2) times their respective Pauli matrices, so factoring out \u210f/2, we get P_n = (\u210f/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). \n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u210f/2) |v>. So substituting, we have (\u210f/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) v = (\u210f/2) v. So multiplying both sides by 2/\u210f gives (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) v = v. \n\nThe eigenvectors of the operator n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z corresponding to eigenvalue +1 (since we divided out \u210f/2 and the original eigenvalue was +\u210f/2). Wait, actually, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 matrices are \u00b11. So the eigenvalue equation here is (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) v = 1*v. \n\nNow, to find the eigenvector. Let me recall that for a general direction in the x-z plane, the eigenvector corresponding to +1 can be written in terms of theta. Let me think of the standard way to write eigenvectors for spin along an arbitrary axis. \n\nSuppose the direction is given by n, which is in the x-z plane. Let me parametrize the direction as theta from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). \n\nThe operator becomes \u03c3_n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z. \n\nThe eigenvalues are \u00b11, so the eigenvector for +1 can be found by solving (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z - I) v =0. Let me write the matrix form. The matrix for \u03c3_n is:\n\n\u03c3_n matrix:\nFirst row: [n_z, n_x]\nSecond row: [n_x, -n_z] (Wait, no, wait. Let me compute \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z multiplied by their components. Let's see: \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x \u03c3_x is [[0,n_x],[n_x, 0]]\n\n\u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_z \u03c3_z is [[n_z,0],[0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding them together gives the matrix:\n\n[ n_z, n_x ]\n\n[ n_x, -n_z ]\n\nWait, no: Let me add the two matrices properly. \n\nn_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z:\n\nFirst element (1,1): n_z*1 (from \u03c3_z) plus 0 (since \u03c3_x has 0 there) \u2192 n_z.\n\nFirst row second element: n_x *1 (from \u03c3_x's top right) plus 0 (since \u03c3_z's top right is 0) \u2192 n_x.\n\nSecond row first element: n_x*1 (from \u03c3_x's bottom left) plus 0 (\u03c3_z's bottom left is 0) \u2192 n_x.\n\nSecond row second element: 0 (from \u03c3_x's bottom right) plus (-n_z) from \u03c3_z's bottom right \u2192 -n_z. \n\nSo the matrix for \u03c3_n is:\n\n[ n_z   n_x ]\n\n[ n_x  -n_z ]\n\nSo the equation (\u03c3_n - I) v = 0 becomes:\n\n[ n_z -1    n_x      ] [v1]   = [0]\n\n[ n_x      -n_z -1 ] [v2]      [0]\n\nSo we can write the equations:\n\n(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0\n\nn_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0\n\nWe can solve this system. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(n_z -1)v1 + n_x v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1, assuming n_x \u22600.\n\nAlternatively, let's plug in the parametrization. Since n is in x-z plane, and let's use theta such that n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Because if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then the x-component is sin\u03b8, z-component is cos\u03b8. \n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the first equation becomes (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1. \n\nSimplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Recall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = tan(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (v1, tan(\u03b8/2) v1). To normalize it, the norm squared is |v1|^2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = |v1|^2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So set |v1|^2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) =1 \u2192 |v1|= cos(\u03b8/2). So then v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), and v2 = sin(\u03b8/2). \n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLet me let v1 = cos(\u03b8/2). Then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). So the vector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. That's the normalized eigenvector. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm. The normalization:\n\ncos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1, so yes, that's normalized. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 (since we divided by \u210f/2 earlier) is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]. \n\nBut the question says the eigenvalue is +\u210f/2. Since the operator P_n is (\u210f/2) times the \u03c3_n matrix, so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u210f/2. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nOption B has a phase factor e^{i phi} but since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but since there's no y component, maybe phi is fixed. The problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so maybe the phase is not needed here. The options for B have e^{i phi} sin(theta), but in our solution, there's no phase because the direction is along x-z. Since phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis, but in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. So perhaps the phase is included as e^{i phi} but in our case, since n is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so maybe the answer must account for that phase. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that would be option C. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The standard formula for the eigenstate of spin along an arbitrary direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is usually written as:\n\n|+> = [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nAh, right! Because if the direction is in the x-y plane, then the phase comes into play. Wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 (along x) or pi (along -x), but since it's arbitrary in x-z, perhaps the direction is parametrized by theta from the z-axis and phi is fixed at 0. Wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would have phi =0 or pi (since phi is the angle in the x-y plane from x-axis). Wait, maybe the parametrization here uses theta as the polar angle from the z-axis and phi is the azimuthal angle. Since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Therefore, the e^{i phi} term would be either 1 or -1, but since we can choose the global phase, perhaps it's just sin(theta/2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different parametrization where the direction is given only by theta, so the phase isn't needed. Let me see the options again. Option B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but the question says the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is fixed. Therefore, the phase factor might not be needed here, so the correct answer would be option C. \n\nWait, but in the standard formula, when the direction is along an arbitrary axis with spherical angles (theta, phi), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]. Since here, in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, so the phase would be either 1 or -1. However, since the problem states \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", the answer must be general, so perhaps they parametrized theta differently. Wait, maybe the question's parametrization of theta is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different coordinate system where theta is the angle from the x-axis. But I think the standard is polar angle from z-axis. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question's answer is C. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That matches our calculation if phi is zero. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the general form would need to account for the direction in x-z. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized with theta from the z-axis, and phi is fixed (either 0 or pi). But in the standard formula, when phi is fixed, the phase would be fixed. Since the question allows for an arbitrary direction in the plane, but the eigenvector's components don't depend on phi because when you are in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but in the eigenvector, the phase can be absorbed into the global phase. So perhaps the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's theta is defined differently. Let me see another approach. Let me suppose the direction is given by some angle theta from the z-axis. Then, the eigenvector is as we found, cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option C. \n\nLooking at the other options: A and D have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to come from this calculation. Option B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but the sine term is not divided by 2. Wait, the standard formula uses theta/2. So perhaps B is incorrect. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is option C. Let me just confirm once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different parametrization where the angle is the angle from the x-axis. Let me try that. Suppose the direction makes an angle phi with the x-axis in the x-z plane. Then, n_x = cos(phi), n_z = sin(phi). Then theta would be the angle from x-axis. Then, the calculation would be similar. Let me see:\n\nLet me suppose that the direction is parametrized by an angle theta from x-axis. So then n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta). Then, the same steps:\n\nThe matrix becomes [cos(theta) -1, cos(0) ? Wait, no, n_x is cos(theta), n_z is sin(theta). Then, the equations would be (sin(theta) -1)v1 + cos(theta) v2 =0. \n\nHmm, perhaps this would lead to a different expression. But the problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\". The key is that regardless of the parametrization, the answer should be in terms of the angle defining the direction. The problem probably expects the standard parametrization where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So then the answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a muon's spin operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z of the operator P, each as matrices multiplied by \u210f/2. The eigenvector should correspond to the eigenvalue +\u210f/2. \n\nFirst, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are used, and each component of the spin operator (like S_x, S_y, S_z) is proportional to these. The given matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z look exactly like the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u210f/2. So P_x is (\u03c3_x)*(\u210f/2), right? Let me confirm the matrices:\n\nP_x matrix:\nFirst row [0 1], second [1 0]. Yeah, that's \u03c3_x scaled by \u210f/2. Similarly, P_y is \u03c3_y scaled by \u210f/2, since the first row is [0 -i], second [i 0], which matches \u03c3_y. And P_z is \u03c3_z scaled by \u210f/2. So the operator P is essentially the spin operator for the muon, analogous to the Pauli matrices.\n\nNow the problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8) perhaps? Since it's in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Let me think: an arbitrary direction in x-z would have spherical coordinates where the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and since there's no phi component (because it's in x-z), phi would be 0 or \u03c0, but maybe we can just parametrize it with theta only. Wait, maybe they parametrize it as n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. \n\nThe operator along direction n would then be P_n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y =0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Let me write that as P_n = (n_x)(P_x) + (n_z)(P_z). Each of these P components is (\u210f/2) times their respective Pauli matrices, so factoring out \u210f/2, we get P_n = (\u210f/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). \n\nThe eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u210f/2) |v>. So substituting, we have (\u210f/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) v = (\u210f/2) v. So multiplying both sides by 2/\u210f gives (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) v = v. \n\nThe eigenvectors of the operator n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z corresponding to eigenvalue +1 (since we divided out \u210f/2 and the original eigenvalue was +\u210f/2).

Let me recall that for a general direction in the x-z plane, the eigenvector corresponding to +1 can be written in terms of theta. Let me think of the standard way to write eigenvectors for spin along an arbitrary axis. \n\nSuppose the direction is given by n, which is in the x-z plane. Let me parametrize the direction as theta from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). \n\nThe operator becomes \u03c3_n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z. \n\nThe eigenvalues are \u00b11, so the eigenvector for +1 can be found by solving (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z - I) v =0. Let me write the matrix form. The matrix for \u03c3_n is:\n\n\u03c3_n matrix:\nFirst row: [n_z, n_x]\nSecond row: [n_x, -n_z] (Wait, no, wait. Let me compute \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z multiplied by their components. Let's see: \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x \u03c3_x is [[0,n_x],[n_x, 0]]\n\n\u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_z \u03c3_z is [[n_z,0],[0, -n_z]]\n\nAdding them together gives the matrix:\n\n[ n_z, n_x ]\n\n[ n_x, -n_z ]\n\nWait, no: Let me add the two matrices properly. \n\nn_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z:\n\nFirst element (1,1): n_z*1 (from \u03c3_z) plus 0 (since \u03c3_x has 0 there) \u2192 n_z.\n\nFirst row second element: n_x *1 (from \u03c3_x's top right) plus 0 (since \u03c3_z's top right is 0) \u2192 n_x.\n\nSecond row first element: n_x*1 (from \u03c3_x's bottom left) plus 0 (\u03c3_z's bottom left is 0) \u2192 n_x.\n\nSecond row second element: 0 (from \u03c3_x's bottom right) plus (-n_z) from \u03c3_z's bottom right \u2192 -n_z. \n\nSo the matrix for \u03c3_n is:\n\n[ n_z   n_x ]\n\n[ n_x  -n_z ]\n\nSo the equation (\u03c3_n - I) v = 0 becomes:\n\n[ n_z -1    n_x      ] [v1]   = [0]\n\n[ n_x      -n_z -1 ] [v2]      [0]\n\nSo we can write the equations:\n\n(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0\n\nn_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0\n\nWe can solve this system. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(n_z -1)v1 + n_x v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1, assuming n_x \u22600.\n\nAlternatively, let's plug in the parametrization. Since n is in x-z plane, and let's use theta such that n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Because if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then the x-component is sin\u03b8, z-component is cos\u03b8. \n\nSo substituting n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the first equation becomes (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1. \n\nSimplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Recall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] ) = tan(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as (v1, tan(\u03b8/2) v1). To normalize it, the norm squared is |v1|^2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = |v1|^2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So set |v1|^2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) =1 \u2192 |v1|= cos(\u03b8/2). So then v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), and v2 = sin(\u03b8/2). \n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLet me let v1 = cos(\u03b8/2). Then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). So the vector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. That's the normalized eigenvector. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm. The normalization:\n\ncos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1, so yes, that's normalized. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +1 (since we divided by \u210f/2 earlier) is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]. \n\nBut the question says the eigenvalue is +\u210f/2. Since the operator P_n is (\u210f/2) times the \u03c3_n matrix, so the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u210f/2. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nOption B has a phase factor e^{i phi} but since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but since there's no y component, maybe phi is fixed. The problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so maybe the phase is not needed here. The options for B have e^{i phi} sin(theta), but in our solution, there's no phase because the direction is along x-z. Since phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis, but in x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. So perhaps the phase is included as e^{i phi} but in our case, since n is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so maybe the answer must account for that phase. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So that would be option C. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The standard formula for the eigenstate of spin along an arbitrary direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is usually written as:\n\n|+> = [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nAh, right! Because if the direction is in the x-y plane, then the phase comes into play. Wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 (along x) or pi (along -x), but since it's arbitrary in x-z, perhaps the direction is parametrized by theta from the z-axis and phi is fixed at 0. Wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would have phi =0 or pi (since phi is the angle in the x-y plane from x-axis). Wait, maybe the parametrization here uses theta as the polar angle from the z-axis and phi is the azimuthal angle. Since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi. Therefore, the e^{i phi} term would be either 1 or -1, but since we can choose the global phase, perhaps it's just sin(theta/2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different parametrization where the direction is given only by theta, so the phase isn't needed. Let me see the options again. Option B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but the question says the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is fixed. Therefore, the phase factor might not be needed here, so the correct answer would be option C. \n\nWait, but in the standard formula, when the direction is along an arbitrary axis with spherical angles (theta, phi), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]. Since here, in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, so the phase would be either 1 or -1. However, since the problem states \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", the answer must be general, so perhaps they parametrized theta differently. Wait, maybe the question's parametrization of theta is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different coordinate system where theta is the angle from the x-axis. But I think the standard is polar angle from z-axis. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question's answer is C. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That matches our calculation if phi is zero. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the general form would need to account for the direction in x-z. Wait, but in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized with theta from the z-axis, and phi is fixed (either 0 or pi). But in the standard formula, when phi is fixed, the phase would be fixed. Since the question allows for an arbitrary direction in the plane, but the eigenvector's components don't depend on phi because when you are in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but in the eigenvector, the phase can be absorbed into the global phase. So perhaps the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's theta is defined differently. Let me see another approach. Let me suppose the direction is given by some angle theta from the z-axis. Then, the eigenvector is as we found, cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So option C. \n\nLooking at the other options: A and D have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't seem to come from this calculation. Option B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but the sine term is not divided by 2. Wait, the standard formula uses theta/2. So perhaps B is incorrect. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is option C. Let me just confirm once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different parametrization where the angle is the angle from the x-axis. Let me try that. Suppose the direction makes an angle phi with the x-axis in the x-z plane. Then, n_x = cos(phi), n_z = sin(phi). Then theta would be the angle from x-axis. Then, the calculation would be similar. Let me see:\n\nLet me suppose that the direction is parametrized by an angle theta from x-axis. So then n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta). Then, the same steps:\n\nThe matrix becomes [cos(theta) -1, cos(0) ? Wait, no, n_x is cos(theta), n_z is sin(theta). Then, the equations would be (sin(theta) -1)v1 + cos(theta) v2 =0. \n\nHmm, perhaps this would lead to a different expression. But the problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\". The key is that regardless of the parametrization, the answer should be in terms of the angle defining the direction. The problem probably expects the standard parametrization where theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So then the answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n\nTo find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\) for the operator \\(\\vec{P}\\) along an arbitrary direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane, we start by noting that the components of \\(\\vec{P}\\) are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) can be parametrized with spherical coordinates where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle from the z-axis, giving \\(\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)\\). \n\nThe operator \\(\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z \\right)\n\\]\nThe eigenvalue equation for \\(+\\hbar/2\\) simplifies to:\n\\[\n(\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z) \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nExpressing the Pauli matrices and solving the system, we find the eigenvector components:\n\\[\nv_1 = \\cos(\\theta/2), \\quad v_2 = \\sin(\\theta/2)\n\\]\nThis vector is normalized, as \\(\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1\\). The phase factor \\(e^{i\\phi}\\) is unnecessary here because the direction lies in the x-z plane (fixing \\(\\phi\\) to 0 or \\(\\pi\\)), which can be absorbed into the global phase. \n\nThus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about such operators. \n\nFirst, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are each proportional to \u0127/2 times specific matrices. These matrices look familiar\u2014they remind me of the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, Pauli matrices are often used for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. So maybe this operator P is analogous to the Pauli spin operator, but scaled by \u0127/2? Let me check the components again:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's exactly the Pauli-X matrix (\u03c3_x) scaled by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2)*[[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli-Y matrix (\u03c3_y) scaled by \u0127/2. And P_z is (\u0127/2)*[[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is \u03c3_z scaled by \u0127/2. So P must be the Pauli spin operator scaled by \u0127/2. \n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is probably measured from the z-axis, but maybe from the x? Wait, in standard spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, but since it's in x-z plane, maybe the angle is defined differently. Hmm, but maybe I can represent the direction n as a unit vector in terms of spherical coordinates but with \u03c6 (the azimuthal angle) fixed? Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, maybe \u03b8 here is measured from the x-axis? Not sure yet. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe operator P along direction n would be given by the combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since the direction is along n in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. Therefore, the operator P_n should be P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote the direction vector as n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), assuming \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Then, n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2) [ (sin\u03b8) * \u03c3_x + (cos\u03b8) * \u03c3_z ].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's write out the matrix for P_n. \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8],[sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\ncos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cos\u03b8, 0],[0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe (1,1) element is 0 + cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8,\n\nThe (1,2) element is sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8,\n\nThe (2,1) element is sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8,\n\nThe (2,2) element is 0 + (-cos\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, the matrix equation for the eigenvalue problem is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = (2/\u0127)*(eigenvalue) * v \n\nWait, actually, since P_n is (\u0127/2) times that matrix, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, so setting up the equation:\n\n(P_n) v = (+\u0127/2) v\n\nTherefore,\n\n(\u0127/2) [matrix] v = (\u0127/2) v \n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n[matrix] v = v \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me recheck:\n\nWait the eigenvalue equation is P_n v = \u03bb v, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue given as +\u0127/2. Since P_n is (\u0127/2)*[matrix], then:\n\n(\u0127/2)*[matrix] v = (\u0127/2) v \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127:\n\n[matrix] v = v \n\nSo the equation simplifies to [matrix] v = v. \n\nWait, so the matrix equation is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = v \n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n( [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n   [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] - I ) v = 0 \n\nWhere I is the identity matrix. Let's write that matrix:\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nSo the matrix to consider for the eigenvalue 1 (since we subtracted the identity matrix) is:\n\n[cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWe need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 1 for the matrix (matrix of P_n scaled by 2/\u0127), but since the equation reduces to (matrix - I)v =0, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made an error here. Let me recheck the setup. The eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2)*M*v = (\u0127/2)*v, where M is the matrix. So (M - I)v =0. So yes, the matrix is M minus identity.\n\nSo to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve (M - I)v =0, where M is the matrix above (before multiplying by \u0127/2). \n\nSo the matrix M is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, M - I is:\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWe can write the equations:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nWe can pick one equation to solve for v1 and v2. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nLet me express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nHmm, note that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So substituting:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as a scalar multiple of [1, tan(\u03b8/2)]^T. To make it a normalized vector, let's compute the norm:\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(\u03b8/2)]^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the norm is sec(\u03b8/2), so to normalize, multiply by cos(\u03b8/2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is:\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) [1, tan(\u03b8/2)]^T \n\nWhich gives components:\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * 1 = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nand \n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), so that's a candidate. But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, but in the equations above, I assumed that the second equation is consistent. Let me check with the second equation. Let me plug v1 and v2 into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nSubstituting v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) tan(\u03b8/2) v1 =0 \n\nFactor out v1:\n\n[sin\u03b8 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) tan(\u03b8/2)] v1 =0 \n\nLet me compute the bracket term. Let's substitute tan(\u03b8/2) = t for simplicity.\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) \n\ncos\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond, -cos\u03b8 -1 = - (cos\u03b8 +1) = - [ (1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) +1 ] = - [2 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] = -2(1 - sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so -cos\u03b8-1 is -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2). \n\nThus the bracket becomes:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) + [ -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] * [ sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] \n\nBecause tan(\u03b8/2) is sin/cos, so substituting:\n\nThe second term is -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * [ sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] = -2 cos(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo overall:\n\nFirst term: 2 sin cos \n\nSecond term: -2 cos sin \n\nAdding together gives 0. So yes, the second equation is satisfied. Good. \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is indeed (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is exactly that. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) is either 0 or \u03c0, since y is zero. For example, if the direction is along the x axis (\u03b8 = 90 degrees from z?), then \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0/2? Hmm, maybe the parametrization here is different. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. The standard parametrization for a direction in x-z plane (with y=0) would have angles such that the polar angle is measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). The operator P_n is then a combination of P_x and P_z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle used in the problem is different. Wait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\". The question is whether the eigenvector is expressed in terms of the angle \u03b8 that defines the direction. \n\nThe answer we got is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). So option C. Let me check if any other option could be similar. Option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, but with an exponential. Since the problem didn't mention any phase, but the eigenvectors of Pauli matrices can have complex components. Wait, but in our case, when we derived the eigenvector, the components are real, because the direction is along x-z, so maybe the eigenvector is real. \n\nWait, the eigenvector we found is real. The components are cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2), so no imaginary part. So option C is real. Option B has an e^{i\u03c6} term, which would introduce a phase. Since the direction is in x-z, maybe \u03c6 is zero (if along x) or \u03c0 (if along -x), so e^{i\u03c6} would be \u00b11. But the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", so maybe the phase is included in the general case. Hmm, but the question says \"the elements of the normalized eigenvector\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error here. Wait, let me think again. Let me rederive the eigenvector again. \n\nWe had the matrix M = [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWe want to solve (M - I)v =0.\n\nThe equations are (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nand sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nWe solved the first equation and found v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 \n\nThen, substituting into the second equation, it works out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the eigenvector as [v1, v2]^T, with v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nLet me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 again. Let me use trig identities:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin\u03b8/2 cos\u03b8/2) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. \n\nSo the vector is proportional to [1, tan(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the norm is sec(\u03b8/2). So multiply by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nBecause tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so multiplying by cos(\u03b8/2) gives sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nTherefore, the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is exactly that. The other options involve different expressions. Option B has a phase factor e^{i phi} which might not be necessary here since the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi would be 0 or pi, making that term real. But the problem states \"arbitrary direction\", so perhaps the general form with phi is needed, but the question doesn't mention phi in the problem statement. Since the direction is in x-z, the angle phi (azimuthal) is either 0 or pi (if measured from x) but since the problem didn't mention phi, the answer is likely C. \n\nAnother check: For example, if the direction is along the z-axis (theta = 0, since angle from z-axis is 0). Then the eigenvector should be (1,0), because P_z's + eigenstate is [1;0]. Plugging theta = 0 into option C gives cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so (1,0). Correct.\n\nIf the direction is along the x-axis (theta = 90 degrees, since angle from z-axis is 90 degrees). Then theta is pi/2. Then theta/2 is pi/4. So cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. The eigenvector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T. \n\nWait, let's check with the operator P_x. The eigenvalue +1/2 for P_x (since P_x is (\u0127/2)*sigma_x, so eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2). The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 would be [1;1]/sqrt(2), which is exactly (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2). So that matches. So when theta is pi/2 (90 degrees), the answer is correct. \n\nAnother test: direction along negative z-axis (theta = pi). Then theta/2 is pi/2. cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So eigenvector would be (0,1). But wait, the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for P_z along the negative z direction? Wait, if n is pointing along negative z-axis (theta = pi), then P_n would be P_z*(-1) because n_z is -1. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, if the direction is along the negative z-axis (theta = pi radians from the positive z-axis), then n_z = cos(pi) = -1, n_x = sin(pi)=0. So the operator P_n would be (\u0127/2)[0*sigma_x + (-1)*sigma_z] = - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalues would be -\u0127/2 and +\u0127/2? Wait, no. Wait the eigenvalues of P_n would be the eigenvalues of that operator. Let me see:\n\nThe matrix for P_n in this case is (\u0127/2)*[ [ -1, 0 ], [0,1 ] ] because cos\u03b8 = -1, so cos\u03b8 in the first entry. So the operator is - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalues would be -\u0127/2 and +\u0127/2? Wait, no. Wait the eigenvalues of sigma_z are \u00b11. So when multiplied by -\u0127/2, they become \u2213\u0127/2. So the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the eigenvector of sigma_z with eigenvalue -1, which is [0,1]^T. Which matches our previous result: theta=pi, so the eigenvector is (cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1). So that's correct. \n\nThus, option C works for those test cases. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about such operators. \n\nFirst, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are each proportional to \u0127/2 times specific matrices. These matrices look familiar\u2014they remind me of the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, Pauli matrices are often used for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. So maybe this operator P is analogous to the Pauli spin operator, but scaled by \u0127/2? Let me check the components again:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) multiplied by [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's exactly the Pauli-X matrix (\u03c3_x) scaled by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2)*[[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli-Y matrix (\u03c3_y) scaled by \u0127/2. And P_z is (\u0127/2)*[[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is \u03c3_z scaled by \u0127/2. So P must be the Pauli spin operator scaled by \u0127/2. \n\nThe question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is probably measured from the z-axis, but maybe from the x? Wait, in standard spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, but since it's in x-z plane, maybe the angle is defined differently. Hmm, but maybe I can represent the direction n as a unit vector in terms of spherical coordinates but with \u03c6 (the azimuthal angle) fixed? Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, maybe \u03b8 here is measured from the x-axis? Not sure yet. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe operator P along direction n would be given by the combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since the direction is along n in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. Therefore, the operator P_n should be P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote the direction vector as n = (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), assuming \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Then, n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2) [ (sin\u03b8) * \u03c3_x + (cos\u03b8) * \u03c3_z ].\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's write out the matrix for P_n. \n\n\u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8],[sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\ncos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cos\u03b8, 0],[0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nThe (1,1) element is 0 + cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8,\n\nThe (1,2) element is sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8,\n\nThe (2,1) element is sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8,\n\nThe (2,2) element is 0 + (-cos\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, the matrix equation for the eigenvalue problem is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = (2/\u0127)*(eigenvalue) * v \n\nWait, actually, since P_n is (\u0127/2) times that matrix, and the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, so setting up the equation:\n\n(P_n) v = (+\u0127/2) v\n\nTherefore,\n\n(\u0127/2) [matrix] v = (\u0127/2) v \n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n[matrix] v = v \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me recheck:\n\nWait the eigenvalue equation is P_n v = \u03bb v, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue given as +\u0127/2. Since P_n is (\u0127/2)*[matrix], then:\n\n(\u0127/2)*[matrix] v = (\u0127/2) v \n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127:\n\n[matrix] v = v \n\nSo the equation simplifies to [matrix] v = v. \n\nWait, so the matrix equation is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = v \n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n( [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], \n   [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] - I ) v = 0 \n\nWhere I is the identity matrix. Let's write that matrix:\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nSo the matrix to consider for the eigenvalue 1 (since we subtracted the identity matrix) is:\n\n[cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWe need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 1 for the matrix (matrix of P_n scaled by 2/\u0127), but since the equation reduces to (matrix - I)v =0, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made an error here. Let me recheck the setup. The eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2)*M*v = (\u0127/2)*v, where M is the matrix. So (M - I)v =0. So yes, the matrix is M minus identity.\n\nSo to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve (M - I)v =0, where M is the matrix above (before multiplying by \u0127/2). \n\nSo the matrix M is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nTherefore, M - I is:\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWe can write the equations:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nWe can pick one equation to solve for v1 and v2. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nLet me express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)v1 \n\nSo v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1 \n\nHmm, note that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So substituting:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as a scalar multiple of [1, tan(\u03b8/2)]^T. To make it a normalized vector, let's compute the norm:\n\nThe norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(\u03b8/2)]^2 = 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the norm is sec(\u03b8/2), so to normalize, multiply by cos(\u03b8/2). Thus the normalized eigenvector is:\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) [1, tan(\u03b8/2)]^T \n\nWhich gives components:\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * 1 = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nand \n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), so that's a candidate. But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, but in the equations above, I assumed that the second equation is consistent. Let me check with the second equation. Let me plug v1 and v2 into the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nSubstituting v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) tan(\u03b8/2) v1 =0 \n\nFactor out v1:\n\n[sin\u03b8 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) tan(\u03b8/2)] v1 =0 \n\nLet me compute the bracket term. Let's substitute tan(\u03b8/2) = t for simplicity.\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) \n\ncos\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond, -cos\u03b8 -1 = - (cos\u03b8 +1) = - [ (1 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) +1 ] = - [2 - 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] = -2(1 - sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nWait, cos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so -cos\u03b8-1 is -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2). \n\nThus the bracket becomes:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) + [ -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] * [ sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] \n\nBecause tan(\u03b8/2) is sin/cos, so substituting:\n\nThe second term is -2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * [ sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) ) ] = -2 cos(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo overall:\n\nFirst term: 2 sin cos \n\nSecond term: -2 cos sin \n\nAdding together gives 0. So yes, the second equation is satisfied. Good. \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is indeed (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is exactly that. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) is either 0 or \u03c0, since y is zero. For example, if the direction is along the x axis (\u03b8 = 90 degrees from z?), then \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0/2? Hmm, maybe the parametrization here is different. Alternatively, maybe the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. The standard parametrization for a direction in x-z plane (with y=0) would have angles such that the polar angle is measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). The operator P_n is then a combination of P_x and P_z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle used in the problem is different. Wait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\". The question is whether the eigenvector is expressed in terms of the angle \u03b8 that defines the direction. \n\nThe answer we got is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). So option C. Let me check if any other option could be similar. Option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, but with an exponential. Since the problem didn't mention any phase, but the eigenvectors of Pauli matrices can have complex components. Wait, but in our case, when we derived the eigenvector, the components are real, because the direction is along x-z, so maybe the eigenvector is real. \n\nWait, the eigenvector we found is real. The components are cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2), so no imaginary part. So option C is real. Option B has an e^{i\u03c6} term, which would introduce a phase. Since the direction is in x-z, maybe \u03c6 is zero (if along x) or \u03c0 (if along -x), so e^{i\u03c6} would be \u00b11. But the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", so maybe the phase is included in the general case. Hmm, but the question says \"the elements of the normalized eigenvector\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error here. Wait, let me think again. Let me rederive the eigenvector again. \n\nWe had the matrix M = [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nWe want to solve (M - I)v =0.\n\nThe equations are (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0 \n\nand sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0 \n\nWe solved the first equation and found v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1 \n\nThen, substituting into the second equation, it works out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the eigenvector as [v1, v2]^T, with v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nLet me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 again. Let me use trig identities:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin\u03b8/2 cos\u03b8/2) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. \n\nSo the vector is proportional to [1, tan(\u03b8/2) ].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the norm is sec(\u03b8/2). So multiply by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\ncos(\u03b8/2) * [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] = [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nBecause tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so multiplying by cos(\u03b8/2) gives sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nTherefore, the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is exactly that. The other options involve different expressions. Option B has a phase factor e^{i phi} which might not be necessary here since the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi would be 0 or pi, making that term real. But the problem states \"arbitrary direction\", so perhaps the general form with phi is needed, but the question doesn't mention phi in the problem statement. Since the direction is in x-z, the angle phi (azimuthal) is either 0 or pi (if measured from x) but since the problem didn't mention phi, the answer is likely C. \n\nAnother check: For example, if the direction is along the z-axis (theta = 0, since angle from z-axis is 0). Then the eigenvector should be (1,0), because P_z's + eigenstate is [1;0]. Plugging theta = 0 into option C gives cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so (1,0). Correct.\n\nIf the direction is along the x-axis (theta = 90 degrees, since angle from z-axis is 90 degrees). Then theta is pi/2. Then theta/2 is pi/4. So cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. The eigenvector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T. \n\nWait, let's check with the operator P_x. The eigenvalue +1/2 for P_x (since P_x is (\u0127/2)*sigma_x, so eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2). The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 would be [1;1]/sqrt(2), which is exactly (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2). So that matches. So when theta is pi/2 (90 degrees), the answer is correct. \n\nAnother test: direction along negative z-axis (theta = pi). Then theta/2 is pi/2. cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So eigenvector would be (0,1). But wait, the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 for P_z along the negative z direction? Wait, if n is pointing along negative z-axis (theta = pi), then P_n would be P_z*(-1) because n_z is -1. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, if the direction is along the negative z-axis (theta = pi radians from the positive z-axis), then n_z = cos(pi) = -1, n_x = sin(pi)=0. So the operator P_n would be (\u0127/2)[0*sigma_x + (-1)*sigma_z] = - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalues would be -\u0127/2 and +\u0127/2? Wait, no. Wait the eigenvalues of P_n would be the eigenvalues of that operator. Let me see:\n\nThe matrix for P_n in this case is (\u0127/2)*[ [ -1, 0 ], [0,1 ] ] because cos\u03b8 = -1, so cos\u03b8 in the first entry. So the operator is - (\u0127/2) sigma_z. The eigenvalues would be -\u0127/2 and +\u0127/2? Wait, no. Wait the eigenvalues of sigma_z are \u00b11. So when multiplied by -\u0127/2, they become \u2213\u0127/2. So the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the eigenvector of sigma_z with eigenvalue -1, which is [0,1]^T. Which matches our previous result: theta=pi, so the eigenvector is (cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1). So that's correct. \n\nThus, option C works for those test cases. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$. The components of $\\vec{P}$ are given by scaled Pauli matrices.
