      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have two electrons in p orbitals, which means each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2 both equal to 1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. The question is asking for the joint probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -\u0127. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with coupled angular momentum states, the total state is a combination of the individual states. The given state is a total angular momentum state with l=2 and m=-1. The individual angular momenta are l1=1 and l2=1. \n\nThe key here is to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1 m1, l2 m2>. Because the measurements of L1z and L2z correspond to the m1 and m2 values. The joint probability would be the square of the coefficient of the term where m1 = m2 = -1, since each contributes -\u0127. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The m value for the total angular momentum is the sum of m1 and m2. So, for the total m to be -1, the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. But we want both m1 and m2 to be -\u0127, so each m1 and m2 would be -1 (since m is in units of \u0127). So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 would give m_total = -2. But the given m is -1, so that combination isn't part of this state. Wait, that might be the key here. \n\nHold on, the total m is the sum of m1 and m2. The state given has m = -1. So the possible m1 and m2 combinations must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, -2) but wait, since each electron is in a p orbital (l=1), their m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and (0, -1 ). Because m1 and m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So the combination where both are -1 would give a total m of -2, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the term with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is not present in this state. Hence, the coefficient for that term is zero, so the probability is zero?\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recall how to expand the coupled states into the uncoupled basis. The state |l1 l2 l m> is a linear combination of |l1 m1, l2 m2> where m1 + m2 = m. So in this case, m is -1, so all the terms in the expansion must have m1 + m2 = -1. So the only possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) or (0, -1). Since each electron's m can't be less than -l or more than +l. So there is no term where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the coefficient of such a term is zero, so the probability is zero. Hence the answer is D) 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to actually construct the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. Let me try that.\n\nThe state |1 1 2 -1> can be written as a combination of the uncoupled states. Let me think about how to compute that. \n\nThe total angular momentum states are built by combining the individual m values. Since l1 = l2 =1, and the total l is 2, m is -1. The possible m1 and m2 must add to m =-1.\n\nThe possible pairs for m1 and m2 are:\n\n- m1 = -1, m2 =0 \u2192 sum -1\n\n- m1 =0, m2 =-1 \u2192 sum -1\n\nAre there others? m1 can be 1, but then m2 would have to be -2, which isn't possible. Similarly, m2=1 would require m1=-2, which is impossible. So only those two terms.\n\nTherefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |1 -1,1 0> and |1 0,1 -1>. Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. \n\nThe general form for |l1 l2 l m> is a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m, with coefficients depending on the angular momentum coupling. \n\nI think for the case of l1 = l2 =1 and l=2, m=-1, the expansion would be something like:\n\n|1 1 2 -1> = C1 |1 -1, 1 0> + C2 |1 0,1 -1>\n\nWe can look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Alternatively, recall that when coupling two angular momenta, the coefficients can be found using recursion relations or known tables. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the steps to construct the states. \n\nFirst, the maximum m for l=2 is 2. The state |2,2> is just |1,1;1,1> because the maximum m1 and m2 would be +1 each, so their sum is +2. \n\nThen, the next state |2,1> would be a combination of the states where m1 + m2 =1. The possible pairs are (1,0), (0,1). The coefficients here would be such that when you lower the angular momentum, you get the right coefficients. \n\nContinuing down, the state |2,0> would have m1 + m2 =0, so pairs (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1). \n\nThe state |2,-1> would be the conjugate of |2,1>, so similar coefficients with some sign changes. \n\nBut here, we need |2,-1>. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=l2=1 and l=2, m=-1. \n\nThe coefficients can be found as follows. For the state |l1 l2 l m> = |1 1 2 -1>, the components are the possible m1 and m2 pairs adding to -1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the term |1 -1,1 0> in this state would be sqrt[( (l + l1 - l2)! (l + l2 - l1)! (l1 + l2 - l)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 + l +1)! ) ) ] times some factors. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for two p electrons (l1=l2=1), the triplet and singlet states. Wait, but here we are considering orbital angular momentum, not spin. \n\nAlternatively, let me look for a standard result. \n\nWait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. \n\nLooking up (or recalling) that the coefficients for the state |2, -1> would be:\n\nThe state is a combination of the basis states with m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nLet me consider the possible terms:\n\nThe coefficients can be determined by the requirement that the states are orthogonal to other states in the basis. \n\nAlternatively, here's a way to think: the state |2, -1> is the same as the state obtained by applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to the state |2,0> once, but I might need to normalize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use symmetry. Let me think of the state when l=2, m=-1. The possible components:\n\nThe pair (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). Let me suppose that the coefficients for these are equal. Since the system is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons (since they are in the same orbital angular momentum state?), but wait, orbital angular momentum states can be symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the coupling. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange only if the total angular momentum is even? Not sure. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the state must be symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, the orbital angular momentum states don't have to be symmetric or antisymmetric because electrons are fermions, but here we are ignoring spin. Wait, the question says \"ignoring their spin angular momentum\". So the problem is considering only the orbital angular momentum part, so the state could be symmetric or antisymmetric in the orbital part. But the question is about the coupled angular momentum state. The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific angular momentum state, which is a combination of the uncoupled states. \n\nAssuming that the coefficients for the two terms are equal, then the expansion would be something like:\n\n|2, -1> = (1/\u221a2)[ |1 -1,1 0> + |1 0,1 -1> ]\n\nBut is that correct? Let me check with another approach. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1 1 2 -1> when expressed as |1 m1, 1 m2> with m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nLet me look up a standard Clebsch-Gordan table. \n\nWait, I think the coefficients are as follows (from standard tables):\n\nFor l1 =1, l2=1, l=2, m =-1:\n\nThe state |2, -1> is a combination of the basis states where m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nThe coefficients are:\n\nFor m1 = -1, m2 =0: coefficient is sqrt(2/3)\n\nWait, no, perhaps let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, here's a way to calculate it using the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nThe general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m> can be found using recursion relations. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for the case of two angular momenta each of 1, the possible total l values are 0,1,2. The state with l=2, m=-1 is part of the triplet (since 2 is the maximum, so it's a triplet? Wait, no, triplet is for spin, but here the orbital angular momentum coupling. The total l can be 0,1,2. \n\nThe coefficients for the state |2, m> can be constructed as follows. \n\nThe highest m state is |2,2> = |1 1> (since m1=1 and m2=1). \n\nThen, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- on |2,2>, we get sqrt(2*(2+1) - (2)^2) |2,1> ?\n\nWait, maybe better to use the lowering operator. \n\nLet me compute L- |2,2> = sqrt(2*2)*(L1- + L2-) |2,2>. Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, let me refer to the standard expansion. \n\nI recall that for two electrons in p orbitals (l=1 each), the triplet (l=2) states are symmetric under exchange, and the singlet (l=0) is antisymmetric, but since we are dealing with orbital angular momentum, which is a bosonic quantity, the combination can be symmetric. \n\nBut regardless, focusing on the coefficients. \n\nSuppose that in the state |1 1 2 -1>, the expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = a |1 -1, 1 0> + b |1 0, 1 -1>\n\nTo find a and b, we can use normalization and the action of the lowering operator. \n\nAlternatively, since the state is part of the l=2 multiplet, which has states from m=2 down to m=-2. \n\nLet me think of the state |2,1>. The possible m1 and m2 pairs adding to +1 would be (1,0) and (0,1). So the state |2,1> would be a combination of those. Let's say:\n\n|2,1> = c |1 1, 1 0> + d |1 0, 1 1>\n\nBut the highest state is |2,2> which is |1 1;1 1>. So applying L- on that gives sqrt(2*(2+1))*(L1- |1 1> + L2- |1 1>) but perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the coefficients from a standard table. \n\nWait, here's a way to remember that for two p electrons (l1=l2=1), the total l=2 state with m=-1 is a combination of the two terms (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1) each with coefficient sqrt(1/2). Because the state must be symmetric under exchange since l=2 is the symmetric combination (since the orbital part can be symmetric). Wait, but the coefficients might have different factors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) each? Let me think of normalization. \n\nSuppose that the expansion is:\n\n|2, -1> = sqrt(2/3) |1 -1, 1 0> + sqrt(2/3) |1 0, 1 -1> ?\n\nWait, no, that would give a normalization of (2/3 + 2/3) = 4/3, which is over 1. So that's not right. \n\nWait, perhaps each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2). Then the total would be (1/\u221a2)^2 *2 = 1, so that works. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the state when you have two particles in the same angular momentum state. \n\nWait, the state |2, -1> must be symmetric under interchange of the two particles. So the coefficients for the terms |1 -1,1 0> and |1 0,1 -1> must be equal. So they have the same coefficient. Let me denote them as a and a. Then the normalization requires that |a|^2 + |a|^2 = 1, so 2a\u00b2=1 \u2192 a=1/\u221a2. \n\nSo then the expansion would be:\n\n|2, -1> = (1/\u221a2)|1 -1,1 0> + (1/\u221a2)|1 0,1 -1>\n\nTherefore, if that's correct, then the coefficients for each of those terms are 1/sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the term where both m1 and m2 are -1 is not present. Hence, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -\u0127 (which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero, since that term isn't in the expansion. \n\nTherefore the answer is D) 0. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check another approach. Suppose we have the state |2, -1>. The possible m1 and m2 pairs are those adding to -1. So the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). There's no term with (-1,-1) because their sum would be -2, which isn't the m here. Hence, the joint probability of measuring both as -\u0127 is zero. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer is D) 0.\n",

So that's not right. \n\nWait, perhaps each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2). Then the total would be (1/\u221a2)^2 *2 = 1, so that works. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the state when you have two particles in the same angular momentum state. \n\nWait, the state |2, -1> must be symmetric under interchange of the two particles. So the coefficients for the terms |1 -1,1 0> and |1 0,1 -1> must be equal. So they have the same coefficient. Let me denote them as a and a. Then the normalization requires that |a|^2 + |a|^2 = 1, so 2a\u00b2=1 \u2192 a=1/\u221a2. \n\nSo then the expansion would be:\n\n|2, -1> = (1/\u221a2)|1 -1,1 0> + (1/\u221a2)|1 0,1 -1>\n\nTherefore, if that's correct, then the coefficients for each of those terms are 1/sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the term where both m1 and m2 are -1 is not present. Hence, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -\u0127 (which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero, since that term isn't in the expansion. \n\nTherefore the answer is D) 0. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check another approach. Suppose we have the state |2, -1>. The possible m1 and m2 pairs are those adding to -1. So the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). There's no term with (-1,-1) because their sum would be -2, which isn't the m here. Hence, the joint probability of measuring both as -\u0127 is zero. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer is D) 0.\n\n\nThe given coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>, which represents two electrons with individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers \\( l_1 = 1 \\) and \\( l_2 = 1 \\), and total angular momentum \\( l = 2 \\) and \\( m = -1 \\). The total \\( m \\)-value is the sum of the individual \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) values. To have \\( L_{1z} = -\\hbar \\) and \\( L_{2z} = -\\hbar \\), the corresponding \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) values must both be \\(-1\\), which would sum to \\( m = -2 \\). However, the given state has \\( m = -1 \\), meaning no term in its expansion contains \\( m_1 = -1 \\) and \\( m_2 = -1 \\). The valid combinations for \\( m = -1 \\) are \\( (m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0) \\) and \\( (m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1) \\), neither of which includes both \\( m_1 = -1 \\) and \\( m_2 = -1 \\). Thus, the joint probability is zero.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the probability of measuring both electrons' orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z as -\u0127. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a result of combining the individual angular momenta l1 and l2 into a total angular momentum l. Here, each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, so their combined l can range from |1-1| to 1+1, so 0, 1, or 2. The given state has l=2 and m=-1. \n\nThe question is about the joint probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127. Since each electron's angular momentum is in an orbital state (ignoring spin), their z-components can be -l\u0127, ..., +l\u0127. For l=1, each can have m values of -1, 0, +1. \n\nBut the given state is a coupled state. To find the probability, I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1 m1, l2 m2>. The probability will be the square of the coefficient of the term where m1 and m2 are both -1, since L1z and L2z would each have eigenvalues -\u0127 in that term. \n\nLet me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta. The state |l1 l2; L M> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M. Here, M is -1, so m1 + m2 = -1. Since l1 and l2 are both 1, their m values can be -1, 0, +1. \n\nThe coefficients for the combined state with L=2 and M=-1. Let me think of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1. \n\nThe standard formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients might help here. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that for L=2, the maximum m is 2, so the highest state would be |1,1;2,2> = |1,1>1,1. Then, the next states are built by lowering the angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can list all possible combinations. Since L=2 and M=-1, the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. So possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1) but wait, m can't be -2 since l=1. So the possible pairs are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. Wait, but 0 + (-1) = -1, yes. Also, m1 could be -2? No, since each m can only be -1,0,+1. So only those two possibilities. \n\nWait, but let me check. The total m is m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs are:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm1 = -2, m2=1 \u2192 but m can't be -2 for l=1.\n\nSo the two terms. Now, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each of these terms in the state |1,1,2,-1>?\n\nI think the coefficients can be found using the formula. Let me recall that for L = l1 + l2, the maximum M is l1 + l2, so here L=2 is the maximum possible, so the state |2,2> is just |1,1> (since 1+1=2, m1=1 and m2=1). \n\nTo get the state |2,1>, we need combinations that sum to 1. Similarly, for |2,0>, etc. \n\nWait, maybe the state |2,-1> is constructed from the lower m terms. Let me see if I can find the expansion of |1,1;2,-1>.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a standard table or formula for these coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general approach is to build up the states by lowering from the highest state. \n\nStarting with |2,2> = |1,1;1,1> \u2192 so that's the first term. \n\nTo get |2,1>, we apply the lowering operator. But maybe that's getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the coefficients for the state |L=2, M=-1> when combining l1=1 and l2=1 are such that the coefficients for the two possible terms (m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1) are each sqrt(1/2). \n\nWait, let me think of symmetry. Since the total angular momentum is symmetric in some way? \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that when adding two angular momenta, the coefficients for the state with L = l1 + l2 (the maximum possible) will have coefficients only for the terms where m1 and m2 add up to L. But when L is less than that, the coefficients are more involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nThe possible terms are | -1,0> and |0, -1>. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these terms in the |2,-1> state. \n\nI think that in the case of L=2, the coefficients for the states with the highest possible M (like M=2 here) are straightforward, but for lower M, perhaps we need to consider the coefficients. \n\nWait, here's a way to think about it. The state |l1,l2; L,M> is built by combining the individual states such that the total M is the sum of the m's. The coefficients are determined by orthogonality and normalization. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that when adding two angular momenta with l1 = l2 =1, the state with L=2 and M=-1 is a symmetric combination? \n\nWait, let me think of the possible m1 and m2 for the given L and M. \n\nThe state |2,-1> must be a linear combination of |m1,m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1). \n\nSo the state would be a combination of those two terms. Let me denote the coefficients as C1 and C2 for each term respectively. \n\nThe coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nLooking up or recalling the formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1:\n\nThe general formula might be a bit complex, but perhaps I can use the fact that the state must be symmetric or antisymmetric? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient table. \n\nWait, let me try to recall that when combining two angular momenta, the coefficients for the states with L = l1 + l2 (the maximum L) are such that each m1 and m2 are aligned. For L=2, the maximum M is 2, which is |1,1>. \n\nThe next state, M=1, would be a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, with coefficients sqrt(1/2). \n\nWait, but for M=1 in L=2, perhaps the combination is (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2). \n\nThen for M=0, the combination would involve terms like |1,-1>, |0,0>, |-1,1>, but perhaps more terms. \n\nWait, but for our case, M is -1. Let me see:\n\nThe state |2, -1> would be a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So the two terms are |-1,0> and |0,-1>. \n\nThe coefficients for these terms in the |2, -1> state would be equal? \n\nWait, but let me think of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The CG coefficient for |l1 m1; l2 m2> in |L M> is given by certain rules. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients for |1,1;2,-1> would be such that when you lower the angular momentum from the highest state. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the state |2,-1> is formed by applying the lowering operator L- once to |2,0>, but that might not directly help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula from a table. \n\nLooking it up in my mind (since I can't actually look it up now), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 particles to L=2, M=-1 would have the coefficients for the terms |-1,0> and |0,-1> each with a coefficient of sqrt(1/2). Because when adding two angular momenta, symmetric combinations for the same L. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014if the coefficients for both terms are the same, then the state would be ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> is ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nThen, the square of each coefficient is 1/2. \n\nBut the question is the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -\u0127. That would correspond to the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Wait, hold on, wait a second. Wait, m1 + m2 must equal M = -1. But if m1 and m2 are both -1, their sum would be -2, which is less than -1. So that term isn't part of the state. \n\nOh! Wait, that's a key point. The given state has M = -1, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. Therefore, the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the term where both are -1 isn't part of this state. \n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -\u0127 (i.e., m1 = -1, m2 = -1) would have zero probability, since that term isn't present in the expansion. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 0. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -\u0127. Since each Lz has eigenvalues m\u0127, so -\u0127 corresponds to m = -1. So both m1 and m2 being -1 would give L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127. But in the state |2, -1>, the sum m1 + m2 = -1. So the only possible combinations are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) or (0, -1). The combination (-1, -1) would sum to -2, which is not allowed here. \n\nTherefore, there is no component in the given state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Thus, the probability is zero. \n\nSo the correct answer should be D) 0. \n\nHmm, but I should make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me think again. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which is the coupled state. The expansion into uncoupled states must only have terms where m1 + m2 = -1. Since the term with m1=-1 and m2=-1 sums to -2, which is not the case here, that term can't be present. Therefore, the probability is zero. \n\nYes, so the answer is D.\n",

The given state has l=2 and m=-1. \n\nThe question is about the joint probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127. Since each electron's angular momentum is in an orbital state (ignoring spin), their z-components can be -l\u0127, ..., +l\u0127. For l=1, each can have m values of -1, 0, +1. \n\nBut the given state is a coupled state. To find the probability, I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1 m1, l2 m2>. The probability will be the square of the coefficient of the term where m1 and m2 are both -1, since L1z and L2z would each have eigenvalues -\u0127 in that term. \n\nLet me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two angular momenta.
