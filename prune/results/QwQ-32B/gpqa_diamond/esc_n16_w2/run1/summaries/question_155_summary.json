      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty \u0394P_z for a system in a specific eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula \u0394A = sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then plug them into this formula.\n\nFirst, let me recall the given information. The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The state vector is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2]. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127 on the diagonal. Wait, the problem says first row (\u0127, 0,0), second row (0,0,0), third (0,0,-\u0127). So the eigenvalues of P_z in this basis are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors, so each basis vector corresponds to those eigenvalues. \n\nThe state is given in this basis, so the components of the state vector are the coefficients in terms of the P_z eigenbasis. \n\nThe uncertainty in P_z is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to compute both \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let me write down the state vector as a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2 , 1/\u221a2 , -1/2 ]^T.\n\nWait, the entries are -1/2, 1 over root 2, and -1/2. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is (-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1). So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute the expectation value. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, this is straightforward. The expectation value is the sum over each basis component's coefficient squared multiplied by the eigenvalue for that component.\n\nLet me denote the basis vectors as |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9, |3\u27e9, corresponding to the three rows. The eigenvalues for P_z are:\n\nP_z |1\u27e9 = \u0127 |1\u27e9,\n\nP_z |2\u27e9 = 0 * |2\u27e9,\n\nP_z |3\u27e9 = -\u0127 |3\u27e9.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, -\u0127 for the first, second, third basis vectors respectively.\n\nThe state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n\u03c8 = (-1/2)|1\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|2\u27e9 + (-1/2)|3\u27e9.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is:\n\n\u03c8* P_z \u03c8 = [ (-1/2)^2 * \u0127 ] + [ (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 ] + [ (-1/2)^2 * (-\u0127) ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the expectation value is the sum of (coefficient_i)^2 times eigenvalue_i. Because when the operator is diagonal, the expectation is just the sum of |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: |(-1/2)|\u00b2 * \u0127 = (1/4) * \u0127.\n\nSecond term: |(1/\u221a2)|\u00b2 * 0 = (1/2) * 0 = 0.\n\nThird term: |(-1/2)|\u00b2 * (-\u0127) = (1/4)*(-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nAdding them together: (1/4 \u0127) + 0 - (1/4 \u0127) = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold on. Wait, the third term's eigenvalue is -\u0127, so the third term is (1/4)*(-\u0127). So adding 1/4 \u0127 and -1/4 \u0127 gives zero. The second term is zero. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0?\n\nHmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using matrix multiplication. Let me try that way. The expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8 | P_z | \u03c8\u27e9. \n\nThe state vector is a column vector: [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. The conjugate transpose (bra vector) is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] (since all entries are real here). \n\nThe matrix P_z is diagonal with entries [\u0127, 0, -\u0127]. So multiplying P_z with |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nP_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ \u0127*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), -\u0127*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8 | P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the dot product of the bra vector and this result:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(\u0127/2) = \u0127/4 (Wait, (-1/2) times (-\u0127/2) is (1/2 * \u0127/2) = \u0127/4? Wait no, (-1/2)*(-\u0127/2) = (1/2 * \u0127/2) = \u0127/4. Yes.\n\nSecond term is zero.\n\nThird term: (-1/2)*(\u0127/2) = - \u0127/4.\n\nAdding them together: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0. So indeed, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0. \n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the average value is zero. \n\nNow, let's compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Again, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will also be diagonal with entries (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2. So the diagonal entries are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nThus, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of |c_i|\u00b2 times (eigenvalue_i)^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/4) * (\u0127)^2,\n\nSecond term: (1/2) * 0^2 = 0,\n\nThird term: (1/4)*( (-\u0127)^2 ) = (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2.\n\nAdding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, using the matrix method: \n\nP_z squared matrix is diag(\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2). So when you compute \u27e8\u03c8 | P_z\u00b2 | \u03c8\u27e9, it's the same as the first component squared times \u0127\u00b2 plus the third component squared times \u0127\u00b2, plus the second component squared times zero. \n\nSo that would be ( (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 ) + ( (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * \u0127\u00b2 ) \n\nWhich is (1/4 + 1/4)\u0127\u00b2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nSo \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2, and \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is 0. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2 ) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nWait, that would be option B. But wait, let me confirm once more. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) sqrt(2)\u0127,\n\nB) \u0127/sqrt(2),\n\nC) \u0127/2,\n\nD) \u0127.\n\nSo according to this calculation, the answer should be B. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the components. Let me check the state vector again. The problem states the state vector is a column with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So yes, the coefficients for |1\u27e9 and |3\u27e9 are each -1/2. \n\nThe squared terms for those components are ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4 each. So each contributes to the first and third terms. The second component squared is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. \n\nWait, but the eigenvalues for the third basis vector is -\u0127, so when squaring, it's ( (-\u0127)^2 ), so that term is correct. \n\nTherefore, the variance is (1/2 \u0127\u00b2 ), so the square root is (\u0127)/sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore the answer should be option B. \n\nHmm, but let me think again why the expectation value is zero. Since the state is symmetric in some way between the first and third basis vectors. Because the coefficients for |1\u27e9 and |3\u27e9 are both -1/2, but their eigenvalues are \u0127 and -\u0127. So their contributions to \u27e8P_z\u27e9 cancel each other out, leading to zero. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty calculation is correct. So I think the answer is B.\n",

The given state is already expressed in this basis. The matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries (\u0127, 0, -\u0127). So the eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.\n\nThe state vector is a column vector: \n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. \n\nWait, I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute the sum of squares of the absolute values of the components:\n\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4 =1. Okay, it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to take the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9, multiply by the P_z matrix, then multiply by |\u03c8\u27e9 again. Since the state is real (no imaginary parts?), the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me write it out.\n\nFirst, the P_z matrix is:\n\n[ \u0127   0    0    ]\n[ 0   0    0    ]\n[ 0   0   -\u0127    ]\n\nSo when I multiply P_z by |\u03c8\u27e9, I get:\n\nFirst component: \u0127*(-1/2)\nSecond component: 0*(1/\u221a2) = 0\nThird component: -\u0127*(-1/2) = (\u0127/2)\n\nSo the result of P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the vector [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of the original state with this result. Let me compute that:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u0127/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(\u0127/2) \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2 * \u0127/2) = \u0127/4 \n\nThird term: (-1/2)*(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4 \n\nThe middle term is 0. So total is \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0. Wait, so \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero? That's interesting. \n\nHmm, that's unexpected. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the first component of P_z |\u03c8> is \u0127*(-1/2) = -\u0127/2. Then the inner product with the first component of |\u03c8> which is -1/2. So (-1/2) * (-\u0127/2) is indeed \u0127/4. The third component of P_z|\u03c8> is (\u0127/2) and the third component of |\u03c8> is -1/2. So multiplying those gives (\u0127/2)*(-1/2) = -\u0127/4. Adding those gives \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 =0. The middle term is 0. So yes, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero. Okay.\n\nNow, moving on to \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal entries. So the matrix for P_z squared would be:\n\n[ \u0127\u00b2   0    0    ]\n[ 0    0    0    ]\n[ 0    0    \u0127\u00b2   ]\n\nWait, because the original P_z had entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127. Squaring each gives (\u0127)^2, 0, (-\u0127)^2 which is \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2. So P_z squared matrix is as above.\n\nSo then, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the expectation value of this matrix with the given state. Let's compute that.\n\nMultiply P_z squared matrix by |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nFirst component: \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2)\nSecond component: 0*(1/\u221a2) =0\nThird component: \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2)\n\nSo the result is [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, take the inner product with the original state vector:\n\n(-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-\u0127\u00b2/2 )\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2)*(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4 \n\nThird term: (1/2)*(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/4 \n\nSo total is \u0127\u00b2/4 + \u0127\u00b2/4 = \u0127\u00b2/2. \n\nTherefore \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (\u0127\u00b2/2) - (0)^2 = \u0127\u00b2/2. \n\nSo the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nLooking at the options, B is \u0127/\u221a2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything once again. \n\nWait, the calculation of \u27e8P_z\u27e9 was zero. That's correct because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, and since P_x and P_z don't commute, their expectation values can be different. Also, the given state is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, but that doesn't mean it's an eigenstate of P_z. \n\nThe components of the state in the P_z basis are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The expectation of P_z is indeed the sum over (probability * eigenvalue). Let's see another way:\n\nThe probabilities for each basis vector (eigenvectors of P_z) are the squares of the absolute values of the components. \n\nFirst component: | -1/2 |\u00b2 = 1/4, eigenvalue \u0127 \u2192 contribution (1/4)*\u0127\n\nSecond component: |1/\u221a2|\u00b2 = 1/2, eigenvalue 0 \u2192 0\n\nThird component: | -1/2 |\u00b2 = 1/4, eigenvalue -\u0127 \u2192 (1/4)*(-\u0127)\n\nAdding those: (1/4 \u0127) + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) = 0. Yep, same as before. \n\nFor the \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, each term would be the probability times (eigenvalue)^2. \n\nFirst term: 1/4 * (\u0127)^2 \n\nSecond term: 1/2 * 0^2 =0\n\nThird term: 1/4 * (-\u0127)^2 =1/4 * \u0127\u00b2\n\nTotal is (1/4 + 1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2, which matches. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty is sqrt( (\u0127\u00b2/2) -0 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So option B.\n",
