      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, the options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, the relative speed part. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is v = (u + v')/(1 + (uv')/c\u00b2), right? Wait, but here, since both are moving in the same direction, maybe their relative speed would be the difference divided by something? Wait, no, actually, relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the relative velocity of one astronaut as seen from the other would require using the velocity addition formula. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut B's frame, what is astronaut A's speed? Wait, no, maybe I need to consider one frame as the reference. Alternatively, since they're both moving in the same direction, their relative speed in the lab frame (if we're considering the frame where both are moving) might not be straightforward. Wait, the question says \"relative speed\" of the two astronauts. So the relative speed between them would be how fast one is moving relative to the other. \n\nRight, so in relativity, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed (as observed from one of their frames) is calculated using the formula. Let me get the formula straight. Suppose we have two objects moving in the same direction with speeds u and v (both in the lab frame). The speed of one relative to the other is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). Wait, that's when you want to find the velocity of one object in the rest frame of the other. Because in the frame of the second object (say, the one moving at v), the first object's speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). \n\nSo here, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let's say astronaut 1 (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 (3m) at 0.5c. So from astronaut 2's frame, astronaut 1's speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D's first part. So that would narrow it down to C or D.\n\nNow the second part is total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of their individual relativistic energies. Since they are moving in the same direction, their momenta add, but energy is just the sum of each energy. So each astronaut's energy is gamma*m*c\u00b2, right?\n\nSo for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)). Let's compute gamma for each.\n\nFirst, for the first astronaut (0.6c):\n\nv1 = 0.6c. So (v1/c)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nThus, energy E1 = gamma1 * m1 * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut (0.5c, mass 3m):\n\nv2 = 0.5c. (v2/c)^2 = 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 = 1/0.866 \u2248 1.1547.\n\nThen E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3 m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. So that's approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. So looking at the options, that matches option C's energy (5.96 mc\u00b2) and the relative speed 0.14c. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me recalculate the gamma for the second astronaut more precisely. \n\nGamma2 is 1 divided by sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660254. So 1 divided by that is 2/sqrt(3) \u2248 1.1547005. So 1.1547 * 3 is exactly 3.4641. So E1 is 2.5, E2 is 3.4641. Sum is 5.9641, so yes, 5.96 when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C: v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2. \n\nLooking at the options, option C has both those numbers. Option D has E=5mc\u00b2, which is less, so that's not correct. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the relative velocity again. The formula was (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer must be option C.\n",

Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each with different values for relative speed and energy. Alright, first step is to tackle each part separately: the relative velocity and the total energy.\n\nStarting with the relative speed. The question says both are moving in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're going the same direction? But one is faster than the other. The astronaut with mass 2m is moving at 0.6c, and the other (3m) at 0.5c. Since they're in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference between their velocities? Like, 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, that's in classical physics.

But at relativistic speeds, the formula might be different. Hmm, actually, the relative velocity of one object as observed from the other's frame is given by the velocity subtraction formula. Let me recall the formula: If an object is moving at velocity u in the lab frame, and another at velocity v, then the velocity of the first as seen from the second's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c\u00b2). But here, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c\u00b2). Wait, but the question is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So which one's frame are we considering?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify from which frame. Hmm. Maybe the question is asking for the relative speed in the lab frame? But that doesn't make sense because in the lab frame, their relative speed would just be 0.1c. But since the options have other numbers like 0.14c, that must not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the relative speed here refers to the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's rest frame. So, for example, if astronaut A (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B (3m) at 0.5c, then from B's frame, A's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c\u00b2) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D's velocity. So the relative speed would be about 0.14c. So the first part of the answer must be either C or D.\n\nNow moving on to the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, we have to compute their gamma factor, multiply by their mass and c squared, then add them together.\n\nLet's compute each gamma. \n\nFirst astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. The gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). For 0.6c, v/c = 0.6. So (v/c)^2 = 0.36. Therefore, 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. Thus gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. \n\nSo energy for the first astronaut is gamma * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v/c is 0.5, so (v/c)^2 = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. Thus gamma is 1 / 0.866 \u2248 1.1547.\n\nSo energy for the second astronaut is 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2. Let me compute that: 3 * 1.1547 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 \u2248 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So that would be approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, that matches option C (0.14c and 5.96 mc\u00b2) and option B has 4.96 which is lower, so probably C is correct. Wait, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the second astronaut's gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, so 1 divided by that is 2/sqrt(3) \u2248 1.1547. So 1.1547 multiplied by 3 gives 3.4641. Then 2.5 + 3.4641 is indeed approximately 5.9641, so 5.96 m c\u00b2. So that's the total energy. \n\nLooking back at the options, the only one with 0.14c and ~5.96 mc\u00b2 is option C. So the answer should be C. Let me check the other options again.\n\nOption B says 0.1c and 4.96, which can't be right because the relative speed calculation using the relativistic formula gives 0.14c. Option D has 0.14c but the energy is 5mc\u00b2, which is less than our calculated value. Option A is way off with 1.1c which exceeds c, which is impossible. So the correct answer must be C.\n",

Thus gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. \n\nSo energy for the first astronaut is gamma * 2m * c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v/c is 0.5, so (v/c)^2 = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. Thus gamma is 1 / 0.866 \u2248 1.1547.\n\nSo energy for the second astronaut is 1.1547 * 3m c\u00b2. Let me compute that: 3 * 1.1547 \u2248 3.4641 m c\u00b2.\n\nAdding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 \u2248 5.9641 m c\u00b2. So that would be approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. Looking at the options, that matches option C (0.14c and 5.96 mc\u00b2) and option B has 4.96 which is lower, so probably C is correct. Wait, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the second astronaut's gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, so 1 divided by that is 2/sqrt(3) \u2248 1.1547. So 1.1547 multiplied by 3 gives 3.4641. Then 2.5 + 3.4641 is indeed approximately 5.9641, so 5.96 m c\u00b2. So that's the total energy. \n\nLooking back at the options, the only one with 0.14c and ~5.96 mc\u00b2 is option C. So the answer should be C. Let me check the other options again.\n\nOption B says 0.1c and 4.96, which can't be right because the relative speed calculation using the relativistic formula gives 0.14c. Option D has 0.14c but the energy is 5mc\u00b2, which is less than our calculated value. Option A is way off with 1.1c which exceeds c, which is impossible. So the correct answer must be C.\n\n\nTo determine the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula since they are moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction. The relative speed of the faster astronaut (0.6c) as observed from the slower astronaut's (0.5c) rest frame is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.14c\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total energy of the system by summing the relativistic energies of both astronauts. For the first astronaut (mass \\(2m\\), speed \\(0.6c\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\n\\]\n\\[\nE_1 = \\gamma_1 \\cdot 2m \\cdot c^2 = 1.25 \\cdot 2m \\cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\n\\]\n\nFor the second astronaut (mass \\(3m\\), speed \\(0.5c\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547\n\\]\n\\[\nE_2 = \\gamma_2 \\cdot 3m \\cdot c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\cdot 3m \\cdot c^2 \\approx 3.464mc^2\n\\]\n\nAdding these energies gives the total energy:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \\approx 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \\approx 5.96mc^2\n\\]\n\nThe only option matching both results is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
