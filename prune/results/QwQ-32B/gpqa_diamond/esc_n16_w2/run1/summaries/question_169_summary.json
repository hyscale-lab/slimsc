      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about nuclear decay processes and how changing the emitted particles affects the energy spectrum of the E particles. Alright, let's start by understanding the original decay and then the variant.\n\nThe original reaction is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V. The problem states that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint Q. Now, when they change the decay to emit one exotic massless particle M instead of the 2V, so the new reaction would be 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. Wait, but the original had two V particles. So replacing two V (which are probably neutrinos, maybe?) with one M. Since M is massless, like a photon or another neutrino? But the key here is that in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. \n\nFirst, I remember that in beta decay, the electron (beta particle) has a continuous spectrum up to a maximum energy because the energy is shared between the electron and the neutrino. The neutrino's energy would then take the remaining. Since the neutrino is very light (or massless, like in the original theory), it carries away some energy. If the number of particles changes, the available energy for the other particles might change, affecting the endpoint.\n\nIn the original case, with two E and two V particles, the total energy available (Q value) is fixed. The E particles can have varying energies because their energy is shared with the V particles. Since V is light, their kinetic energy can vary, allowing E to have a continuous spread. \n\nNow, in the variant, they replace the two V with one M. Since M is massless, like a photon or another neutrino? Let's see. The total number of particles emitted changes. Let me think about the Q value. The Q value is the total energy released in the decay. The endpoint of the E spectrum in the original case is when all the available energy goes to an E particle, but since there are two E and two V, maybe the maximum energy for an E would depend on how the energy is shared. Wait, actually, in beta decay, the maximum energy of the electron is when the neutrino takes zero energy, but since neutrinos have to have some, but if they are massless, they must carry some momentum. Wait, maybe the endpoint Q in the original case is the total Q value of the reaction. The endpoint is the maximum possible energy any single E could have, but since there are two E's and two V's, perhaps the total energy of all the E's would be part of the Q. Wait, the question says the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous with some endpoint. Hmm, maybe the total energy of all E particles can't exceed Q, so the maximum total energy for E would be Q minus the energy carried away by the V particles. Wait, but maybe the total energy available (the Q value) is fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Q value here is the total energy released in the decay. So in the original decay, the two E and two V particles must share this Q. The E's can have varying energies, so their individual energies can vary, but the total energy of all E and V is Q. Since the V particles are light (or massless), their kinetic energy can take up some of the Q, allowing the E particles to have a continuous distribution. The endpoint for the E's would be when one E takes as much as possible, but since there are two E's, maybe the maximum energy per E is Q divided by 2? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. In beta decay, the maximum energy of the electron is when the neutrino takes the least possible energy (zero, but actually, due to conservation of momentum, the minimum is non-zero, but in the problem here, maybe they're simplifying). The total Q is fixed. So in the original case, each E's energy can vary, but the sum of energies of E and V particles must equal Q. Since there are two Vs and two Es, the possible energies would be distributed among them. The continuous spectrum comes from the fact that the energy can be split in many ways between the particles. \n\nNow, in the variant, instead of two V particles, there's one M. Since M is massless, it must carry energy and momentum as well. So the total energy now is distributed between the two E particles and the single M. The Q value (total energy released) should be the same as before because the nuclear transition energy is fixed, right? Wait, the Q value is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei. So if the reaction changes the particles emitted, does the Q value change? Wait, the question says that in the variant, the decay is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. The original had 2V instead of M. So the mass of the final particles (B, E, and V or M) would affect the Q value. Because Q is (mass_initial - mass_final) times c\u00b2. So if replacing two V particles (each with mass mV) with one M (massless), then the mass of the final products would be different. Let me see. \n\nOriginal decay: 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V. The mass of the final particles would be 2(m_B) + 2(m_E) + 2(m_V). \n\nVariant: 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. Since M is massless, its mass is zero. So the final mass is 2(m_B) + 2(m_E). \n\nAssuming that the initial mass (2A) is the same, the Q value (mass difference) would now be higher. Because the final mass is lower (since we removed two V masses). So the Q value (energy released) would be larger in the variant. \n\nWait, Q is (mass_initial - mass_final) * c\u00b2. So if the final mass is less (because we removed the mass of the two V particles), then the Q value increases. So the total energy available (Q) is now higher. Therefore, the maximum energy that the E particles can have would be higher. \n\nBut how does this affect the spectrum? The original had two E particles and two V, so the energy distribution is among four particles. The variant has two E and one M (massless). So three particles. Since M is massless, it must carry some energy. Let's think of the possible energy distributions. \n\nIn the original decay, the two V particles can take any amount of energy (as they are light), allowing the E's to have a continuous spectrum up to some maximum. The maximum would be when the other particles take the minimum possible. For the E's, the maximum energy any single E can have would depend on how the energy is split. But the question mentions the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles. Wait, maybe it's the total energy of all E particles. Wait, the wording says \"total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles\". Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps it's the energy spectrum of each E particle, but the question says \"total energy spectrum\", maybe meaning the distribution of energies for each E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total energy of all E particles. But in the original case, the total energy of the E's plus the V's equals Q. So the total energy of the E's can vary, so their individual energies can vary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to beta decay, where the electron's energy spectrum is continuous because the neutrino shares the energy. Here, in the original, with two V's, the two E's can have their energies distributed in a way that allows a continuous spectrum. The endpoint (maximum possible energy for an E) would be when the other particles take the minimum possible energy. But since there are two V's and two E's, the maximum energy for any one E might be when the other E and the two V's take as little as possible. Since V's are massless, their minimum energy is when they have momentum but zero rest mass. But maybe the minimum energy they can have is determined by conservation laws. \n\nAlternatively, the endpoint Q in the original is the maximum possible energy for an E particle. But in the variant, since the Q value (total energy available) is higher, the maximum energy (endpoint) would be higher. But also, the number of particles that can take energy away has changed. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's model it. \n\nSuppose the original decay has two E and two V. The total energy available (Q) is fixed. The energy of each E can vary, but the sum of all E and V's energies must equal Q. So each E's energy is between 0 and some maximum. The maximum possible energy for an E would be when the other E and the two V's take as little as possible. Since V's are massless, they can have zero energy only if their momentum is zero, but due to conservation of momentum, their momenta must add up with the others to zero. So it's complicated. But in the continuous spectrum, the maximum energy for an E would be when the other particles take the minimal possible energy. \n\nAlternatively, the total energy of all E particles can go up to Q minus the minimum energy carried by the V's. Since the V's can take very little energy (since they are light), the maximum total energy for E would approach Q. But since there are two E's, each can have up to nearly Q (but not exactly because the other particles need some energy). \n\nIn the variant, replacing two V's with one M (massless). So now the final particles are 2E and 1M. The total energy available is now higher because the mass of the final state is less. So the new Q' (Q prime) would be higher than the original Q. Let's say Q' = Q + 2mV c\u00b2 (since the mass of the two V's is now not present in the final state, so the mass difference is larger). Therefore, the maximum energy that the E particles can have would be higher. \n\nAdditionally, the number of particles that can take energy away is now three (two E and one M) instead of four (two E and two V). So the energy has to be divided between three particles instead of four. Since there's one less particle to share the energy, each E could potentially have a higher maximum. \n\nWait, but how does the number of particles affect the endpoint? Let's think of the maximum possible energy for an E. Suppose in the variant, to maximize the energy of one E, the other E and the M must take as little as possible. Since M is massless, it can take minimal energy (like a photon, which must have at least some energy to carry momentum). But the minimal energy for M would be when its momentum is as small as possible, but considering conservation laws. \n\nAssuming that the minimal energy taken by the other particles (the other E and M) is negligible, then the maximum energy for one E would be Q', which is higher than Q. So the endpoint increases. \n\nThe question is, does the spectrum remain continuous? Well, in the original case, the spectrum is continuous because the energy can be shared in various ways between the E and V particles. In the variant, since there's still at least one other particle (the M and the other E) that can take varying amounts of energy, the E particles can still have a continuous distribution of energies. The presence of another particle (the M) allows for continuous sharing. So the spectrum remains continuous but with an adjusted shape (since the number of particles changed) and the endpoint increases because Q' is larger. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option B says the endpoint increases, which aligns with Q' being higher. Option D says the endpoint decreases. So I think B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a scenario where the endpoint decreases? Hmm, no, because the total energy available (Q') is higher. The maximum energy possible for the E particles would be higher. \n\nAnother angle: In beta decay, when you have more particles (like adding another neutrino), the maximum energy of the electron would decrease because there are more particles to share the energy. Here, replacing two neutrinos (V) with one M (another massless particle), so instead of two particles taking energy away, now it's one. So that's one less particle to share the energy. So the maximum energy available for E increases. So the endpoint (max possible energy) increases. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the spectrum remains continuous (since there are still multiple particles to share energy), the shape changes (because the number of particles changed), and the endpoint increases. So answer B.\n",

The Q value (total energy released) should be the same as before because the nuclear transition energy is fixed, right?

Wait, the question says that in the variant, the decay is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. The original had 2V instead of M. So the mass of the final particles (B, E, and V or M) would affect the Q value.

So the final mass is 2(m_B) + 2(m_E). \n\nAssuming that the initial mass (2A) is the same, the Q value (mass difference) would now be higher. Because the final mass is lower (since we removed two V masses). So the Q value (energy released) would be larger in the variant. \n\nWait, Q is (mass_initial - mass_final) * c\u00b2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes when the decay process emits an exotic massless particle M instead of the two V particles. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts about particle decay and energy spectra.\n\nThe original reaction is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V. The problem states that the energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q. A continuous spectrum usually suggests that the decay process allows the emitted particles to take on a range of energies, up to some maximum. The endpoint Q would be the maximum possible energy any E particle can have in this decay. \n\nNow, in the modified decay, they replace the two V particles with one M. Since M is massless, its energy would be entirely kinetic, right? Because massless particles (like photons or neutrinos) have energy equal to their momentum (E = pc). \n\nThe key here is understanding how the presence of different numbers of particles in the final state affects the available energy for the E particles. In the original decay, there are two V particles and two E particles. When replacing two V particles with one M, the number of final particles changes. Since M is massless, it might carry away some energy that the Vs previously did, but since there's only one M instead of two Vs, maybe the total energy available for E changes?\n\nWait, but the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value) might be different now. The original Q-value is the total energy available, which determines the endpoint of the E's spectrum. The Q-value is calculated based on the mass difference between the initial and final particles. Let's think about that. \n\nThe original decay's Q-value would be the mass difference between the initial (2A) and the final products (2B + 2E + 2V). The maximum energy for E (the endpoint Q) comes from when all the available energy goes into the E particles. But in reality, the energy has to be shared among all the emitted particles. \n\nWhen replacing 2V with 1M, the total mass of the final state changes. Let's see: the mass of the Vs would have contributed to the total mass of the products, but since M is massless, the total mass of the final state might be less. Wait, actually, the mass of the initial and final nuclei must be considered here. The Q-value is (mass_initial - mass_final) * c\u00b2. \n\nWait, perhaps the Q-value for the modified decay is different. Let me think. Let's denote the mass of A as m_A, B as m_B, E as m_E (assuming E is a particle with some mass, but since they are \"much lighter\" than the nucleons, maybe their mass is negligible?), but the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B. So the mass of E and V can be considered negligible compared to the nucleons. \n\nAssuming that the masses of E and V are negligible (since they are much lighter than A and B), then the original decay's Q-value would be Q_original = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c\u00b2. But if their masses are negligible, then that term is approximately 2(m_A - m_B). \n\nIn the modified decay, the reaction is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. So the mass of the final state would be 2m_B + 2m_E + 0 (since M is massless). So the Q-value here would be Q_modified = 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). Wait, but since the original had 2V particles, which were also negligible, perhaps the difference is that in the original, the mass of the final state was 2m_B + 2m_E + 2m_V, but since m_V is negligible, the original Q is 2(m_A - m_B - m_E - m_V) \u2248 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). But the modified decay has 2B + 2E + M, so the mass is 2m_B + 2m_E, so Q_modified is 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). Wait, that would mean that the Q-value for the modified decay is actually higher than the original? Because the original had 2m_V added in the denominator? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think again. Let me define it more precisely. Let me write the Q-values.\n\nOriginal decay: 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V. The Q value is (mass of 2A) - (mass of 2B + 2E + 2V) multiplied by c\u00b2. \n\nModified decay: 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. The Q value here would be (mass of 2A) - (mass of 2B + 2E + mass of M). Since M is massless, its mass is zero. So the Q_modified = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 0)c\u00b2. \n\nComparing to the original Q_original = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c\u00b2. \n\nSo Q_modified = Q_original + 2m_V c\u00b2. Because the original had an extra 2m_V subtracted. Therefore, the Q_modified is higher. Therefore, the total energy available in the modified decay is higher. \n\nBut how does that affect the energy spectrum of E particles? \n\nIn the original decay, each E particle's maximum energy would depend on how the energy is distributed. Since the total energy is Q_original, but there are two E's and two V's. The maximum energy an E can have occurs when all the kinetic energy goes into one E, and the other particles take as little as possible. \n\nWait, but in beta decay, for example, the beta particle's maximum energy is the Q-value minus the rest mass energy of the emitted particles. Wait, but here the E and V particles might be massless? Wait the problem says E and V are \"much lighter\" particles. So their rest mass is negligible. \n\nAssuming E and V are massless (like neutrinos?), then their energy is entirely kinetic. \n\nIn the original decay, the total energy available (Q_original) is distributed among the two E and two V particles. The maximum energy an E can have would be when the other particles (the other E and the two V's) have minimal energy. Since they are massless, their minimum energy is zero (if they can go in the opposite direction). Wait but in reality, the particles must conserve momentum. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe we can think in terms of the endpoint. The endpoint of the E's energy spectrum in the original decay is determined by the maximum possible energy that one E can have when the other particles take as little as possible. \n\nSuppose in the original decay, the total energy available (Q_original) is split between the two E and two V particles. The maximum energy for an E would be when the other E and the two V's take zero energy, but that's impossible because of momentum conservation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum energy of E is when the other particles (the other E and Vs) are all moving in the opposite direction, so that the E can get as much as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the endpoint is Q_original divided by something. Wait, let's think of a simpler case. \n\nSuppose in beta decay: the Q-value is the maximum energy the electron can have. Because when the neutrino takes zero kinetic energy (but actually, they have to share the energy, so the electron's maximum energy is when the neutrino takes the minimum, which is its rest mass. But if neutrinos are massless, then their minimum energy is zero. Wait, but in reality, in beta decay, the electron and neutrino must share the Q-value. So the electron's maximum energy is Q, when the neutrino takes zero, but that would violate momentum conservation. So actually, the maximum energy is less than Q. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of kinematics. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the endpoint is determined by the total energy minus the minimum energy required for the other particles. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum energy of E in the original decay would be Q_original divided by the number of E particles? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key here is that when you have more particles in the final state, the available energy per particle is less. But in this case, replacing two V particles with one M (massless) reduces the number of final particles by one (since 2V \u2192 1M: replacing two with one, so total particles go from 2+2+2=6 to 2B+2E +1 M, so total 5). \n\nBut how does the number of particles affect the energy distribution? \n\nAlternatively, since the modified decay has a higher Q-value (as we calculated earlier), then the maximum energy available for the E particles would be higher. Because Q_modified is higher than Q_original. \n\nWait, let's recap that calculation. The Q_original is (2A mass) - (2B + 2E + 2V masses). The modified Q is (2A) - (2B + 2E + 0) because M is massless. So the difference between the two Q values is exactly the mass of the two V particles. Since the V's are much lighter, their mass is negligible, but even so, the modified Q is higher. \n\nTherefore, the total energy available in the modified decay is higher. Since the E particles' maximum energy is determined by the Q-value of the decay, their endpoint should be higher. \n\nNow, the question is about the shape of the spectrum. The original has a continuous spectrum. The modified would also have a continuous spectrum because the decay still has multiple particles (the two E's and the M), so the energy can be shared in different ways. Unless there's some conservation law that forces a specific energy, but with massless particles, I think the spectrum remains continuous. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the spectrum remains continuous but with an increased endpoint, so option B: the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose in the original decay, the two V particles carry away some energy, so the E's can't get the full Q. In the modified decay, instead of two V's, there's one M. Since M is massless, perhaps the energy can be distributed such that more goes to the E's. \n\nAlternatively, the Q is higher, so even if the distribution is similar, the maximum possible would be higher. \n\nTherefore, the endpoint increases. The spectrum remains continuous because it's still a multi-body decay (with three particles emitted: 2E and 1M). \n\nSo yes, B is the answer. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions: \n\nB says the spectrum remains continuous with adjusted shape and endpoint increases. \n\nD says the endpoint decreases. \n\nHmm, so the reasoning is that the Q is higher, so the endpoint increases, so B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different consideration. \n\nWait, in the original decay, the two V's are emitted. Since they are particles (maybe like neutrinos?), their presence allows for more ways to distribute energy. But when replacing two V's with one M, the number of degrees of freedom decreases. But the energy available is higher. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum energy of E would be when all the extra Q (from the original plus 2mVc\u00b2) is given to E. \n\nYes, so the endpoint should be higher, so B is correct. \n\nAnother way: in the original decay, the maximum energy an E can have would be when the other E and the two V's have as little energy as possible. Since they are massless, their minimum energy is zero (if they can go in opposite directions). But momentum conservation must be considered. \n\nSuppose in the original decay, the two E and two V particles are emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. The maximum energy of one E would require that the other E and the two V's have zero energy. But in reality, their momenta must add up to zero. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the maximum energy for one E. Let\u2019s suppose that all the energy (except the rest masses, which are negligible) is given to one E. But since all particles are massless, their energy is equal to their momentum magnitude. \n\nLet me consider a simplified case where all particles are emitted in one direction, but that would violate momentum conservation. Alternatively, to maximize one E's energy, the other particles must take as little as possible. \n\nLet me think in terms of energy and momentum conservation. \n\nSuppose in the original decay, the total energy is Q_original. The decay products are two E (E1, E2), two V (V1, V2). All are massless. \n\nTotal momentum must be zero (assuming the initial nucleons are at rest). \n\nThe maximum energy of E1 would be when E2 and the Vs take as little energy as possible. \n\nThe minimum energy for E2, V1, V2 is when their momenta are opposite to E1's. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum energy of E1 occurs when E2 and the Vs have their momenta aligned opposite to E1's direction. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum energy of E1 is when E2 has zero energy and the Vs also have zero. But that can't happen because of momentum conservation. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum energy occurs when E2's momentum is opposite to E1, and the Vs are arranged to cancel the remaining momentum. \n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe the key point is that the Q value is higher in the modified decay, so the maximum possible energy (the endpoint) must increase. Since the question states that in the original decay the endpoint is Q, then in the modified case, the endpoint would be higher. \n\nThe spectrum remains continuous because the decay still involves multiple particles, so energy can be distributed in various ways. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe original decay has a Q-value determined by the mass difference between the initial and final particles. When replacing two massive particles (V) with a single massless particle (M), the final state's total mass decreases because M contributes no rest mass. This increases the available energy (Q_modified > Q_original). The energy spectrum of E remains continuous due to the multi-body decay dynamics (two E and one M), but the higher Q-value raises the maximum possible energy (endpoint) for E particles. \n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes when the decay process emits an exotic massless particle M instead of the two V particles. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts about particle decay and energy spectra.\n\nThe original reaction is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + 2V. The problem states that the energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q. A continuous spectrum usually suggests that the decay process allows the emitted particles to take on a range of energies, up to some maximum. The endpoint Q would be the maximum possible energy any E particle can have in this decay. \n\nNow, in the modified decay, they replace the two V particles with one M. Since M is massless, its energy would be entirely kinetic, right? Because massless particles (like photons or neutrinos) have energy equal to their momentum (E = pc). \n\nThe key here is understanding how the presence of different numbers of particles in the final state affects the available energy for the E particles. In the original decay, there are two V particles and two E particles. When replacing two V particles with one M, the number of final particles changes. Since M is massless, it might carry away some energy that the Vs previously did, but since there's only one M instead of two Vs, maybe the total energy available for E changes?\n\nWait, but the total energy released in the decay (the Q-value) might be different now. The original Q-value is the total energy available, which determines the endpoint of the E's spectrum. The Q-value is calculated based on the mass difference between the initial and final particles. Let's think about that. \n\nThe original decay's Q-value would be the mass difference between the initial (2A) and the final products (2B + 2E + 2V). The maximum energy for E (the endpoint Q) comes from when all the available energy goes into the E particles. But in reality, the energy has to be shared among all the emitted particles. \n\nWhen replacing 2V with 1M, the total mass of the final state changes. Let's see: the mass of the Vs would have contributed to the total mass of the products, but since M is massless, the total mass of the final state might be less. Wait, actually, the mass of the initial and final nuclei must be considered here. The Q-value is (mass_initial - mass_final) * c\u00b2. \n\nWait, perhaps the Q-value for the modified decay is different. Let me think. Let's denote the mass of A as m_A, B as m_B, E as m_E (assuming E is a particle with some mass, but since they are \"much lighter\" than the nucleons, maybe their mass is negligible?), but the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B. So the mass of E and V can be considered negligible compared to the nucleons. \n\nAssuming that the masses of E and V are negligible (since they are much lighter than A and B), then the original decay's Q-value would be Q_original = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c\u00b2. But if their masses are negligible, then that term is approximately 2(m_A - m_B). \n\nIn the modified decay, the reaction is 2A \u2192 2B + 2E + M. So the mass of the final state would be 2m_B + 2m_E + 0 (since M is massless). So the Q-value here would be Q_modified = 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). Wait, but since the original had 2V particles, which were also negligible, perhaps the difference is that in the original, the mass of the final state was 2m_B + 2m_E + 2m_V, but since m_V is negligible, the original Q is 2(m_A - m_B - m_E - m_V) \u2248 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). But the modified decay has 2B + 2E + M, so the mass is 2m_B + 2m_E, so Q_modified is 2(m_A - m_B - m_E). Wait, that would mean that the Q-value for the modified decay is actually higher than the original? Because the original had 2m_V added in the denominator? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think again.

Since M is massless, its mass is zero. So the Q_modified = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 0)c\u00b2. \n\nComparing to the original Q_original = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c\u00b2. \n\nSo Q_modified = Q_original + 2m_V c\u00b2. Because the original had an extra 2m_V subtracted. Therefore, the Q_modified is higher.
