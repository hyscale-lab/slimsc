      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a single particle in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n\u00b2) * E, where n is the principal quantum number starting from 1. Since the problem defines E as that base value, each energy level is just a multiple of E based on n squared.\n\nBut here, we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they're spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so each particle must occupy a different quantum state. The quantum state here is defined by the quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle has spin 1/2, each energy level (each n) can hold two particles with opposite spins (up and down). \n\nSo for four particles, we need to fill up the lowest energy states. Let me break it down:\n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can have two particles (spin up and down). The second energy level (n=2) can also hold two particles. The third (n=3) would have another two, but we only have four particles. Wait, wait. Let me see:\n\nWait, four particles. Each n level can hold two particles (since spin can be \u00b11/2). So for four particles, the first two n levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles, right? Because 2 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) = 4. That fills up the first two energy levels completely. \n\nSo the ground state of the system would be when all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states. The total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. Let's see:\n\nEach particle in n=1 has energy E*(1)^2 = E. Since two particles there, that's 2E. The two in n=2 have energy E*(2)^2 = 4E each? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, the given E is already \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So the actual energy for each n is n\u00b2 times that. So the base E here is the n=1 energy. So E_n = n\u00b2 * E. \n\nAh, right. So when the problem says \"in terms of E\", each energy level n contributes n\u00b2 * E. So for n=1, it's 1E. n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, etc.\n\nSo in the ground state, the four particles must be arranged so that the total energy is minimized. Since they are fermions, we can't have more than two in each n level. So the first two n's (1 and 2) each have two particles. \n\nCalculating the total energy for ground state:\n\nFor n=1: 2 particles contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E. \n\nFor n=2: 2 particles contribute 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2*(4E) = 8E. \n\nTotal ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on, that gives 10E. But looking at the options, option D has 10E as the first, but option C has 10E as the second. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the counts. Each n level can have two particles. So n=1 has two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 also has two. So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. \n\nThen the first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available energy level. The next available is n=3. But since the Pauli exclusion applies, we can only have two particles in n=3. But to get the first excited state, we need the minimal possible increase in energy. So instead of moving one particle from the lowest levels, maybe the minimal step is to put one particle into n=3. Wait, but all the lower levels are filled. Wait, the first excited state would be when one particle is moved from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next higher n=3. Wait, but actually, the system's ground state is filled up to n=2. To get the first excited state, you need to promote one of the particles to the next available state, which is n=3. \n\nWait, but the particles in n=2 are already in the highest filled level. So moving one from n=2 to n=3 would leave the n=2 level with one particle, but since the exclusion principle allows that (since spin can be different). Wait, but in the ground state, the two in n=2 are already both spins. So the next available state is n=3 with spin up, for example. \n\nSo the first excited state would have three particles: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, the total particles must remain four. Wait, the original configuration was two in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, you take one from n=2 and put it into n=3. So now you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but that's still four particles. \n\nSo the energy would be:\n\n2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. \n\nHmm, so then the first excited state would be 15E? But that would make the ground state 10E, first excited 15E, which is option D's first two entries. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state could be splitting the particles differently. Wait, maybe there's another way to arrange them with a lower energy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted? But that would require moving a particle to a higher energy, but the n=1 is already filled. Wait, but the n=1 can't have more than two. So moving a particle from n=1 to a higher level would actually increase the total energy. But maybe that's not the minimal increase. Wait, the minimal energy increase would be moving a particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to n=3, as before, which gives an increase of (9E - 4E) = 5E. Whereas moving from n=1 to n=3 would give a larger increase (9-1=8E), so the minimal is moving from n=2 to n=3.\n\nSo the first excited state would have total energy 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next possible configuration. \n\nWhat's the next possible? The next would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3, so now two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, let's think. The first excited state is two in n1, one in n2, one in n3. To get the next state, maybe moving another particle from n2 to n3. Then you have two in n1, zero in n2, two in n3. But that would give a total energy of 2*1E + 2*9E = 2 + 18 = 20E. But maybe there's a lower energy configuration?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving one particle from n2 to n3, giving 15E. The second excited could be moving another particle from n2 to n3 (so now n3 has two particles, n2 has zero). That would give 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E. But that might not be the next. Alternatively, maybe another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead?\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when the first excited state has one in n3, but the next could be having another particle in n3, so two in n3. Or maybe one particle is in n4?\n\nWait, the first excited state is 15E. The second excited might be moving the second particle from n2 to n3, so total energy becomes 2E (from n1) + 0 (from n2) + 2*(9E) (from n3) = 2 + 18 = 20E. Alternatively, maybe instead of moving both particles from n2 to n3, we could move one to n3 and another to n4, which would give a different energy. Let me see: \n\nSuppose in the first excited state, you have two in n1, one in n2, one in n3 (total 15E). The next state could be moving another from n2 to n3 (so two in n3, and n2 empty) \u2192 2+18 =20E. Alternatively, moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4? But there's only one left in n2 (since first excited has one in n2). Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the ground state is n1(2), n2(2). First excited is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). The next excited state could be moving that remaining n2 particle to n3, giving n3 with two particles, so 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 =20E. Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles is in n=3 and another in n=4, so that the total energy is 2*(1) + 1*(2)^2 + 1*(3)^2 + 1*(4)^2? Wait, but that would require more particles. Wait, no, total four particles. Let's see:\n\nWait, the first excited state is 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3. The next state (second excited) could have 2 in n1, 0 in n2, 2 in n3 (total energy 2 + 18 =20E). Alternatively, maybe moving one particle from n2 to n4. Then you have 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n4. The energy would be 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E, which is higher than 20. So the lower energy would be 20E. But perhaps there's another arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n2 to n3 but instead splitting the n2 particles differently. Wait, maybe another way: perhaps one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, so the first excited is as before. Then the second excited could have another particle promoted from n2 to n3, so two in n3. But then the total energy would be 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where one particle is promoted to a higher level but with a smaller increase. Let me see.\n\nWait another thought: the first excited state might not be the only possibility. For example, what if instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, you have another configuration? Like, perhaps one particle in n1 is promoted to n3, but that would give a higher energy. Let's see: moving one from n1 (energy 1E) to n3 (9E) would add 8E, whereas moving from n2 to n3 adds 5E. So the minimal is indeed moving from n2 to n3.\n\nSo the first excited state energy is 15E. The second excited would be 20E? But looking at the options, none of them have 10E,15E,20E. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nHmm. My calculation for the ground state was 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But 20E isn't in any of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe the second excited state isn't 20E. Let me think again. Let's consider all possibilities step by step.\n\nGround state: n1 has two, n2 has two. Total energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(2)^2 E = 2 + 8 = 10E. Correct.\n\nFirst excited state: Moving one particle from n2 to n3. Now, the configuration is two in n1, one in n2, one in n3. The energy is 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 +4 +9 =15E. Correct.\n\nSecond excited state: Now, what's the next possible configuration with the next higher energy? The next would be moving another particle from n2 to n3. But there's only one left in n2. So moving that one to n3. Now n3 has two, n2 has zero. The energy becomes 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 18 = 20E. \n\nAlternatively, instead of moving both from n2 to n3, maybe we can move one to n3 and another to n4? Wait, but the first excited already moved one from n2 to n3. The next step could be moving one from n2 to n3 and another to n4? But that would require two particles moving. But the minimal step would be the smallest possible energy increase. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, the second excited state might have one particle in n2 and one in n4 instead of n3. Wait, let's see. Let's think of all possible configurations with four particles, ordered by energy.\n\nThe first excited state is 15E. The next would be the next possible arrangement with higher energy than 15E. \n\nAnother possibility is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (as before) and the other from n2 to n4? Wait no, that would need two particles moving, but in the first excited state, there was one left in n2. So to get to the second excited, the next possible would be moving that last n2 to n3 (so two in n3) giving 20E. Alternatively, moving that last n2 particle to n4 instead of n3. Then the configuration would be two in n1, 0 in n2, 1 in n3, 1 in n4. Then the total energy is 2*1 + 0 + 9 + 16 = 2 + 9 +16= 27E. Which is higher than 20E. So the lower energy option is better. So the second excited would be 20E, but that's not among the options given. \n\nWait, looking at the options again. The options D has 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, 18E. Maybe I made an error here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe there's another configuration for the second excited state. Let me think: the ground state is n1:2, n2:2. \n\nFirst excited: n1:2, n2:1, n3:1 (15E). \n\nSecond excited: What if instead of moving the last n2 to n3, we promote one of the n1 particles to n3? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from n1 (which is already filled with two) to a higher level. Since n1 is full, but we can only have two there. So moving a particle from n1 to n3 would free up a spot? No, because the two in n1 are already in the lowest possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n2 is moved to n3 (so 15E first excited) and then another particle from n2 to n3 (so 20E second). But 20E is not an option. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the particles are spin-1/2, so each n level can have two particles (spin up and down). So the first two particles are in n=1 with spins up and down. The next two are in n=2 similarly. So for the ground state, that's correct. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). The next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that leaves n2 with 0. Alternatively, moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4? But that would require moving two particles. Wait, but perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level? \n\nWait, but that would give a higher energy. Let me see: if you move one from n1 to n3, then the configuration would be n1(1), n2(2), n3(1). The total energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 +8 +9=18E. Oh! That's 18E, which is an option (option D's third entry is 18E). \n\nWait, so maybe that's the correct path. Let me check that. \n\nWait, the first excited state is 15E. The second excited could be either moving the second particle from n2 to n3 (20E) or moving a particle from n1 to n3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited would be 18E. \n\nAh! So perhaps I was wrong before. Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a lower energy than moving the last n2 to n3. Let's calculate the energy for that configuration.\n\nSo, moving one from n1 to n3: \n\nOriginal ground state: n1(2), n2(2) \u2192 10E.\n\nFirst excited: moving one from n2 to n3 \u2192 15E.\n\nSecond excited: moving one from n1 to n3 (instead of moving the remaining n2). The configuration would be n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Wait, but that leaves n2 still with two particles. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state could be moving a particle from n1 to n3. Let me see the steps again:\n\nAfter the first excited (15E), the configuration is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). \n\nThe next step could be moving another particle from n2 to n3 (so n2 becomes 0, n3 becomes 2). That gives total energy 2 + 0 + 2*9 = 20E.\n\nAlternatively, moving one from n1 to n3. To do that, you have to move one of the two in n1 to n3. Then the configuration would be n1(1), n2(1), n3(2). The energy is 1*1 + 1*4 + 2*9 \u2192 1 +4 +18 =23E. Wait, that's higher than 20E. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving the second particle from n2 to n3, you move one from n2 to n4, and leave n3 empty? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a different arrangement. Let's think of all possible ways to have four particles in different n's with the next lowest energy.\n\nThe first excited is 15E (n1:2, n2:1, n3:1).\n\nThe next could be moving one from n2 to n3 (so n2:0, n3:2 \u2192 20E) or moving one from n2 to n4 (so n2:0, n3:1, n4:1 \u2192 2 + 0 +9 +16= 27E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n1 to n2? That would decrease energy, but that's going back to the ground state, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another configuration where two particles are in n=3 and one each in n=1 and n=2? No, that's the same as moving the second n2 to n3.\n\nHmm, but the options given have 18E as an option (option D's third entry). How do we get 18E?\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternative approach: the total energy is the sum over each particle's energy. Since all particles are fermions, we have to fill the lowest possible energy states.\n\nGround state: the lowest four states. Since each n can have two particles (spin up/down), the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) each have two particles. Total energy: 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E =10E. That's correct.\n\nFirst excited state: the next possible state is when we have one more particle in a higher energy level. The minimal increase is to promote one of the particles from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy: 2*1\u00b2E +1*2\u00b2E +1*3\u00b2E = 2 +4 +9 =15E. That's the first excited state. \n\nSecond excited state: Now, the next state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 0*(2\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving both to n=3, we have one in n=3 and another in a higher level?\n\nWait, but the next possible would be moving one from n=2 to n=4. Then the configuration would be n1(2), n2(0), n3(1), n4(1). The energy would be 2 + 0 +9 +16 =27E. That's higher than 20E. So 20E is the next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to n=3? Let me see. That would require moving one from n=1 to n=3. But the two in n=1 are already the lowest possible. \n\nWait, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would mean that n=1 now has 1, n=3 has 2 (since there's already one from the first excited). Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, n3 has one. If in the second excited, you move a particle from n1 to n3, you get n1(1), n2(1), n3(2). The energy would be 1*1 +1*4 +2*9 =1+4+18=23E. That's higher than 20.\n\nHmm, so where does 18E come from?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me check if there's another possible first excited state. For example, maybe instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, we can have another configuration where one of the particles from n2 is moved to n3 and another is moved to n4? But that would require two particles moving, which would make the energy higher than the first excited. So no, the first excited is definitely 15E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, and another particle from n=1 is moved to n=2. Wait, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would not help. \n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the first excited state is different. Let me think again. The ground state is n1:2, n2:2. The first excited state could have one particle promoted to n=3, but perhaps there's another way to arrange the particles such that the total energy is lower than 15E? No, because moving from n=2 to n=3 gives an increase of 5E. Moving from n=1 to n=3 would be a larger increase, so 15E is the correct first excited.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because none of the options have 20E as the second excited. Let me look at the options again. \n\nOption D is 10E,15E,18E. So 18E would be the second excited. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but arranged differently. Wait, let me think of another configuration. Suppose after the first excited (15E), the second excited could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? Wait, but that would require moving two particles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the particles from n=2 is moved to n=3, and another particle from n=2 is moved to n=4? But that would give higher energy. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state? Let me check that again. \n\nWait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Each energy level n can have two particles (since spin can be up or down). So for four particles, the first two n's (1 and 2) are filled. \n\nWait, but what if the particles are fermions, so the total spin might have to be considered? Wait no, the spin is just part of the quantum state. The key is the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two particles have the same set of quantum numbers. Since the spin is part of the quantum state, each n can have two particles (with different spins). So my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts the energy levels differently. Wait, the problem says \"four identical spin-1/2 particles\". Are they distinguishable by their spin? Since spin is part of their quantum state, the Pauli exclusion requires that each particle has a unique combination of n and spin. \n\nWait, but for spin-1/2 particles, each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the particles are in a 1D infinite well, so their wavefunctions are symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait no, since they are fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, or vice versa. But for the energy levels, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part's energy. So the energy is just based on the spatial wavefunctions, so the calculation remains as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's given E. The question says E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), which is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So each subsequent energy level is n\u00b2 times that. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after the first excited state (15E), the second excited can have one particle in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require moving two particles? \n\nWait, no. Let me think of all possible four-particle configurations with energy higher than 15E, but the next possible minimal.\n\nWait, what if the first excited state is not moving one from n=2 to n=3, but moving one from n=1 to n=3? That would give a higher energy than 15E, so it can't be the first excited. So the first excited is indeed 15E.\n\nWait, let me consider the option D, which has 18E as the second excited. To get 18E, the total energy must be 18E. Let me see what configuration gives that.\n\nSuppose the configuration is n1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nThen the energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 =1+8+9=18E. Exactly! So how do we get there?\n\nStarting from the ground state (n1:2, n2:2 \u2192 10E). \n\nTo reach this configuration (n1:1, n2:2, n3:1), we need to move one particle from n1 to n3. But moving a particle from n1 (energy 1E) to n3 (9E) gives an increase of 8E. The first excited state was 15E (increase of 5E from ground). So moving a particle from n1 to n3 would give an increase of 8E, which would be a larger jump than the first excited state. But the second excited state must have higher energy than the first excited (15E). 18E is higher than 15E, so it's possible. \n\nWait, but then the first excited is 15E, then the second could be this 18E, which is less than 20E. So maybe that's the case. \n\nWait, so the first excited state is when you move a particle from n2 to n3 (15E). The second excited state could be moving a particle from n1 to n3 (18E). Because even though that requires moving a particle from a lower level, the total energy is still higher than the first excited. \n\nAh! So the first excited is the minimal increase (moving from n2 to n3, adding 5E to get 15E). The second excited is the next minimal increase, which would be moving a particle from n2 to n3 (but that's already done once). Alternatively, moving another particle from n2 to n3 gives 20E, but there's also another configuration where you move a particle from n1 to n3 (adding 8E). The 18E configuration is lower than 20E, so it's the next. \n\nWait, but how do you get that configuration? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the ground state (n1:2, n2:2):\n\nFirst excited: move one from n2 to n3 \u2192 15E (n1:2, n2:1, n3:1).\n\nSecond excited: move one from n1 to n3 \u2192 which would leave n1:1, n2:1, n3:2. Wait, but that would require moving one from n1 to n3, which gives:\n\nTotal energy: 1*(1)^2 + 1*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 \u2192 1 +4 +18 =23E. Wait, that's higher than 20E. So that can't be 18E.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error here. Let me calculate the configuration where n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1:\n\nWait, how do you get there? From the ground state (n1:2, n2:2), you have to move one from n1 to n3. The configuration would be n1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nThe energy is 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9 =1+8+9=18E. \n\nTo do that, you have to move one from n1 to n3. The energy difference is (9-1)*E =8E added. \n\nBut that would require moving a particle from n1 to n3, which requires a larger energy jump than the first excited state's 5E. So this configuration's total energy is 10E +8E =18E, which is higher than the first excited state (15E). Therefore, it is indeed the second excited state, because it's the next minimal after 15E. \n\nWait, but why is this possible? Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 is a valid configuration even though it requires moving from a lower level. The total energy is still higher than the ground state, so it's an excited state, but it's higher than the first excited (15E) but lower than moving two particles from n2 to n3 (which would be 20E). \n\nAh! So the order of excited states isn't necessarily just moving the highest particle up, but any configuration with higher energy than the previous but the next minimal. \n\nSo the first excited is moving one from n2 to n3 (15E). The second excited would be the next smallest energy increase, which is moving one from n1 to n3 (adding 8E to ground gives 18E, but since the first excited is already 15E, which is lower than 18E? Wait, no. Wait, the ground is 10E. The first excited is 15E. The next possible is either moving another from n2 to n3 (total energy 20E) or moving one from n1 to n3 (total 18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state is 18E. \n\nWait, but moving from n1 to n3 requires moving a particle from a lower level, but that's allowed as long as the total energy is higher. So the order of the excited states would be:\n\nFirst excited: 15E (moving from n2 to n3)\n\nSecond excited: 18E (moving from n1 to n3)\n\nThird excited: 20E (moving second from n2 to n3)\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the second excited state would be 18E. \n\nThen the options would have D as 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited). Which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that moving from n1 to n3 is indeed allowed. The configuration where n1 has one particle, n2 has two, and n3 has one is allowed. Since each n can have up to two particles, except n1 has one, n2 has two (which is okay), and n3 has one. So that's a valid configuration. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10E, 15E, 18E. \n\nWait but I thought initially the second excited would be 20E. But the key is that moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a lower energy than moving the second from n2. \n\nSo the correct sequence is 10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second). Therefore, option D is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe ground state energy is calculated by filling the lowest two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) with two particles each. Each particle in n=1 contributes 1E and each in n=2 contributes 4E, totaling 2E + 8E = **10E**. \n\nFor the first excited state, the minimal energy increase comes from promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. This results in two particles in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=3 (9E), totaling **15E**. \n\nThe second excited state requires the next smallest energy increase. Moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 (instead of moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3) yields a configuration with one particle in n=1 (1E), two in n=2 (8E), and one in n=3 (9E), totaling **18E**. This is lower than promoting the second n=2 particle to n=3 (which would give 20E), making 18E the correct second excited state energy.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a single particle in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n\u00b2) * E, where n is the principal quantum number starting from 1. Since the problem defines E as that base value, each energy level is just a multiple of E based on n squared.\n\nBut here, we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they're spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so each particle must occupy a different quantum state. The quantum state here is defined by the quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle has spin 1/2, each energy level (each n) can hold two particles with opposite spins (up and down). \n\nSo for four particles, we need to fill up the lowest energy states. Let me break it down:\n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can have two particles (spin up and down). The second energy level (n=2) can also hold two particles. The third (n=3) would have another two, but we only have four particles. Wait, wait. Let me see:\n\nWait, four particles. Each n level can hold two particles (since spin can be \u00b11/2). So for four particles, the first two n levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles, right? Because 2 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) = 4. That fills up the first two energy levels completely. \n\nSo the ground state of the system would be when all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states. The total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. Let's see:\n\nEach particle in n=1 has energy E*(1)^2 = E. Since two particles there, that's 2E. The two in n=2 have energy E*(2)^2 = 4E each? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, the given E is already \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So the actual energy for each n is n\u00b2 times that. So the base E here is the n=1 energy. So E_n = n\u00b2 * E. \n\nAh, right. So when the problem says \"in terms of E\", each energy level n contributes n\u00b2 * E. So for n=1, it's 1E. n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, etc.\n\nSo in the ground state, the four particles must be arranged so that the total energy is minimized. Since they are fermions, we can't have more than two in each n level. So the first two n's (1 and 2) each have two particles. \n\nCalculating the total energy for ground state:\n\nFor n=1: 2 particles contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E. \n\nFor n=2: 2 particles contribute 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2*(4E) = 8E. \n\nTotal ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on, that gives 10E. But looking at the options, option D has 10E as the first, but option C has 10E as the second. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the counts. Each n level can have two particles. So n=1 has two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 also has two. So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. \n\nThen the first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next available energy level. The next available is n=3. But since the Pauli exclusion applies, we can only have two particles in n=3. But to get the first excited state, we need the minimal possible increase in energy. So instead of moving one particle from the lowest levels, maybe the minimal step is to put one particle into n=3. Wait, but all the lower levels are filled. Wait, the first excited state would be when one particle is moved from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next higher n=3. Wait, but actually, the system's ground state is filled up to n=2. To get the first excited state, you need to promote one of the particles to the next available state, which is n=3. \n\nWait, but the particles in n=2 are already in the highest filled level. So moving one from n=2 to n=3 would leave the n=2 level with one particle, but since the exclusion principle allows that (since spin can be different). Wait, but in the ground state, the two in n=2 are already both spins. So the next available state is n=3 with spin up, for example. \n\nSo the first excited state would have three particles: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, the total particles must remain four. Wait, the original configuration was two in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, you take one from n=2 and put it into n=3. So now you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but that's still four particles. \n\nSo the energy would be:\n\n2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. \n\nHmm, so then the first excited state would be 15E? But that would make the ground state 10E, first excited 15E, which is option D's first two entries. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state could be splitting the particles differently. Wait, maybe there's another way to arrange them with a lower energy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted? But that would require moving a particle to a higher energy, but the n=1 is already filled. Wait, but the n=1 can't have more than two. So moving a particle from n=1 to a higher level would actually increase the total energy. But maybe that's not the minimal increase. Wait, the minimal energy increase would be moving a particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to n=3, as before, which gives an increase of (9E - 4E) = 5E. Whereas moving from n=1 to n=3 would give a larger increase (9-1=8E), so the minimal is moving from n=2 to n=3.\n\nSo the first excited state would have total energy 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next possible configuration. \n\nWhat's the next possible? The next would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3, so now two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, let's think. The first excited state is two in n1, one in n2, one in n3. To get the next state, maybe moving another particle from n2 to n3. Then you have two in n1, zero in n2, two in n3. But that would give a total energy of 2*1E + 2*9E = 2 + 18 = 20E. But maybe there's a lower energy configuration?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving one particle from n2 to n3, giving 15E. The second excited could be moving another particle from n2 to n3 (so now n3 has two particles, n2 has zero). That would give 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E. But that might not be the next. Alternatively, maybe another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead?\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when the first excited state has one in n3, but the next could be having another particle in n3, so two in n3. Or maybe one particle is in n4?\n\nWait, the first excited state is 15E. The second excited might be moving the second particle from n2 to n3, so total energy becomes 2E (from n1) + 0 (from n2) + 2*(9E) (from n3) = 2 + 18 = 20E. Alternatively, maybe instead of moving both particles from n2 to n3, we could move one to n3 and another to n4, which would give a different energy. Let me see: \n\nSuppose in the first excited state, you have two in n1, one in n2, one in n3 (total 15E). The next state could be moving another from n2 to n3 (so two in n3, and n2 empty) \u2192 2+18 =20E. Alternatively, moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4? But there's only one left in n2 (since first excited has one in n2). Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the ground state is n1(2), n2(2). First excited is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). The next excited state could be moving that remaining n2 particle to n3, giving n3 with two particles, so 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 =20E. Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles is in n=3 and another in n=4, so that the total energy is 2*(1) + 1*(2)^2 + 1*(3)^2 + 1*(4)^2? Wait, but that would require more particles. Wait, no, total four particles. Let's see:\n\nWait, the first excited state is 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3. The next state (second excited) could have 2 in n1, 0 in n2, 2 in n3 (total energy 2 + 18 =20E). Alternatively, maybe moving one particle from n2 to n4. Then you have 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n4. The energy would be 2 + 4 + 16 = 22E, which is higher than 20. So the lower energy would be 20E. But perhaps there's another arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n2 to n3 but instead splitting the n2 particles differently. Wait, maybe another way: perhaps one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, so the first excited is as before. Then the second excited could have another particle promoted from n2 to n3, so two in n3. But then the total energy would be 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where one particle is promoted to a higher level but with a smaller increase. Let me see.\n\nWait another thought: the first excited state might not be the only possibility. For example, what if instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, you have another configuration? Like, perhaps one particle in n1 is promoted to n3, but that would give a higher energy. Let's see: moving one from n1 (energy 1E) to n3 (9E) would add 8E, whereas moving from n2 to n3 adds 5E. So the minimal is indeed moving from n2 to n3.\n\nSo the first excited state energy is 15E. The second excited would be 20E? But looking at the options, none of them have 10E,15E,20E. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nC) 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nD) 10E, 15E, 18E\n\nHmm. My calculation for the ground state was 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But 20E isn't in any of the options. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, maybe the second excited state isn't 20E. Let me think again. Let's consider all possibilities step by step.\n\nGround state: n1 has two, n2 has two. Total energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(2)^2 E = 2 + 8 = 10E. Correct.\n\nFirst excited state: Moving one particle from n2 to n3. Now, the configuration is two in n1, one in n2, one in n3. The energy is 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 +4 +9 =15E. Correct.\n\nSecond excited state: Now, what's the next possible configuration with the next higher energy? The next would be moving another particle from n2 to n3. But there's only one left in n2. So moving that one to n3. Now n3 has two, n2 has zero. The energy becomes 2*1 + 0 + 2*9 = 2 + 18 = 20E. \n\nAlternatively, instead of moving both from n2 to n3, maybe we can move one to n3 and another to n4? Wait, but the first excited already moved one from n2 to n3. The next step could be moving one from n2 to n3 and another to n4? But that would require two particles moving. But the minimal step would be the smallest possible energy increase. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, the second excited state might have one particle in n2 and one in n4 instead of n3. Wait, let's see. Let's think of all possible configurations with four particles, ordered by energy.\n\nThe first excited state is 15E. The next would be the next possible arrangement with higher energy than 15E. \n\nAnother possibility is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (as before) and the other from n2 to n4? Wait no, that would need two particles moving, but in the first excited state, there was one left in n2. So to get to the second excited, the next possible would be moving that last n2 to n3 (so two in n3) giving 20E. Alternatively, moving that last n2 particle to n4 instead of n3. Then the configuration would be two in n1, 0 in n2, 1 in n3, 1 in n4. Then the total energy is 2*1 + 0 + 9 + 16 = 2 + 9 +16= 27E. Which is higher than 20E. So the lower energy option is better. So the second excited would be 20E, but that's not among the options given. \n\nWait, looking at the options again. The options D has 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, 18E. Maybe I made an error here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe there's another configuration for the second excited state. Let me think: the ground state is n1:2, n2:2. \n\nFirst excited: n1:2, n2:1, n3:1 (15E). \n\nSecond excited: What if instead of moving the last n2 to n3, we promote one of the n1 particles to n3? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from n1 (which is already filled with two) to a higher level. Since n1 is full, but we can only have two there. So moving a particle from n1 to n3 would free up a spot? No, because the two in n1 are already in the lowest possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n2 is moved to n3 (so 15E first excited) and then another particle from n2 to n3 (so 20E second). But 20E is not an option. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, maybe the particles are spin-1/2, so each n level can have two particles (spin up and down). So the first two particles are in n=1 with spins up and down. The next two are in n=2 similarly. So for the ground state, that's correct. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). The next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that leaves n2 with 0. Alternatively, moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4? But that would require moving two particles. Wait, but perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level? \n\nWait, but that would give a higher energy. Let me see: if you move one from n1 to n3, then the configuration would be n1(1), n2(2), n3(1). The total energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 = 1 +8 +9=18E. Oh! That's 18E, which is an option (option D's third entry is 18E). \n\nWait, so maybe that's the correct path. Let me check that. \n\nWait, the first excited state is 15E. The second excited could be either moving the second particle from n2 to n3 (20E) or moving a particle from n1 to n3 (18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited would be 18E. \n\nAh! So perhaps I was wrong before. Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a lower energy than moving the last n2 to n3. Let's calculate the energy for that configuration.\n\nSo, moving one from n1 to n3: \n\nOriginal ground state: n1(2), n2(2) \u2192 10E.\n\nFirst excited: moving one from n2 to n3 \u2192 15E.\n\nSecond excited: moving one from n1 to n3 (instead of moving the remaining n2). The configuration would be n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Wait, but that leaves n2 still with two particles. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state could be moving a particle from n1 to n3. Let me see the steps again:\n\nAfter the first excited (15E), the configuration is n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). \n\nThe next step could be moving another particle from n2 to n3 (so n2 becomes 0, n3 becomes 2). That gives total energy 2 + 0 + 2*9 = 20E.\n\nAlternatively, moving one from n1 to n3. To do that, you have to move one of the two in n1 to n3. Then the configuration would be n1(1), n2(1), n3(2). The energy is 1*1 + 1*4 + 2*9 \u2192 1 +4 +18 =23E. Wait, that's higher than 20E. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving the second particle from n2 to n3, you move one from n2 to n4, and leave n3 empty? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a different arrangement. Let's think of all possible ways to have four particles in different n's with the next lowest energy.\n\nThe first excited is 15E (n1:2, n2:1, n3:1).\n\nThe next could be moving one from n2 to n3 (so n2:0, n3:2 \u2192 20E) or moving one from n2 to n4 (so n2:0, n3:1, n4:1 \u2192 2 + 0 +9 +16= 27E). Alternatively, moving a particle from n1 to n2? That would decrease energy, but that's going back to the ground state, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another configuration where two particles are in n=3 and one each in n=1 and n=2? No, that's the same as moving the second n2 to n3.\n\nHmm, but the options given have 18E as an option (option D's third entry). How do we get 18E?\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternative approach: the total energy is the sum over each particle's energy. Since all particles are fermions, we have to fill the lowest possible energy states.\n\nGround state: the lowest four states. Since each n can have two particles (spin up/down), the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) each have two particles. Total energy: 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E =10E. That's correct.\n\nFirst excited state: the next possible state is when we have one more particle in a higher energy level. The minimal increase is to promote one of the particles from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy: 2*1\u00b2E +1*2\u00b2E +1*3\u00b2E = 2 +4 +9 =15E. That's the first excited state. \n\nSecond excited state: Now, the next state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 0*(2\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving both to n=3, we have one in n=3 and another in a higher level?\n\nWait, but the next possible would be moving one from n=2 to n=4. Then the configuration would be n1(2), n2(0), n3(1), n4(1). The energy would be 2 + 0 +9 +16 =27E. That's higher than 20E. So 20E is the next.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to n=3? Let me see. That would require moving one from n=1 to n=3. But the two in n=1 are already the lowest possible. \n\nWait, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would mean that n=1 now has 1, n=3 has 2 (since there's already one from the first excited). Wait, no. Wait, in the first excited state, n3 has one. If in the second excited, you move a particle from n1 to n3, you get n1(1), n2(1), n3(2). The energy would be 1*1 +1*4 +2*9 =1+4+18=23E. That's higher than 20.\n\nHmm, so where does 18E come from?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me check if there's another possible first excited state. For example, maybe instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, we can have another configuration where one of the particles from n2 is moved to n3 and another is moved to n4? But that would require two particles moving, which would make the energy higher than the first excited. So no, the first excited is definitely 15E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, and another particle from n=1 is moved to n=2. Wait, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 would not help. \n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the first excited state is different. Let me think again. The ground state is n1:2, n2:2. The first excited state could have one particle promoted to n=3, but perhaps there's another way to arrange the particles such that the total energy is lower than 15E? No, because moving from n=2 to n=3 gives an increase of 5E. Moving from n=1 to n=3 would be a larger increase, so 15E is the correct first excited.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because none of the options have 20E as the second excited. Let me look at the options again. \n\nOption D is 10E,15E,18E. So 18E would be the second excited. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but arranged differently. Wait, let me think of another configuration. Suppose after the first excited (15E), the second excited could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? Wait, but that would require moving two particles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the particles from n=2 is moved to n=3, and another particle from n=2 is moved to n=4? But that would give higher energy. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state? Let me check that again. \n\nWait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Each energy level n can have two particles (since spin can be up or down). So for four particles, the first two n's (1 and 2) are filled. \n\nWait, but what if the particles are fermions, so the total spin might have to be considered? Wait no, the spin is just part of the quantum state. The key is the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two particles have the same set of quantum numbers. Since the spin is part of the quantum state, each n can have two particles (with different spins). So my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts the energy levels differently. Wait, the problem says \"four identical spin-1/2 particles\". Are they distinguishable by their spin? Since spin is part of their quantum state, the Pauli exclusion requires that each particle has a unique combination of n and spin. \n\nWait, but for spin-1/2 particles, each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the particles are in a 1D infinite well, so their wavefunctions are symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait no, since they are fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, or vice versa. But for the energy levels, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part's energy. So the energy is just based on the spatial wavefunctions, so the calculation remains as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's given E. The question says E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), which is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So each subsequent energy level is n\u00b2 times that. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after the first excited state (15E), the second excited can have one particle in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require moving two particles? \n\nWait, no. Let me think of all possible four-particle configurations with energy higher than 15E, but the next possible minimal.\n\nWait, what if the first excited state is not moving one from n=2 to n=3, but moving one from n=1 to n=3? That would give a higher energy than 15E, so it can't be the first excited. So the first excited is indeed 15E.\n\nWait, let me consider the option D, which has 18E as the second excited. To get 18E, the total energy must be 18E. Let me see what configuration gives that.\n\nSuppose the configuration is n1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nThen the energy would be 1*1 + 2*4 + 1*9 =1+8+9=18E. Exactly! So how do we get there?\n\nStarting from the ground state (n1:2, n2:2 \u2192 10E). \n\nTo reach this configuration (n1:1, n2:2, n3:1), we need to move one particle from n1 to n3. But moving a particle from n1 (energy 1E) to n3 (9E) gives an increase of 8E. The first excited state was 15E (increase of 5E from ground). So moving a particle from n1 to n3 would give an increase of 8E, which would be a larger jump than the first excited state. But the second excited state must have higher energy than the first excited (15E). 18E is higher than 15E, so it's possible. \n\nWait, but then the first excited is 15E, then the second could be this 18E, which is less than 20E. So maybe that's the case. \n\nWait, so the first excited state is when you move a particle from n2 to n3 (15E). The second excited state could be moving a particle from n1 to n3 (18E). Because even though that requires moving a particle from a lower level, the total energy is still higher than the first excited. \n\nAh! So the first excited is the minimal increase (moving from n2 to n3, adding 5E to get 15E). The second excited is the next minimal increase, which would be moving a particle from n2 to n3 (but that's already done once). Alternatively, moving another particle from n2 to n3 gives 20E, but there's also another configuration where you move a particle from n1 to n3 (adding 8E). The 18E configuration is lower than 20E, so it's the next. \n\nWait, but how do you get that configuration? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the ground state (n1:2, n2:2):\n\nFirst excited: move one from n2 to n3 \u2192 15E (n1:2, n2:1, n3:1).\n\nSecond excited: move one from n1 to n3 \u2192 which would leave n1:1, n2:1, n3:2. Wait, but that would require moving one from n1 to n3, which gives:\n\nTotal energy: 1*(1)^2 + 1*(2)^2 + 2*(3)^2 \u2192 1 +4 +18 =23E. Wait, that's higher than 20E. So that can't be 18E.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error here. Let me calculate the configuration where n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1:\n\nWait, how do you get there? From the ground state (n1:2, n2:2), you have to move one from n1 to n3. The configuration would be n1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nThe energy is 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9 =1+8+9=18E. \n\nTo do that, you have to move one from n1 to n3. The energy difference is (9-1)*E =8E added. \n\nBut that would require moving a particle from n1 to n3, which requires a larger energy jump than the first excited state's 5E. So this configuration's total energy is 10E +8E =18E, which is higher than the first excited state (15E). Therefore, it is indeed the second excited state, because it's the next minimal after 15E. \n\nWait, but why is this possible? Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 is a valid configuration even though it requires moving from a lower level. The total energy is still higher than the ground state, so it's an excited state, but it's higher than the first excited (15E) but lower than moving two particles from n2 to n3 (which would be 20E). \n\nAh! So the order of excited states isn't necessarily just moving the highest particle up, but any configuration with higher energy than the previous but the next minimal. \n\nSo the first excited is moving one from n2 to n3 (15E). The second excited would be the next smallest energy increase, which is moving one from n1 to n3 (adding 8E to ground gives 18E, but since the first excited is already 15E, which is lower than 18E? Wait, no. Wait, the ground is 10E. The first excited is 15E. The next possible is either moving another from n2 to n3 (total energy 20E) or moving one from n1 to n3 (total 18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state is 18E. \n\nWait, but moving from n1 to n3 requires moving a particle from a lower level, but that's allowed as long as the total energy is higher. So the order of the excited states would be:\n\nFirst excited: 15E (moving from n2 to n3)\n\nSecond excited: 18E (moving from n1 to n3)\n\nThird excited: 20E (moving second from n2 to n3)\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the second excited state would be 18E. \n\nThen the options would have D as 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited). Which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that moving from n1 to n3 is indeed allowed. The configuration where n1 has one particle, n2 has two, and n3 has one is allowed. Since each n can have up to two particles, except n1 has one, n2 has two (which is okay), and n3 has one. So that's a valid configuration. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10E, 15E, 18E. \n\nWait but I thought initially the second excited would be 20E. But the key is that moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a lower energy than moving the second from n2. \n\nSo the correct sequence is 10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second). Therefore, option D is correct.\n\n\nThe ground state energy is calculated by filling the lowest two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) with two particles each. Each particle in n=1 contributes 1E and each in n=2 contributes 4E, totaling 2E + 8E = **10E**. \n\nFor the first excited state, the minimal energy increase comes from promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. This results in two particles in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=3 (9E), totaling **15E**. \n\nThe second excited state requires the next smallest energy increase. Moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 (instead of moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3) yields a configuration with one particle in n=1 (1E), two in n=2 (8E), and one in n=3 (9E), totaling **18E**. This is lower than promoting the second n=2 particle to n=3 (which would give 20E), making 18E the correct second excited state energy.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, I need to think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a particle in a box, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = n\u00b2E, where E is the base energy given here. But wait, the problem says E is exactly \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), so that's the base unit. So each energy level for a single particle would be n\u00b2 times that E. \n\nNow, since there are four identical spin-1/2 particles, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2, each spatial orbital can hold two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down). So the particles have to be placed in the lowest energy states following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nLet me start by listing the possible single-particle states. The lowest energy levels are n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). \n\nSince there are four particles, we need to fill the lowest energy states. Let's see:\n\nFirst, n=1 can take two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can take another two. So the four particles would fill n=1 and n=2. Each of these orbitals is filled completely. \n\nThe total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes (1\u00b2)E, so two particles contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E. Similarly, the two particles in n=2 contribute 2*(2\u00b2E) = 8E. So total ground state energy would be 2E +8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on, the options have 10E as one of the answers. But let me check again. Wait, the problem says four particles, so n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's the ground state. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 10E as the first option except for option D and A. Wait, looking at the options: option C has 4E as the first, which can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the question says the four particles are identical spin-1/2. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem says four particles, so each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each spin), then the next two into n=2. So the total energy is indeed 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So that would be the ground state. So the first energy (ground state) is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when we promote one particle to the next available energy level. \n\nWhat's the next available? After n=2, the next is n=3. But we have to see which one is the first excited state. The first excited state would be the state with the next lowest energy. So perhaps moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but let's think step by step.\n\nWait, the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible energy states. The first excited state would be when one of the particles is excited to the next available state. The next available is n=3? Or perhaps the next possible state is the next available single-particle state. \n\nWait, the particles in the n=2 are already filled. The next available state is n=3. So in the first excited state, we would have three particles in the lower states and one in the next. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nWait, let me think of the system's total energy. The ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state would be when one of the particles from the highest filled orbital (n=2) is moved to n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait no, the n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, no. Wait, the particles in n=2 are both already filled. So to get an excited state, you have to move one particle from the n=2 to the next higher orbital, which is n=3. So the new configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but the original n=2 had two particles. So moving one of them to n=3 would leave n=2 with one, but that's allowed? Because each n can have two particles, so n=2 would have one left. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state would have the configuration of two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But then the total energy would be:\n\nFor n=1: 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E,\n\nn=2: 1*(2\u00b2E) = 4E,\n\nn=3:1*(3\u00b2E) =9E,\n\nTotal: 2E +4E +9E=15E. \n\nWait but that's higher than the ground state. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so the total energy would be (2*(1^2) + 1*(2^2) + 1*(3^2))E = (2 +4 +9)E =15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when we have three particles in lower states and one in the next. Wait, but maybe there's another configuration with lower energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to n=3? Wait, but that would be higher. No, because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would increase the energy more than moving from n=2 to n=3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is moved to n=3. So the total energy becomes 10E + (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2)E = 10E +5E =15E. \n\nHmm. But then the first excited state would be 15E? But let's see the options. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E,10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nWait, if the ground state is 10E, then first excited is 15E, so D is 10E,15E,18E. The second excited state would be next. Let's see what comes next. The next excited state would be the next possible configuration. \n\nThe first excited is when one particle is in n=3. The next would be when another particle is promoted. Let's see:\n\nAfter first excited (15E), the next could be moving another n=2 particle to n=3, leading to two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Wait, but that would leave n=2 empty? That might not be the next step. Alternatively, maybe moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. Hmm, but perhaps the next state is when one particle from n=2 is moved to n=3 and another to n=3? Or maybe another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited state could be when one particle is promoted to n=4. Wait, but the next minimal energy would be to have two particles in n=3. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, after the first excited state (two in n1, one in n2, one in n3), the next step would be moving another particle from n2 to n3, so then n3 would have two, and n2 would have zero. Then total energy would be 2*(1)\u00b2E + 0*(2)^2E + 2*(3)^2E = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E? But that's higher than 15E. Alternatively, maybe the second excited is when the first excited has one in n3, and then another particle in n3, but that requires moving two particles from n2 to n3? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n1 and one in n2? Wait no, because the ground state already has two in n1 and two in n2. To get excited, you can't have more in n1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Wait, four particles. Each n can have two particles. So n1: 2, n2:2. That's the ground state. \n\nFirst excited state: the minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n2 to n3. So the configuration is n1:2, n2:1, n3:1. The energy would be 2*(1)^2E + 1*(2)^2E +1*(3)^2E = 2 +4 +9 =15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n2 to n3. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So the configuration is 2*(1)^2E + 0*(2)^2E + 2*(3)^2E = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. But that's 20E. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, maybe the second excited is when one particle is promoted to n3 and another to n4? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, we could move one from n2 to n4? But that would give a higher energy. The minimal next step after 15E would be 20E, but maybe there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, and another particle in n2 is promoted to n3, but that would give the total energy as 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. However, looking at the options given, D's second excited is 18E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves from n2 to n3 (total 15E), then the next excited state could be moving one particle from n2 to n4, so then the configuration is 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3, and 1 in n4? Wait, but that would be four particles. Let me count:\n\nWait, original configuration after ground state (2,2). After first excited (2,1,1). Then moving another from n2 to n4 would leave n2 with 0, and add a particle in n4. So then the configuration would be n1:2, n2:0, n3:1, n4:1. But that's only 4 particles (2+0+1+1=4). The energy would be 2*1 + 0*4 +1*9 +1*16 = 2 +0 +9 +16=27E. That's even higher. \n\nHmm, this isn't matching the options. Let's look again at the options. Option D is 10, 15, 18. So 18E would be the second excited. How can that happen? \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (total 15E), and the second excited state is moving a different particle from n2 to n3. Wait, but then you have two particles in n3, so that would be 2*(3)^2 = 18E for the n3 terms. Let me recalculate that configuration. \n\nIf two particles are in n3, then the configuration is n1:2, n2:0, n3:2. The energy would be 2*1 +0 + 2*(9) = 2 + 0 +18 =20E. Still not 18. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the possible total energies. The ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. Then maybe the second excited is when one particle is promoted from n2 to n3 (15E), but then the second excited could be moving another particle from n1 to n3? Wait, but that would be moving a particle from n1 (lower energy) to n3, which would give a higher total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a configuration where one particle is in n3 and another in n4. So, the first excited is 15E (as before), then the second excited would be moving one particle from n2 to n3 (so two in n3) and the other n2 particle stays. Wait, no, that would require two particles in n3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the second excited state. Let's see. The first excited is when one particle from n2 moves to n3. The second excited could be when the other particle from n2 moves to n3 as well. That would give two in n3, so total energy would be 2*1\u00b2 + 0*2\u00b2 + 2*3\u00b2 = 2+0+18=20E, which isn't in the options. \n\nHmm, maybe the first excited is moving a particle from n2 to n3 (15E), and the second excited is moving a particle from n1 to n3? Wait, but moving a particle from n1 to n3 would require higher energy. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have the ground state: 2 in n1, 2 in n2 (total 10E). \n\nAnother possible first excited state is to have three particles in n1 and one in n2? But n1 can only take two, so that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (15E), and the second excited is moving a particle from n2 to n4, so then n2 has one left, n4 has one. So energy would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*16 +0*9? Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, the configuration would be:\n\nAfter moving one from n2 to n3 (first excited: 15E), then moving another from n2 to n4. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 1, n4 has 1. So total energy is 2*1 + 0 + 1*9 + 1*16 = 2 + 0 +9+16=27E. Not 18. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a different way to arrange the particles. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle from n2 moves to n3 and another from n1 moves to n3? Wait, but that would mean moving a particle from a lower energy (n1) to higher (n3), which would increase the total energy more than necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n2 to n3. Maybe there's another configuration with a lower energy increase? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the ground state. Let me double-check. The four particles are spin-1/2, so each spatial orbital can have two particles (spin up/down). The ground state would indeed be n1 filled (two), n2 filled (two). So total energy 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 2+8=10E. \n\nThe first excited state must be the next possible energy by having one particle in a higher state. The minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n2 to n3, since moving a particle from n1 would require moving to a higher n which would have a larger energy increase. \n\nSo moving from n2 (2) to n3 (3), the energy added is (3^2 -2^2) = 5, so total energy becomes 10 +5=15E. So first excited is 15E. \n\nThe second excited would be the next possible. The next minimal step is to move another particle from n2 (now there's one left in n2) to n3. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So the energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 0 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 +0 + 18 =20E. But that's not in the options. Wait, but looking at the options, D has 18 as the second excited. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n2 is promoted to n3, and another from n2 is promoted to n4. But that would give higher energy. Let me see:\n\nMoving one to n3 (energy 3\u00b2) and another to n4 (4\u00b2). So the total energy would be:\n\nn1:2 (2E), n2:0, n3:1 (9E), n4:1 (16E). Total is 2 +0 +9 +16 =27E. \n\nNo, that's higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited is when we have one particle in n3 and one in n4. But that requires moving two particles from n2, but then their contributions would be 3\u00b2 and 4\u00b2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider another configuration. What if instead of moving two particles from n2 to n3, we move one to n3 and another to n4? No, that gives higher energy. \n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let's think of the possible energy levels. The next possible state after 15E might be moving one of the n2 particles to n3 and another to n2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is moved to n3, and another particle from n1 is moved to n2? Wait, but moving a particle from n1 to n2 would actually lower the energy, which can't happen in an excited state. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the options again. Option D is 10E,15E,18E. So the second excited is 18E. How can that happen? \n\nWait, 18E would be 18E = 18*(E). Let's see what configuration gives that. Suppose the configuration is n1:2, n3:2. Then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 2*(3)^2 =2 + 18 =20E. No. \n\nWait, maybe n1 has two, n2 has one, and n3 has one, but also another in n4? No, that would be higher. \n\nWait, 18E would be if the total is 18E. Let me think: 18E could be 2*(1)^2 + 1*(2)^2 + 1*(4)^2. Wait, 2 +4 +16 =22E. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving a particle from n2 to n4? Then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(4)^2 = 2+4+16 =22E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n3 and one in n2? Wait, that would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2+4+18=24E. \n\nHmm, none of these are 18. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the first excited state's energy is 15E. The second excited state must be the next possible higher energy. Let's see:\n\nAnother possibility: the first excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3 (15E). The second excited state could be moving the other particle from n2 to n3, making two in n3. That gives 2*(1)^2 +0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one particle is in n4, but that would require higher energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n1 is promoted to n3. Let's see: moving a particle from n1 to n3. The energy change would be (3^2 -1^2)=8. So total energy would be 10E +8E =18E. Oh! That's possible! \n\nWait, but that would require moving a particle from n1 to n3. But why would that be the next excited state? Because moving from n1 to n3 gives a higher energy increase than moving from n2 to n3. Wait, moving from n2 to n3 gives a delta of 5E (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2=5), whereas moving from n1 to n3 gives 3\u00b2-1\u00b2=8. So the first excited would be the minimal, so moving from n2 to n3 (5E increase), but moving from n1 to n3 would be a bigger jump. \n\nTherefore, the first excited is 15E, and the next possible is moving another from n2 to n3 (20E), or moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4 (27E), or moving one from n1 to n3 (18E). Wait, but moving from n1 to n3 would require that the particle is promoted to a higher state. But in that case, the configuration would have one less in n1, but n1 can only have two. Wait, if you move one from n1 to n3, then n1 would have one left, which is allowed. \n\nWait, but in the ground state, n1 has two particles. If you move one of them to n3, then n1 has one, n3 has one. The other particles are in n2 (two). Wait, but that would require the configuration:\n\nn1:1 (spin up and down?), but wait, no, each spatial orbital can have two particles (spin). So moving one from n1 to n3 would leave one in n1 (so one spin?), but actually, each spatial orbital can hold two particles (different spins). So if you have one particle in n1, that's possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is moving one particle from n1 to n3, and leaving the other particles as n2 (two). Let's see:\n\nThe total energy would be (1)^2 *2 (since one particle remains in n1, but wait, no. Wait, the original n1 had two particles. Moving one to n3 leaves one in n1. The n2 remains with two. So:\n\nn1 has 1 particle (so energy contribution 1\u00b2*1?), wait no. Wait, each particle contributes their own energy. So if n1 has one particle, that's 1\u00b2E. The other particle from n1 is now in n3, contributing 3\u00b2E. The n2 has two particles (each 2\u00b2E). \n\nTotal energy would be:\n\n1*(1)^2E + 2*(2)^2E + 1*(3)^2E \n\n= 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. \n\nAh! That's 18E. So that configuration would have an energy of 18E. But is that possible? \n\nYes, because moving a particle from n1 (which has two) to n3 would leave n1 with one (so one particle in n1), and n3 now has one. The n2 is still full. \n\nSo the configuration would be:\n\nn1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nBut wait, the particles in n1 can have two, so moving one out leaves one, which is okay. The total particles are 1+2+1=4. \n\nSo the energy here is 1 +8 +9 =18E. \n\nSo this configuration would have an energy of 18E, which is lower than moving both n2 particles to n3 (20E). So this would be the second excited state. \n\nTherefore, the order would be:\n\nGround state: 10E,\n\nFirst excited: 15E (moving n2\u2192n3),\n\nSecond excited: 18E (moving n1\u2192n3 and keeping n2 full? Wait, no, in that case, the 18E comes from moving one from n1 to n3. \n\nWait, but why is this configuration possible? Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 requires breaking the Pauli exclusion? No, because each spatial orbital can hold two particles. The n1 is still allowed to have one particle. \n\nWait, but the first excited state is when you move a particle from n2 to n3 (15E). The next step is the next possible minimal energy, which could be moving a particle from n1 to n3 (resulting in 18E) instead of moving another from n2 to n3 (which would be 20E). \n\nWait, because moving from n1 to n3 gives a smaller energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3. Let me calculate the energy differences. \n\nThe ground state is 10E. \n\nMoving a particle from n2 to n3 adds (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2)E =5E, so total 15E. \n\nMoving a particle from n1 to n3 adds (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2)E= 8E, so total 10+8=18E. \n\nSo between moving from n2 to n3 (5E increase) and moving from n1 to n3 (8E increase), the former is smaller, so the first excited is 15E. The next step is the next smallest possible increase. The next smallest increase would be moving another from n2 to n3 (another 5E), leading to 15+5=20E, but alternatively, moving from n1 to n3 (8E) gives 18E. Which is smaller than 20E. \n\nWait, so between 15E and 20E, the 18E is lower. So that's the next excited state. \n\nAh! So the second excited state is 18E, which comes from moving one particle from n1 to n3. \n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nGround:10E,\n\nFirst excited:15E,\n\nSecond excited:18E. \n\nSo the correct option is D) 10E,15E,18E. \n\nLet me check the options again. Option D says exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground state configuration is the lowest energy arrangement where each spatial orbital is filled with two particles (spin up/down). For four particles, this is two particles in the n=1 orbital and two in the n=2 orbital. The total ground state energy is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (1^2 E) + 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\\]\n\nThe first excited state is achieved by promoting one particle from the n=2 orbital to the next available orbital (n=3). This results in:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (1^2 E) + 1 \\times (2^2 E) + 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\\]\n\nThe second excited state is the next minimal energy increase, which occurs by promoting one particle from the n=1 orbital to the n=3 orbital (since moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3 yields a higher energy). This configuration gives:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times (1^2 E) + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, I need to think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a particle in a box, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = n\u00b2E, where E is the base energy given here. But wait, the problem says E is exactly \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), so that's the base unit. So each energy level for a single particle would be n\u00b2 times that E. \n\nNow, since there are four identical spin-1/2 particles, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2, each spatial orbital can hold two particles (one with spin up, one with spin down). So the particles have to be placed in the lowest energy states following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nLet me start by listing the possible single-particle states. The lowest energy levels are n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). \n\nSince there are four particles, we need to fill the lowest energy states. Let's see:\n\nFirst, n=1 can take two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can take another two. So the four particles would fill n=1 and n=2. Each of these orbitals is filled completely. \n\nThe total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes (1\u00b2)E, so two particles contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E. Similarly, the two particles in n=2 contribute 2*(2\u00b2E) = 8E. So total ground state energy would be 2E +8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on, the options have 10E as one of the answers. But let me check again. Wait, the problem says four particles, so n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's the ground state. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 10E as the first option except for option D and A. Wait, looking at the options: option C has 4E as the first, which can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the question says the four particles are identical spin-1/2. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem says four particles, so each spatial orbital can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each spin), then the next two into n=2. So the total energy is indeed 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So that would be the ground state. So the first energy (ground state) is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when we promote one particle to the next available energy level. \n\nWhat's the next available? After n=2, the next is n=3. But we have to see which one is the first excited state. The first excited state would be the state with the next lowest energy. So perhaps moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but let's think step by step.\n\nWait, the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible energy states. The first excited state would be when one of the particles is excited to the next available state. The next available is n=3? Or perhaps the next possible state is the next available single-particle state. \n\nWait, the particles in the n=2 are already filled. The next available state is n=3. So in the first excited state, we would have three particles in the lower states and one in the next. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nWait, let me think of the system's total energy. The ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state would be when one of the particles from the highest filled orbital (n=2) is moved to n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait no, the n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, no. Wait, the particles in n=2 are both already filled. So to get an excited state, you have to move one particle from the n=2 to the next higher orbital, which is n=3. So the new configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but the original n=2 had two particles. So moving one of them to n=3 would leave n=2 with one, but that's allowed? Because each n can have two particles, so n=2 would have one left. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state would have the configuration of two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But then the total energy would be:\n\nFor n=1: 2*(1\u00b2E) = 2E,\n\nn=2: 1*(2\u00b2E) = 4E,\n\nn=3:1*(3\u00b2E) =9E,\n\nTotal: 2E +4E +9E=15E. \n\nWait but that's higher than the ground state. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so the total energy would be (2*(1^2) + 1*(2^2) + 1*(3^2))E = (2 +4 +9)E =15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when we have three particles in lower states and one in the next. Wait, but maybe there's another configuration with lower energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to n=3? Wait, but that would be higher. No, because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would increase the energy more than moving from n=2 to n=3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is moved to n=3. So the total energy becomes 10E + (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2)E = 10E +5E =15E. \n\nHmm. But then the first excited state would be 15E? But let's see the options. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E,10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nWait, if the ground state is 10E, then first excited is 15E, so D is 10E,15E,18E. The second excited state would be next. Let's see what comes next. The next excited state would be the next possible configuration. \n\nThe first excited is when one particle is in n=3. The next would be when another particle is promoted. Let's see:\n\nAfter first excited (15E), the next could be moving another n=2 particle to n=3, leading to two particles in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Wait, but that would leave n=2 empty? That might not be the next step. Alternatively, maybe moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. Hmm, but perhaps the next state is when one particle from n=2 is moved to n=3 and another to n=3? Or maybe another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited state could be when one particle is promoted to n=4. Wait, but the next minimal energy would be to have two particles in n=3. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, after the first excited state (two in n1, one in n2, one in n3), the next step would be moving another particle from n2 to n3, so then n3 would have two, and n2 would have zero. Then total energy would be 2*(1)\u00b2E + 0*(2)^2E + 2*(3)^2E = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E? But that's higher than 15E. Alternatively, maybe the second excited is when the first excited has one in n3, and then another particle in n3, but that requires moving two particles from n2 to n3? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n1 and one in n2? Wait no, because the ground state already has two in n1 and two in n2. To get excited, you can't have more in n1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Wait, four particles. Each n can have two particles. So n1: 2, n2:2. That's the ground state. \n\nFirst excited state: the minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n2 to n3. So the configuration is n1:2, n2:1, n3:1. The energy would be 2*(1)^2E + 1*(2)^2E +1*(3)^2E = 2 +4 +9 =15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n2 to n3. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So the configuration is 2*(1)^2E + 0*(2)^2E + 2*(3)^2E = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. But that's 20E. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, maybe the second excited is when one particle is promoted to n3 and another to n4? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where instead of moving a particle from n2 to n3, we could move one from n2 to n4? But that would give a higher energy. The minimal next step after 15E would be 20E, but maybe there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, and another particle in n2 is promoted to n3, but that would give the total energy as 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. However, looking at the options given, D's second excited is 18E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves from n2 to n3 (total 15E), then the next excited state could be moving one particle from n2 to n4, so then the configuration is 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3, and 1 in n4? Wait, but that would be four particles. Let me count:\n\nWait, original configuration after ground state (2,2). After first excited (2,1,1). Then moving another from n2 to n4 would leave n2 with 0, and add a particle in n4. So then the configuration would be n1:2, n2:0, n3:1, n4:1. But that's only 4 particles (2+0+1+1=4). The energy would be 2*1 + 0*4 +1*9 +1*16 = 2 +0 +9 +16=27E. That's even higher. \n\nHmm, this isn't matching the options. Let's look again at the options. Option D is 10, 15, 18. So 18E would be the second excited. How can that happen? \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (total 15E), and the second excited state is moving a different particle from n2 to n3. Wait, but then you have two particles in n3, so that would be 2*(3)^2 = 18E for the n3 terms. Let me recalculate that configuration. \n\nIf two particles are in n3, then the configuration is n1:2, n2:0, n3:2. The energy would be 2*1 +0 + 2*(9) = 2 + 0 +18 =20E. Still not 18. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the possible total energies. The ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. Then maybe the second excited is when one particle is promoted from n2 to n3 (15E), but then the second excited could be moving another particle from n1 to n3? Wait, but that would be moving a particle from n1 (lower energy) to n3, which would give a higher total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a configuration where one particle is in n3 and another in n4. So, the first excited is 15E (as before), then the second excited would be moving one particle from n2 to n3 (so two in n3) and the other n2 particle stays. Wait, no, that would require two particles in n3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the second excited state. Let's see. The first excited is when one particle from n2 moves to n3. The second excited could be when the other particle from n2 moves to n3 as well. That would give two in n3, so total energy would be 2*1\u00b2 + 0*2\u00b2 + 2*3\u00b2 = 2+0+18=20E, which isn't in the options. \n\nHmm, maybe the first excited is moving a particle from n2 to n3 (15E), and the second excited is moving a particle from n1 to n3? Wait, but moving a particle from n1 to n3 would require higher energy. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have the ground state: 2 in n1, 2 in n2 (total 10E). \n\nAnother possible first excited state is to have three particles in n1 and one in n2? But n1 can only take two, so that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is moving one particle from n2 to n3 (15E), and the second excited is moving a particle from n2 to n4, so then n2 has one left, n4 has one. So energy would be 2*1 +1*4 +1*16 +0*9? Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, the configuration would be:\n\nAfter moving one from n2 to n3 (first excited: 15E), then moving another from n2 to n4. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 1, n4 has 1. So total energy is 2*1 + 0 + 1*9 + 1*16 = 2 + 0 +9+16=27E. Not 18. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a different way to arrange the particles. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle from n2 moves to n3 and another from n1 moves to n3? Wait, but that would mean moving a particle from a lower energy (n1) to higher (n3), which would increase the total energy more than necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n2 to n3. Maybe there's another configuration with a lower energy increase? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the ground state. Let me double-check. The four particles are spin-1/2, so each spatial orbital can have two particles (spin up/down). The ground state would indeed be n1 filled (two), n2 filled (two). So total energy 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 2+8=10E. \n\nThe first excited state must be the next possible energy by having one particle in a higher state. The minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n2 to n3, since moving a particle from n1 would require moving to a higher n which would have a larger energy increase. \n\nSo moving from n2 (2) to n3 (3), the energy added is (3^2 -2^2) = 5, so total energy becomes 10 +5=15E. So first excited is 15E. \n\nThe second excited would be the next possible. The next minimal step is to move another particle from n2 (now there's one left in n2) to n3. So now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So the energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 0 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 +0 + 18 =20E. But that's not in the options. Wait, but looking at the options, D has 18 as the second excited. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n2 is promoted to n3, and another from n2 is promoted to n4. But that would give higher energy. Let me see:\n\nMoving one to n3 (energy 3\u00b2) and another to n4 (4\u00b2). So the total energy would be:\n\nn1:2 (2E), n2:0, n3:1 (9E), n4:1 (16E). Total is 2 +0 +9 +16 =27E. \n\nNo, that's higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited is when we have one particle in n3 and one in n4. But that requires moving two particles from n2, but then their contributions would be 3\u00b2 and 4\u00b2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider another configuration. What if instead of moving two particles from n2 to n3, we move one to n3 and another to n4? No, that gives higher energy. \n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let's think of the possible energy levels. The next possible state after 15E might be moving one of the n2 particles to n3 and another to n2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is moved to n3, and another particle from n1 is moved to n2? Wait, but moving a particle from n1 to n2 would actually lower the energy, which can't happen in an excited state. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the options again. Option D is 10E,15E,18E. So the second excited is 18E. How can that happen? \n\nWait, 18E would be 18E = 18*(E). Let's see what configuration gives that. Suppose the configuration is n1:2, n3:2. Then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 2*(3)^2 =2 + 18 =20E. No. \n\nWait, maybe n1 has two, n2 has one, and n3 has one, but also another in n4? No, that would be higher. \n\nWait, 18E would be if the total is 18E. Let me think: 18E could be 2*(1)^2 + 1*(2)^2 + 1*(4)^2. Wait, 2 +4 +16 =22E. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving a particle from n2 to n4? Then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(4)^2 = 2+4+16 =22E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n3 and one in n2? Wait, that would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2+4+18=24E. \n\nHmm, none of these are 18. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the first excited state's energy is 15E. The second excited state must be the next possible higher energy. Let's see:\n\nAnother possibility: the first excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3 (15E). The second excited state could be moving the other particle from n2 to n3, making two in n3. That gives 2*(1)^2 +0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 + 0 + 18 =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one particle is in n4, but that would require higher energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle from n1 is promoted to n3. Let's see: moving a particle from n1 to n3. The energy change would be (3^2 -1^2)=8. So total energy would be 10E +8E =18E. Oh! That's possible! \n\nWait, but that would require moving a particle from n1 to n3. But why would that be the next excited state? Because moving from n1 to n3 gives a higher energy increase than moving from n2 to n3. Wait, moving from n2 to n3 gives a delta of 5E (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2=5), whereas moving from n1 to n3 gives 3\u00b2-1\u00b2=8. So the first excited would be the minimal, so moving from n2 to n3 (5E increase), but moving from n1 to n3 would be a bigger jump. \n\nTherefore, the first excited is 15E, and the next possible is moving another from n2 to n3 (20E), or moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4 (27E), or moving one from n1 to n3 (18E). Wait, but moving from n1 to n3 would require that the particle is promoted to a higher state. But in that case, the configuration would have one less in n1, but n1 can only have two. Wait, if you move one from n1 to n3, then n1 would have one left, which is allowed. \n\nWait, but in the ground state, n1 has two particles. If you move one of them to n3, then n1 has one, n3 has one. The other particles are in n2 (two). Wait, but that would require the configuration:\n\nn1:1 (spin up and down?), but wait, no, each spatial orbital can have two particles (spin). So moving one from n1 to n3 would leave one in n1 (so one spin?), but actually, each spatial orbital can hold two particles (different spins). So if you have one particle in n1, that's possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is moving one particle from n1 to n3, and leaving the other particles as n2 (two). Let's see:\n\nThe total energy would be (1)^2 *2 (since one particle remains in n1, but wait, no. Wait, the original n1 had two particles. Moving one to n3 leaves one in n1. The n2 remains with two. So:\n\nn1 has 1 particle (so energy contribution 1\u00b2*1?), wait no. Wait, each particle contributes their own energy. So if n1 has one particle, that's 1\u00b2E. The other particle from n1 is now in n3, contributing 3\u00b2E. The n2 has two particles (each 2\u00b2E). \n\nTotal energy would be:\n\n1*(1)^2E + 2*(2)^2E + 1*(3)^2E \n\n= 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. \n\nAh! That's 18E. So that configuration would have an energy of 18E. But is that possible? \n\nYes, because moving a particle from n1 (which has two) to n3 would leave n1 with one (so one particle in n1), and n3 now has one. The n2 is still full. \n\nSo the configuration would be:\n\nn1:1, n2:2, n3:1. \n\nBut wait, the particles in n1 can have two, so moving one out leaves one, which is okay. The total particles are 1+2+1=4. \n\nSo the energy here is 1 +8 +9 =18E. \n\nSo this configuration would have an energy of 18E, which is lower than moving both n2 particles to n3 (20E). So this would be the second excited state. \n\nTherefore, the order would be:\n\nGround state: 10E,\n\nFirst excited: 15E (moving n2\u2192n3),\n\nSecond excited: 18E (moving n1\u2192n3 and keeping n2 full? Wait, no, in that case, the 18E comes from moving one from n1 to n3. \n\nWait, but why is this configuration possible? Because moving a particle from n1 to n3 requires breaking the Pauli exclusion? No, because each spatial orbital can hold two particles. The n1 is still allowed to have one particle. \n\nWait, but the first excited state is when you move a particle from n2 to n3 (15E). The next step is the next possible minimal energy, which could be moving a particle from n1 to n3 (resulting in 18E) instead of moving another from n2 to n3 (which would be 20E). \n\nWait, because moving from n1 to n3 gives a smaller energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3. Let me calculate the energy differences. \n\nThe ground state is 10E. \n\nMoving a particle from n2 to n3 adds (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2)E =5E, so total 15E. \n\nMoving a particle from n1 to n3 adds (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2)E= 8E, so total 10+8=18E. \n\nSo between moving from n2 to n3 (5E increase) and moving from n1 to n3 (8E increase), the former is smaller, so the first excited is 15E. The next step is the next smallest possible increase. The next smallest increase would be moving another from n2 to n3 (another 5E), leading to 15+5=20E, but alternatively, moving from n1 to n3 (8E) gives 18E. Which is smaller than 20E. \n\nWait, so between 15E and 20E, the 18E is lower. So that's the next excited state. \n\nAh! So the second excited state is 18E, which comes from moving one particle from n1 to n3. \n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nGround:10E,\n\nFirst excited:15E,\n\nSecond excited:18E. \n\nSo the correct option is D) 10E,15E,18E. \n\nLet me check the options again. Option D says exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be D.\n\n\nThe four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground state configuration is the lowest energy arrangement where each spatial orbital is filled with two particles (spin up/down). For four particles, this is two particles in the n=1 orbital and two in the n=2 orbital. The total ground state energy is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (1^2 E) + 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\\]\n\nThe first excited state is achieved by promoting one particle from the n=2 orbital to the next available orbital (n=3). This results in:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (1^2 E) + 1 \\times (2^2 E) + 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\\]\n\nThe second excited state is the next minimal energy increase, which occurs by promoting one particle from the n=1 orbital to the n=3 orbital (since moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3 yields a higher energy). This configuration gives:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times (1^2 E) + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\\]\n\nThus, the energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
