      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the question mentions a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 with the transition energy \u0394E of hydrogen, where the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether they're equal, the coupling term is much greater, much smaller, or just greater than \u0394E.\n\nHmm. Let me recall what the paramagnetic coupling term is. I think in the context of the hydrogen atom, the paramagnetic term comes from the interaction between the electron's orbital motion and the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is usually given by the Zeeman effect term. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic term (which is the first-order term in the Zeeman effect) is given by the interaction between the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic field. \n\nThe formula for the paramagnetic term (H_paramag) is (e/(2m_e)) * (L \u00b7 B), where e is the electron charge, m_e is the electron mass, L is the orbital angular momentum operator, and B is the magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is along the Oz axis, this simplifies to (e/(2m_e)) * L_z * B. The expectation value of this term would then involve \u27e8L_z\u27e9. \n\nWait, but the question says \"for small values of m\". The orbital magnetic quantum number m_l (since m here is probably m_l) determines the expectation value of L_z. Since L_z has eigenvalues m_l * \u0127, so \u27e8L_z\u27e9 would be m_l * \u0127. Therefore, the expectation value of the paramagnetic term would be (e/(2m_e)) * m_l * \u0127 * B.\n\nNow, the transition energy \u0394E given here is for a transition with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Let me find the energy corresponding to that wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, converting 0.4861 micrometers to meters: 0.4861 \u03bcm = 4.861e-7 meters. So,\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m) \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 \n\nDivide by 4.861e-7: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 \u2248 4.09e-19 J per photon. \n\nBut since the question is about the energy scale of the transition, this is the \u0394E we need to compare with the paramagnetic term.\n\nNow, the paramagnetic term's expectation value is (e/(2m_e)) * m_l * \u0127 * B. Let's plug in the numbers here. Let me note down the constants:\n\ne = 1.6e-19 C,\n\nm_e = 9.11e-31 kg,\n\n\u0127 \u2248 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s,\n\nB = 1 T,\n\nand m_l is small. Let's see, the problem says \"small values of m\", so m_l is probably like 0, \u00b11, etc. Let's suppose m_l is of order 1 (since it's small, maybe m is like 1 or 2, but even 1 is small compared to n^2 for high n? Wait, but maybe in hydrogen transitions, the m values are small in general? Hmm. Wait, but the question says to consider small m, so maybe m is like 1 or so. Let me proceed with m_l = 1 for an estimate.\n\nCalculating the paramagnetic term's expectation value:\n\nH_paramag = (e/(2m_e)) * m_l * \u0127 * B\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= (1.6e-19 C / (2 * 9.11e-31 kg)) * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * 1 T\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the coefficient (e/(2m_e)):\n\ne/(2m_e) = (1.6e-19) / (2 * 9.11e-31) \n\nCalculating denominator: 2 *9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30\n\nSo 1.6e-19 / 1.822e-30 \u2248 (1.6 / 1.822) * 1e11 \u2248 0.878 * 1e11 \u2248 8.78e10 C/(kg)\n\nThen multiply by m_l (1) and \u0127 (1.054e-34 J\u00b7s):\n\nSo 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = 8.78 *1.054 \u2248 9.25, so 9.25e-24 (units?)\n\nWait, but let's track the units:\n\ne/(2m_e) has units of (C)/(kg). Then multiply by \u0127 (J\u00b7s), and then B (Tesla). Let me see Tesla is kg/(C\u00b7s), right? Because 1 T = 1 kg/(s\u00b7C). \n\nSo let's see the units:\n\n(e/(2m_e)) [C/kg] * (\u0127 [J\u00b7s] = (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2)*s = kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s) ) * B [kg/(C\u00b7s)]\n\nMultiply all together:\n\n(C/kg) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s) * (kg/(C\u00b7s)) \n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nThe C in the numerator and denominator cancels. \n\nkg in denominator from first term cancels with kg in numerator from second term. \n\nThen remaining units: (m\u00b2/s) * (kg/(s)) \u2192 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2 \u2192 which is Joules. So units check out as energy. \n\nSo the numerical value:\n\nLet me recalculate the numerical part step by step again for accuracy.\n\nFirst, e/(2m_e):\n\ne = 1.6e-19 C,\n\n2m_e = 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30 kg,\n\nso 1.6e-19 / 1.822e-30 \u2248 (1.6 / 1.822) * 1e11 \u2248 0.878 * 1e11 = ~8.78e10 C/kg.\n\nMultiply by m_l (1):\n\nStill 8.78e10.\n\nMultiply by \u0127: 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s \u2192 so 8.78e10 * 1.05457e-34 \u2248 8.78 *1.05457 \u2248 ~9.25e-24 (unit: (C/kg)*(J\u00b7s) ??? Wait, maybe I should track the actual numbers with exponents:\n\nWait, 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = 8.78 * 1.054 = approx 9.25, and 10^10 * 10^-34 = 10^-24, so 9.25e-24.\n\nThen multiply by B (1 T):\n\nSo 9.25e-24 * 1 = 9.25e-24 J.\n\nSo the paramagnetic term's expectation value is approximately 9.25e-24 Joules.\n\nNow, the transition energy \u0394E was calculated as ~4.09e-19 J. \n\nComparing the two:\n\nParamagnetic term: ~9.25e-24 J\n\nTransition energy \u0394E: ~4.09e-19 J\n\nSo the paramagnetic term is much smaller than \u0394E. The ratio is (9.25e-24)/(4.09e-19) \u2248 (9.25 /4.09) * 1e-5 \u2248 ~2.26 * 1e-5 \u2248 2.26e-5. So that's about 0.002%, so definitely much smaller.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \u0394E. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake here. Let me see again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the exponents in the paramagnetic term calculation. Let me recalculate that step again.\n\nThe paramagnetic term:\n\n(e/(2m_e))*(m_l * \u0127 * B)\n\nSo e/(2m_e) = 1.6e-19 C divided by (2*9.11e-31 kg) \u2192 1.6/(1.822e-30) \u2192 wait, no, the denominator is 2m_e which is 1.822e-30 kg. So 1.6e-19 / (1.822e-30) \u2192 that's (1.6 / 1.822) * 1e11 \u2192 yes, that gives ~8.78e10 C/kg.\n\nMultiply by m_l=1, so 8.78e10 C/kg.\n\nMultiply by \u0127 (1.054e-34 J\u00b7s):\n\nSo 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = (8.78 * 1.054) * 1e-24 \u2192 as before ~9.25e-24.\n\nMultiply by B=1 T. Since T is kg/(C\u00b7s), so the units are okay, but the numerical value is still 9.25e-24 J.\n\nThe transition energy \u0394E was 4.09e-19 J. So 9.25e-24 is 0.00000925e-19 compared to 4.09e-19. So it's about 9e-6 times smaller. So yes, the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the answer is C.\n\nAnother check: typical Zeeman splitting energies are much smaller than the transition energies in atoms. For example, in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are on the order of eV (like 13.6 eV for n=1, but transitions between levels like from n=2 to n=1 would be about 10 eV, which is 1.6e-18 J. Wait, but in the problem, the given wavelength is 0.4861 \u03bcm, which is in the visible range. Let me see what transition that corresponds to.\n\nWait, 0.4861 \u03bcm is the H-beta line? Wait, the Balmer series transitions end at n=2. Let me check the wavelength for a transition to n=2. Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The H-alpha is 656 nm (red), H-beta is 486 nm (blue), which matches the given wavelength here (0.4861 \u03bcm = 486.1 nm). So that's the H-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=5 to n=2? Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for the Balmer series:\n\nThe wavelength is given by 1/\u03bb = R*(1/2\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b2), where R is the Rydberg constant (\u22481.097e4 m^-1). \n\nSo for 0.4861 \u03bcm (486.1 nm), 1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9 m) \u2248 2.057e6 m^-1.\n\nR*(1/4 - 1/n\u00b2) = 1.097e4*(0.25 - 1/n\u00b2) = 2.057e6?\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me compute:\n\nWait, let's do it properly. Let me compute 1/\u03bb = R_H (1/2\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b2). Let me solve for n.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m,\n\n1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9) \u2248 2.057e6 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo,\n\n2.057e6 = 1.097e4 (0.25 - 1/n\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097e4:\n\n2.057e6 / 1.097e4 \u2248 2.057 / 1.097 * 1e2 \u2248 approx 1.875 * 100 = 187.5 \u2248 0.25 - 1/n\u00b2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps my numbers are off. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 1.097e4 is approximately 1.097 *10^4 m^-1. \n\nSo 1.097e4 * (0.25 - 1/n\u00b2) = 2.057e6 ?\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\nSuppose n is 4, then 1/4\u00b2 = 1/16, so 0.25 - 1/16 = 0.25 -0.0625 =0.1875. Multiply by 1.097e4 gives 0.1875 *1.097e4 \u2248 2067 m\u207b\u00b9, which is way less than 2.05e6. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe the Rydberg constant is 1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9?\n\nWait, no. The Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9. Wait, I think I messed up the exponent. Let me confirm: Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097373e7 m\u207b\u00b9. So that's 1.097373\u00d710^7 m\u207b\u00b9. \n\nAh, that's probably where I messed up. Let me recalculate with the correct R_H.\n\nSo, 1/\u03bb = R_H*(1/4 -1/n\u00b2). Let's plug in the numbers with R_H =1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nGiven \u03bb=486.1e-9 m, so 1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9) \u2248 2.057e6 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSet equal to R_H*(1/4 -1/n\u00b2):\n\n2.057e6 = 1.097e7*(0.25 - 1/n\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097e7:\n\n2.057e6 / 1.097e7 \u2248 0.1875 \u2248 0.25 - 1/n\u00b2\n\nSo 0.25 - 0.1875 = 0.0625 = 1/n\u00b2 \u2192 n\u00b2 = 1/0.0625 = 16 \u2192 n=4. \n\nAh, so that transition is from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference here is between n=4 and n=2. \n\nThe energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. So \u0394E would be E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/16) = -3.4 + 0.85 = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. \n\nConverting that to Joules: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 2.55 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 4.08e-19 J, which matches the earlier calculation of ~4.09e-19 J. So that's correct. \n\nSo the transition energy is about 4e-19 J, and the paramagnetic term is ~9e-24 J. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom.

The expectation value of this term would then involve \u27e8L_z\u27e9. \n\nWait, but the question says \"for small values of m\". The orbital magnetic quantum number m_l (since m here is probably m_l) determines the expectation value of L_z. Since L_z has eigenvalues m_l * \u0127, so \u27e8L_z\u27e9 would be m_l * \u0127. Therefore, the expectation value of the paramagnetic term would be (e/(2m_e)) * m_l * \u0127 * B.\n\nNow, the transition energy \u0394E given here is for a transition with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Let me find the energy corresponding to that wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, converting 0.4861 micrometers to meters: 0.4861 \u03bcm = 4.861e-7 meters.

Let's see, the problem says \"small values of m\", so m_l is probably like 0, \u00b11, etc. Let's suppose m_l is of order 1 (since it's small, maybe m is like 1 or 2, but even 1 is small compared to n^2 for high n? Wait, but maybe in hydrogen transitions, the m values are small in general? Hmm. Wait, but the question says to consider small m, so maybe m is like 1 or so. Let me proceed with m_l = 1 for an estimate.\n\nCalculating the paramagnetic term's expectation value:\n\nH_paramag = (e/(2m_e)) * m_l * \u0127 * B\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= (1.6e-19 C / (2 * 9.11e-31 kg)) * 1 * 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * 1 T\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the coefficient (e/(2m_e)):\n\ne/(2m_e) = (1.6e-19) / (2 * 9.11e-31) \n\nCalculating denominator: 2 *9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30\n\nSo 1.6e-19 / 1.822e-30 \u2248 (1.6 / 1.822) * 1e11 \u2248 0.878 * 1e11 \u2248 8.78e10 C/(kg)\n\nThen multiply by m_l (1) and \u0127 (1.054e-34 J\u00b7s):\n\nSo 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = 8.78 *1.054 \u2248 9.25, so 9.25e-24 (units?)\n\nWait, but let's track the units:\n\ne/(2m_e) has units of (C)/(kg).

Wait, maybe I should track the actual numbers with exponents:\n\nWait, 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = 8.78 * 1.054 = approx 9.25, and 10^10 * 10^-34 = 10^-24, so 9.25e-24.\n\nThen multiply by B (1 T):\n\nSo 9.25e-24 * 1 = 9.25e-24 J.\n\nSo the paramagnetic term's expectation value is approximately 9.25e-24 Joules.\n\nNow, the transition energy \u0394E was calculated as ~4.09e-19 J. \n\nComparing the two:\n\nParamagnetic term: ~9.25e-24 J\n\nTransition energy \u0394E: ~4.09e-19 J\n\nSo the paramagnetic term is much smaller than \u0394E. The ratio is (9.25e-24)/(4.09e-19) \u2248 (9.25 /4.09) * 1e-5 \u2248 ~2.26 * 1e-5 \u2248 2.26e-5. So that's about 0.002%, so definitely much smaller.\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \u0394E. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake here. Let me see again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the exponents in the paramagnetic term calculation. Let me recalculate that step again.\n\nThe paramagnetic term:\n\n(e/(2m_e))*(m_l * \u0127 * B)\n\nSo e/(2m_e) = 1.6e-19 C divided by (2*9.11e-31 kg) \u2192 1.6/(1.822e-30) \u2192 wait, no, the denominator is 2m_e which is 1.822e-30 kg. So 1.6e-19 / (1.822e-30) \u2192 that's (1.6 / 1.822) * 1e11 \u2192 yes, that gives ~8.78e10 C/kg.\n\nMultiply by m_l=1, so 8.78e10 C/kg.\n\nMultiply by \u0127 (1.054e-34 J\u00b7s):\n\nSo 8.78e10 * 1.054e-34 = (8.78 * 1.054) * 1e-24 \u2192 as before ~9.25e-24.\n\nMultiply by B=1 T. Since T is kg/(C\u00b7s), so the units are okay, but the numerical value is still 9.25e-24 J.\n\nThe transition energy \u0394E was 4.09e-19 J. So 9.25e-24 is 0.00000925e-19 compared to 4.09e-19. So it's about 9e-6 times smaller. So yes, the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the answer is C.\n\nAnother check: typical Zeeman splitting energies are much smaller than the transition energies in atoms. For example, in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are on the order of eV (like 13.6 eV for n=1, but transitions between levels like from n=2 to n=1 would be about 10 eV, which is 1.6e-18 J. Wait, but in the problem, the given wavelength is 0.4861 \u03bcm, which is in the visible range. Let me see what transition that corresponds to.\n\nWait, 0.4861 \u03bcm is the H-beta line? Wait, the Balmer series transitions end at n=2. Let me check the wavelength for a transition to n=2. Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The H-alpha is 656 nm (red), H-beta is 486 nm (blue), which matches the given wavelength here (0.4861 \u03bcm = 486.1 nm). So that's the H-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=5 to n=2? Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for the Balmer series:\n\nThe wavelength is given by 1/\u03bb = R*(1/2\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b2), where R is the Rydberg constant (\u22481.097e4 m^-1). \n\nSo for 0.4861 \u03bcm (486.1 nm), 1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9 m) \u2248 2.057e6 m^-1.\n\nR*(1/4 - 1/n\u00b2) = 1.097e4*(0.25 - 1/n\u00b2) = 2.057e6?\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me compute:\n\nWait, let's do it properly. Let me compute 1/\u03bb = R_H (1/2\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b2). Let me solve for n.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m,\n\n1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9) \u2248 2.057e6 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSo,\n\n2.057e6 = 1.097e4 (0.25 - 1/n\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097e4:\n\n2.057e6 / 1.097e4 \u2248 2.057 / 1.097 * 1e2 \u2248 approx 1.875 * 100 = 187.5 \u2248 0.25 - 1/n\u00b2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps my numbers are off. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, 1.097e4 is approximately 1.097 *10^4 m^-1. \n\nSo 1.097e4 * (0.25 - 1/n\u00b2) = 2.057e6 ?\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\nSuppose n is 4, then 1/4\u00b2 = 1/16, so 0.25 - 1/16 = 0.25 -0.0625 =0.1875. Multiply by 1.097e4 gives 0.1875 *1.097e4 \u2248 2067 m\u207b\u00b9, which is way less than 2.05e6. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe the Rydberg constant is 1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9?\n\nWait, no. The Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9. Wait, I think I messed up the exponent. Let me confirm: Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097373e7 m\u207b\u00b9. So that's 1.097373\u00d710^7 m\u207b\u00b9. \n\nAh, that's probably where I messed up. Let me recalculate with the correct R_H.\n\nSo, 1/\u03bb = R_H*(1/4 -1/n\u00b2). Let's plug in the numbers with R_H =1.097e7 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nGiven \u03bb=486.1e-9 m, so 1/\u03bb = 1/(486.1e-9) \u2248 2.057e6 m\u207b\u00b9.\n\nSet equal to R_H*(1/4 -1/n\u00b2):\n\n2.057e6 = 1.097e7*(0.25 - 1/n\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097e7:\n\n2.057e6 / 1.097e7 \u2248 0.1875 \u2248 0.25 - 1/n\u00b2\n\nSo 0.25 - 0.1875 = 0.0625 = 1/n\u00b2 \u2192 n\u00b2 = 1/0.0625 = 16 \u2192 n=4. \n\nAh, so that transition is from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference here is between n=4 and n=2. \n\nThe energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. So \u0394E would be E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/16) = -3.4 + 0.85 = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. \n\nConverting that to Joules: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 2.55 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 4.08e-19 J, which matches the earlier calculation of ~4.09e-19 J. So that's correct. \n\nSo the transition energy is about 4e-19 J, and the paramagnetic term is ~9e-24 J. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E.\n\n\nTo compare the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 with the transition energy \u0394E of hydrogen, we first calculate the paramagnetic term. For a magnetic field **B** = 1 T and small orbital magnetic quantum number \\( m_l \\approx 1 \\), the paramagnetic term is:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\langle H_{\\text{paramag}} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e}{2m_e} m_l \\hbar B\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the constants:\n- \\( e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\),\n- \\( m_e = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg} \\),\n- \\( \\hbar \\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\),\n- \\( B = 1 \\, \\text{T} \\),\n- \\( m_l = 1 \\),\n\nwe get:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\langle H_{\\text{paramag}} \\right\\rangle \\approx \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}}{2 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}} \\times 1 \\times 1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 1 \\approx 9.25 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nNext, the transition energy \\( \\Delta E \\) for wavelength \\( \\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} \\) (486.1 nm) is calculated using \\( \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s})(3.0 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nComparing the two values:\n- Paramagnetic term: \\( 9.25 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} \\),\n- Transition energy: \\( 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\).\n\nThe paramagnetic term is **much smaller** than \\( \\Delta E \\), so the correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this question about the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy in a hydrogen atom. Let me start by recalling what the paramagnetic coupling term is. I think it's related to the Zeeman effect, which is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic term, H, probably comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field B.\n\nThe question mentions that the magnetic field is along the Oz axis and that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. The magnetic field strength is 1 Tesla. We have to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for this coupling term, \u27e8H\u27e9, with the transition energy \u0394E of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.\n\nFirst, let's get the transition energy \u0394E. The wavelength given is 0.4861 \u00b5m, which is 486.1 nm. That seems like part of the Balmer series. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. The transition energy would be the difference between two energy levels. The wavelength can be related to the energy via the formula E = hc/\u03bb. Let me compute that.\n\nPlanck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s, and c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength \u03bb is 486.1 x 10^-9 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 \u2248 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m gives \u2248 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 \u2248 ~4.09e-19 J. Convert that to eV since the energy levels are usually in eV. Since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 ~2.556 eV. Hmm, but wait, the transition energy here would be the difference between two energy levels. Let me check if this wavelength corresponds to a specific transition.\n\nThe Balmer series transitions end at n=2. The wavelength 486.1 nm is the H-beta line, which is from n=5 to n=2? Wait, no, let me recall. The Balmer series transitions are from higher n to n=2. The wavelengths are known. Let me see:\n\nThe Balmer series lines are H-alpha (656 nm, n=3\u21922), H-beta (486 nm, n=4\u21922), H-gamma (434 nm, n=5\u21922), etc. So 486 nm corresponds to n=4 to n=2. The energy difference between n=4 and n=2 would be E4 - E2. \n\nCalculating that: E_n = -13.6 eV / n\u00b2. So E4 = -13.6/16 \u2248 -0.85 eV, E2 = -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. The transition energy \u0394E would be E2 - E4 (since the photon energy is the difference when going from higher to lower energy). Wait, actually, the energy of the emitted photon is the difference between the initial and final states. So if going from n=4 to n=2, then \u0394E = E2 - E4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. But the absolute value is 2.55 eV, which matches the earlier calculation. So \u0394E is about 2.55 eV.\n\nNow the paramagnetic coupling term. The Zeeman effect's paramagnetic term is given by H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where \u03bc is the magnetic moment. For orbital angular momentum, the magnetic moment \u03bc = (e/(2m_e)) L. The z-component would be \u03bc_z = (e/(2m_e)) m_l * \u0127, so the energy is H = -\u03bc_z B = - (e/(2m_e)) m_l \u0127 B. \n\nWait, actually, the Zeeman effect Hamiltonian for orbital angular momentum is H_Z = -\u03bc_L \u00b7 B. The expectation value \u27e8H\u27e9 would be -\u03bc_L_z * B. Since \u03bc_L = (e/(2m_e)) L_z, so \u27e8H\u27e9 = - (e/(2m_e)) \u27e8L_z\u27e9 B. But L_z is m_l \u0127, so \u27e8H\u27e9 = - (e/(2m_e)) m_l \u0127 B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps written as H = - (\u03bc_B) m_l B, where \u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton. Because \u03bc_B = (e\u0127)/(2m_e), so substituting that in: H = - \u03bc_B m_l B. \n\nSo the energy shift due to the magnetic field is \u0394E_zeeman = - \u03bc_B m_l B. \n\nThe Bohr magneton \u03bc_B is approximately 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T. Let me confirm that. Yes, \u03bc_B \u2248 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T. \n\nGiven B = 1 T, so the Zeeman energy is \u0394E_zeeman = - \u03bc_B m_l * 1 T. Since m_l can be from -l to +l in integers. The problem states that m is small. So m_l is small. Let's take m_l as order 1 (since it's small, maybe m_l is 0, \u00b11, etc.), so the energy shift would be of order \u03bc_B * 1 T. \n\nCalculating the magnitude: \u03bc_B * B \u2248 9.27e-24 J. To compare with \u0394E which is 2.55 eV, we need to convert units. Let's convert 2.55 eV to Joules. 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 2.55 eV \u2248 2.55 * 1.6e-19 \u2248 4.08e-19 J. \n\nSo the Zeeman term is ~ 9.27e-24 J, while the transition energy is ~4.08e-19 J. \n\nComparing the two: 9.27e-24 vs 4.08e-19. The Zeeman term is much smaller. So \u27e8H\u27e9 (which is the Zeeman energy here) is much less than \u0394E. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E. \n\nWait, but let me double-check if I considered the right terms. The question says \"paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy \u0394E\". The transition energy here is between two states, but the Zeeman effect is a small splitting compared to the transition energy between different n levels. Since the Zeeman splitting is typically on the order of micro-eV or similar, while the transition energy between n levels is on the order of eV, so yes, the Zeeman term is much smaller. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Zeeman shift when the atom is in a particular state, but in any case, the paramagnetic term (Zeeman) is much smaller than typical electronic transitions. \n\nSo the correct answer should be C.\n",

The expectation value \u27e8H\u27e9 would be -\u03bc_L_z * B. Since \u03bc_L = (e/(2m_e)) L_z, so \u27e8H\u27e9 = - (e/(2m_e)) \u27e8L_z\u27e9 B. But L_z is m_l \u0127, so \u27e8H\u27e9 = - (e/(2m_e)) m_l \u0127 B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps written as H = - (\u03bc_B) m_l B, where \u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton. Because \u03bc_B = (e\u0127)/(2m_e), so substituting that in: H = - \u03bc_B m_l B. \n\nSo the energy shift due to the magnetic field is \u0394E_zeeman = - \u03bc_B m_l B. \n\nThe Bohr magneton \u03bc_B is approximately 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T. Let me confirm that. Yes, \u03bc_B \u2248 9.27 x 10^-24 J/T. \n\nGiven B = 1 T, so the Zeeman energy is \u0394E_zeeman = - \u03bc_B m_l * 1 T. Since m_l can be from -l to +l in integers. The problem states that m is small. So m_l is small. Let's take m_l as order 1 (since it's small, maybe m_l is 0, \u00b11, etc.), so the energy shift would be of order \u03bc_B * 1 T. \n\nCalculating the magnitude: \u03bc_B * B \u2248 9.27e-24 J. To compare with \u0394E which is 2.55 eV, we need to convert units. Let's convert 2.55 eV to Joules. 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 2.55 eV \u2248 2.55 * 1.6e-19 \u2248 4.08e-19 J. \n\nSo the Zeeman term is ~ 9.27e-24 J, while the transition energy is ~4.08e-19 J. \n\nComparing the two: 9.27e-24 vs 4.08e-19. The Zeeman term is much smaller. So \u27e8H\u27e9 (which is the Zeeman energy here) is much less than \u0394E. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E. \n\nWait, but let me double-check if I considered the right terms. The question says \"paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy \u0394E\". The transition energy here is between two states, but the Zeeman effect is a small splitting compared to the transition energy between different n levels. Since the Zeeman splitting is typically on the order of micro-eV or similar, while the transition energy between n levels is on the order of eV, so yes, the Zeeman term is much smaller. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Zeeman shift when the atom is in a particular state, but in any case, the paramagnetic term (Zeeman) is much smaller than typical electronic transitions. \n\nSo the correct answer should be C.\n\n\nTo compare the paramagnetic coupling term \u27e8H\u27e9 with the transition energy \u0394E of the hydrogen atom, we start by calculating \u0394E using the given wavelength \u03bb = 0.4861 \u00b5m. The energy of a photon with this wavelength is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s})(3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{486.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.08 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to a transition between energy levels (e.g., n=4 to n=2 in the Balmer series).\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect and is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = -\\mu_B m_l B,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_B \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T} \\) is the Bohr magneton, \\( m_l \\) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small in magnitude), and \\( B = 1 \\, \\text{T} \\). For small \\( m_l \\) (e.g., \\( |m_l| \\leq 1 \\)), the energy shift is:\n\n\\[\n|\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle| \\approx \\mu_B \\cdot B \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]\n\nComparing the magnitudes:\n\n- \\( \\Delta E \\approx 4.08 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n- \\( |\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle| \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Thus, \\( \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
