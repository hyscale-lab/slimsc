      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about figuring out the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose. The experiment involved knocking out these genes and looking at their resistance levels. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some genetics concepts here. The question mentions that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. That probably means it's regulating the expression of other genes. The terms like epistasis, pleiotropy, and redundancy are important here. \n\nEpistasis is when one gene masks or alters the phenotype of another gene. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that plays into the resistance levels here. Gene redundancy would mean that two genes can perform the same function, so if one is knocked out, the other can compensate, but if both are knocked out, the effect is more severe.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Wild-type is 100% resistance.\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance a bit but not completely.\n- g2 (knockout of G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big hit, so G2 is probably critical.\n- g3 (knockout of G3) is 50% resistance.\n- The double mutants:\n  - g1g3: 10% resistance. \n  - g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n  - g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n\nHmm, so when you knock out both G1 and G2, the resistance is 0, same as just G2. That suggests that G1's effect is somehow dependent on G2. Because removing G2 already brings it to 0, adding G1's knockout doesn't make it worse. That might mean that G2 is epistatic over G1. Wait, but epistasis is usually about one gene affecting the expression of another. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's required for G1 to function. \n\nLooking at the g2g3 double mutant: it's 0%, same as g2 alone. So losing G3 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse. So G3's function might also be downstream of G2. Because without G2, both G1 and G3 might not be expressed. \n\nNow, the g1g3 double has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single knockout (75% and 50% respectively). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops further. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be redundant. Because each can compensate for some function. So when both are missing, their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That would be redundancy. \n\nSo putting this together, G2 is probably a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3's contributions are lost, leading to 0% resistance. The fact that g1g2 gives 0% (same as g2 alone) suggests that G1's contribution is dependent on G2. Similarly, G3's function is also dependent on G2, so G2 is the key transcription factor. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Wait, redundancy would explain the g1g3 giving lower than either single. Because when both are gone, their combined loss is worse. So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nBut the question also mentions that one is a transcription factor. So G2 being the TF fits. \n\nOption D mentions that G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. But in the case of redundancy, maybe they are in parallel pathways. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their effects are additive. So the double knockout would be worse than either single. \n\nThe term \"epistatic\" here might be tricky. Let me think again. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be masked by G1. But in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss leads to worse than either. So maybe that's not epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, the redundancy would mean that they are in parallel, so each contributes partially. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" but if they are redundant, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, maybe I need to think again. \n\nWait, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So the g2 mutant has 0% because both downstream genes are not active. \n\nThe g1g3 double mutant's resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). Since each single mutant has some resistance, but together it's worse, that suggests that they are in parallel pathways. So their functions are redundant. So when both are missing, their combined loss is more severe. So that's redundancy, so the answer would have \"gene redundancy\" between G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they are redundant, perhaps they are in parallel, so epistasis might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic part is incorrect. Let me check other options. \n\nOption C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but the question is about resistance. Not sure how that fits. \n\nOption B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, but the data for g1g3 is worse than either. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then maybe G1's effect is masked by G3. But in the double knockout, they both are gone, so that would be additive. \n\nWait, perhaps the term \"epistatic\" is being used here in a different way. Let me think again. \n\nEpistasis is when one gene's allele masks or modifies the effect of another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of a functional G1 might mask the effect of G3. But when G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect would show. But in the double mutant, both are out. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (redundant), then each can provide some resistance. The single mutants have some resistance left. The double mutant has less. \n\nThe question says that G2 is a transcription factor. So G2 must be upstream of G1 and/or G3. \n\nLooking at the data for the double mutants:\n\ng1g2 has 0% resistance. Since G2's knockout alone already gives 0%, that suggests that G1's loss doesn't affect the outcome once G2 is gone. So G1's contribution is dependent on G2. So G2 must be required for G1's function. Similarly, G3's function is also dependent on G2. \n\nThus, G2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. \n\nNow, the g1g3 double has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So when both are missing, the effect is more severe. Since each single has some resistance (75 and 50), their combined loss must be additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that are redundant. So they can each contribute to resistance, but when both are gone, the plant is much more susceptible. \n\nSo the interaction between G1 and G3 is redundancy. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nWait, but redundancy doesn't involve epistasis. Epistasis would be if one gene's effect is hidden by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the case of redundancy, both can contribute independently. \n\nHmm, maybe the \"epistatic\" part here is a distractor. Let me check the options again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, but the epistasis part is not correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the options may have different combinations. Let's see:\n\nOption D says \"gene redundancy\" between G1 and G3. That's correct. \n\nThe other part says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Wait, maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another angle. \n\nWait, let me think about the epistasis. If in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So the loss of G1 doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G1 is epistatic over G2? No, because G2 is the one causing the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' contributions are irrelevant. \n\nThe question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". So G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. \n\nIn that case, G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, so their expression depends on G2. \n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: \n\ng1 has 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are still present. Since G2 is a TF, maybe it's activating both G1 and G3. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active. So the remaining resistance comes from G3. \n\nSimilarly, in the g3 mutant, G1 is still active, so 50% resistance. Wait, but if G2 is active, then both are expressed. \n\nWait, the wild-type has 100% resistance. So the combined effect of G1 and G3 (when G2 is present) gives full resistance. \n\nSo when G1 is knocked out, the remaining G3 can only give 75%? That seems inconsistent. Wait, let me think:\n\nWait, maybe the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from each gene. Suppose that G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50% when G2 is present. Wait, but in the wild type, it's 100%. Hmm, maybe each contributes in a way that when both are present, they add up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for both G1 and G3 to be expressed. So when G2 is present, both are active. \n\nSo in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active. So the resistance is 75% (maybe G3 gives 75% alone?), but in the g3 mutant, G1 gives 50%? \n\nWait, that might not add up. Let's see:\n\nWild-type: G1 and G3 both active \u2192 100%.\n\ng1: G3 only \u2192 75% (so G3 contributes 75%?)\n\ng3: G1 only \u2192 50% (so G1 contributes 50%?)\n\nThen, when both are knocked out (g1g3), they have neither, so 0? But in the data, g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another component. Maybe the total resistance is the sum of the individual contributions. \n\nIf G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 25%, then together they make 50%, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2's own contribution plus the others. But the question states that the genes in question are the ones being tested. \n\nWait, the problem states that the genes in question are G1, G2, G3. So maybe G2 itself is also contributing, but since it's a transcription factor, maybe it's not directly providing resistance but enabling others. \n\nWait, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't be activated. Wait, but that's not the case because in the g2g3 double mutant, it's 0%, which is same as g2. So G3's knockout doesn't affect it when G2 is already gone. \n\nHmm, so maybe G2 is both a transcription factor and has its own function. But the problem says the genes in question are the three, so perhaps the main resistance is through G2's activation of G1 and G3, and perhaps G2 itself is also part of the pathway. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total resistance is the combination of all three genes. But the question states that the three are the candidates, so maybe G2's role is as a transcription factor that's required for the expression of G1 and G3. \n\nWait, let's think of the data again:\n\n- g1 (no G1) has 75% resistance. Since G2 is still there, so G2 is active, so maybe G3 is still expressed. Thus, the remaining 75% comes from G3. \n\n- g3 (no G3) has 50% resistance. Since G2 is still there, so G1 is expressed, so that's G1's contribution (50%). \n\nTherefore, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), then both their contributions are lost. Since in wild type, their combined contributions give 100%, so 75% (from G3) plus 25% (from G1?), but that might not add up. Wait, maybe the total is additive. \n\nWait, if G3 alone gives 75%, G1 alone gives 50%, then together they would give 75+50=125%, which can't be. So perhaps there's a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum resistance is when both are present. So when both are present, their combined effect gives 100%, but individually, each contributes partially. \n\nThe combined loss (g1g3) would then have neither, so 0%? But the data shows 10%, which is not 0. That's confusing. \n\nWait, the data for g1g3 is 10%. Hmm. So perhaps there's another factor. Maybe G2 has its own contribution. \n\nWait, maybe G2 itself is a gene that's necessary for some basic resistance. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), the plant has 0% resistance, so G2 must be necessary. \n\nBut if G2 is a transcription factor, then when you knock it out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. But then in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is still expressed. \n\nWait, so in the g1 mutant (no G1), G2 is still there, so G3 is expressed. The resistance is 75% (maybe G3 provides 75% when active). \n\nIn the g3 mutant (no G3), G1 is expressed, so G1 provides 50%. \n\nThen, when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), then the plant can't express either, so the only resistance would come from G2 itself. But then why is it 10%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's own function is also part of the resistance. So when G2 is present (in wild type), it's contributing along with G1 and G3. But when G2 is knocked out, all contributions are gone, leading to 0%. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me refocus. \n\nThe key points from the data:\n\n- g2 and g1g2 and g2g3 all have 0% resistance. So any mutation that includes g2 leads to 0% unless maybe when combined with others. \n\n- g1 alone is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance in a way that's additive but not entirely redundant. \n\nWait, but redundancy would mean that they can each substitute for each other. So losing one leaves the other, so the double loss is worse. \n\nIn the case of g1g3, their combined loss gives 10%, which is worse than either alone. So maybe each contributes some level. \n\nIf G1 provides 25% and G3 provides 50%, then together they'd give 75% (but wild type is 100%). Hmm, maybe there's another factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's contribution is essential. Let's think of G2 as a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2, those genes are not expressed, so their contributions are lost. \n\nThus, in wild type, the total resistance comes from G2 (as a TF) plus the products of G1 and G3. Wait, but G2's own function might be necessary for the pathway. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2's product is required for the pathway, so when it's missing, nothing works. \n\nWait, the problem says the genes in question are G1, G2, G3. The question is about their interactions. \n\nThe fact that g1g3 has 10% suggests that there's some residual resistance even when both are missing. But maybe G2's own function contributes a little? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10% is due to some other genes not considered here, but the question says the three are the candidates. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is the interaction between G1 and G3. Since their double is worse than either single, they are in parallel (redundant). \n\nThe options that mention redundancy are D and possibly C. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nThe redundancy part makes sense, but the epistasis part may not. \n\nEpistasis would mean that one gene's effect is hidden by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect doesn't matter. But in the g3 mutant (no G3), the resistance is 50%, which is G1's contribution. So maybe that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. But when G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect becomes visible. \n\nWait, in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75% (which would be G3's contribution). So maybe G3 can contribute more when G1 is not there. That would fit with G1 being epistatic over G3. \n\nSo in the wild type, G1 is present and masks G3's effect, so their combined effect is 100%, but when G1 is missing, G3 can contribute more (75%). \n\nHmm, that could be. \n\nLet me see: \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in wild type (both present), G1's effect dominates. When G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 can now have its full effect (75%). So in wild type, G1's presence suppresses G3's contribution, so together they give 100% (maybe G1 contributes more when it's there). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is the other way around. \n\nWait, but the question's data: when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). That suggests that G3 contributes more when G1 is present. \n\nWait, if G3's contribution is masked by G1, then without G1, G3 can contribute more. So when G1 is out, G3's contribution is 75%, but when both are present, maybe G3 is only contributing 25% (since 50% is from G1 and 25% from G3, totaling 75?), but that's not adding to 100. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let's look at the options again. \n\nThe correct answer must involve G2 being the transcription factor. \n\nThe redundancy between G1 and G3 is supported by their double mutant being worse than either single. \n\nLooking at the options, D and B have G2 as TF. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nOption B says G3 is epistatic over G1. \n\nWait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. If they are redundant, that would mean they contribute additively. \n\nIf G1 contributes 50% and G3 75%, then together they would give 125%, but that's over 100. So maybe the actual contributions are such that their combined presence gives 100%, but individually, they can only provide a portion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both allows full activation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G1 is epistatic over G3. For example, when G1 is present, G3's effect is suppressed, so in wild type, G1 is active and G3's contribution is less. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over more. \n\nIn that case, the g1 mutant would have higher resistance from G3 (since it's now not suppressed), leading to 75%. \n\nSo in the double mutant g1g3, both are out, so no contribution from either, leading to lower than both. \n\nBut why would that be 10%? Maybe there's some other source of resistance, but the question says the three genes are the candidates. \n\nAlternatively, the 10% is an experimental error, but we can ignore that for the question's sake. \n\nIn any case, the key points are: \n\n- G2 is the transcription factor upstream of the others, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance, and the other knockouts can still have some resistance. \n\n- The interaction between G1 and G3 is redundancy (since their double is worse than either single), so that's D or C. \n\nLooking at option D: \n\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nThe epistatic part might be confusing, but if G1 being epistatic means it masks G3's effect, then the data supports that. Because when G1 is present (wild type), the total is 100%, but when G1 is absent (g1), G3 can contribute more (75%). So that would mean that in the presence of G1, G3's contribution is less (since the total would then be 100% from G1 plus some, but I'm getting a bit stuck here). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis isn't necessary here. The redundancy is the main point. \n\nSince the options don't have an option that just says redundancy without epistasis, but the question must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back, the options:\n\nOption D mentions redundancy and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D. \n\nThe other options:\n\nOption C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. But pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, not sure how that applies here. \n\nOption B mentions same promoter, which is not indicated in the data. \n\nSo the best fit seems to be D. \n\nI think the answer is D.\n",

That suggests that G1's effect is somehow dependent on G2. Because removing G2 already brings it to 0, adding G1's knockout doesn't make it worse. That might mean that G2 is epistatic over G1. Wait, but epistasis is usually about one gene affecting the expression of another. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's required for G1 to function. \n\nLooking at the g2g3 double mutant: it's 0%, same as g2 alone. So losing G3 in addition to G2 doesn't make it worse. So G3's function might also be downstream of G2. Because without G2, both G1 and G3 might not be expressed. \n\nNow, the g1g3 double has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single knockout (75% and 50% respectively). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops further. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be redundant. Because each can compensate for some function. So when both are missing, their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That would be redundancy. \n\nSo putting this together, G2 is probably a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3's contributions are lost, leading to 0% resistance. The fact that g1g2 gives 0% (same as g2 alone) suggests that G1's contribution is dependent on G2. Similarly, G3's function is also dependent on G2, so G2 is the key transcription factor. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Wait, redundancy would explain the g1g3 giving lower than either single. Because when both are gone, their combined loss is worse. So redundancy makes sense here. \n\nBut the question also mentions that one is a transcription factor. So G2 being the TF fits. \n\nOption D mentions that G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. But in the case of redundancy, maybe they are in parallel pathways. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their effects are additive. So the double knockout would be worse than either single. \n\nThe term \"epistatic\" here might be tricky. Let me think again. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be masked by G1. But in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss leads to worse than either. So maybe that's not epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, the redundancy would mean that they are in parallel, so each contributes partially. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" but if they are redundant, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, maybe I need to think again. \n\nWait, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So the g2 mutant has 0% because both downstream genes are not active. \n\nThe g1g3 double mutant's resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). Since each single mutant has some resistance, but together it's worse, that suggests that they are in parallel pathways. So their functions are redundant. So when both are missing, their combined loss is more severe. So that's redundancy, so the answer would have \"gene redundancy\" between G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they are redundant, perhaps they are in parallel, so epistasis might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic part is incorrect. Let me check other options. \n\nOption C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but the question is about resistance. Not sure how that fits. \n\nOption B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, but the data for g1g3 is worse than either. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then maybe G1's effect is masked by G3. But in the double knockout, they both are gone, so that would be additive. \n\nWait, perhaps the term \"epistatic\" is being used here in a different way. Let me think again. \n\nEpistasis is when one gene's allele masks or modifies the effect of another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of a functional G1 might mask the effect of G3. But when G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect would show. But in the double mutant, both are out. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (redundant), then each can provide some resistance. The single mutants have some resistance left. The double mutant has less. \n\nThe question says that G2 is a transcription factor. So G2 must be upstream of G1 and/or G3. \n\nLooking at the data for the double mutants:\n\ng1g2 has 0% resistance. Since G2's knockout alone already gives 0%, that suggests that G1's loss doesn't affect the outcome once G2 is gone. So G1's contribution is dependent on G2. So G2 must be required for G1's function. Similarly, G3's function is also dependent on G2. \n\nThus, G2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. \n\nNow, the g1g3 double has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So when both are missing, the effect is more severe. Since each single has some resistance (75 and 50), their combined loss must be additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that are redundant. So they can each contribute to resistance, but when both are gone, the plant is much more susceptible. \n\nSo the interaction between G1 and G3 is redundancy. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nWait, but redundancy doesn't involve epistasis. Epistasis would be if one gene's effect is hidden by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the case of redundancy, both can contribute independently. \n\nHmm, maybe the \"epistatic\" part here is a distractor. Let me check the options again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, but the epistasis part is not correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the options may have different combinations. Let's see:\n\nOption D says \"gene redundancy\" between G1 and G3. That's correct. \n\nThe other part says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Wait, maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another angle. \n\nWait, let me think about the epistasis. If in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So the loss of G1 doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G1 is epistatic over G2? No, because G2 is the one causing the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' contributions are irrelevant. \n\nThe question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". So G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. \n\nIn that case, G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, so their expression depends on G2. \n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: \n\ng1 has 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are still present. Since G2 is a TF, maybe it's activating both G1 and G3. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active. So the remaining resistance comes from G3. \n\nSimilarly, in the g3 mutant, G1 is still active, so 50% resistance. Wait, but if G2 is active, then both are expressed. \n\nWait, the wild-type has 100% resistance. So the combined effect of G1 and G3 (when G2 is present) gives full resistance. \n\nSo when G1 is knocked out, the remaining G3 can only give 75%? That seems inconsistent. Wait, let me think:\n\nWait, maybe the total resistance is the sum of the contributions from each gene. Suppose that G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50% when G2 is present. Wait, but in the wild type, it's 100%. Hmm, maybe each contributes in a way that when both are present, they add up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for both G1 and G3 to be expressed. So when G2 is present, both are active. \n\nSo in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active. So the resistance is 75% (maybe G3 gives 75% alone?), but in the g3 mutant, G1 gives 50%? \n\nWait, that might not add up. Let's see:\n\nWild-type: G1 and G3 both active \u2192 100%.\n\ng1: G3 only \u2192 75% (so G3 contributes 75%?)\n\ng3: G1 only \u2192 50% (so G1 contributes 50%?)\n\nThen, when both are knocked out (g1g3), they have neither, so 0? But in the data, g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another component. Maybe the total resistance is the sum of the individual contributions. \n\nIf G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 25%, then together they make 50%, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2's own contribution plus the others. But the question states that the genes in question are the ones being tested. \n\nWait, the problem states that the genes in question are G1, G2, G3. So maybe G2 itself is also contributing, but since it's a transcription factor, maybe it's not directly providing resistance but enabling others. \n\nWait, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't be activated. Wait, but that's not the case because in the g2g3 double mutant, it's 0%, which is same as g2. So G3's knockout doesn't affect it when G2 is already gone. \n\nHmm, so maybe G2 is both a transcription factor and has its own function. But the problem says the genes in question are the three, so perhaps the main resistance is through G2's activation of G1 and G3, and perhaps G2 itself is also part of the pathway. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total resistance is the combination of all three genes. But the question states that the three are the candidates, so maybe G2's role is as a transcription factor that's required for the expression of G1 and G3. \n\nWait, let's think of the data again:\n\n- g1 (no G1) has 75% resistance. Since G2 is still there, so G2 is active, so maybe G3 is still expressed. Thus, the remaining 75% comes from G3. \n\n- g3 (no G3) has 50% resistance. Since G2 is still there, so G1 is expressed, so that's G1's contribution (50%). \n\nTherefore, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), then both their contributions are lost. Since in wild type, their combined contributions give 100%, so 75% (from G3) plus 25% (from G1?), but that might not add up. Wait, maybe the total is additive. \n\nWait, if G3 alone gives 75%, G1 alone gives 50%, then together they would give 75+50=125%, which can't be. So perhaps there's a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum resistance is when both are present. So when both are present, their combined effect gives 100%, but individually, each contributes partially. \n\nThe combined loss (g1g3) would then have neither, so 0%? But the data shows 10%, which is not 0. That's confusing. \n\nWait, the data for g1g3 is 10%. Hmm. So perhaps there's another factor. Maybe G2 has its own contribution. \n\nWait, maybe G2 itself is a gene that's necessary for some basic resistance. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), the plant has 0% resistance, so G2 must be necessary. \n\nBut if G2 is a transcription factor, then when you knock it out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. But then in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is still expressed. \n\nWait, so in the g1 mutant (no G1), G2 is still there, so G3 is expressed. The resistance is 75% (maybe G3 provides 75% when active). \n\nIn the g3 mutant (no G3), G1 is expressed, so G1 provides 50%. \n\nThen, when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), then the plant can't express either, so the only resistance would come from G2 itself. But then why is it 10%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's own function is also part of the resistance. So when G2 is present (in wild type), it's contributing along with G1 and G3. But when G2 is knocked out, all contributions are gone, leading to 0%. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me refocus. \n\nThe key points from the data:\n\n- g2 and g1g2 and g2g3 all have 0% resistance. So any mutation that includes g2 leads to 0% unless maybe when combined with others. \n\n- g1 alone is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance in a way that's additive but not entirely redundant. \n\nWait, but redundancy would mean that they can each substitute for each other. So losing one leaves the other, so the double loss is worse. \n\nIn the case of g1g3, their combined loss gives 10%, which is worse than either alone. So maybe each contributes some level. \n\nIf G1 provides 25% and G3 provides 50%, then together they'd give 75% (but wild type is 100%). Hmm, maybe there's another factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's contribution is essential. Let's think of G2 as a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2, those genes are not expressed, so their contributions are lost. \n\nThus, in wild type, the total resistance comes from G2 (as a TF) plus the products of G1 and G3. Wait, but G2's own function might be necessary for the pathway. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2's product is required for the pathway, so when it's missing, nothing works. \n\nWait, the problem says the genes in question are G1, G2, G3. The question is about their interactions. \n\nThe fact that g1g3 has 10% suggests that there's some residual resistance even when both are missing. But maybe G2's own function contributes a little? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10% is due to some other genes not considered here, but the question says the three are the candidates. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is the interaction between G1 and G3. Since their double is worse than either single, they are in parallel (redundant). \n\nThe options that mention redundancy are D and possibly C. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nThe redundancy part makes sense, but the epistasis part may not. \n\nEpistasis would mean that one gene's effect is hidden by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect doesn't matter. But in the g3 mutant (no G3), the resistance is 50%, which is G1's contribution. So maybe that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. But when G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect becomes visible. \n\nWait, in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75% (which would be G3's contribution). So maybe G3 can contribute more when G1 is not there. That would fit with G1 being epistatic over G3. \n\nSo in the wild type, G1 is present and masks G3's effect, so their combined effect is 100%, but when G1 is missing, G3 can contribute more (75%). \n\nHmm, that could be. \n\nLet me see: \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in wild type (both present), G1's effect dominates. When G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 can now have its full effect (75%). So in wild type, G1's presence suppresses G3's contribution, so together they give 100% (maybe G1 contributes more when it's there). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is the other way around. \n\nWait, but the question's data: when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than when G3 is knocked out (50%). That suggests that G3 contributes more when G1 is present. \n\nWait, if G3's contribution is masked by G1, then without G1, G3 can contribute more. So when G1 is out, G3's contribution is 75%, but when both are present, maybe G3 is only contributing 25% (since 50% is from G1 and 25% from G3, totaling 75?), but that's not adding to 100. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let's look at the options again. \n\nThe correct answer must involve G2 being the transcription factor. \n\nThe redundancy between G1 and G3 is supported by their double mutant being worse than either single. \n\nLooking at the options, D and B have G2 as TF. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nOption B says G3 is epistatic over G1. \n\nWait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. If they are redundant, that would mean they contribute additively. \n\nIf G1 contributes 50% and G3 75%, then together they would give 125%, but that's over 100. So maybe the actual contributions are such that their combined presence gives 100%, but individually, they can only provide a portion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both allows full activation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is that G1 is epistatic over G3. For example, when G1 is present, G3's effect is suppressed, so in wild type, G1 is active and G3's contribution is less. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over more. \n\nIn that case, the g1 mutant would have higher resistance from G3 (since it's now not suppressed), leading to 75%. \n\nSo in the double mutant g1g3, both are out, so no contribution from either, leading to lower than both. \n\nBut why would that be 10%? Maybe there's some other source of resistance, but the question says the three genes are the candidates. \n\nAlternatively, the 10% is an experimental error, but we can ignore that for the question's sake. \n\nIn any case, the key points are: \n\n- G2 is the transcription factor upstream of the others, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance, and the other knockouts can still have some resistance. \n\n- The interaction between G1 and G3 is redundancy (since their double is worse than either single), so that's D or C. \n\nLooking at option D: \n\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nThe epistatic part might be confusing, but if G1 being epistatic means it masks G3's effect, then the data supports that. Because when G1 is present (wild type), the total is 100%, but when G1 is absent (g1), G3 can contribute more (75%). So that would mean that in the presence of G1, G3's contribution is less (since the total would then be 100% from G1 plus some, but I'm getting a bit stuck here). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis isn't necessary here. The redundancy is the main point. \n\nSince the options don't have an option that just says redundancy without epistasis, but the question must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back, the options:\n\nOption D mentions redundancy and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D. \n\nThe other options:\n\nOption C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. But pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, not sure how that applies here. \n\nOption B mentions same promoter, which is not indicated in the data. \n\nSo the best fit seems to be D. \n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n\nThe experiment's results indicate that G2 is essential for resistance, as its knockout (g2) and any double mutant including g2 (g1g2, g2g3) all exhibit 0% resistance. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, as their loss alone (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%) retains partial resistance only when G2 is functional. The g1g3 double mutant shows 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, indicating redundancy between G1 and G3. Their combined loss exacerbates susceptibility, as they likely contribute to parallel pathways. The option stating G2 as a transcription factor, G1 and G3 redundancy, and G1 epistatic over G3 aligns with these observations. While epistasis is less directly supported, the redundancy and G2's upstream role are key. \n\nAnswer: D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nAnswer: $D\nWait, the final answer should be in the format 'Answer: $LETTER'. I think I made a mistake in the last line. Let me correct it.\n\nThe correct final line should be exactly as specified. \n\nThe correct answer is D. \n\nAnswer: D\n\nWait, but in the options, the correct answer is D, so the final line should be:\n\nAnswer: D\n\nBut according to the instructions, it should be exactly 'Answer: $LETTER'.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the correct answer here. The question is about gene interactions in lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose. The data given is the resistance levels of different mutants and double mutants. The options involve terms like transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, a transcription factor is a gene that regulates other genes by controlling the transcription of DNA into RNA. So if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would affect the expression of other genes downstream. Epistasis refers to a situation where the effect of one gene is masked or modified by another gene. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the presence of a recessive allele in A can hide the effect of B's alleles. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that plays into the resistance levels here. Gene redundancy would mean that two genes have overlapping functions, so losing one might not have a big effect, but losing both would be worse.\n\nThe results given are:\n\n- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistance.\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance.\n- g2 (knockout of G2) has 0% resistance.\n- g3 (knockout of G3) has 50% resistance.\n- The double mutants:\n  - g1g2: 0%\n  - g1g3: 10%\n  - g2g3: 0%\n\nHmm. Let me think step by step. Let's see which genes are essential. The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, so that's the most severe. The g1g2 and g2g3 also have 0%, so combining g2 with any other knockout doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps acting upstream of others. Since knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance, maybe it's a transcription factor that's required for the expression of other genes involved in resistance, like G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the single mutants: g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0% but worse than wild type. The g3 mutant is 50%. Now, when you have the double mutants, like g1g3, which is 10%. That's worse than either single mutant, but not as bad as 0%. Wait, but g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which is same as g2. So maybe G2 is so important that when it's knocked out, the other genes can't compensate. \n\nLet me think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe it's regulating both G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so their loss doesn't matter. So in the double mutants with g2, you can't see the effect of the other genes because G2's absence is already causing total loss of resistance. So in that case, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options, let's see each one:\n\nOption A says G1 is the transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. But the data shows that g2 has 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. If G2 were epistatic to G1, then the g2 mutant's phenotype would mask G1's effect. But that might make sense here, but I'm not sure if G1 being a TF fits. Because if G1 is a TF, then knocking it out would reduce resistance, but if G2 is epistatic over G1, maybe G2's loss would negate G1's contribution. But the g2 mutant is 0%, which is worse than G1's 75%. Not sure.\n\nOption B says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. The same promoter part might not be directly relevant here. The epistasis part: if G3 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of G3 would affect G1's expression? Not sure how that plays into the numbers. The double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So combining their knockouts makes it worse. That suggests that their functions are additive, but not epistatic. Because epistatic interactions usually involve one masking the other. So maybe they are in parallel pathways, so losing both makes it worse. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (so each affects multiple traits?), G1 is epistatic over G3. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be hidden when G1 is present. But in the g1g3 double mutant, their resistance is 10%. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3's loss would be more pronounced. Wait, but if G3 is already knocked out, then maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy (so they can compensate each other), and G1 is epistatic over G3. Redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can take over. So in the single mutants, each has some resistance. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. That would make sense if they are redundant. For example, each contributes 25%? Wait, but the single mutants have 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). That complicates things. Wait, redundancy usually would mean that losing one doesn't have a big effect. But here, losing G3 reduces resistance by half (to 50%), so maybe they aren't perfectly redundant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are downstream of it. Since G2 is a TF, knocking it out would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so their loss doesn't matter. Hence, the double mutants with g2 don't show any improvement. \n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So when G1 is knocked out, resistance is reduced but not completely. Since G1's function might be partially redundant with G3? Or maybe G1 is part of another pathway. \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then losing both would lead to additive effect. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50% (since 100-75=25% loss from g1, and 100-50=50% loss from g3). So combined, the loss would be 75%, leading to 25% resistance. But the actual result is 10%, which is less than 25. Hmm, maybe multiplicative? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's an interaction where their pathways are dependent. \n\nAlternatively, since G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active (since G2 is functional), so resistance is 75%, which is a partial loss. Similarly, in g3, G1 is still there. The double mutant g1g3 would lose both, so their combined effect is more severe, but not as bad as the total loss (since maybe the TF isn't the only pathway, but in this case, since G2 is a TF, maybe G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes, so their loss would lead to a significant drop. \n\nNow looking at the options again. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they are redundant, then their combined knockout would lead to a bigger loss. Since the single mutants have 75 and 50, which are partial, but together they get to 10, which is worse. That fits redundancy. \n\nAlso, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The options all have G1 or G2 as TF. Since G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the same as the double mutants involving G2. So G2 must be essential. If G2 is the TF, then that makes sense. \n\nNow, for the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. But how does that fit? \n\nAlternatively, if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still there (since G2 is still active), so some resistance remains. Similarly, in g3, G1 is present. But when both are knocked out, then even though G2 is active, since both downstream genes are gone, resistance drops further. But the g1g3 is 10%, which is better than 0%, so G2 must still be active. Wait, but in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, which would be when G2 is knocked out. \n\nSo the TF (G2) is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. Therefore, if G2 is present, then G1 and G3 can be expressed. So in the double mutants like g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't add anything. So that's why g1g2 is 0% same as g2. \n\nNow, the question is about the relationships between G1 and G3. The options mention redundancy, pleiotropy, etc. \n\nThe key here is that the single mutants have some resistance (so they are not completely epistatic over each other), and their double mutant has worse resistance. That suggests that they are in parallel pathways (redundant). So if they are redundant, losing both would have a more severe effect. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits. \n\nAdditionally, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. How does that work here? If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be hidden when G1 is present. But in the g1 mutant (no G1), then the effect of G3 would be more pronounced. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the wild type, G1 is present, so G3's effect is masked. So when G1 is knocked out (g1), then G3's effect becomes visible. But in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if G1 is epistatic over G3, the presence of G1 allows G3 to function. Without G1, G3 can't contribute. But that would mean that in the g1 mutant, G3's contribution is lost, so the resistance would be lower than g3 alone. But in reality, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, so the g1 is better. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let's consider epistasis in terms of the double mutant. \n\nEpistasis can be additive, dominant, or recessive. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So in the absence of G1, G3's mutation has no effect. But that would mean that the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as g1 alone. But in reality, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that contradicts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then losing G3 would mask the effect of G1. But that also doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe the epistasis here isn't directly between G1 and G3, but because of the hierarchy with G2. Since G2 is upstream, the interactions between G1 and G3 are only possible when G2 is present. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed, and their effects can combine. \n\nThe question is about the relationships between G1 and G3. The options D and C mention epistasis between G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redundancy is the key here. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout gives a worse phenotype. Since they are both downstream of G2 (the TF), their loss would lead to a bigger loss in resistance. \n\nSo looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined loss is worse), and G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, but how does the epistasis part fit here? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redundancy is the main point. The question's options might not require the epistasis part to be correct as long as redundancy is there. \n\nLooking at the options again. Let me check each option's details:\n\nOption D says G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nIf they are redundant, their combined loss would be worse than either alone, which matches the data (g1g3 is worse than either g1 or g3). \n\nThe epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, it might suppress the effect of G3's mutation. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, which lacks G1, the resistance is 75%, but the g3 mutant (with G1 present) has 50%. So when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is lower than when G1 is knocked out. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the presence of G1 (wild type), G3's mutations are masked. So if G3 is knocked out (g3), but G1 is present, the effect would be less than if G3's effect is not masked. Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe epistasis here is not the main point. Let me see the options again. \n\nOption C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here the question is about resistance levels. I'm not sure how that's relevant here. \n\nOption D's redundancy seems to fit better. \n\nThe question states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream. Since G2 is the TF, that's covered in options B, C, D. \n\nThe correct answer is likely D. Because G2 being the TF explains the 0% in g2 and the double mutants with g2. The redundancy between G1 and G3 explains why their double mutant has lower resistance than either single. \n\nThe epistasis part in D says G1 is epistatic over G3. Let me think again. \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So, in the absence of G1, the effect of G3's mutation would be more pronounced. Wait, but in g1 (no G1), the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That would suggest that when G1 is absent, the effect of G3's presence is better. So maybe G1 somehow inhibits G3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis here is not directly between G1 and G3, but the redundancy is the key. Since the question allows for the possibility that at least one is a TF, but the options may have the correct combination. \n\nLooking at the options again, D says gene redundancy between G1 and G3. Since their double mutant has a much lower resistance than either single, that's redundancy. The epistasis part might be a distractor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Let me check other options. \n\nOption C says G1 is epistatic over G3. If that's true, then in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. So if you knock out G3 (g3), the resistance is lower than if G1 is present. Wait, but g3 has 50% resistance. The wild type is 100. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G3 is knocked out, but G1 is present, the resistance would be like wild type minus G3's contribution. But how does that work? Maybe the epistasis here is not the main issue. \n\nAlternatively, since the question mentions that G2 is a TF, and the other options have different setups, D seems better. \n\nI think the best answer is D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic over G3. Even though I'm a bit confused about the epistasis part, the redundancy fits the data for g1g3. The other parts of the options need to fit as well. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is not between G1 and G3 but G2 is epistatic over them. But the options don't state that. The question says at least one gene is upstream (TF), which is G2. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe experiment involves analyzing resistance levels in lupine mutants to determine gene interactions. Key observations include:\n\n- **g2 (knockout of G2)** has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is critical for resistance. Since double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also show 0%, G2's loss likely negates the effects of other genes, suggesting G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of others.  \n- **g1 (75%)** and **g3 (50%)** retain partial resistance, implying their functions are not fully redundant but contribute to resistance.  \n- **g1g3 (10%)** shows significantly reduced resistance compared to either single mutant, indicating their combined loss exacerbates the phenotype. This suggests **redundancy** between G1 and G3: their parallel pathways compensate for each other when one is absent.  \n- **Epistasis** between G1 and G3 is less likely because their combined effect is additive (not masked). However, option D states **G1 is epistatic over G3**, which might reflect hierarchical regulation within their pathways.  \n\nOption D aligns with the data: G2 is the TF (explaining g2's 0% resistance), G1 and G3 are redundant (explaining g1g3's reduced resistance), and the epistasis claim is plausible if G1 modulates G3's activity. Other options either misassign the TF role (e.g., G1 in A) or fail to explain redundancy (e.g., pleiotropy in C).  \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the correct answer here. The question is about gene interactions in lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose. The data given is the resistance levels of different mutants and double mutants. The options involve terms like transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, a transcription factor is a gene that regulates other genes by controlling the transcription of DNA into RNA. So if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would affect the expression of other genes downstream. Epistasis refers to a situation where the effect of one gene is masked or modified by another gene. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the presence of a recessive allele in A can hide the effect of B's alleles. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that plays into the resistance levels here. Gene redundancy would mean that two genes have overlapping functions, so losing one might not have a big effect, but losing both would be worse.\n\nThe results given are:\n\n- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistance.\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance.\n- g2 (knockout of G2) has 0% resistance.\n- g3 (knockout of G3) has 50% resistance.\n- The double mutants:\n  - g1g2: 0%\n  - g1g3: 10%\n  - g2g3: 0%\n\nHmm. Let me think step by step. Let's see which genes are essential. The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, so that's the most severe. The g1g2 and g2g3 also have 0%, so combining g2 with any other knockout doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps acting upstream of others. Since knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance, maybe it's a transcription factor that's required for the expression of other genes involved in resistance, like G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the single mutants: g1 is 75%, which is better than g2's 0% but worse than wild type. The g3 mutant is 50%. Now, when you have the double mutants, like g1g3, which is 10%. That's worse than either single mutant, but not as bad as 0%. Wait, but g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which is same as g2. So maybe G2 is so important that when it's knocked out, the other genes can't compensate. \n\nLet me think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe it's regulating both G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, then both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so their loss doesn't matter. So in the double mutants with g2, you can't see the effect of the other genes because G2's absence is already causing total loss of resistance. So in that case, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options, let's see each one:\n\nOption A says G1 is the transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. But the data shows that g2 has 0%, which is worse than g1's 75%. If G2 were epistatic to G1, then the g2 mutant's phenotype would mask G1's effect. But that might make sense here, but I'm not sure if G1 being a TF fits. Because if G1 is a TF, then knocking it out would reduce resistance, but if G2 is epistatic over G1, maybe G2's loss would negate G1's contribution. But the g2 mutant is 0%, which is worse than G1's 75%. Not sure.\n\nOption B says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. The same promoter part might not be directly relevant here. The epistasis part: if G3 is epistatic over G1, then the presence of G3 would affect G1's expression? Not sure how that plays into the numbers. The double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So combining their knockouts makes it worse. That suggests that their functions are additive, but not epistatic. Because epistatic interactions usually involve one masking the other. So maybe they are in parallel pathways, so losing both makes it worse. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (so each affects multiple traits?), G1 is epistatic over G3. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be hidden when G1 is present. But in the g1g3 double mutant, their resistance is 10%. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the absence of G1, the effect of G3's loss would be more pronounced. Wait, but if G3 is already knocked out, then maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy (so they can compensate each other), and G1 is epistatic over G3. Redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can take over. So in the single mutants, each has some resistance. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. That would make sense if they are redundant. For example, each contributes 25%? Wait, but the single mutants have 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). That complicates things. Wait, redundancy usually would mean that losing one doesn't have a big effect. But here, losing G3 reduces resistance by half (to 50%), so maybe they aren't perfectly redundant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are downstream of it. Since G2 is a TF, knocking it out would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed. So in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so their loss doesn't matter. Hence, the double mutants with g2 don't show any improvement. \n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So when G1 is knocked out, resistance is reduced but not completely. Since G1's function might be partially redundant with G3? Or maybe G1 is part of another pathway. \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then losing both would lead to additive effect. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50% (since 100-75=25% loss from g1, and 100-50=50% loss from g3). So combined, the loss would be 75%, leading to 25% resistance. But the actual result is 10%, which is less than 25. Hmm, maybe multiplicative? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's an interaction where their pathways are dependent. \n\nAlternatively, since G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still active (since G2 is functional), so resistance is 75%, which is a partial loss. Similarly, in g3, G1 is still there. The double mutant g1g3 would lose both, so their combined effect is more severe, but not as bad as the total loss (since maybe the TF isn't the only pathway, but in this case, since G2 is a TF, maybe G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes, so their loss would lead to a significant drop. \n\nNow looking at the options again. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they are redundant, then their combined knockout would lead to a bigger loss. Since the single mutants have 75 and 50, which are partial, but together they get to 10, which is worse. That fits redundancy. \n\nAlso, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. The options all have G1 or G2 as TF. Since G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the same as the double mutants involving G2. So G2 must be essential. If G2 is the TF, then that makes sense. \n\nNow, for the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. But how does that fit? \n\nAlternatively, if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So in the g1 mutant, G3 is still there (since G2 is still active), so some resistance remains. Similarly, in g3, G1 is present. But when both are knocked out, then even though G2 is active, since both downstream genes are gone, resistance drops further. But the g1g3 is 10%, which is better than 0%, so G2 must still be active. Wait, but in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, which would be when G2 is knocked out. \n\nSo the TF (G2) is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3. Therefore, if G2 is present, then G1 and G3 can be expressed. So in the double mutants like g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't add anything. So that's why g1g2 is 0% same as g2. \n\nNow, the question is about the relationships between G1 and G3. The options mention redundancy, pleiotropy, etc. \n\nThe key here is that the single mutants have some resistance (so they are not completely epistatic over each other), and their double mutant has worse resistance. That suggests that they are in parallel pathways (redundant). So if they are redundant, losing both would have a more severe effect. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits. \n\nAdditionally, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. How does that work here? If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be hidden when G1 is present. But in the g1 mutant (no G1), then the effect of G3 would be more pronounced. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the wild type, G1 is present, so G3's effect is masked. So when G1 is knocked out (g1), then G3's effect becomes visible. But in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if G1 is epistatic over G3, the presence of G1 allows G3 to function. Without G1, G3 can't contribute. But that would mean that in the g1 mutant, G3's contribution is lost, so the resistance would be lower than g3 alone. But in reality, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, so the g1 is better. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let's consider epistasis in terms of the double mutant. \n\nEpistasis can be additive, dominant, or recessive. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. So in the absence of G1, G3's mutation has no effect. But that would mean that the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as g1 alone. But in reality, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that contradicts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then losing G3 would mask the effect of G1. But that also doesn't fit. \n\nWait, maybe the epistasis here isn't directly between G1 and G3, but because of the hierarchy with G2. Since G2 is upstream, the interactions between G1 and G3 are only possible when G2 is present. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed, and their effects can combine. \n\nThe question is about the relationships between G1 and G3. The options D and C mention epistasis between G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redundancy is the key here. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined knockout gives a worse phenotype. Since they are both downstream of G2 (the TF), their loss would lead to a bigger loss in resistance. \n\nSo looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined loss is worse), and G1 is epistatic over G3.
