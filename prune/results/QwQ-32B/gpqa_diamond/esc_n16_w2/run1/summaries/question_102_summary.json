      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the problem is about a new ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct in mice. The main issue is that after breeding and using the Cre-lox system, there's no green signal (eGFP) observed. So why isn't the GFP showing up?\n\nFirst, let me parse the setup. The bicistronic vector uses lox-Cre. The ligand is 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is 3' fused to eGFP. The ligand has a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor's stop is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272. They used SOX10-Cre mice. Since Cre can remove the stop cassettes, maybe the problem is about which Cre can remove which lox sites?\n\nWait, the question mentions that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the construct is bicistronic, so maybe the ligand and receptor are on the same mRNA but separated by IRES? Or maybe the stop cassettes are in the way. Let me think again.\n\nThe ligand's ORF is 5' and fused to mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand-mCherry would be expressed only if Cre removes the stop. Similarly, the receptor has a stop between it and eGFP in a lox2272 cassette. So for the receptor-eGFP to be expressed, Cre must remove the stop there too.\n\nBut the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre. The Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, I think SOX10 is a marker for some neural crest derivatives like glial cells. The problem is that after crossing, there's no green (eGFP) signal. The ligand is mCherry, but maybe the mCherry is present?\n\nWait, the question says they bred a mouse homozygous for their construct with SOX10-Cre. The construct's stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. The Cre used here is the standard Cre, which recognizes loxP sites. But lox2272 is a variant that Cre doesn't act on? Or maybe the other way around?\n\nWait, the standard Cre recognizes loxP sites. The lox2272 is a mutant site that can be used for directionality. Wait, I remember that lox2272 is a mutated lox site that Cre can recombine only if it's in the same orientation. Or perhaps the Cre can only act on loxP sites and not the other. Wait, the question says between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. So that's a standard Cre recombination target. The receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites. Since SOX10-Cre would express Cre in neural crest cells, but if the receptor's stop is in a lox2272 cassette, then Cre can't remove that stop because it only recognizes loxP. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP would still have the stop, so the eGFP wouldn't be translated. That would explain why there's no green signal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ligand's stop is removed by Cre (since it's loxP), so ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor's eGFP isn't because the Cre can't remove the lox2272 stops. So the receptor isn't expressed with eGFP. So the green (eGFP) isn't there, which matches the problem's observation. So the answer would be related to the receptor's stop cassette not being removed because the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by the Cre used here. Wait, but the question's options don't mention that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) ligand and receptor in paracrine \u2013 maybe they're not in the same cell, but the question's about the construct's expression. Not sure.\n\nB) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi \u2013 that would prevent cell surface localization but maybe still detectable by Western?\n\nC) enhancer missing \u2013 but the construct is homozygous, so maybe the promoter is there but the stop wasn't removed.\n\nD) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be translated. But the question is about the green signal. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so the protein isn't made, hence no signal. But the problem is that the construct's design uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop. Since Cre can only remove the loxP sites (like the ligand's), but the receptor's stop is in a lox2272, which Cre doesn't recognize. Therefore, the receptor's eGFP remains as a stop, so the receptor isn't fused to eGFP. Wait, actually, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So the stop is in between. If the stop is there, then the eGFP would not be translated. So the receptor would be expressed (since it's before the stop) but eGFP isn't. Wait, but the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, so the stop is between them. So if the stop is present, the eGFP part isn't translated, so the receptor isn't fused. So the eGFP isn't present. Hence, no green signal. So the reason would be that the Cre can't remove the stop for the receptor-eGFP because it's using lox2272 instead of loxP. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, maybe the problem is that when the stop is removed, the frameshift or in-frame fusion is not correct. But if the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't even translated. So the eGFP wouldn't be present. But the question is why the green signal is not observed. The eGFP is part of the receptor's construct. So if the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP is not translated, so no GFP. But the problem is that the construct's design uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop, and Cre can't remove that. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't mention that. The options given are A to D.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Maybe the fusion was not correctly done, so even if the stop is removed, the frameshift occurs. But the problem states that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They did a Western blot after transfection and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, the question says that after transfection of the plasmid into astrocytes, they used their antibodies to test the construct expression. So maybe in the transfected cells, the construct was expressed correctly, so the eGFP would be present. But in the mouse model, when crossed with Cre, it's not there. Hmm. Wait, the problem says that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So the bicistronic vector is present in both copies. But when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous. \n\nWait, the key point is that the Cre is only cutting the ligand's stop (loxP) but not the receptor's (lox2272). So ligand-mCherry would be expressed (since Cre removes the loxP-stop-loxP), so mCherry should be present, but the receptor's eGFP stop is in a lox2272 cassette which Cre can't cut. So the receptor-eGFP's stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal (eGFP) isn't there. \n\nBut the options don't have an option about the lox2272. Let me check again the options:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the stop was removed but the frameshift occurs. But if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't even translated. So why is D the answer?\n\nWait, the question says that between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in the lox2272 cassette. So if Cre can't remove that, then the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is present, but eGFP isn't. Hence, no green. The reason is that the Cre couldn't remove the stop because the lox2272 sites aren't recognized. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES is between them? The question says the ligand is at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor is 3' with IRES? Wait the structure is: ligand ORF is 5' position, fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is the stop in the loxP cassette. Then the receptor is 3', and between the receptor and eGFP is the lox2272 stop. Wait the receptor is at the 3' end, and the IRES is upstream of the receptor? The problem says \"the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element.\"\n\nAh, so the bicistronic construct has the ligand under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. But the ligand is fused to mCherry with a stop in between (but that's in a loxP cassette). Wait, the ligand's construct is ligand-ORF followed by a stop, then mCherry? Or ligand is fused to mCherry via removing the stop. So the ligand-mCherry is a single ORF if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor's stop between it and eGFP would need to be removed for the receptor-eGFP fusion. \n\nThe key is that the receptor's stop is in a lox2272 cassette. The Cre used (SOX10-Cre) can only cut loxP sites, not lox2272. Therefore, the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal (eGFP) isn't there. But none of the options mention this. Let me check again the options.\n\nHmm, the options given are A to D. Let me read again:\n\nOption C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is present for the ligand, and IRES for the receptor. Maybe the IRES isn't enough? Not sure. \n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. The eGFP isn't part of the protein. So the green signal isn't present. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the stop not be removed? Because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272. \n\nWait, but the question states that the bicistronic construct is homozygous. The Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. The problem is that in the mouse model, after breeding, the eGFP isn't seen. So the reason must be related to the construct's design. The answer options don't have the lox2272 issue. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP is a separate ORF, but since it's bicistronic via IRES, maybe the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't? Wait, the structure is: ligand (with mCherry after removing the stop) and the receptor (with eGFP after removing the stop). The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor and ligand are in a bicistronic mRNA. So the receptor would be translated via IRES, but to have the eGFP, the stop between receptor and eGFP must be removed. If the stop isn't removed, then eGFP isn't part of the receptor. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't present. \n\nThe problem is that the Cre can't remove the stop in the receptor's cassette because it's lox2272. Since the answer options don't mention that, maybe I'm missing another angle. Let me look at the options again. \n\nOption B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck there, maybe it's not visible on the cell surface, but a Western blot would still show it. The question mentions that they tested the construct in transfected astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin. So in the transfection, the construct worked, so the eGFP should be expressed when the stop is removed. But in the mouse model with Cre, maybe the receptor isn't being expressed. \n\nWait, the construct is in the mouse, and when crossed with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed (loxP) so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't present. So the answer would be that the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is D? \n\nWait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP isn't even part of the protein. The stop would prevent translation of eGFP. So the eGFP isn't made. But if the stop was removed (if the Cre could do it), then they would be in frame. But in this case, the Cre couldn't do it. So the problem is not the frame, but the stop. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The question states that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they could detect the proteins. So the construct works in vitro. But in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't visible. \n\nThe reason could be that in the mouse model, the Cre didn't remove the stop for the receptor's eGFP. Since the stop is in lox2272, Cre can't remove it, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason given in the options must be the one that corresponds to this scenario. But the options don't have an option about the lox sites. \n\nWait, looking at option D again: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop was removed, then the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. But if the stop wasn't removed, then they are not in frame. Wait no, the stop is between them. So if the stop is present, the eGFP isn't part of the protein. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is a separate ORF? No, the structure is that the receptor is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is there, the eGFP isn't translated. So the eGFP isn't present. The problem is the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't mention that. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D because the stop being there causes a frameshift? Like, if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP can't be translated. So the fusion isn't possible. But the actual issue is the stop wasn't removed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that the lox2272 cassette isn't removed by Cre, so the stop remains. But the options don't have that, so maybe the answer is D. Wait, maybe the problem is that when they designed the construct, the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that in the transfected cells, they saw the proteins. So the construct works in vitro. Therefore, the problem must be in the mouse model. \n\nWait, the bicistronic vector's ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES. So the ligand is expressed, and the receptor via IRES. But to have the eGFP, the stop must be removed. Since the Cre can't remove the lox2272, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason for no green is that the eGFP isn't made. \n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is B? If the receptor is stuck in Golgi, then it's not on the cell surface, but a Western blot would still show it. The question says they did the Western blot on transfected cells and saw signals. So the construct works. So the issue in the mouse is not the construct's expression, but maybe the cells where the Cre is active. Wait, the Cre is SOX10, which is in neural crest cells. The construct's expression might be in those cells. But the eGFP isn't there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't because the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't present. The answer options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is D. Wait, if the stop is present between receptor and eGFP, then the eGFP is a separate ORF. But since the stop is there, the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. The problem says the green signal isn't observed. So the eGFP isn't present. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA) ligand and receptor in paracrine: this would mean they act on different cells, but the question is about the construct's expression, not the interaction's effect. \n\nB) receptor stuck in Golgi: that would mean it's not on the cell surface, but the eGFP should still be present. \n\nC) enhancer missing: the CBA promoter is there, so maybe not. \n\nD) receptor and eGFP not in frame: If the stop is removed, then they are in frame. If not, the eGFP isn't part of the protein. But the stop being present is the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, so the eGFP isn't there. The reason is the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the ligand's stop is in loxP, so when Cre is present, it removes that, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't remove, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green (eGFP) is not present. The reason must be that the eGFP wasn't expressed, so the answer is D? No, D says the proteins aren't in frame. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick. The bicistronic vector uses IRES. The receptor's expression is via IRES, so even if the stop is there between receptor and eGFP, the receptor would still be expressed (since the IRES allows the second ORF to be translated). Wait, but the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's own stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So the receptor would be translated, but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't present, so no green. \n\nThe options don't have an option about the stop cassette. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP isn't part of the protein, but the stop would have to be in frame. Wait, the stop is a stop codon, so if it's present, the ribosome stops there, so the eGFP isn't translated. The receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't there. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed. \n\nSince the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is B? Or maybe the answer is C? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working properly. But the question states that in the transfected cells, the construct worked. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is D because the stop wasn't removed, but the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the stop is between them, then the fusion can't happen unless the stop is removed. The stop's presence would prevent the eGFP from being part of the protein. So the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is the stop wasn't removed, but since the options don't have that, maybe D is the closest. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. The stop is between them. So the eGFP is a separate ORF, but the stop prevents it from being translated. So the eGFP isn't part of the receptor. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the fact that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 cassette, so the stop remains. But the options don't mention that. Wait, looking back, the question says that between the ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP. Between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. The Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which can only cut loxP sites. Therefore, the ligand's stop is removed (so ligand-mCherry is expressed), but the receptor's stop is not removed (so the eGFP isn't expressed). Therefore, no green signal. The reason is that the receptor's eGFP expression is blocked by the stop not being removed. \n\nSince the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, maybe it's retained in Golgi, so the eGFP isn't visible. But the Western blot would still detect it. \n\nWait, the question says that in the transfected cells, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the construct works, meaning that when the stop is removed (in vitro?), the eGFP is expressed. But in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't there. The reason must be that the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting us to realize that the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so the first ORF is ligand (with mCherry if stop is removed). The IRES allows the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA. But the receptor has its own stop between it and eGFP. So the eGFP is a third ORF? Or is it part of the same mRNA? \n\nAlternatively, the bicistronic vector has ligand-mCherry (if stop is removed) and then the receptor-eGFP (if stop is removed). The IRES is between the two. So the receptor is translated via IRES, but to have eGFP, the stop must be removed. Since Cre can't remove the receptor's stop (lox2272), the eGFP isn't expressed. \n\nThe answer must be D, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question's options don't have the lox2272 issue. Perhaps the answer is D, but maybe the question considers that the stop being present would cause a frameshift? No, the stop is a stop codon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, then the eGFP isn't on the cell surface, but it's still present. The Western would show it, but maybe the fluorescence isn't visible. But the question says no green signal, so the eGFP isn't there. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another angle. The question says that the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices. The ligand is a coiled coil. Maybe the interaction between them is necessary for the receptor to be expressed on the cell surface. But the question is about the construct's expression, not the interaction's effect. \n\nAlternatively, option A: paracrine relationship means the ligand and receptor are in different cells, so no autocrine signaling. But that wouldn't prevent the eGFP from being expressed. \n\nOption C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, then neither would be expressed. But the ligand's stop is removed, so maybe it's expressed. \n\nWait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, so it should be expressed even without an enhancer. \n\nHmm, I'm going to have to choose. The most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP isn't part of the protein, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The stop's presence would mean that the eGFP isn't translated, so the construct isn't in frame. So D is the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe bicistronic construct uses Cre to remove stop cassettes flanked by lox sites. The ligand's stop is between loxP sites, while the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites. SOX10-Cre can only recognize loxP, so it removes the ligand's stop, allowing ligand-mCherry expression. However, the receptor's stop in lox2272 remains unremoved, preventing eGFP translation. The eGFP is not expressed because the stop between the receptor and eGFP is still present. Among the options, the most plausible explanation for no green signal (eGFP) is that the receptor and eGFP were not in frame due to the unremoved stop. However, the stop's presence directly blocks eGFP translation, not frame issues. Since the question's options do not mention lox2272, the closest is **D**, as the stop's retention disrupts the fusion, effectively making them non-functional in frame.\n\nAnswer: D",

If the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be translated. But the question is about the green signal. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so the protein isn't made, hence no signal. But the problem is that the construct's design uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop. Since Cre can only remove the loxP sites (like the ligand's), but the receptor's stop is in a lox2272, which Cre doesn't recognize. Therefore, the receptor's eGFP remains as a stop, so the receptor isn't fused to eGFP. Wait, actually, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So the stop is in between.

So the eGFP isn't present. Hence, no green signal. So the reason would be that the Cre can't remove the stop for the receptor-eGFP because it's using lox2272 instead of loxP. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, maybe the problem is that when the stop is removed, the frameshift or in-frame fusion is not correct. But if the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't even translated. So the eGFP wouldn't be present. But the question is why the green signal is not observed. The eGFP is part of the receptor's construct. So if the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP is not translated, so no GFP. But the problem is that the construct's design uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop, and Cre can't remove that. So the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't mention that. The options given are A to D.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Maybe the fusion was not correctly done, so even if the stop is removed, the frameshift occurs. But the problem states that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They did a Western blot after transfection and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, the question says that after transfection of the plasmid into astrocytes, they used their antibodies to test the construct expression. So maybe in the transfected cells, the construct was expressed correctly, so the eGFP would be present. But in the mouse model, when crossed with Cre, it's not there. Hmm. Wait, the problem says that the mice are homozygous for the construct. So the bicistronic vector is present in both copies. But when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous. \n\nWait, the key point is that the Cre is only cutting the ligand's stop (loxP) but not the receptor's (lox2272). So ligand-mCherry would be expressed (since Cre removes the loxP-stop-loxP), so mCherry should be present, but the receptor's eGFP stop is in a lox2272 cassette which Cre can't cut. So the receptor-eGFP's stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal (eGFP) isn't there. \n\nBut the options don't have an option about the lox2272. Let me check again the options:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would be a problem if the stop was removed but the frameshift occurs. But if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't even translated. So why is D the answer?\n\nWait, the question says that between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in the lox2272 cassette. So if Cre can't remove that, then the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is present, but eGFP isn't. Hence, no green. The reason is that the Cre couldn't remove the stop because the lox2272 sites aren't recognized. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES is between them? The question says the ligand is at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor is 3' with IRES? Wait the structure is: ligand ORF is 5' position, fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is the stop in the loxP cassette. Then the receptor is 3', and between the receptor and eGFP is the lox2272 stop. Wait the receptor is at the 3' end, and the IRES is upstream of the receptor? The problem says \"the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element.\"\n\nAh, so the bicistronic construct has the ligand under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. But the ligand is fused to mCherry with a stop in between (but that's in a loxP cassette). Wait, the ligand's construct is ligand-ORF followed by a stop, then mCherry? Or ligand is fused to mCherry via removing the stop. So the ligand-mCherry is a single ORF if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor's stop between it and eGFP would need to be removed for the receptor-eGFP fusion. \n\nThe key is that the receptor's stop is in a lox2272 cassette. The Cre used (SOX10-Cre) can only cut loxP sites, not lox2272. Therefore, the receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green signal (eGFP) isn't there. But none of the options mention this. Let me check again the options.\n\nHmm, the options given are A to D. Let me read again:\n\nOption C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is present for the ligand, and IRES for the receptor. Maybe the IRES isn't enough? Not sure. \n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. The eGFP isn't part of the protein. So the green signal isn't present. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the stop not be removed? Because the Cre couldn't cut the lox2272. \n\nWait, but the question states that the bicistronic construct is homozygous. The Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. The problem is that in the mouse model, after breeding, the eGFP isn't seen. So the reason must be related to the construct's design. The answer options don't have the lox2272 issue. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP is a separate ORF, but since it's bicistronic via IRES, maybe the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't? Wait, the structure is: ligand (with mCherry after removing the stop) and the receptor (with eGFP after removing the stop). The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor and ligand are in a bicistronic mRNA. So the receptor would be translated via IRES, but to have the eGFP, the stop between receptor and eGFP must be removed. If the stop isn't removed, then eGFP isn't part of the receptor. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't present. \n\nThe problem is that the Cre can't remove the stop in the receptor's cassette because it's lox2272. Since the answer options don't mention that, maybe I'm missing another angle. Let me look at the options again. \n\nOption B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck there, maybe it's not visible on the cell surface, but a Western blot would still show it. The question mentions that they tested the construct in transfected astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin. So in the transfection, the construct worked, so the eGFP should be expressed when the stop is removed. But in the mouse model with Cre, maybe the receptor isn't being expressed. \n\nWait, the construct is in the mouse, and when crossed with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed (loxP) so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, so Cre can't remove it, so the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed. So the eGFP isn't present. So the answer would be that the receptor's eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is D? \n\nWait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't removed, the eGFP isn't even part of the protein. The stop would prevent translation of eGFP. So the eGFP isn't made. But if the stop was removed (if the Cre could do it), then they would be in frame. But in this case, the Cre couldn't do it. So the problem is not the frame, but the stop. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The question states that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they could detect the proteins. So the construct works in vitro. But in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't visible. \n\nThe reason could be that in the mouse model, the Cre didn't remove the stop for the receptor's eGFP. Since the stop is in lox2272, Cre can't remove it, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason given in the options must be the one that corresponds to this scenario. But the options don't have an option about the lox sites. \n\nWait, looking at option D again: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop was removed, then the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. But if the stop wasn't removed, then they are not in frame. Wait no, the stop is between them. So if the stop is present, the eGFP isn't part of the protein. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is a separate ORF? No, the structure is that the receptor is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is there, the eGFP isn't translated. So the eGFP isn't present. The problem is the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't mention that. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D because the stop being there causes a frameshift? Like, if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP can't be translated. So the fusion isn't possible. But the actual issue is the stop wasn't removed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that the lox2272 cassette isn't removed by Cre, so the stop remains. But the options don't have that, so maybe the answer is D. Wait, maybe the problem is that when they designed the construct, the receptor and eGFP were not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that in the transfected cells, they saw the proteins. So the construct works in vitro. Therefore, the problem must be in the mouse model. \n\nWait, the bicistronic vector's ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES. So the ligand is expressed, and the receptor via IRES. But to have the eGFP, the stop must be removed. Since the Cre can't remove the lox2272, the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason for no green is that the eGFP isn't made. \n\nBut since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is B? If the receptor is stuck in Golgi, then it's not on the cell surface, but a Western blot would still show it. The question says they did the Western blot on transfected cells and saw signals. So the construct works. So the issue in the mouse is not the construct's expression, but maybe the cells where the Cre is active. Wait, the Cre is SOX10, which is in neural crest cells. The construct's expression might be in those cells. But the eGFP isn't there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't because the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't present. The answer options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is D. Wait, if the stop is present between receptor and eGFP, then the eGFP is a separate ORF. But since the stop is there, the eGFP isn't translated. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. The problem says the green signal isn't observed. So the eGFP isn't present. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA) ligand and receptor in paracrine: this would mean they act on different cells, but the question is about the construct's expression, not the interaction's effect. \n\nB) receptor stuck in Golgi: that would mean it's not on the cell surface, but the eGFP should still be present. \n\nC) enhancer missing: the CBA promoter is there, so maybe not. \n\nD) receptor and eGFP not in frame: If the stop is removed, then they are in frame. If not, the eGFP isn't part of the protein. But the stop being present is the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't, so the eGFP isn't there. The reason is the stop wasn't removed. But the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the ligand's stop is in loxP, so when Cre is present, it removes that, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't remove, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the green (eGFP) is not present. The reason must be that the eGFP wasn't expressed, so the answer is D? No, D says the proteins aren't in frame. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick. The bicistronic vector uses IRES. The receptor's expression is via IRES, so even if the stop is there between receptor and eGFP, the receptor would still be expressed (since the IRES allows the second ORF to be translated). Wait, but the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the receptor's own stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So the receptor would be translated, but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't present, so no green. \n\nThe options don't have an option about the stop cassette. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP isn't part of the protein, but the stop would have to be in frame. Wait, the stop is a stop codon, so if it's present, the ribosome stops there, so the eGFP isn't translated. The receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't there. The reason would be that the stop wasn't removed. \n\nSince the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is B? Or maybe the answer is C? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working properly. But the question states that in the transfected cells, the construct worked. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is D because the stop wasn't removed, but the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the stop is between them, then the fusion can't happen unless the stop is removed. The stop's presence would prevent the eGFP from being part of the protein. So the eGFP isn't expressed. The reason is the stop wasn't removed, but since the options don't have that, maybe D is the closest. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame. The stop is between them. So the eGFP is a separate ORF, but the stop prevents it from being translated. So the eGFP isn't part of the receptor. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the answer would be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the fact that the Cre can't remove the lox2272 cassette, so the stop remains. But the options don't mention that. Wait, looking back, the question says that between the ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP. Between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. The Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which can only cut loxP sites. Therefore, the ligand's stop is removed (so ligand-mCherry is expressed), but the receptor's stop is not removed (so the eGFP isn't expressed). Therefore, no green signal. The reason is that the receptor's eGFP expression is blocked by the stop not being removed. \n\nSince the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, maybe it's retained in Golgi, so the eGFP isn't visible. But the Western blot would still detect it. \n\nWait, the question says that in the transfected cells, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the construct works, meaning that when the stop is removed (in vitro?), the eGFP is expressed. But in the mouse, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't there. The reason must be that the stop wasn't removed, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting us to realize that the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so the first ORF is ligand (with mCherry if stop is removed). The IRES allows the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA. But the receptor has its own stop between it and eGFP. So the eGFP is a third ORF? Or is it part of the same mRNA? \n\nAlternatively, the bicistronic vector has ligand-mCherry (if stop is removed) and then the receptor-eGFP (if stop is removed). The IRES is between the two. So the receptor is translated via IRES, but to have eGFP, the stop must be removed. Since Cre can't remove the receptor's stop (lox2272), the eGFP isn't expressed. \n\nThe answer must be D, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question's options don't have the lox2272 issue. Perhaps the answer is D, but maybe the question considers that the stop being present would cause a frameshift? No, the stop is a stop codon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, then the eGFP isn't on the cell surface, but it's still present. The Western would show it, but maybe the fluorescence isn't visible. But the question says no green signal, so the eGFP isn't there. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another angle. The question says that the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices. The ligand is a coiled coil. Maybe the interaction between them is necessary for the receptor to be expressed on the cell surface. But the question is about the construct's expression, not the interaction's effect. \n\nAlternatively, option A: paracrine relationship means the ligand and receptor are in different cells, so no autocrine signaling. But that wouldn't prevent the eGFP from being expressed. \n\nOption C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, then neither would be expressed. But the ligand's stop is removed, so maybe it's expressed. \n\nWait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, so it should be expressed even without an enhancer. \n\nHmm, I'm going to have to choose. The most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop wasn't removed, then the eGFP isn't part of the protein, so the eGFP isn't expressed. The stop's presence would mean that the eGFP isn't translated, so the construct isn't in frame. So D is the answer.\n\n\nThe bicistronic construct uses Cre to remove stop cassettes flanked by lox sites. The ligand's stop is between loxP sites, while the receptor's stop is between lox2272 sites. SOX10-Cre can only recognize loxP, so it removes the ligand's stop, allowing ligand-mCherry expression. However, the receptor's stop in lox2272 remains unremoved, preventing eGFP translation. The eGFP is not expressed because the stop between the receptor and eGFP is still present. Among the options, the most plausible explanation for no green signal (eGFP) is that the receptor and eGFP were not in frame due to the unremoved stop. However, the stop's presence directly blocks eGFP translation, not frame issues. Since the question's options do not mention lox2272, the closest is **D**, as the stop's retention disrupts the fusion, effectively making them non-functional in frame.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out why there's no green signal in the offspring when they used the fluorescent microscope. The question is about a genetic construct involving a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. Let me start by breaking down the setup.\n\nFirst, the construct is bicistronic with a lox-Cre vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a constitutive promoter. The receptor part has an IRES upstream, so maybe the receptor is expressed via IRES? Wait, but there are stop sequences in loxP cassettes. Oh right, the ligand has a stop between its ORF and mCherry in a loxP-stop-loxP. The receptor's stop is between it and eGFP in lox2272-stop-lox2272. \n\nSo, when Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), it would remove the stop sequences. But since the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is a marker for them), the Cre should excise the stop sequences. Wait, but the problem says that after breeding, the offspring don't show green (eGFP from the receptor). The green comes from the receptor-eGFP. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the construct structure again. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between, which is flanked by loxP. So when Cre is present, it would remove that stop, allowing the ligand to be fused to mCherry? Wait, no. Wait, the stop is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be translated, hit the stop, and the mCherry wouldn't be expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are expressed as a fusion. \n\nSimilarly, the receptor has a stop between it and eGFP, flanked by lox2272. So Cre would remove that stop, allowing the receptor to be fused to eGFP. \n\nBut the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the offspring would have the Cre in neural crest cells. The Cre should excise both stops, leading to ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. So why is there no green?\n\nLooking at the options. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could mean that even if the stop is removed, the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is wrong, so the fusion protein isn't made. If that's the case, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES is an internal ribosomal entry site, so the receptor is expressed via IRES even without the ligand being translated? Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so maybe it's the first cistron, and the receptor is the second via IRES. But the stop between the ligand and mCherry would affect the ligand's expression. Wait, no, the ligand is the first part. Let me clarify the structure again:\n\nThe construct is bicistronic, so the ligand ORF is first, followed by a stop (in a loxP cassette), then mCherry. Wait, no, the problem says between the ligand ORF and mCherry is the stop in loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry. But that would mean the ligand is translated, stops, then mCherry isn't translated unless Cre removes the stop. \n\nWait, the bicistronic vector probably has two separate ORFs? Or is it a single transcript where the first gene (ligand) is followed by a stop, then the second gene (mCherry) after the stop? No, maybe the structure is that the ligand is fused to mCherry but separated by a stop. Hmm, perhaps the bicistronic setup uses IRES? Wait, the problem says the receptor is after the IRES. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe ligand is at the 5' position fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the ligand is translated, the stop prevents mCherry. With Cre, the stop is removed, so ligand-mCherry is expressed as a fusion. \n\nThe receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP with a stop between them in lox2272. The receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the problem states that upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the construct structure is like this: Promoter (CBA) -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry? Wait no, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but separated by a stop. Hmm. Wait, maybe the entire construct is arranged so that the ligand is first, then after a stop (which is in a loxP cassette), comes mCherry? But that would make the ligand and mCherry separate? Or perhaps the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry's ORF. But the problem says \"ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry\", so maybe the ligand is fused to mCherry, but a stop is inserted between them. So the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry is after the stop, but without Cre, the stop would prevent translation of mCherry. Wait, maybe it's a single ORF where the ligand and mCherry are separated by a stop. So the ligand is translated, stops, and then the mCherry is not translated unless the stop is removed by Cre. So with Cre, the ligand and mCherry are in frame as a fusion.\n\nThe receptor is at the 3' end, with the IRES upstream. Wait, IRES is usually used for bicistronic expression where the first ORF is translated normally, then the ribosome can skip the IRES and translate the second ORF. So maybe the receptor is downstream of the IRES, so that if the first part (ligand) is expressed, then the receptor can be translated via IRES. But the receptor has its own stop between it and eGFP. So, the receptor's stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the receptor would be translated (since the IRES allows it) but the eGFP isn't because of the stop. With Cre, the stop is removed, so receptor and eGFP are fused.\n\nNow, the problem states that after breeding, the offspring don't have green (eGFP). So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed. Possible reasons:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the reading frame is off between the receptor and eGFP, then the eGFP wouldn't be properly translated. So even if the stop is gone, the frameshift would prevent functional eGFP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working? But the question mentions that the receptor is under IRES, so perhaps the problem is with the frame. \n\nAnother option: B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein is made but not transported to the cell surface, but GFP is usually cytoplasmic unless targeted elsewhere. But the question says they're using a confocal, so maybe they should see the GFP regardless. Unless it's retained in Golgi and not fluorescent. Hmm, but that's a possibility. \n\nOption C: the enhancer for ligand/receptor is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive one, so maybe that's not it. Unless the IRES part requires some enhancer. Not sure. \n\nOption A says paracrine relationship. If the ligand and receptor are in paracrine, maybe they can't act on the same cell, but that wouldn't affect expression. The question is about the absence of green, which is the receptor-eGFP. \n\nLooking back, the problem states that they tested the construct with Western blot after transfecting primary astrocytes. If the Western blot showed that the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, then maybe the problem is in the construct. But the question says they bred the mice and saw no green. \n\nWait, but the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins. If the construct's receptor-eGFP wasn't in frame, then the antibody might not recognize it properly, but the Western blot would have shown that. The question says they did the Western blot and presumably saw the proteins? Or maybe the Western blot showed that the eGFP wasn't present, but the problem states that they \"do not observe a green signal\" in the mouse. \n\nWait, the problem says they used the antibodies to test the construct expression on Western blot after transfection. If the receptor-eGFP wasn't in frame, then maybe the fusion protein isn't made, so the Western wouldn't show the expected band. But the question says that after breeding the mice, there's no green. \n\nSo perhaps during the Western blot, they saw that the eGFP wasn't present. Wait, but the question doesn't say that. The question says they raised antibodies against overexpressed proteins (so maybe the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor) and used them to test the construct's expression. The total proteins are proportional to actin, so loading control is okay. \n\nAssuming the Western showed that the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, then the problem in the construct would be the frame. So D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the IRES wasn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow the second cistron. But if the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be a single ORF. Wait, perhaps the receptor is after the IRES, so the receptor is translated via IRES, but the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is removed. So if the stop is removed (because Cre is present), then the receptor and eGFP are in frame. \n\nIf the frame is wrong (option D), then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain no green. \n\nAnother angle: the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand-receptor pair is expressed. So the Cre should be present in those cells. Therefore, the stops should be removed. So the problem must be in the construct's design. \n\nThe answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because even if the stop is removed, if the reading frame is off between the receptor and eGFP, the eGFP won't be translated properly. So the fusion protein isn't made, hence no green signal.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe bicistronic construct has the ligand ORF fused to mCherry with a loxP-flanked stop codon, and the receptor ORF fused to eGFP with a lox2272-flanked stop codon. SOX10-Cre mice express Cre in neural crest cells, which should remove both stop codons, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusions. The absence of green fluorescence suggests the receptor-eGFP fusion is not functional. \n\nOption D posits that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop codon is removed but the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is disrupted, the eGFP portion would not be translated correctly, leading to no green signal. This explanation aligns with the experimental design and the observed result. Other options, such as Golgi retention (B) or missing enhancers (C), are less likely because the construct\u2019s design and Cre activity should theoretically allow expression, and the ligand-receptor paracrine relationship (A) does not directly explain the lack of fluorescence. The critical issue is the frame integrity between the receptor and eGFP. \n\nAnswer: D",

The receptor's stop is between it and eGFP in lox2272-stop-lox2272. \n\nSo, when Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), it would remove the stop sequences. But since the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is a marker for them), the Cre should excise the stop sequences. Wait, but the problem says that after breeding, the offspring don't show green (eGFP from the receptor). The green comes from the receptor-eGFP. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the construct structure again. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between, which is flanked by loxP. So when Cre is present, it would remove that stop, allowing the ligand to be fused to mCherry? Wait, no. Wait, the stop is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the ligand would be translated, hit the stop, and the mCherry wouldn't be expressed. But with Cre, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are expressed as a fusion. \n\nSimilarly, the receptor has a stop between it and eGFP, flanked by lox2272. So Cre would remove that stop, allowing the receptor to be fused to eGFP. \n\nBut the mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the offspring would have the Cre in neural crest cells. The Cre should excise both stops, leading to ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. So why is there no green?\n\nLooking at the options. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could mean that even if the stop is removed, the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is wrong, so the fusion protein isn't made. If that's the case, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES is an internal ribosomal entry site, so the receptor is expressed via IRES even without the ligand being translated? Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so maybe it's the first cistron, and the receptor is the second via IRES. But the stop between the ligand and mCherry would affect the ligand's expression. Wait, no, the ligand is the first part. Let me clarify the structure again:\n\nThe construct is bicistronic, so the ligand ORF is first, followed by a stop (in a loxP cassette), then mCherry. Wait, no, the problem says between the ligand ORF and mCherry is the stop in loxP-stop-loxP. So the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry. But that would mean the ligand is translated, stops, then mCherry isn't translated unless Cre removes the stop. \n\nWait, the bicistronic vector probably has two separate ORFs? Or is it a single transcript where the first gene (ligand) is followed by a stop, then the second gene (mCherry) after the stop? No, maybe the structure is that the ligand is fused to mCherry but separated by a stop. Hmm, perhaps the bicistronic setup uses IRES? Wait, the problem says the receptor is after the IRES. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe ligand is at the 5' position fused to mCherry. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the ligand is translated, the stop prevents mCherry. With Cre, the stop is removed, so ligand-mCherry is expressed as a fusion. \n\nThe receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP with a stop between them in lox2272. The receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the problem states that upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So the construct structure is like this: Promoter (CBA) -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry? Wait no, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but separated by a stop. Hmm. Wait, maybe the entire construct is arranged so that the ligand is first, then after a stop (which is in a loxP cassette), comes mCherry? But that would make the ligand and mCherry separate? Or perhaps the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry's ORF. But the problem says \"ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry\", so maybe the ligand is fused to mCherry, but a stop is inserted between them. So the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry is after the stop, but without Cre, the stop would prevent translation of mCherry. Wait, maybe it's a single ORF where the ligand and mCherry are separated by a stop. So the ligand is translated, stops, and then the mCherry is not translated unless the stop is removed by Cre. So with Cre, the ligand and mCherry are in frame as a fusion.\n\nThe receptor is at the 3' end, with the IRES upstream. Wait, IRES is usually used for bicistronic expression where the first ORF is translated normally, then the ribosome can skip the IRES and translate the second ORF. So maybe the receptor is downstream of the IRES, so that if the first part (ligand) is expressed, then the receptor can be translated via IRES. But the receptor has its own stop between it and eGFP. So, the receptor's stop is in the lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the receptor would be translated (since the IRES allows it) but the eGFP isn't because of the stop. With Cre, the stop is removed, so receptor and eGFP are fused.\n\nNow, the problem states that after breeding, the offspring don't have green (eGFP). So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed. Possible reasons:\n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is removed, but the reading frame is off between the receptor and eGFP, then the eGFP wouldn't be properly translated. So even if the stop is gone, the frameshift would prevent functional eGFP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working? But the question mentions that the receptor is under IRES, so perhaps the problem is with the frame. \n\nAnother option: B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein is made but not transported to the cell surface, but GFP is usually cytoplasmic unless targeted elsewhere. But the question says they're using a confocal, so maybe they should see the GFP regardless. Unless it's retained in Golgi and not fluorescent. Hmm, but that's a possibility. \n\nOption C: the enhancer for ligand/receptor is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive one, so maybe that's not it. Unless the IRES part requires some enhancer. Not sure. \n\nOption A says paracrine relationship. If the ligand and receptor are in paracrine, maybe they can't act on the same cell, but that wouldn't affect expression. The question is about the absence of green, which is the receptor-eGFP. \n\nLooking back, the problem states that they tested the construct with Western blot after transfecting primary astrocytes. If the Western blot showed that the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, then maybe the problem is in the construct. But the question says they bred the mice and saw no green. \n\nWait, but the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins. If the construct's receptor-eGFP wasn't in frame, then the antibody might not recognize it properly, but the Western blot would have shown that. The question says they did the Western blot and presumably saw the proteins? Or maybe the Western blot showed that the eGFP wasn't present, but the problem states that they \"do not observe a green signal\" in the mouse. \n\nWait, the problem says they used the antibodies to test the construct expression on Western blot after transfection. If the receptor-eGFP wasn't in frame, then maybe the fusion protein isn't made, so the Western wouldn't show the expected band. But the question says that after breeding the mice, there's no green. \n\nSo perhaps during the Western blot, they saw that the eGFP wasn't present. Wait, but the question doesn't say that. The question says they raised antibodies against overexpressed proteins (so maybe the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor) and used them to test the construct's expression. The total proteins are proportional to actin, so loading control is okay. \n\nAssuming the Western showed that the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, then the problem in the construct would be the frame. So D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the IRES wasn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow the second cistron. But if the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be a single ORF. Wait, perhaps the receptor is after the IRES, so the receptor is translated via IRES, but the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is removed. So if the stop is removed (because Cre is present), then the receptor and eGFP are in frame. \n\nIf the frame is wrong (option D), then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain no green. \n\nAnother angle: the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, which is where the ligand-receptor pair is expressed. So the Cre should be present in those cells. Therefore, the stops should be removed. So the problem must be in the construct's design. \n\nThe answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because even if the stop is removed, if the reading frame is off between the receptor and eGFP, the eGFP won't be translated properly. So the fusion protein isn't made, hence no green signal.\n\n\nThe bicistronic construct has the ligand ORF fused to mCherry with a loxP-flanked stop codon, and the receptor ORF fused to eGFP with a lox2272-flanked stop codon. SOX10-Cre mice express Cre in neural crest cells, which should remove both stop codons, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusions. The absence of green fluorescence suggests the receptor-eGFP fusion is not functional. \n\nOption D posits that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop codon is removed but the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is disrupted, the eGFP portion would not be translated correctly, leading to no green signal. This explanation aligns with the experimental design and the observed result. Other options, such as Golgi retention (B) or missing enhancers (C), are less likely because the construct\u2019s design and Cre activity should theoretically allow expression, and the ligand-receptor paracrine relationship (A) does not directly explain the lack of fluorescence. The critical issue is the frame integrity between the receptor and eGFP. \n\nAnswer: D",
