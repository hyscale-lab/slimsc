      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the problem gives me the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. The formation constant (K) for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. \n\nHmm, right, the formation constant (K) for the reaction between Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA (Y\u2074\u207b) to form the complex CaY\u00b2\u207b would be K = [CaY\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, that probably means the reaction has gone to completion, so the concentrations of free Ca\u00b2+ and Y\u2074\u207b would be very low because the complex is highly favored. But wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions, so maybe I need to consider the dissociation of the complex?\n\nWait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, maybe that implies that the EDTA and calcium were added in a 1:1 ratio, so all the calcium is complexed. But even so, the complex can dissociate a tiny bit. So the actual [Ca\u00b2+] would be determined by the K value. \n\nLet me set this up. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Let\u2019s assume that at equilibrium, a small amount x of Ca\u00b2+ and Y\u2074\u207b are present. The formation constant expression is:\n\nK = [CaY\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b])\n\nSince the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into Ca\u00b2+ and Y\u2074\u207b, the equilibrium concentrations would be:\n\n[CaY\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02 (since K is very large, so x is negligible compared to 0.02)\n\n[Ca\u00b2+] = x\n\n[Y\u2074\u207b] = x (since each dissociation produces one Ca\u00b2+ and one Y\u2074\u207b, so their concentrations are equal)\n\nPlugging into K:\n\n5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) \n\nSo 5e10 = 0.02 / x\u00b2 \n\nSolving for x\u00b2 = 0.02 /5e10 \n\nx\u00b2 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 \n\n2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13 \n\nThen x = sqrt(4e-13) \u2192 sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) \u2192 2 * 1e-6.5 ?\n\nWait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 which is 3.16e-7. Wait, actually sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) would be sqrt(4*1e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13). Hmm, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, 4e-13 inside the square root:\n\nsqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) \u2192 since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. \n\nWait 10^(-13) is (10^(-6.5))^2, so sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. \n\nSo 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.3e-7. \n\nTherefore, x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. \n\nSo the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is x, which is 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the math. Let me compute x squared again. \n\nOriginal equation:\n\nK = [CaY]/([Ca][Y]) \u2192 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)\n\nSo rearranged, x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13 \u2192 x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2192 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.3e-7. Yep. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. Option C is 6.3x10^-7, which matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the complex concentration is 0.02. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the equilibrium concentration, but since K is so large, the amount that dissociates is negligible, so the approximation holds. \n\nAnother way to think about it: since K is 5e10, which is very large, the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ would be extremely low. The options given are C and others. The calculation gives 6.3e-7, which is option C, so that must be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

Hmm, the question says the solution is 0.02 M in the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant K is 5x10^10. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by recalling some concepts about complex ions and formation constants.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the formation constant (K) represents the equilibrium between the free metal ions, the ligand, and the complex. The formula for the formation constant (Kf) is usually written as:\n\nKf = [Complex] / ([M][L])\n\nWhere [M] is the concentration of the free metal ion and [L] is the concentration of the free ligand. In this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so the reaction would be Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA\u2074\u207b \u21cc Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b. The K given here is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is highly favored. So, under ideal conditions (like the question states pH is ideal and temperature is 25\u00b0C), the reaction should go almost to completion.\n\nThe problem states that the solution has a concentration of 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, \"stoichiometric\" here probably means that all the calcium ions are complexed with EDTA. So initially, if we have, say, 0.02 M Ca\u00b2+ and enough EDTA, they would form the complex. But since K is so large, the amount of free Ca\u00b2+ should be very small. \n\nLet me set this up with variables. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Since the complex is formed, the EDTA concentration would also be x, assuming 1:1 stoichiometry. Wait, but actually, the EDTA would also be consumed. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the equilibrium. \n\nThe initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, does that mean that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M at equilibrium? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 0.02 M, but some of it is in the complex. Or maybe the question is saying that the solution is prepared such that all the Ca\u00b2+ is complexed, so the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But then, since K is very large, the free Ca\u00b2+ would be negligible. But the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0.02 M is the initial concentration of the complex, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So maybe the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1 between Ca and EDTA, so the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ is what we need to find. \n\nThe formation constant expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, and assuming that EDTA is in excess or whatever, but in this case, since the problem states the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the free ions would be in such a way that K is maintained. \n\nWait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the free Ca and EDTA concentrations multiply together and divided into the complex concentration equals K. But since K is so large (5e10), the denominator [Ca][EDTA] must be very small. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the EDTA and Ca are in stoichiometric amounts, so that initially, all the Ca is complexed, but at equilibrium, a tiny amount dissociates. Let me model that.\n\nSuppose that the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 0.02 M, and EDTA is also 0.02 M, so they form 0.02 M of the complex. But since K is so large, the amount that dissociates is negligible. Let x be the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ at equilibrium. Then, the EDTA concentration would also be x, and the complex would be 0.02 - x. \n\nPlugging into the K expression:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2) because x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, 5e10 \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2). Then, solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13 /1e1? Wait, let me compute that again:\n\n0.02 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5, wait sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) which is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but perhaps easier to write as 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, but maybe just compute it numerically.\n\nWait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^(1/2) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) which is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = approx 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approx 6.3e-7. That's 6.3x10^-7, which is option C. \n\nWait, so that's one of the options. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key idea is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M (assuming that the initial is all complex, so the dissociation is minimal). Then, the K expression is K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since K is huge, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so we approximate (0.02 -x) \u2248 0.02. Then, K \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2), so x\u00b2 \u2248 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Taking square root gives x=2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7. So the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Suppose the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. Then, at equilibrium, the complex concentration is 0.02 - x, and the free Ca and EDTA are each x. So, K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since K is 5e10, which is a huge number, that means the denominator must be very small. So x is going to be very small. So 0.02 -x \u22480.02. So, solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=2*1e-6.5. Since 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, 2 times that is 6.3e-7, so that's correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Wait, perhaps the 0.02 M is the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+? No, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so the complex itself is 0.02 M. So the setup I did is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So maybe the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1 between Ca and EDTA, so the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca\u00b2+ is what we need to find. \n\nThe formation constant expression is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, and assuming that EDTA is in excess or whatever, but in this case, since the problem states the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the free ions would be in such a way that K is maintained. \n\nWait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the free Ca and EDTA concentrations multiply together and divided into the complex concentration equals K. But since K is so large (5e10), the denominator [Ca][EDTA] must be very small. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the EDTA and Ca are in stoichiometric amounts, so that initially, all the Ca is complexed, but at equilibrium, a tiny amount dissociates. Let me model that.\n\nSuppose that the initial concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 0.02 M, and EDTA is also 0.02 M, so they form 0.02 M of the complex. But since K is so large, the amount that dissociates is negligible. Let x be the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ at equilibrium. Then, the EDTA concentration would also be x, and the complex would be 0.02 - x. \n\nPlugging into the K expression:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2) because x is very small compared to 0.02.\n\nSo, 5e10 \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2). Then, solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13 /1e1? Wait, let me compute that again:\n\n0.02 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5, wait sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) which is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but perhaps easier to write as 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, but maybe just compute it numerically.\n\nWait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^(1/2) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) which is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = approx 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approx 6.3e-7. That's 6.3x10^-7, which is option C. \n\nWait, so that's one of the options. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key idea is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M (assuming that the initial is all complex, so the dissociation is minimal). Then, the K expression is K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since K is huge, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so we approximate (0.02 -x) \u2248 0.02. Then, K \u2248 0.02/(x\u00b2), so x\u00b2 \u2248 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Taking square root gives x=2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7. So the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Suppose the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. Then, at equilibrium, the complex concentration is 0.02 - x, and the free Ca and EDTA are each x. So, K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since K is 5e10, which is a huge number, that means the denominator must be very small. So x is going to be very small. So 0.02 -x \u22480.02. So, solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=2*1e-6.5. Since 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, 2 times that is 6.3e-7, so that's correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented differently. Wait, perhaps the 0.02 M is the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+? No, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so the complex itself is 0.02 M. So the setup I did is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex with a formation constant \\( K = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\), we use the equilibrium expression for the formation of the complex:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the concentration of free \\( \\text{Ca}^{2+} \\) ions at equilibrium. Since the complex dissociates slightly, the concentration of \\( \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\) will also be \\( x \\), and the concentration of the complex will be \\( 0.02 - x \\approx 0.02 \\) (since \\( K \\) is very large, \\( x \\) is negligible compared to 0.02). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M} \\), corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
