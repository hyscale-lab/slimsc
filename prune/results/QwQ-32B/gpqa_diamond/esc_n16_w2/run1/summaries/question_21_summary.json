      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question has two parts: A and B. Let me start with part A first. The question is asking which of the two compounds, benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does not show tautomerism. \n\nI remember that tautomerism involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, usually involving the movement of a proton and a double bond. Common types include keto-enol tautomerism. Let me think about each compound.\n\nBenzoquinone has the structure of a benzene ring with two ketone groups (CO) attached at positions 1 and 4 (or 1 and 2 maybe? Wait, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-benzoquinone). The structure would have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but does it have any possibility for enol form? Let me visualize: each carbonyl group is a C=O. To form an enol, one of the oxygens would need to take a proton and form an -OH group, while the adjacent carbon becomes double-bonded. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl oxygens are each part of a conjugated system. I'm not sure if they can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe there's some possibility of shifting. Wait, maybe benzoquinone can undergo some tautomerism, but maybe not in common conditions?\n\nNow cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups attached at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbonyls is separated by a CH2 group? Wait, actually, the structure is three carbonyl groups attached to a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the formula C6H6O3? Hmm, but wait, maybe each of the three carbonyl groups is in a position where they can tautomerize. For example, if one of the carbonyl groups (say at position 1) could lose a proton and form an enol, but then that might lead to rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the three ketones are in positions that allow for some kind of tautomerism. Wait, I think cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is known to undergo tautomerism. For instance, it can form enol forms. Let me recall: when a molecule has multiple ketone groups, sometimes they can shift. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the trione can form a diketo and enol form? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because its structure is more stable. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The benzene ring's conjugation might stabilize the structure, so maybe it doesn't tautomerize. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, might be able to undergo some kind of tautomerism, like shifting between different enol forms. For example, each ketone can potentially form an enol. But maybe the three ketones can't all be in the same form at once. Wait, maybe the trione can tautomerize to a diketo-enol form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo some tautomerism? Let me think again. Benzoquinone's structure is two ketone groups on the benzene ring. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyl oxygens are on carbons 1 and 4. The adjacent positions have double bonds as part of the benzene ring. Wait, but maybe if one of the oxygen takes a proton from an adjacent carbon, forming an enol, but the benzene ring's conjugation might prevent that. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can form a hydroquinone via reduction, but that's a different process. Tautomerism would be a proton shift without changing the overall formula. \n\nWait, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are part of a conjugated system. The benzene ring's conjugation would stabilize the keto form, so there's no enol form. So then, benzoquinone (the A option) would not show tautomerism, making cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione the one that does. Wait, but the question asks which does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't, then the answer for A would be benzoquinone (so option D or B?), but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Wait, perhaps the trione is a stable structure and can't tautomerize. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to recall specific compounds. \n\nWait, I remember that 1,3-cyclohexanedione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But with three ketones, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because all three carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow enol forms. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the trione is a tautomeric form and can shift. Alternatively, perhaps the trione is actually a meso compound or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Wait, let's think of the structure. If the benzene ring has two ketone groups, then each ketone is part of the aromatic ring. So the structure is more rigid. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring. The double bonds in the ring prevent the carbonyl oxygens from moving. So, perhaps benzoquinone cannot tautomerize. So the one that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone, so the answer for A would be benzoquinone. \n\nThen part B is asking between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) and is not superimposable on its mirror image. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's break down the name. The formula would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's see the structure. The carbon chain is: the carboxylic acid ester group is on the third carbon (since 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COO-). Wait, maybe the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the hydroxy one) has a hydroxyl group, and the third carbon has the ester group. Let's look for chiral centers. The second carbon (the one with the -OH) has four different groups: the hydroxyl, the adjacent carbons (the first carbon is CH3, the third is a carbonyl carbon (since it's part of the ester group). Wait, the third carbon would be connected to an oxygen (as part of the ester) and another carbon. Let's see:\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nO\n||\nC-OCH3 (the ester group on the third carbon). The second carbon (the hydroxy one) is connected to CH3 (first carbon), the third carbon (carbonyl), a hydroxyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the OH) has four different substituents: the CH3 group (from the first carbon), the COOCH3 group (third carbon), the -OH, and a hydrogen. So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have a chiral center and thus optical isomerism (enantiomers). \n\nNow dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid (the two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides). The structure of fumaric acid is CH2=C(CH2COOH)2, but when esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH2COOCH3)2CH2. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is trans- butene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is CH2(COO-)CH=CH(COO-). Wait, the correct structure is: \n\nThe fumarate anion would have the two carboxyl groups on the trans side of the double bond. So when dimethylated, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Since the double bond is rigid, the molecule can't rotate, so the two ester groups are on the same side (trans). Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would not have optical isomerism. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it is meso. Wait, fumarate's structure: the two carboxyl groups are on the same side (trans) of the double bond. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So when you make the dimethyl ester, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), then there's a plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be meso and not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up with maleic acid. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, which can have optical isomerism? Wait, no, actually, both maleic and fumaric acids are meso if they are cis or trans? Wait, no, maleic acid (cis) and fumaric acid (trans) are geometric isomers. Both are achiral because of their symmetry. For example, cis-butenedioic acid (maleic acid) has a plane of symmetry (the plane through the double bond and the two -COOH groups), so it's not chiral. Similarly, trans (fumaric acid) also has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, their dimethyl esters would also be meso compounds, so they don't have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, because it has a chiral center. \n\nPutting it all together: For part A, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. For part B, the optical isomer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (which matches), and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also matches). So the answer would be B. Wait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nWait, option B is: \n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 which is what I thought. \n\nOption C has B as dimethyl fumarate, which I think is wrong. \n\nOption D has B as dimethyl fumarate, which is also wrong. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option B. \n\nWait but wait, wait another thought on part A: Benzoquinone. Let me confirm again. \n\nBenzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (like O=C-O in the ring? Wait no. The formula for benzoquinone is C6H4O2. The structure is benzene with two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached at 1 and 4 positions. Each of these is a ketone group (since they are part of the aromatic ring). \n\nIn terms of tautomerism, keto-enol tautomers involve the proton moving between the alpha carbon and the oxygen. But in benzoquinone's case, the carbonyl oxygens are part of the aromatic ring. The benzene ring's conjugation would make the keto form very stable, so enol forms would not be favored. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each of those could potentially undergo enolization. However, maybe the molecule can't tautomerize because of the ring structure? Or perhaps it can. Wait, for example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups are separated by CH2 groups. So maybe each can form an enol form. However, when one becomes an enol, the others remain as ketones. But the question is whether it shows tautomerism. Since it can exist in different forms through proton shifts, then yes, it does show tautomerism. Therefore, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone, so A is benzoquinone. \n\nThus, option B is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check option C again. Option C says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so that's the one that doesn't show tautomerism, which would be wrong). So option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the correct answers for parts A and B:\n\n**Part A**: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.  \nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The aromatic conjugation stabilizes the keto form, making enol tautomerism unfavorable. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, which can undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to the flexibility of the ring and the presence of multiple ketone groups. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.  \nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon (connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H), enabling optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, which has a plane of symmetry (meso form), making it achiral and lacking optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) and is not superimposable on its mirror image. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's break down the name. The formula would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let's see the structure. The carbon chain is: the carboxylic acid ester group is on the third carbon (since 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COO-).

Wait, the 2-hydroxypropanoate: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (the one with the OH) has four different substituents: the CH3 group (from the first carbon), the COOCH3 group (third carbon), the -OH, and a hydrogen. So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have a chiral center and thus optical isomerism (enantiomers). \n\nNow dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a trans-dicarboxylic acid (the two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides). The structure of fumaric acid is CH2=C(CH2COOH)2, but when esterified with methanol, it becomes (CH2COOCH3)2CH2. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is trans- butene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is CH2(COO-)CH=CH(COO-). Wait, the correct structure is: \n\nThe fumarate anion would have the two carboxyl groups on the trans side of the double bond. So when dimethylated, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Since the double bond is rigid, the molecule can't rotate, so the two ester groups are on the same side (trans). Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would not have optical isomerism. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it is meso. Wait, fumarate's structure: the two carboxyl groups are on the same side (trans) of the double bond. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So when you make the dimethyl ester, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), then there's a plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be meso and not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up with maleic acid. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, which can have optical isomerism? Wait, no, actually, both maleic and fumaric acids are meso if they are cis or trans? Wait, no, maleic acid (cis) and fumaric acid (trans) are geometric isomers. Both are achiral because of their symmetry. For example, cis-butenedioic acid (maleic acid) has a plane of symmetry (the plane through the double bond and the two -COOH groups), so it's not chiral. Similarly, trans (fumaric acid) also has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, their dimethyl esters would also be meso compounds, so they don't have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, because it has a chiral center. \n\nPutting it all together: For part A, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. For part B, the optical isomer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (which matches), and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also matches). So the answer would be B. Wait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nWait, option B is: \n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 which is what I thought. \n\nOption C has B as dimethyl fumarate, which I think is wrong. \n\nOption D has B as dimethyl fumarate, which is also wrong. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option B. \n\nWait but wait, wait another thought on part A: Benzoquinone.

Wait, for example, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl groups are separated by CH2 groups. So maybe each can form an enol form. However, when one becomes an enol, the others remain as ketones. But the question is whether it shows tautomerism. Since it can exist in different forms through proton shifts, then yes, it does show tautomerism. Therefore, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone, so A is benzoquinone. \n\nThus, option B is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check option C again.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the answers for parts A and B here. Let me start with part A: which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nHmm, tautomerism involves the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements, like keto-enol tautomers. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize? Or does it stay as it is? Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If there's a possibility of shifting a hydrogen, maybe between the oxygen and adjacent carbon? But I'm not sure.\n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Wait, that's three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring. Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure where every other carbon is a carbonyl. Like O=C-O-C-O-C... but arranged in a ring. But maybe this can undergo tautomerism? Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't tautomerize, whereas the trione might?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recall specific cases. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. I think it can exist in tautomeric forms, but maybe not? Wait, maybe the trione can form enol tautomers. Let me think. For example, in a ketone, enol tautomerism involves moving a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon to the oxygen. In the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps each carbonyl group can form enol forms, leading to different tautomers. So if there are three carbonyls, maybe there are multiple tautomeric forms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more stable as the keto form and doesn't tautomerize? Or maybe benzoquinone can form a tautomer like a phenol form? Wait, benzoquinone has two ketones. For example, maybe the structure can rearrange? Let me think of another angle. \n\nWait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as trichloroacetic acid analog? No, not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the trione can undergo tautomerism between different forms. For example, in a cyclic trione, each carbonyl could potentially form an enol. But since they are in a ring, maybe they can't all be enols at the same time? \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because the structure is too rigid? Or perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as benzene-1,3,5-trione, which is called trichloroacetic acid's structure but with oxygen? Wait, no, that's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe the trione is a tricarbonyl ring, which might have a tendency to form enol tautomers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at specific examples. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is another compound mentioned, but that's part of B. \n\nWait, part A is between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The question states which does NOT show tautomerism. So if one of them can't tautomerize, that's the answer. \n\nLooking up in my memory: Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) typically exists in the keto form and doesn't tautomerize to an enol because the resonance stabilization is better in the keto form. The two carbonyl groups are conjugated, providing good stability. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a tricarbonyl compound. I think this compound is actually called trione, and it can undergo tautomerism. Because each carbonyl can form an enol, but since they are on adjacent carbons, maybe they can't all be enol at the same time. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can exist in different tautomeric forms where different carbonyls are in enol form. \n\nTherefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. Wait, but wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think again. If benzoquinone's structure is more stable and doesn't tautomerize, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism. So A would be benzoquinone. Then the answer for part A is benzoquinone (since it does NOT show tautomerism). \n\nMoving on to part B: which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) or a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule is dissymmetric. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write the structure. The formula is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid ester. The structure: the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, so the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, maybe better to think: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid. The ester would be methyl lactate. The structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is three carbons. The middle carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, and the other groups: on carbon 2, the substituents would be: hydroxyl, H (since it's the middle carbon), the adjacent carbons. Wait, let's see: \n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (carboxylate ester group)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: CH3?\n\nWait, actually, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbon atoms, the hydroxyl is on C2. The C2 has substituents: OH, H (since the other two are connected to C1 and C3). Wait, let's list the groups on C2:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (which has the COOCH3 group)\n- Carbon 3 (CH3)\n- The hydroxyl group (OH)\n- A hydrogen (since it's a central carbon in the three-carbon chain). \n\nWait, so the groups around C2 are: \n\n- One group is the adjacent carbon (C1, which has the ester group)\n- Another is the adjacent carbon (C3, methyl)\n- The hydroxyl (OH)\n- And a hydrogen (H). \n\nSo four different groups: COOCH3 (through C1), CH3 (C3), OH, and H. Therefore, that carbon (C2) is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a chiral center, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the anhydride of fumaric acid, which is a trans-diol. Wait, fumaric acid is a trans-configured diene. The structure of fumaric acid is CH2=C(CHOOH)-CH2, but wait, actually, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So when esterified with methanol, the two carboxylic acid groups become COOCH3. \n\nThe structure of dimethyl fumarate would be OOC(CH2)C=CH2OOC? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Let me correct. The correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So fumaric acid is trans- but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the ester would be OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No. Wait, no, each carboxylic group is esterified. Wait, the molecule has two carboxylic acid groups. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters: each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but-2-ene is CH2-CH=CH-CH3. So but-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that would be butanedioic acid (succinic acid). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is a dienol, but actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two carboxylic acid groups are on the ends of the double bond. So when methylated, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends would be esterified. Wait, actually, dimethyl fumarate would have both carboxylic groups as methyl esters. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure should be (E)-2-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the molecule is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would have a single bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Let me get this right. \n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would have both carboxylic groups esterified with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would be if it were a single bond. Wait, no. Wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-\nCarbon 2: CH=\nCarbon 3: CH-\nCarbon 4: COOCH3?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The molecule has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two end carbons (1 and 4) each have a carboxylic acid group. So in the ester form, it's:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? But then the CH2 groups would be part of the double bond? Wait, no. Let me draw it properly.\n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid is:\n\nHOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOH\n\nSo when each carboxylic acid is esterified with methanol, replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So the structure becomes:\n\nOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3. Wait, but each carboxylic group is on carbons 1 and 4. So the molecule would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the two ester groups on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, we need to check if there is a chiral center. In this structure, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those carbons is part of the double bond, so they can't rotate freely. Let's see the groups around each carbon. \n\nCarbon 1: connected to OOC (ester group), and to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has two substituents: the double bond to carbon 3, and the connection to carbon 1 (with the ester group). The other groups on carbon 2 would be a hydrogen? Wait, carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a hydrogen. Wait, in the structure OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but no, that's with a single bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (OOC-) and carbon 3 (the double bond). Carbon 2's other substituent is a hydrogen? Or maybe another group? Let's see: \n\nThe molecule structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 1: OOC- (connected to CH2?), no. Wait, the first carbon (leftmost) is OOC-, then attached to carbon 2, which is CH= (so the double bond is between 2 and 3). Carbon 2's structure would be: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (OOC-CH-)\n- Carbon 3 (CH=)\n- A hydrogen? \n\nWait, carbon 2 has two bonds: one to carbon 1 (single bond?), and the double bond to carbon 3. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-2-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be a single bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nIn this case, each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2:\n- Connected to OOC- (from the left)\n- Double bond to C3\n- The other two bonds: one is a single bond to a hydrogen? Or maybe another group?\n\nWait, carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a hydrogen. The structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-\nCarbon 2: CH2? No, because it's double bonded. Wait, perhaps I need to think of each carbon's substituents. \n\nCarbon 2 is part of the double bond between 2 and 3. The left side is connected to carbon 1 (OOC-CH2?), no. Wait, perhaps the structure is OOC\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013COOCH3, but that would be a single bond. But fumarate has a double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think of fumaric acid as HOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents. Carbon 2 is connected to OOC- (from the first carbon) and the double bond to carbon 3, plus a single bond to a hydrogen? No, because in the double bond, each carbon has two bonds. Wait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- One bond to carbon 1 (the first carbon, which is OOC-)\n- One double bond to carbon 3 (the next carbon)\n- The remaining bonds: Carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it has two bonds in the double bond (with carbon 3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's count the bonds. \n\nCarbon 2 is part of a double bond, so it has a double bond to carbon 3 (so two bonds there), and a single bond to carbon 1 (the first carbon). So that's three bonds. Since it's a carbon, it needs four bonds. The fourth bond must be a hydrogen. Wait, yes! Carbon 2 would have a hydrogen attached. \n\nWait, the structure of the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to carbon 1 (the OOC- group)\n- A double bond to carbon 3\n- One single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- The fourth bond? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon has four bonds. Let me see again: \n\nCarbon 2: \n\n- Single bond to carbon 1 (OOC-CH2- ? No, wait the first carbon is OOC- connected to carbon 2. Wait, carbon 1 is the first in the chain, so OOC-CH2 would be if it were a single bond, but since it's a double bond between 2 and 3, perhaps the first carbon is OOC-CH2-? No. \n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think of the structure again. Fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2 (left side of the double bond):\n\n- Connected to the first carbon (which is OOC-)\n- Double bond to carbon 3\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (since the other bond must be there)\nWait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- The double bond (two bonds) to carbon 3\n- One single bond to the first carbon (the OOC- group)\n- One single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nSo that's four bonds. \n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 (right side of the double bond):\n\n- Double bond to carbon 2\n- Single bond to the fourth carbon (the COOH group)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- The fourth bond?\n\nWait, carbon 3 is connected to:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 2 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to the fourth carbon (the COO- group)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nWait, that's four bonds. \n\nSo each of carbons 2 and 3 have a hydrogen attached. \n\nNow, looking at dimethyl fumarate, which is the dimethyl ester, so the two COOH groups are replaced with COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (but with the trans configuration). \n\nNow, looking for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- OOC- (from the first carbon, which is part of the OOC-CH2? Wait, no. Carbon 2 is part of the double bond. The substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (counts as a single substituent in terms of groups)\nWait, in terms of groups around the carbon, the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The group from carbon 1: the OOC- (which is connected via a single bond)\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (so that's part of the double bond, not a substituent)\n- A hydrogen (H)\n- The other substituent? Wait, carbon 2 has four bonds. The bonds are:\n\n1. Single bond to carbon 1 (the OOC- group's carbon)\n2. Double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n3. Single bond to H.\n\nWait, that's only three bonds. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's count again. \n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- Single bond to the first carbon (OOC-)\n- Double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- Single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- That's three bonds. Wait, that can't be. A carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first carbon is OOC-, connected to carbon 2 via a single bond. Carbon 2's other bonds are:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- A single bond to a methyl group? Wait no. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nWait, the first carbon (left) is OOC- connected to carbon 2 (which is CH=). The carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to OOC- (the first carbon)\n- A double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nWait, that's four bonds. \n\nWait, the first carbon (OOC-) is connected via a single bond to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has:\n\n- OOC- (single bond)\n- double bond to C3 (two bonds)\n- H (single bond)\nSo that's four bonds. \n\nCarbon 3 (right side of the double bond):\n\n- Double bond to C2 (two bonds)\n- Single bond to the fourth carbon (which is the COOCH3 group)\n- A single bond to H (hydrogen)\n- So again, four bonds. \n\nNow, looking at each carbon for chirality:\n\nCarbon 2 has substituents:\n\n- OOC- (from the left)\n- The double bond (counts as one substituent, but actually, the double bond is part of the carbon's structure)\nWait, substituents are the groups attached. So carbon 2 is attached to:\n\n- The group from the left (OOC-CH2? No, actually, the first carbon is OOC- connected via a single bond to C2. So the substituents on C2 are:\n\n1. The group coming from the left (the OOC- group's carbon is connected to C2)\n2. The double bond to C3 (so not a substituent, but part of the bond structure)\n3. A hydrogen (H)\n4. The other substituent would be the double bond's other part? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe carbon 2 has:\n\n- The OOC- group's carbon (connected via a single bond)\n- A double bond to C3 (so the double bond is part of the structure, but the substituent here is the CH2 group? No, perhaps not.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The single bond to the first carbon (which has the OOC- group)\n- The double bond to C3 (so the substituents here are the double bond, but in terms of groups, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the substituent on C2 from that side is the rest of the molecule (the C3 and beyond)\n- The hydrogen attached to C2.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to see if there are any chiral centers in the molecule. \n\nThe molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (with the trans configuration). Let's look at each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-CH2? No, Carbon 1 is the first carbon in the chain, which is OOC- connected to C2. The substituents on C1 are:\n\n- The OOC- group (the ester)\n- A single bond to C2.\n\nCarbon 1 has only two substituents (the OOC- and the C2), so it's not a chiral center. \n\nCarbon 2: connected to:\n\n- C1 (OOC-)\n- C3 (via double bond)\n- H (hydrogen)\nWait, but the double bond is between 2 and 3. The substituents on C2 would be:\n\n- The group from C1 (OOC-)\n- The double bond to C3 (so the rest of the molecule beyond C3)\n- A hydrogen (H)\nWait, but that's three substituents. Wait, but each carbon must have four bonds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents on C2 are:\n\n- OOC- (from the left)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as one substituent but part of the structure)\n- H (hydrogen)\n- The other substituent would be the rest of the molecule beyond C3? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider if any of the carbons have four different groups. \n\nLooking at carbon 2:\n\nThe groups attached to C2 are:\n\n- The left side: the OOC- group (connected via a single bond)\n- The right side: the CH2 (but actually, it's a double bond to C3, so the other side is the C3 and beyond)\n- The H on C2\nWait, but maybe the groups are:\n\nThe substituents on C2 are:\n\n1. The OOC- (from the first carbon)\n2. The double bond to C3 (so the substituent here is the rest of the molecule beyond C3, which includes the COOCH3 group)\n3. A hydrogen (H)\nWait, but that's three groups, but carbon 2 must have four bonds. The fourth bond is the double bond itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are considered as:\n\n- The OOC- (group A)\n- The double bond to C3 (group B, which includes the rest of the molecule)\n- The H (group C)\n- The double bond's other part (the double bond is between C2 and C3, so that's part of the structure, not a substituent). \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Let's think differently: the molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The groups around each of these carbons are as follows:\n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- One single bond to the first carbon (OOC- group)\n- One double bond to C3\n- One single bond to H\nSo substituents: OOC-, C3 (through double bond), and H. Wait, but that's three, plus the double bond's other part? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents on C2 are:\n\n- The OOC- group (single bond)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as a substituent group)\n- The H (single bond)\nBut that's three. Not four. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in the double bond, the carbon is sp2 hybridized, so the groups are arranged in a plane. The substituents on C2 would be:\n\n- The OOC- group (single bond)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as one substituent)\n- The H (single bond)\n- The other substituent is the double bond's other side (which is the C3 part). \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that in the molecule OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, the carbons 2 and 3 are part of the double bond and don't have chiral centers because their substituents are not all different. \n\nCarbon 2 has substituents: \n\n- OOC- (from the first carbon)\n- Double bond to C3 (so the other side is the rest of the molecule)\n- A hydrogen (H)\nBut that's three, but maybe another group? Or perhaps the double bond's other side counts as a substituent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. Because the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have a plane of symmetry. Since the molecule is trans, the groups on each side are symmetric. For example, in the trans configuration, the groups on each side of the double bond are mirror images, but not chiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Let's imagine the structure: \n\nThe left side is OOC-CH= and the right side is CH-COOCH3. Since it's trans, the H on C2 is on one side, and the H on C3 is on the opposite side. But does this create a chiral center? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers because the two ends are symmetric. For example, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it would look the same. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer) does not have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a chiral center at the middle carbon (C2), so it can have optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nA) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it)\n\nB) The compound with optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl... which matches. \n\nWait the options:\n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 that's correct. \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate \u2192 no, because B should be methyl. \n\nSo the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so the non-tautomer is cyclo?), B = methyl...\n\nNo, the question says \"A = the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among the other pair, which shows optical isomerism (B)\". So if the non-tautomer is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), then the answer for part A is benzoquinone. So the correct option must have A as benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at options:\n\nOption B and D have A as benzoquinone. \n\nThen for B part, the optical isomer is methyl, so option B (since option B has B = methyl) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the tautomer part again. \n\nBenzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. I think it doesn't tautomerize because the two ketone groups are conjugated and more stable. The enol form would require moving hydrogens, but the resonance stabilization is better in the keto form. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Since they are on alternate carbons in a ring, maybe they can form enol tautomers. For example, each ketone could form an enol, but in a ring, maybe some can form without causing strain. So the trione can exist in different tautomeric forms, hence it shows tautomerism. \n\nTherefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nSo option B is correct. \n\nYes, so the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) is stabilized by conjugation between its two ketone groups, making it less likely to undergo tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups arranged in a ring, which allows for enol tautomerism through hydrogen shifts. Thus, benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism. \n\nFor optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center at the middle carbon (C2), which has four distinct substituents (OH, H, COOCH\u2083, and CH\u2083). This allows for enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate, however, is a trans-diene with no chiral centers due to its symmetrical structure. \n\nAnswer: B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate matches these conclusions.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the answers for parts A and B here. Let me start with part A: which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nHmm, tautomerism involves the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements, like keto-enol tautomers. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize? Or does it stay as it is? Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If there's a possibility of shifting a hydrogen, maybe between the oxygen and adjacent carbon? But I'm not sure.\n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Wait, that's three carbonyl groups on a six-membered ring. Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure where every other carbon is a carbonyl. Like O=C-O-C-O-C... but arranged in a ring. But maybe this can undergo tautomerism? Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't tautomerize, whereas the trione might?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recall specific cases. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. I think it can exist in tautomeric forms, but maybe not? Wait, maybe the trione can form enol tautomers. Let me think. For example, in a ketone, enol tautomerism involves moving a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon to the oxygen. In the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps each carbonyl group can form enol forms, leading to different tautomers. So if there are three carbonyls, maybe there are multiple tautomeric forms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more stable as the keto form and doesn't tautomerize? Or maybe benzoquinone can form a tautomer like a phenol form? Wait, benzoquinone has two ketones. For example, maybe the structure can rearrange? Let me think of another angle. \n\nWait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as trichloroacetic acid analog? No, not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the trione can undergo tautomerism between different forms. For example, in a cyclic trione, each carbonyl could potentially form an enol. But since they are in a ring, maybe they can't all be enols at the same time? \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because the structure is too rigid? Or perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as benzene-1,3,5-trione, which is called trichloroacetic acid's structure but with oxygen? Wait, no, that's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe the trione is a tricarbonyl ring, which might have a tendency to form enol tautomers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at specific examples. Let me think: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is another compound mentioned, but that's part of B. \n\nWait, part A is between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The question states which does NOT show tautomerism. So if one of them can't tautomerize, that's the answer. \n\nLooking up in my memory: Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) typically exists in the keto form and doesn't tautomerize to an enol because the resonance stabilization is better in the keto form. The two carbonyl groups are conjugated, providing good stability. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a tricarbonyl compound. I think this compound is actually called trione, and it can undergo tautomerism. Because each carbonyl can form an enol, but since they are on adjacent carbons, maybe they can't all be enol at the same time. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can exist in different tautomeric forms where different carbonyls are in enol form. \n\nTherefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism (A) would be benzoquinone. Wait, but wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think again. If benzoquinone's structure is more stable and doesn't tautomerize, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism. So A would be benzoquinone. Then the answer for part A is benzoquinone (since it does NOT show tautomerism). \n\nMoving on to part B: which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) or a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule is dissymmetric. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write the structure. The formula is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid ester. The structure: the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, so the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, maybe better to think: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid. The ester would be methyl lactate. The structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is three carbons. The middle carbon (carbon 2) has a hydroxyl group, and the other groups: on carbon 2, the substituents would be: hydroxyl, H (since it's the middle carbon), the adjacent carbons. Wait, let's see: \n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (carboxylate ester group)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: CH3?\n\nWait, actually, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbon atoms, the hydroxyl is on C2. The C2 has substituents: OH, H (since the other two are connected to C1 and C3). Wait, let's list the groups on C2:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (which has the COOCH3 group)\n- Carbon 3 (CH3)\n- The hydroxyl group (OH)\n- A hydrogen (since it's a central carbon in the three-carbon chain). \n\nWait, so the groups around C2 are: \n\n- One group is the adjacent carbon (C1, which has the ester group)\n- Another is the adjacent carbon (C3, methyl)\n- The hydroxyl (OH)\n- And a hydrogen (H). \n\nSo four different groups: COOCH3 (through C1), CH3 (C3), OH, and H. Therefore, that carbon (C2) is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a chiral center, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the anhydride of fumaric acid, which is a trans-diol. Wait, fumaric acid is a trans-configured diene. The structure of fumaric acid is CH2=C(CHOOH)-CH2, but wait, actually, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So when esterified with methanol, the two carboxylic acid groups become COOCH3. \n\nThe structure of dimethyl fumarate would be OOC(CH2)C=CH2OOC? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Let me correct. The correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So fumaric acid is trans- but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the ester would be OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No. Wait, no, each carboxylic group is esterified. Wait, the molecule has two carboxylic acid groups. So dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters: each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but-2-ene is CH2-CH=CH-CH3. So but-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that would be butanedioic acid (succinic acid). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is a dienol, but actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two carboxylic acid groups are on the ends of the double bond. So when methylated, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends would be esterified. Wait, actually, dimethyl fumarate would have both carboxylic groups as methyl esters. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure should be (E)-2-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the molecule is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would have a single bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Let me get this right. \n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would have both carboxylic groups esterified with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would be if it were a single bond. Wait, no. Wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-\nCarbon 2: CH=\nCarbon 3: CH-\nCarbon 4: COOCH3?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The molecule has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two end carbons (1 and 4) each have a carboxylic acid group. So in the ester form, it's:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's a single bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? But then the CH2 groups would be part of the double bond? Wait, no. Let me draw it properly.\n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid is:\n\nHOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOH\n\nSo when each carboxylic acid is esterified with methanol, replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So the structure becomes:\n\nOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3. Wait, but each carboxylic group is on carbons 1 and 4. So the molecule would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the two ester groups on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, we need to check if there is a chiral center. In this structure, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those carbons is part of the double bond, so they can't rotate freely. Let's see the groups around each carbon. \n\nCarbon 1: connected to OOC (ester group), and to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has two substituents: the double bond to carbon 3, and the connection to carbon 1 (with the ester group). The other groups on carbon 2 would be a hydrogen? Wait, carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a hydrogen. Wait, in the structure OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but no, that's with a single bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (OOC-) and carbon 3 (the double bond). Carbon 2's other substituent is a hydrogen? Or maybe another group? Let's see: \n\nThe molecule structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 1: OOC- (connected to CH2?), no. Wait, the first carbon (leftmost) is OOC-, then attached to carbon 2, which is CH= (so the double bond is between 2 and 3). Carbon 2's structure would be: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (OOC-CH-)\n- Carbon 3 (CH=)\n- A hydrogen? \n\nWait, carbon 2 has two bonds: one to carbon 1 (single bond?), and the double bond to carbon 3. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-2-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be a single bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nIn this case, each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2:\n- Connected to OOC- (from the left)\n- Double bond to C3\n- The other two bonds: one is a single bond to a hydrogen? Or maybe another group?\n\nWait, carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a hydrogen. The structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-\nCarbon 2: CH2? No, because it's double bonded. Wait, perhaps I need to think of each carbon's substituents. \n\nCarbon 2 is part of the double bond between 2 and 3. The left side is connected to carbon 1 (OOC-CH2?), no. Wait, perhaps the structure is OOC\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013COOCH3, but that would be a single bond. But fumarate has a double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think of fumaric acid as HOOC\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents. Carbon 2 is connected to OOC- (from the first carbon) and the double bond to carbon 3, plus a single bond to a hydrogen? No, because in the double bond, each carbon has two bonds. Wait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- One bond to carbon 1 (the first carbon, which is OOC-)\n- One double bond to carbon 3 (the next carbon)\n- The remaining bonds: Carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it has two bonds in the double bond (with carbon 3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's count the bonds. \n\nCarbon 2 is part of a double bond, so it has a double bond to carbon 3 (so two bonds there), and a single bond to carbon 1 (the first carbon). So that's three bonds. Since it's a carbon, it needs four bonds. The fourth bond must be a hydrogen. Wait, yes! Carbon 2 would have a hydrogen attached. \n\nWait, the structure of the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to carbon 1 (the OOC- group)\n- A double bond to carbon 3\n- One single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- The fourth bond? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon has four bonds. Let me see again: \n\nCarbon 2: \n\n- Single bond to carbon 1 (OOC-CH2- ? No, wait the first carbon is OOC- connected to carbon 2. Wait, carbon 1 is the first in the chain, so OOC-CH2 would be if it were a single bond, but since it's a double bond between 2 and 3, perhaps the first carbon is OOC-CH2-? No. \n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think of the structure again. Fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2 (left side of the double bond):\n\n- Connected to the first carbon (which is OOC-)\n- Double bond to carbon 3\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (since the other bond must be there)\nWait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- The double bond (two bonds) to carbon 3\n- One single bond to the first carbon (the OOC- group)\n- One single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nSo that's four bonds. \n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 (right side of the double bond):\n\n- Double bond to carbon 2\n- Single bond to the fourth carbon (the COOH group)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- The fourth bond?\n\nWait, carbon 3 is connected to:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 2 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to the fourth carbon (the COO- group)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nWait, that's four bonds. \n\nSo each of carbons 2 and 3 have a hydrogen attached. \n\nNow, looking at dimethyl fumarate, which is the dimethyl ester, so the two COOH groups are replaced with COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (but with the trans configuration). \n\nNow, looking for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- OOC- (from the first carbon, which is part of the OOC-CH2? Wait, no. Carbon 2 is part of the double bond. The substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (counts as a single substituent in terms of groups)\nWait, in terms of groups around the carbon, the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The group from carbon 1: the OOC- (which is connected via a single bond)\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (so that's part of the double bond, not a substituent)\n- A hydrogen (H)\n- The other substituent? Wait, carbon 2 has four bonds. The bonds are:\n\n1. Single bond to carbon 1 (the OOC- group's carbon)\n2. Double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n3. Single bond to H.\n\nWait, that's only three bonds. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's count again. \n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- Single bond to the first carbon (OOC-)\n- Double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- Single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- That's three bonds. Wait, that can't be. A carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first carbon is OOC-, connected to carbon 2 via a single bond. Carbon 2's other bonds are:\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\n- A single bond to a methyl group? Wait no. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nWait, the first carbon (left) is OOC- connected to carbon 2 (which is CH=). The carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to OOC- (the first carbon)\n- A double bond to carbon 3 (two bonds)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen (H)\nWait, that's four bonds. \n\nWait, the first carbon (OOC-) is connected via a single bond to carbon 2. Carbon 2 has:\n\n- OOC- (single bond)\n- double bond to C3 (two bonds)\n- H (single bond)\nSo that's four bonds. \n\nCarbon 3 (right side of the double bond):\n\n- Double bond to C2 (two bonds)\n- Single bond to the fourth carbon (which is the COOCH3 group)\n- A single bond to H (hydrogen)\n- So again, four bonds. \n\nNow, looking at each carbon for chirality:\n\nCarbon 2 has substituents:\n\n- OOC- (from the left)\n- The double bond (counts as one substituent, but actually, the double bond is part of the carbon's structure)\nWait, substituents are the groups attached. So carbon 2 is attached to:\n\n- The group from the left (OOC-CH2? No, actually, the first carbon is OOC- connected via a single bond to C2. So the substituents on C2 are:\n\n1. The group coming from the left (the OOC- group's carbon is connected to C2)\n2. The double bond to C3 (so not a substituent, but part of the bond structure)\n3. A hydrogen (H)\n4. The other substituent would be the double bond's other part? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe carbon 2 has:\n\n- The OOC- group's carbon (connected via a single bond)\n- A double bond to C3 (so the double bond is part of the structure, but the substituent here is the CH2 group? No, perhaps not.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The single bond to the first carbon (which has the OOC- group)\n- The double bond to C3 (so the substituents here are the double bond, but in terms of groups, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the substituent on C2 from that side is the rest of the molecule (the C3 and beyond)\n- The hydrogen attached to C2.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to see if there are any chiral centers in the molecule. \n\nThe molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (with the trans configuration). Let's look at each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC-CH2? No, Carbon 1 is the first carbon in the chain, which is OOC- connected to C2. The substituents on C1 are:\n\n- The OOC- group (the ester)\n- A single bond to C2.\n\nCarbon 1 has only two substituents (the OOC- and the C2), so it's not a chiral center. \n\nCarbon 2: connected to:\n\n- C1 (OOC-)\n- C3 (via double bond)\n- H (hydrogen)\nWait, but the double bond is between 2 and 3. The substituents on C2 would be:\n\n- The group from C1 (OOC-)\n- The double bond to C3 (so the rest of the molecule beyond C3)\n- A hydrogen (H)\nWait, but that's three substituents. Wait, but each carbon must have four bonds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents on C2 are:\n\n- OOC- (from the left)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as one substituent but part of the structure)\n- H (hydrogen)\n- The other substituent would be the rest of the molecule beyond C3? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider if any of the carbons have four different groups. \n\nLooking at carbon 2:\n\nThe groups attached to C2 are:\n\n- The left side: the OOC- group (connected via a single bond)\n- The right side: the CH2 (but actually, it's a double bond to C3, so the other side is the C3 and beyond)\n- The H on C2\nWait, but maybe the groups are:\n\nThe substituents on C2 are:\n\n1. The OOC- (from the first carbon)\n2. The double bond to C3 (so the substituent here is the rest of the molecule beyond C3, which includes the COOCH3 group)\n3. A hydrogen (H)\nWait, but that's three groups, but carbon 2 must have four bonds. The fourth bond is the double bond itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are considered as:\n\n- The OOC- (group A)\n- The double bond to C3 (group B, which includes the rest of the molecule)\n- The H (group C)\n- The double bond's other part (the double bond is between C2 and C3, so that's part of the structure, not a substituent). \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Let's think differently: the molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The groups around each of these carbons are as follows:\n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- One single bond to the first carbon (OOC- group)\n- One double bond to C3\n- One single bond to H\nSo substituents: OOC-, C3 (through double bond), and H. Wait, but that's three, plus the double bond's other part? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents on C2 are:\n\n- The OOC- group (single bond)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as a substituent group)\n- The H (single bond)\nBut that's three. Not four. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in the double bond, the carbon is sp2 hybridized, so the groups are arranged in a plane. The substituents on C2 would be:\n\n- The OOC- group (single bond)\n- The double bond to C3 (counts as one substituent)\n- The H (single bond)\n- The other substituent is the double bond's other side (which is the C3 part). \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that in the molecule OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, the carbons 2 and 3 are part of the double bond and don't have chiral centers because their substituents are not all different. \n\nCarbon 2 has substituents: \n\n- OOC- (from the first carbon)\n- Double bond to C3 (so the other side is the rest of the molecule)\n- A hydrogen (H)\nBut that's three, but maybe another group? Or perhaps the double bond's other side counts as a substituent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. Because the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have a plane of symmetry. Since the molecule is trans, the groups on each side are symmetric. For example, in the trans configuration, the groups on each side of the double bond are mirror images, but not chiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Let's imagine the structure: \n\nThe left side is OOC-CH= and the right side is CH-COOCH3. Since it's trans, the H on C2 is on one side, and the H on C3 is on the opposite side. But does this create a chiral center? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers because the two ends are symmetric. For example, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, it would look the same. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer) does not have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate) has a chiral center at the middle carbon (C2), so it can have optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nA) The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it)\n\nB) The compound with optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl... which matches. \n\nWait the options:\n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 that's correct. \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate \u2192 no, because B should be methyl. \n\nSo the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so the non-tautomer is cyclo?), B = methyl...\n\nNo, the question says \"A = the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among the other pair, which shows optical isomerism (B)\". So if the non-tautomer is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), then the answer for part A is benzoquinone. So the correct option must have A as benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at options:\n\nOption B and D have A as benzoquinone. \n\nThen for B part, the optical isomer is methyl, so option B (since option B has B = methyl) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the tautomer part again. \n\nBenzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. I think it doesn't tautomerize because the two ketone groups are conjugated and more stable. The enol form would require moving hydrogens, but the resonance stabilization is better in the keto form. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Since they are on alternate carbons in a ring, maybe they can form enol tautomers. For example, each ketone could form an enol, but in a ring, maybe some can form without causing strain. So the trione can exist in different tautomeric forms, hence it shows tautomerism. \n\nTherefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nSo option B is correct. \n\nYes, so the answer should be B.\n\n\nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) is stabilized by conjugation between its two ketone groups, making it less likely to undergo tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups arranged in a ring, which allows for enol tautomerism through hydrogen shifts. Thus, benzoquinone (A) does not show tautomerism. \n\nFor optical isomerism, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center at the middle carbon (C2), which has four distinct substituents (OH, H, COOCH\u2083, and CH\u2083). This allows for enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate, however, is a trans-diene with no chiral centers due to its symmetrical structure. \n\nAnswer: B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate matches these conclusions.\n\nAnswer: B",
