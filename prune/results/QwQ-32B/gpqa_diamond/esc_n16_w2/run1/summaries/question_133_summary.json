      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Wait, orthophosphate ions... Oh right, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But the problem mentions KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about their ions.\n\nFirst, let me note the components. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ ions and HPO4^2- ions. The water of crystallization probably doesn't matter here once dissolved. \n\nSo the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These are conjugate base pairs. Wait, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate, and HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate. So this is a buffer solution. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but how does PO4^3- come into play here? Because the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4. Let me recall the dissociation steps. \n\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3\n2. H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n3. HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\nSo the third dissociation produces PO4^3-. The problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution that has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe solution contains both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). Since the pH here is determined by the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation (Ka2). But the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the third dissociation. \n\nSo to find [PO4^3-], we can use the third dissociation's Ka3. The formula would be Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]. But first, we need to find the pH of the solution to get [H+]. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH can be calculated from the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?\n\nYes, exactly. Since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, their ratio will determine the pH. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let's see:\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since that's where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the conjugate pair) is:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWe can compute the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- first. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of each compound.\n\nFor KH2PO4: \nMass is 1.00 g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007347 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMass is 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005616 mol.\n\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.200 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = moles KH2PO4 / 0.200 L = 0.007347 / 0.2 \u2248 0.036735 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = moles Na2HPO4 / 0.200 L = 0.005616 / 0.2 \u2248 0.02808 M\n\nNow, plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npKa2 is the log of 1/(Ka2). Wait, pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2248 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThen pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02808 / 0.036735). \n\nLet me compute the ratio: 0.02808 / 0.036735 \u2248 0.7644.\n\nlog(0.7644) is approximately. Let's see, log(0.76) is about -0.118, log(0.77) is around -0.1139. Since 0.7644 is between, maybe about -0.117. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, log(0.7644) = ln(0.7644)/ln(10). Let me see, ln(0.7644) is approx -0.267, divided by 2.3026 gives approx -0.116. So pH \u22487.2076 -0.116 \u22487.0916.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.09.\n\nNow, to find [PO4^3-], we look at the third dissociation: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M. [H+] can be found from pH: [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09). Let me calculate that.\n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.812, so 1e-7 *0.812 \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.12e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 = 5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.12e-8 \u2248 (5.0544 /8.12) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.6225 *1e-6 = 6.225e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.2e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). Wait, but let me check the calculations again for accuracy.\n\nWait, let's redo the [H+] calculation precisely. pH is 7.0916, so:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0916). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nThe exponent is -7.0916. Let me break it into 10^-7 * 10^-0.0916.\n\n10^-0.0916: Let me use natural logs. Let me compute ln(10^-0.0916) = -0.0916 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0916 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2108. So exponent is e^-0.2108 \u22480.810. So 10^-0.0916 \u22480.810, so [H+] = 1e-7 *0.810 =8.10e-8. That's consistent with before.\n\nNow numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02808:\n\nLet me compute 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544/8.1)*1e-6.\n\n5.0544 divided by 8.1 is approximately 0.624 (since 8.1 *0.624=5.0544). Exactly, so 0.624 *1e-6 =6.24e-7 M. That's exactly option A. But wait, the options have A as 6.24e-7. So that's a match.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the steps. Let me retrace.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that again. 136.09 is the molar mass. 1 /136.09 is approximately 0.007347. That's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99. 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005616 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations divided by 0.2 L:\n\n0.007347/0.2 is 0.036735 M H2PO4^-.\n\n0.005616/0.2 is 0.02808 M HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch for the second dissociation (since that's the buffer between H2PO4 and HPO4^2-):\n\npH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )\n\nYes. pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me check that again. 6.2e-8, log(6.2)=0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)=0.7924-8= -7.2076. So pKa2=7.2076. Correct.\n\nThe ratio is 0.02808 /0.036735 = let's compute that again:\n\n0.02808 divided by 0.036735. Let me do this division:\n\n0.02808 /0.036735 = (2808 / 36735)*10^-3? Wait, maybe better as:\n\n2808 / 36735 \u2248 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644. Correct.\n\nLog(0.7644) \u2248-0.117. So pH is 7.2076 -0.117 = 7.0906. So pH\u22487.09.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^-7.09. As computed, ~8.1e-8.\n\nThen [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/8.1e-8.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value:\n\n1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544. So numerator is 0.050544e-12. \n\nDivided by 8.1e-8:\n\n0.050544e-12 /8.1e-8 = (0.050544 /8.1) * 1e-4 \n\nWait, wait, 1e-12 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-4. So 0.050544 divided by8.1 equals 0.00624 (since 8.1 *0.00624 =0.050544). So 0.00624e-4 is 6.24e-7. Exactly. So that gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.\n\nHmm, but the options given are A) 6.24x10^-7, B)5.48e-7, etc. So that would be A. But wait, let me check if I considered the correct form of the equilibrium.\n\nWait, in the third dissociation, HPO4^2- loses a proton to become PO4^3-. So the expression is correct: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nYes, that's right. The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M, which is correct. So the calculation seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering activity coefficients or something, but I don't think so. Since the problem is probably expecting an ideal solution.\n\nWait another thought: when we have the solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their concentrations are as calculated, but when considering the third dissociation, do we need to account for any changes in their concentrations? Like, when HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-, that would slightly decrease [HPO4^2-] and increase [PO4^3-]. However, since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the amount dissociated would be negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as ~0.02808 M, which is valid here.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 6.24x10^-7. But wait the options have B and D as close numbers. Let me check my calculation again for possible arithmetic errors.\n\nWait, let me recompute the division step:\n\nNumerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544 \u2192 0.050544e-12 \u2192 5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by [H+] which is 8.1e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544 /8.1) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0544 divided by 8.1: Let me do this division more precisely.\n\n8.1 \u00d7 0.624 = 5.0544 exactly. So 5.0544 /8.1 =0.624 \u2192 0.624 \u00d71e-6 =6.24e-7. Yes.\n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the answer must be A. But wait the options are listed as:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD)3.97x10^-7 M \n\nHmm, so why is there an option B? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation?\n\nWait, the ratio is [base]/[acid], where the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- (since the dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2-). So the equation is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the molar masses again. \n\nKH2PO4: K is 39.1, H2PO4 is H2 (2), P (30.97), O4 (64). So total: 39.1 + 2 +30.97 +64 = 136.07. The given Mw is 136.09, so that's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 22.99*2=45.98, HPO4 is H (1), P (30.97), O4 (64), plus 2 H2O (each 18.015, so 36.03). So total:\n\n45.98 + (1 +30.97 +64) +36.03 = 45.98 +95.97 +36.03 = 45.98+132.0 =177.98, which matches the given 177.99. So moles are correct.\n\nHmm, then perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio? Let me recheck:\n\nH2PO4^- concentration: 0.007347 mol /0.2 L =0.036735 M.\n\nHPO4^2- is 0.005616 /0.2 =0.02808 M.\n\nRatio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644.\n\nLog(0.7644)=?\n\nLet me compute log(0.7644). Let's see, log(0.76)=?\n\nWe can use logarithm tables or approximate:\n\nlog(0.76) = log(7.6\u00d710^-1) = log(7.6) -1 \u22480.8808 -1= -0.1192.\n\nSimilarly, log(0.7644) is a bit higher. Let me compute using natural logs:\n\nln(0.7644) = ?\n\nLet me compute ln(0.7644):\n\nWe know that ln(0.75)= -0.28768207, ln(0.76)= ?\n\nAlternatively, approximate:\n\nLet me use ln(0.7644)= ?\n\nLet me think. Let me use Taylor series around 0.75. Hmm, maybe better to use calculator-like steps.\n\nAlternatively, note that 0.7644 is 0.75 +0.0144.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use log10:\n\nLet me recall that log(7.644\u00d710^-1) = log(7.644) -1.\n\nlog(7.644) is log(7) + log(1.092). Log(7)=0.8451, log(1.092)= ~0.0385. So total log(7.644)= ~0.8836, so log(0.7644)=0.8836 -1= -0.1164.\n\nThus, log(0.7644) is approximately -0.1164.\n\nSo pH =7.2076 -0.1164=7.0912.\n\nSo pH is about 7.091.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^-7.091. Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.091 = 10^(-7 -0.091)=10^-7 *10^-0.091.\n\n10^-0.091: Let me compute ln(10^-0.091)= -0.091 *ln(10)= -0.091*2.302585\u2248-0.2095.\n\nSo e^-0.2095 \u22481 -0.2095 + (0.2095)^2/2 - ... \u2248 approx 0.8115. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator-like steps:\n\n10^0.091 = e^(0.091 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.091 *2.3026)= e^0.2095 \u22481.233. So 10^-0.091 \u22481/1.233\u22480.811.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo the [H+] is ~8.11e-8.\n\nThus, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/8.11e-8.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8 *0.02808 =0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: 5.0544e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0544/8.11)*1e-6.\n\n5.0544 divided by 8.11: Let's see, 8.11 \u00d70.623 = 5.054 (since 8.11*0.6=4.866, 8.11*0.023=0.18653 \u2192 total ~4.866+0.1865=5.0525). So \u22480.623. Thus, 0.623 \u00d71e-6 =6.23e-7, which rounds to 6.23e-7, matching option A's 6.24e-7. The slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps, but the given options have A as the closest. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. But wait, the problem states \"orthophosphate ions\", which is PO4^3-, so all steps are correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might confuse orthophosphate with other forms, but in this case, the question is clear. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? Let me check again.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, is there any other source of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? No, because the other compounds are fully dissociated. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A. But the options have B and D. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the molar masses?\n\nWait KH2PO4's molar mass is given as 136.09. Let me recalculate:\n\nK: 39.1, H2: 2.02, P: 30.97, O4: 64. So total 39.1 +2.02+30.97+64 = 39.1+2.02=41.12; 41.12+30.97=72.09; 72.09+64=136.09. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nNa2: 2\u00d722.99=45.98; HPO4: H is 1.01, P 30.97, O4 64 \u2192 1.01+30.97+64=95.98; plus 2 H2O: 2\u00d718.015=36.03. So total:45.98 +95.98+36.03=45.98+95.98=141.96; +36.03 gives 177.99. Correct.\n\nMoles are correct. \n\nHmm. Then why option A is present and matches. Maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused why the options are there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Wait, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644. log of that is indeed ~-0.116, so pH ~7.09. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? No, the question says orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Ka3 value. The problem states Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Yes. \n\nWait, let me check if the third dissociation is indeed HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo all steps are correct. The answer must be A. But let me check the options again. The first option is A)6.24x10^-7 which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer is A. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think if there is another approach. Suppose the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-. Since HPO4^2- is a weak base, but the Ka3 is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the calculation is as done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants us to consider that the solution has some other equilibria? Like, the presence of H2PO4^- could also contribute to PO4^3- through multiple steps? But no, because H2PO4^- would first lose a proton to become HPO4^2- before losing another to become PO4^3-. Since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of PO4^3- is governed by the third Ka and the [HPO4^2-].\n\nYes, so the approach is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Wait, orthophosphate ions... Oh right, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But the problem mentions KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about their ions.\n\nFirst, let me note the components. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. When it dissolves, it should give Na+ ions and HPO4^2- ions. The water of crystallization probably doesn't matter here once dissolved. \n\nSo the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These are conjugate base pairs. Wait, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate, and HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate. So this is a buffer solution. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, but how does PO4^3- come into play here? Because the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4. Let me recall the dissociation steps. \n\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u21cc H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3\n2. H2PO4^- \u21cc H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8\n3. HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12\n\nSo the third dissociation produces PO4^3-. The problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution that has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThe solution contains both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). Since the pH here is determined by the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which corresponds to the second dissociation (Ka2). But the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the third dissociation. \n\nSo to find [PO4^3-], we can use the third dissociation's Ka3. The formula would be Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]. But first, we need to find the pH of the solution to get [H+]. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH can be calculated from the buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?\n\nYes, exactly. Since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, their ratio will determine the pH. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let's see:\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since that's where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the conjugate pair) is:\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\nWe can compute the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- first. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of each compound.\n\nFor KH2PO4: \nMass is 1.00 g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007347 mol.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\nMass is 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005616 mol.\n\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.200 L.\n\nSo concentrations:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = moles KH2PO4 / 0.200 L = 0.007347 / 0.2 \u2248 0.036735 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = moles Na2HPO4 / 0.200 L = 0.005616 / 0.2 \u2248 0.02808 M\n\nNow, plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npKa2 is the log of 1/(Ka2). Wait, pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u2248 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThen pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02808 / 0.036735). \n\nLet me compute the ratio: 0.02808 / 0.036735 \u2248 0.7644.\n\nlog(0.7644) is approximately. Let's see, log(0.76) is about -0.118, log(0.77) is around -0.1139. Since 0.7644 is between, maybe about -0.117. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, log(0.7644) = ln(0.7644)/ln(10). Let me see, ln(0.7644) is approx -0.267, divided by 2.3026 gives approx -0.116. So pH \u22487.2076 -0.116 \u22487.0916.\n\nSo pH is approximately 7.09.\n\nNow, to find [PO4^3-], we look at the third dissociation: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.\n\nThe expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M. [H+] can be found from pH: [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09). Let me calculate that.\n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.09 is about 0.812, so 1e-7 *0.812 \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nSo [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.12e-8)\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 = 5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.12e-8 \u2248 (5.0544 /8.12) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.6225 *1e-6 = 6.225e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.2e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7). Wait, but let me check the calculations again for accuracy.\n\nWait, let's redo the [H+] calculation precisely. pH is 7.0916, so:\n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0916). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nThe exponent is -7.0916. Let me break it into 10^-7 * 10^-0.0916.\n\n10^-0.0916: Let me use natural logs. Let me compute ln(10^-0.0916) = -0.0916 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0916 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2108. So exponent is e^-0.2108 \u22480.810. So 10^-0.0916 \u22480.810, so [H+] = 1e-7 *0.810 =8.10e-8. That's consistent with before.\n\nNow numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02808:\n\nLet me compute 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544/8.1)*1e-6.\n\n5.0544 divided by 8.1 is approximately 0.624 (since 8.1 *0.624=5.0544). Exactly, so 0.624 *1e-6 =6.24e-7 M. That's exactly option A. But wait, the options have A as 6.24e-7. So that's a match.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the steps. Let me retrace.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that again. 136.09 is the molar mass. 1 /136.09 is approximately 0.007347. That's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: molar mass is 177.99. 1/177.99 is approximately 0.005616 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations divided by 0.2 L:\n\n0.007347/0.2 is 0.036735 M H2PO4^-.\n\n0.005616/0.2 is 0.02808 M HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch for the second dissociation (since that's the buffer between H2PO4 and HPO4^2-):\n\npH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )\n\nYes. pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me check that again. 6.2e-8, log(6.2)=0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)=0.7924-8= -7.2076. So pKa2=7.2076. Correct.\n\nThe ratio is 0.02808 /0.036735 = let's compute that again:\n\n0.02808 divided by 0.036735. Let me do this division:\n\n0.02808 /0.036735 = (2808 / 36735)*10^-3? Wait, maybe better as:\n\n2808 / 36735 \u2248 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644. Correct.\n\nLog(0.7644) \u2248-0.117. So pH is 7.2076 -0.117 = 7.0906. So pH\u22487.09.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^-7.09. As computed, ~8.1e-8.\n\nThen [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/8.1e-8.\n\nWait, let me compute the exact value:\n\n1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544. So numerator is 0.050544e-12. \n\nDivided by 8.1e-8:\n\n0.050544e-12 /8.1e-8 = (0.050544 /8.1) * 1e-4 \n\nWait, wait, 1e-12 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-4. So 0.050544 divided by8.1 equals 0.00624 (since 8.1 *0.00624 =0.050544). So 0.00624e-4 is 6.24e-7. Exactly. So that gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.\n\nHmm, but the options given are A) 6.24x10^-7, B)5.48e-7, etc. So that would be A. But wait, let me check if I considered the correct form of the equilibrium.\n\nWait, in the third dissociation, HPO4^2- loses a proton to become PO4^3-. So the expression is correct: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].\n\nYes, that's right. The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M, which is correct. So the calculation seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering activity coefficients or something, but I don't think so. Since the problem is probably expecting an ideal solution.\n\nWait another thought: when we have the solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their concentrations are as calculated, but when considering the third dissociation, do we need to account for any changes in their concentrations? Like, when HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-, that would slightly decrease [HPO4^2-] and increase [PO4^3-]. However, since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the amount dissociated would be negligible. So we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as ~0.02808 M, which is valid here.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 6.24x10^-7. But wait the options have B and D as close numbers. Let me check my calculation again for possible arithmetic errors.\n\nWait, let me recompute the division step:\n\nNumerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02808 = 1.8 *0.02808 = 0.050544 \u2192 0.050544e-12 \u2192 5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by [H+] which is 8.1e-8:\n\n5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544 /8.1) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0544 divided by 8.1: Let me do this division more precisely.\n\n8.1 \u00d7 0.624 = 5.0544 exactly. So 5.0544 /8.1 =0.624 \u2192 0.624 \u00d71e-6 =6.24e-7. Yes.\n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the answer must be A. But wait the options are listed as:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 M \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD)3.97x10^-7 M \n\nHmm, so why is there an option B? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation?\n\nWait, the ratio is [base]/[acid], where the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- (since the dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 H+ + HPO4^2-). So the equation is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the molar masses again. \n\nKH2PO4: K is 39.1, H2PO4 is H2 (2), P (30.97), O4 (64). So total: 39.1 + 2 +30.97 +64 = 136.07. The given Mw is 136.09, so that's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 22.99*2=45.98, HPO4 is H (1), P (30.97), O4 (64), plus 2 H2O (each 18.015, so 36.03). So total:\n\n45.98 + (1 +30.97 +64) +36.03 = 45.98 +95.97 +36.03 = 45.98+132.0 =177.98, which matches the given 177.99. So moles are correct.\n\nHmm, then perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio? Let me recheck:\n\nH2PO4^- concentration: 0.007347 mol /0.2 L =0.036735 M.\n\nHPO4^2- is 0.005616 /0.2 =0.02808 M.\n\nRatio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644.\n\nLog(0.7644)=?\n\nLet me compute log(0.7644). Let's see, log(0.76)=?\n\nWe can use logarithm tables or approximate:\n\nlog(0.76) = log(7.6\u00d710^-1) = log(7.6) -1 \u22480.8808 -1= -0.1192.\n\nSimilarly, log(0.7644) is a bit higher. Let me compute using natural logs:\n\nln(0.7644) = ?\n\nLet me compute ln(0.7644):\n\nWe know that ln(0.75)= -0.28768207, ln(0.76)= ?\n\nAlternatively, approximate:\n\nLet me use ln(0.7644)= ?\n\nLet me think. Let me use Taylor series around 0.75. Hmm, maybe better to use calculator-like steps.\n\nAlternatively, note that 0.7644 is 0.75 +0.0144.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use log10:\n\nLet me recall that log(7.644\u00d710^-1) = log(7.644) -1.\n\nlog(7.644) is log(7) + log(1.092). Log(7)=0.8451, log(1.092)= ~0.0385. So total log(7.644)= ~0.8836, so log(0.7644)=0.8836 -1= -0.1164.\n\nThus, log(0.7644) is approximately -0.1164.\n\nSo pH =7.2076 -0.1164=7.0912.\n\nSo pH is about 7.091.\n\nThen [H+] is 10^-7.091. Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nLet me compute 10^-7.091 = 10^(-7 -0.091)=10^-7 *10^-0.091.\n\n10^-0.091: Let me compute ln(10^-0.091)= -0.091 *ln(10)= -0.091*2.302585\u2248-0.2095.\n\nSo e^-0.2095 \u22481 -0.2095 + (0.2095)^2/2 - ... \u2248 approx 0.8115. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator-like steps:\n\n10^0.091 = e^(0.091 * ln10) \u2248 e^(0.091 *2.3026)= e^0.2095 \u22481.233. So 10^-0.091 \u22481/1.233\u22480.811.\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 8.11e-8 M.\n\nSo the [H+] is ~8.11e-8.\n\nThus, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02808)/8.11e-8.\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8 *0.02808 =0.050544, so 0.050544e-12 =5.0544e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: 5.0544e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0544/8.11)*1e-6.\n\n5.0544 divided by 8.11: Let's see, 8.11 \u00d70.623 = 5.054 (since 8.11*0.6=4.866, 8.11*0.023=0.18653 \u2192 total ~4.866+0.1865=5.0525). So \u22480.623. Thus, 0.623 \u00d71e-6 =6.23e-7, which rounds to 6.23e-7, matching option A's 6.24e-7. The slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps, but the given options have A as the closest. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. But wait, the problem states \"orthophosphate ions\", which is PO4^3-, so all steps are correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might confuse orthophosphate with other forms, but in this case, the question is clear. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? Let me check again.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, is there any other source of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? No, because the other compounds are fully dissociated. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A. But the options have B and D. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the molar masses?\n\nWait KH2PO4's molar mass is given as 136.09. Let me recalculate:\n\nK: 39.1, H2: 2.02, P: 30.97, O4: 64. So total 39.1 +2.02+30.97+64 = 39.1+2.02=41.12; 41.12+30.97=72.09; 72.09+64=136.09. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O:\n\nNa2: 2\u00d722.99=45.98; HPO4: H is 1.01, P 30.97, O4 64 \u2192 1.01+30.97+64=95.98; plus 2 H2O: 2\u00d718.015=36.03. So total:45.98 +95.98+36.03=45.98+95.98=141.96; +36.03 gives 177.99. Correct.\n\nMoles are correct. \n\nHmm. Then why option A is present and matches. Maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused why the options are there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Wait, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 /0.036735 \u22480.7644. log of that is indeed ~-0.116, so pH ~7.09. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-? No, the question says orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Ka3 value. The problem states Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Yes. \n\nWait, let me check if the third dissociation is indeed HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo all steps are correct. The answer must be A. But let me check the options again. The first option is A)6.24x10^-7 which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer is A. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think if there is another approach. Suppose the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-. Since HPO4^2- is a weak base, but the Ka3 is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-.\n\nBut the calculation is as done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants us to consider that the solution has some other equilibria? Like, the presence of H2PO4^- could also contribute to PO4^3- through multiple steps? But no, because H2PO4^- would first lose a proton to become HPO4^2- before losing another to become PO4^3-. Since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of PO4^3- is governed by the third Ka and the [HPO4^2-].\n\nYes, so the approach is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we first calculate the moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. \n\n- **KH\u2082PO\u2084**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{136.09\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.007347\\ \\text{mol}\n  \\]\n  Concentration in 0.200 L:\n  \\[\n  [\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084}^-] = \\frac{0.007347}{0.200} \\approx 0.0367\\ \\text{M}\n  \\]\n\n- **Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{177.99\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005616\\ \\text{mol}\n  \\]\n  Concentration in 0.200 L:\n  \\[\n  [\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}] = \\frac{0.005616}{0.200} \\approx 0.0281\\ \\text{M}\n  \\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b/HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b):\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_{a2} + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}{[\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084}^-]}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{p}K_{a2} = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.21\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.21 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.0281}{0.0367}\\right) \\approx 7.21 - 0.116 = 7.09\n\\]\n\nThe hydrogen ion concentration \\([H^+]\\) is:\n\\[\n[H^+] = 10^{-7.09} \\approx 8.1 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nUsing the third dissociation constant \\(K_{a3}\\) for HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b:\n\\[\nK_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}\n\\]\nSolving for \\([\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}]\\):\n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}] = \\frac{K_{a3} \\cdot [\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}{[H^+]} = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12})(0.0281)}{8.1 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a solution with 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O in 200.00 cm\u00b3. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the moles of each compound. Let's start with KH2PO4. The molecular weight (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 would be mass divided by Mw: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007346 moles. \n\nNext is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Its Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles here would be 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. That's about 0.005617 moles. \n\nWait, so KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- right? And the other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but the water probably doesn't matter in solution. So the HPO4^2- is the important part here.\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. That's the third ionization step of H3PO4. Since we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, maybe we need to consider the equilibrium between these and PO4^3-?\n\nH3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). \n\nSince we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, the orthophosphate would come from the third dissociation. But since the third Ka (Ka3) is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the concentration of PO4^3- might be very low. But how do we calculate it here?\n\nWait, but the question gives both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts. The solution is a buffer? Maybe the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations? Let me think.\n\nThe solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which provides HPO4^2-). So this is a buffer solution between the second and third dissociation steps. Wait, actually, H2PO4^- is the second ion, and HPO4^2- is the third. Wait, the first is H3PO4, then H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the H2PO4^- is from the first dissociation's conjugate base, but in the second step, H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the buffer here would be between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2, since that's the dissociation between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is the next step. To find [PO4^3-], maybe we can use the third dissociation's Ka3. Because HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nSo, the HPO4^2- in the solution can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nTo find [PO4^3-], we can set up the expression for Ka3:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nSo, if we can find [H+], which depends on the pH of the solution, then we can solve for [PO4^3-].\n\nFirst, let's compute the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe total volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L. \n\nMoles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol\n\nTherefore, the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 \u2248 0.03673 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 \u2248 0.02808 M\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the conjugate pair here):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is the -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-7) \u2248 0.7924 -7 = -6.2076. So pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThen, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764. The log of that is log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.2076 -0.117 \u2248 7.0906.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09. Therefore, [H+] = 10^(-pH) \u2248 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.09e-8 M.\n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation (Ka3):\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M\n\n[H+] is 8.09e-8 M\n\nSo:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.09e-8\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 \u2248 5.054e-14\n\nThen divide by 8.09e-8: 5.054e-14 / 8.09e-8 \u2248 6.25e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's close to option A (6.24e-7) or D (3.97e-7). Wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate step by step.\n\nFirst, the moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol. Yes.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\n0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M for H2PO4^-\n\n0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M for HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = let's compute more accurately.\n\n6.2e-8: log(6.2) is log(6) is 0.7782, log(6.2) is about 0.7924. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nRatio [HPO4]/[H2PO4] = 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.7645. The log of that is log(0.7645). Let me compute that precisely:\n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645 x10^-1) = log(7.645) + (-1). log(7.645) is approx 0.8833, so 0.8833 -1 = -0.1167. So pH = 7.2076 -0.1167 = 7.0909. So pH ~7.09.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0909. Let me compute that more accurately. Since pH 7 is 1e-7, so 7.09 is 10^(-0.09) less. 10^(-0.09) is approx 0.812. So 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8. So [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nNow, plug into Ka3 equation:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nSolving for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] =8.12e-8.\n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 1.8 *0.028085 =0.05055; then 0.05055e-12 \u2192 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.055e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.055/8.12) * 1e-6 \u2248 (0.6225) *1e-6 \u2192 6.225e-7 M. That's approximately 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). \n\nHmm, so why is option D there? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). For the second dissociation (H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+), the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So yes, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], which I did correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the contribution of the third dissociation to the H+ concentration? But since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the H+ from that is negligible compared to the existing H+ from the buffer. So my approach should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the third dissociation?\n\nThe third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo the expression is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the calculation of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?\n\nLet me check the molar masses again.\n\nKH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is 2, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So total is 39.1 + 2 + 30.97 + 64 = 136.07, which matches the given 136.09. So that's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 2*22.99=45.98, HPO4 is H (1) + P (30.97) + 4*16=64 \u2192 total HPO4 is 1+30.97+64=95.97. Then 2 H2O: each H2O is 18, so 2*18=36. So total Mw is 45.98 + 95.97 +36 = 177.95, which rounds to 177.99 as given. So that's correct.\n\nSo the moles are correct. \n\nHmm. So my calculation gives ~6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). But the options have B and D as alternatives. Wait the options are:\n\nA)6.24x10^-7\n\nB)5.48x10^-7\n\nC)2.81x10^-7\n\nD)3.97x10^-7\n\nSo A is the closest. But why is there another option? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the total phosphate species, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]?\n\nLet me re-calculate the pH. Let me compute pKa2 again. \n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nlog(6.2) is log(6) is 0.7782, 6.2 is 6*1.0333, so log(6.2)= log6 + log(1.0333) \u22480.7782 +0.0142= 0.7924. So pKa is 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 /0.03673= 0.7645. Log of that is log(0.7645) is indeed about -0.1167. So pH is 7.2076 -0.1167=7.0909.\n\n[H+] is 10^-7.0909. Let me compute this more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach.\n\n10^-7.0909 = 10^(-7 -0.0909) = 10^-7 *10^-0.0909. \n\n10^-0.0909 is equal to e^(ln(10)*-0.0909) \u2248 e^(-0.0909 *2.3026) \u2248 e^(-0.2094) \u2248 0.8116. \n\nSo 10^-7 *0.8116 \u22488.116e-8 M. So that's correct. \n\nSo plugging back into [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085)/8.116e-8 = (1.8 *0.028085 /8.116 ) * 1e-12 /1e-8 \n\nWait, 1e-12 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-4. So:\n\nFirst part: (1.8 *0.028085)/8.116 \u2248 (0.05055)/8.116 \u22480.00623.\n\nMultiply by 1e-4: 0.00623 *1e-4 =6.23e-7. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but why is option D 3.97e-7? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me check the formula again for the third dissociation. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. So the expression is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the concentration of HPO4^2- as the total, but considering that some of it dissociates? But since Ka3 is so small, the amount that dissociates is negligible. So the [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02808 M. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another way? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the first two dissociations? But no, orthophosphate is the third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator again:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, [H+] =8.116e-8.\n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 1.8 *0.028085 = 0.05055, so 0.05055e-12 =5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8: 5.055e-14 /8.116e-8 = (5.055 /8.116) * 1e-6. \n\n5.055 divided by8.116 is approximately 0.6228. \n\n0.6228e-6 =6.228e-7. So that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B as 5.48e-7. Maybe I made an error in the pH calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is using the wrong pKa? Let me check again.\n\nThe second dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa here is pKa2 =7.2076. Correct.\n\nWait, but what if I used pKa3 instead? That would be wrong, but maybe that's a common mistake. Let's see. If someone mistakenly used the third pKa, but no, the problem is about the third ionization product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity of the HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, the moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 1.00g /177.99g/mol = 0.005617 mol. Divided by 0.2 L gives 0.028085 M. Correct.\n\nH2PO4^- is 1.00g /136.09 =0.007346 mol, divided by 0.2 is 0.03673 M. Correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the total phosphate species and considering some other equilibria? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but my calculation is off. Let me check with another approach. Maybe using the ratio from Ka3.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. The closest is A. The given options are A, B, C, D. Since my calculation gives 6.23e-7, which is very close to A's 6.24e-7, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the pH. Let me compute pH again with precise logarithms.\n\nLet me compute log(0.7645) precisely. Let's see.\n\nlog(0.7645). Let me remember that log(7.645)=0.8833, so log(0.7645) is log(7.645*10^-1) =0.8833 -1= -0.1167. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more accurate pKa?\n\nWait, the problem states the Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is exactly -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that with more precision.\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\nKa2 =6.2e-8.\n\nTake natural log: ln(6.2e-8) = ln(6.2) + ln(1e-8) = 1.824 + (-18.4207) \u2248-16.5967.\n\nThen log(Ka2)= ln(Ka2)/ln(10) = -16.5967 /2.3026\u2248-7.2076, so pKa is 7.2076. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for pKa2? Like maybe the user expects using Ka2 as 6.2x10^-8, so pKa2 is 7.2076, which is correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct. So the answer should be A. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)6.24x10^-7\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 \n\nSo A is the closest. So I think the correct answer is A.\n",

We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the moles of each compound. Let's start with KH2PO4.

Hmm, 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007346 moles. \n\nNext is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Its Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles here would be 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. That's about 0.005617 moles. \n\nWait, so KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- right? And the other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but the water probably doesn't matter in solution. So the HPO4^2- is the important part here.\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. That's the third ionization step of H3PO4. Since we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, maybe we need to consider the equilibrium between these and PO4^3-?\n\nH3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The first is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). \n\nSince we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, the orthophosphate would come from the third dissociation. But since the third Ka (Ka3) is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the concentration of PO4^3- might be very low. But how do we calculate it here?\n\nWait, but the question gives both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts. The solution is a buffer? Maybe the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations? Let me think.\n\nThe solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 (which provides H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which provides HPO4^2-). So this is a buffer solution between the second and third dissociation steps. Wait, actually, H2PO4^- is the second ion, and HPO4^2- is the third. Wait, the first is H3PO4, then H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the H2PO4^- is from the first dissociation's conjugate base, but in the second step, H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2-.\n\nSo, the buffer here would be between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with Ka2, since that's the dissociation between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nWait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is the next step. To find [PO4^3-], maybe we can use the third dissociation's Ka3. Because HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.\n\nSo, the HPO4^2- in the solution can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nTo find [PO4^3-], we can set up the expression for Ka3:\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nSo, if we can find [H+], which depends on the pH of the solution, then we can solve for [PO4^3-].\n\nFirst, let's compute the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.\n\nThe total volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 L. \n\nMoles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol\n\nMoles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol\n\nTherefore, the concentrations are:\n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 \u2248 0.03673 M\n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 \u2248 0.02808 M\n\nNow, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the conjugate pair here):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is the -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that.\n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8, so log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-7) \u2248 0.7924 -7 = -6.2076. So pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThen, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.764. The log of that is log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117.\n\nSo pH \u2248 7.2076 -0.117 \u2248 7.0906.\n\nSo pH is about 7.09. Therefore, [H+] = 10^(-pH) \u2248 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.09e-8 M.\n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation (Ka3):\n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers in:\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M\n\n[H+] is 8.09e-8 M\n\nSo:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.09e-8\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 \u2248 5.054e-14\n\nThen divide by 8.09e-8: 5.054e-14 / 8.09e-8 \u2248 6.25e-7 M.\n\nHmm, that's close to option A (6.24e-7) or D (3.97e-7). Wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate step by step.\n\nFirst, the moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 \u2248 0.007346 mol. Yes.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\n0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M for H2PO4^-\n\n0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M for HPO4^2-.\n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = let's compute more accurately.\n\n6.2e-8: log(6.2) is log(6) is 0.7782, log(6.2) is about 0.7924. So pKa2 is 7.2076.\n\nRatio [HPO4]/[H2PO4] = 0.028085 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.7645. The log of that is log(0.7645). Let me compute that precisely:\n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645 x10^-1) = log(7.645) + (-1). log(7.645) is approx 0.8833, so 0.8833 -1 = -0.1167. So pH = 7.2076 -0.1167 = 7.0909. So pH ~7.09.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.0909. Let me compute that more accurately. Since pH 7 is 1e-7, so 7.09 is 10^(-0.09) less. 10^(-0.09) is approx 0.812. So 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8. So [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M.\n\nNow, plug into Ka3 equation:\n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nSolving for [PO4^3-]:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nPlugging the numbers:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12\n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.028085 M.\n\n[H+] =8.12e-8.\n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 \u2248 1.8 *0.028085 =0.05055; then 0.05055e-12 \u2192 5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.055e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.055/8.12) * 1e-6 \u2248 (0.6225) *1e-6 \u2192 6.225e-7 M. That's approximately 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). \n\nHmm, so why is option D there? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). For the second dissociation (H2PO4^- \u2194 HPO4^2- + H+), the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So yes, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], which I did correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the contribution of the third dissociation to the H+ concentration? But since Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), the H+ from that is negligible compared to the existing H+ from the buffer. So my approach should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the third dissociation?\n\nThe third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-.\n\nSo the expression is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the calculation of the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?\n\nLet me check the molar masses again.\n\nKH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is 2, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So total is 39.1 + 2 + 30.97 + 64 = 136.07, which matches the given 136.09. So that's correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 2*22.99=45.98, HPO4 is H (1) + P (30.97) + 4*16=64 \u2192 total HPO4 is 1+30.97+64=95.97. Then 2 H2O: each H2O is 18, so 2*18=36. So total Mw is 45.98 + 95.97 +36 = 177.95, which rounds to 177.99 as given. So that's correct.\n\nSo the moles are correct. \n\nHmm. So my calculation gives ~6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). But the options have B and D as alternatives. Wait the options are:\n\nA)6.24x10^-7\n\nB)5.48x10^-7\n\nC)2.81x10^-7\n\nD)3.97x10^-7\n\nSo A is the closest. But why is there another option? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the total phosphate species, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]?\n\nLet me re-calculate the pH. Let me compute pKa2 again. \n\nKa2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).\n\nlog(6.2) is log(6) is 0.7782, 6.2 is 6*1.0333, so log(6.2)= log6 + log(1.0333) \u22480.7782 +0.0142= 0.7924. So pKa is 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028085 /0.03673= 0.7645. Log of that is log(0.7645) is indeed about -0.1167. So pH is 7.2076 -0.1167=7.0909.\n\n[H+] is 10^-7.0909. Let me compute this more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach.\n\n10^-7.0909 = 10^(-7 -0.0909) = 10^-7 *10^-0.0909. \n\n10^-0.0909 is equal to e^(ln(10)*-0.0909) \u2248 e^(-0.0909 *2.3026) \u2248 e^(-0.2094) \u2248 0.8116. \n\nSo 10^-7 *0.8116 \u22488.116e-8 M. So that's correct. \n\nSo plugging back into [PO4^3-]:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085)/8.116e-8 = (1.8 *0.028085 /8.116 ) * 1e-12 /1e-8 \n\nWait, 1e-12 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-4. So:\n\nFirst part: (1.8 *0.028085)/8.116 \u2248 (0.05055)/8.116 \u22480.00623.\n\nMultiply by 1e-4: 0.00623 *1e-4 =6.23e-7. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but why is option D 3.97e-7? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me check the formula again for the third dissociation. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2192 H+ + PO4^3-. So the expression is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the concentration of HPO4^2- as the total, but considering that some of it dissociates? But since Ka3 is so small, the amount that dissociates is negligible. So the [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02808 M. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another way? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the first two dissociations? But no, orthophosphate is the third.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me recompute the numerator and denominator again:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, [H+] =8.116e-8.\n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = 1.8 *0.028085 = 0.05055, so 0.05055e-12 =5.055e-14.\n\nDivide by 8.116e-8: 5.055e-14 /8.116e-8 = (5.055 /8.116) * 1e-6. \n\n5.055 divided by8.116 is approximately 0.6228. \n\n0.6228e-6 =6.228e-7. So that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B as 5.48e-7. Maybe I made an error in the pH calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is using the wrong pKa? Let me check again.\n\nThe second dissociation is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa here is pKa2 =7.2076. Correct.\n\nWait, but what if I used pKa3 instead? That would be wrong, but maybe that's a common mistake. Let's see. If someone mistakenly used the third pKa, but no, the problem is about the third ionization product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity of the HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, the moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 1.00g /177.99g/mol = 0.005617 mol. Divided by 0.2 L gives 0.028085 M. Correct.\n\nH2PO4^- is 1.00g /136.09 =0.007346 mol, divided by 0.2 is 0.03673 M. Correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the total phosphate species and considering some other equilibria? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but my calculation is off. Let me check with another approach. Maybe using the ratio from Ka3.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. The closest is A. The given options are A, B, C, D. Since my calculation gives 6.23e-7, which is very close to A's 6.24e-7, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation of the pH. Let me compute pH again with precise logarithms.\n\nLet me compute log(0.7645) precisely. Let's see.\n\nlog(0.7645). Let me remember that log(7.645)=0.8833, so log(0.7645) is log(7.645*10^-1) =0.8833 -1= -0.1167. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using more accurate pKa?\n\nWait, the problem states the Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is exactly -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that with more precision.\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\nKa2 =6.2e-8.\n\nTake natural log: ln(6.2e-8) = ln(6.2) + ln(1e-8) = 1.824 + (-18.4207) \u2248-16.5967.\n\nThen log(Ka2)= ln(Ka2)/ln(10) = -16.5967 /2.3026\u2248-7.2076, so pKa is 7.2076. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for pKa2? Like maybe the user expects using Ka2 as 6.2x10^-8, so pKa2 is 7.2076, which is correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct. So the answer should be A. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)6.24x10^-7\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 \n\nSo A is the closest. So I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe solution contains KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O, which provide H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions, respectively. To find the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b ions, we use the third dissociation constant (Ka\u2083 = 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2) of H\u2083PO\u2084. \n\n1. **Calculate moles of each compound:**\n   - Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084: \\( \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{136.09\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.007346\\ \\text{mol} \\)\n   - Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O: \\( \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{177.99\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005617\\ \\text{mol} \\)\n\n2. **Determine concentrations in 0.2 L solution:**\n   - [H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = \\( \\frac{0.007346}{0.2} \\approx 0.03673\\ \\text{M} \\)\n   - [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = \\( \\frac{0.005617}{0.2} \\approx 0.02808\\ \\text{M} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (pKa\u2082 = 7.2076):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.02808}{0.03673}\\right) \\approx 7.09\n   \\]\n   - [H\u207a] = \\( 10^{-7.09} \\approx 8.12 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{M} \\)\n\n4. **Use Ka\u2083 to find [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]:**\n   \\[\n   K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} \\implies [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{K_{a3} \\cdot [HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]} \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12})(0.02808)}{8.12 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}\n   \\]\n\nThe closest option is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
