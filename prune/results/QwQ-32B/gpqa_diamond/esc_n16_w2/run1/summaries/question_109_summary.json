      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem states that Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. We're told that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and we need to find which of the given partial waves isn't allowed. The options are A to D, each involving different transitions and the emitted particle's angular momentum (denoted by the lowercase letter like p, f, s).\n\nFirst, let's recall some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol here is (2S+1)L_J. So for 1S0, that means S (total spin) is 0, because (2S+1)=1 implies S=0. The L here is S, which is 0 (since S in spectroscopic notation corresponds to L=0). The total angular momentum J is 0 as well, which makes sense since J = L + S when they are aligned. So the initial NN system has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Since T is the isospin, and for two nucleons (protons and neutrons), the isospin can be either 0 or 1. The condition given here is T = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T is 0, that means S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. So S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Therefore, either S is odd and L even, or vice versa.\n\nNext, we have to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of the initial state is determined by (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, the initial parity is (+1)^0 = 1. The final state's parity must also be conserved. The total parity before and after must be the same. The final parity is the product of the NN final parity and the particle X's parity. \n\nThe parity of the NN final state is (-1)^L_final. The particle X's parity is given as -1. So total parity after emission is (-1)^L_final * (-1). The initial parity was 1, so:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n(-1)^{L_final} * (-1) = 1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final} = -1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final} = -1 \u2192 so L_final must be odd. Because (-1)^odd is -1. So L_final must be an odd integer.\n\nAdditionally, we need to conserve angular momentum. The total angular momentum before (initial) is J_initial = 0. The final state's total angular momentum must be the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum. Let's denote the emitted particle's angular momentum as l (given by the lowercase letter in the options: p is l=1, f is l=3, s is l=0, etc.). \n\nSo the total angular momentum conservation requires that the NN's total angular momentum plus the particle's angular momentum must have a possible combination that includes J_initial = 0. \n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be conserved. The initial total J is 0. The final state must have the NN's J_NN plus the particle's angular momentum l such that their vector sum can result in 0. The possible total J values would be |J_NN - l| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J_NN + l. Since the total must be 0, the only possibility is that J_NN = l and their vectors are opposite. So J_NN must equal l, and the projection must be such that they cancel. Alternatively, the possible total angular momentum must include 0. So the minimum possible J is |J_NN - l|, and the maximum is J_NN + l. For 0 to be in that range, we must have that |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l \u2192 which implies that J_NN = l. Because otherwise, if J_NN > l, then the minimum would be J_NN - l, so to have 0, J_NN - l \u2264 0 \u2192 J_NN \u2264 l. But if J_NN < l, then the minimum would be l - J_NN, so that must be \u22640, which would require l - J_NN \u22640 \u2192 l \u2264 J_NN. Contradiction. So the only way is that J_NN = l, and then the total can be zero if their vectors are opposite. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the total angular momentum must have a possible value of 0. So the possible total J values are from |J_NN - l| up to J_NN + l. So 0 must be within that interval. Therefore, |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. The only way this can happen is if J_NN = l, because then the minimum and maximum would be 0 and 2l, so 0 is included. Alternatively, if J_NN and l are such that their difference is zero, so they are equal. So, J_NN must equal l. Because otherwise, if J_NN is not equal to l, the minimum would be |J_NN - l|, which would have to be \u22640, which only happens when J_NN = l. So yes, J_NN must equal l. So that's a key point. So the angular momentum of the NN system (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum l of the emitted particle. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So for example, in option A, the emitted particle is a p (l=1), so the particle has l=1. The NN's final angular momentum must then be J_NN = l =1? Hmm, but let's check each option step by step.\n\nAlso, the term symbols for the final NN state are given in each option. Let's parse each option:\n\nTake each option one by one. The options are transitions from 1S0 (initial) to a final NN state (given by the term symbol) plus a particle X with angular momentum l (given by the lowercase letter). Let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The final NN state's term symbol is 7D1. Let's parse that term symbol. The 7 comes from 2S+1, so S = 3 (since 2*3+1=7). The D means L = 2 (since S corresponds to 0, P to 1, D to 2). The J is 1 (the subscript). Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S? Wait, no, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system and their spin S. But actually, in the term symbol, J can be any value from |L-S| to L+S in integer steps. But here the term symbol is 7D1, so J=1. So L=2, S=3 (from the 7), and J=1. \n\nWait, but S is the total spin of the NN system here. Let me check. For two nucleons, each nucleon has spin 1/2. The total spin S can be 0 or 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, the two nucleons are fermions, so their total spin S must be 0 or 1. Because each has spin 1/2, so adding two spin 1/2 gives S=0 or 1. But in the term symbol given here, the 7 suggests that 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, which is impossible. Wait a second, that can't be. That must be an error. Wait, maybe I misread the term symbol. The term symbol is given as, for example, 7D1. The first number is 2S+1. So for 7, that would require S = 3. But that's impossible because two nucleons can't have spin 3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, the problem states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So perhaps the isospin is 0, so the NN pair must be in a state where their isospin is zero. For two nucleons (proton and neutron), the isospin can be 0 or 1. To have T=0, they must be in a singlet state, so their isospin is 0. But the spin and isospin are separate. Wait, but the problem's condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, the variables here are S(NN) is the spin, L(NN) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, and T(NN) is the isospin. The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, then S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. \n\nBut back to the term symbols. Let's parse each option correctly. Let me check again. For example, option A's final NN state is 7D1. The 7 would be 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. But that's impossible for two nucleons. Wait, that's a problem. Maybe the term symbol is for the emitted particle? No, the question says the term symbol refers to the NN state. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the term symbol is written differently? Let me think again. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So for the NN system, their spin S (total spin) plus orbital angular momentum L gives J. But for two nucleons, S can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, the term symbol's first number (2S+1) can only be 1 or 3. So the 7 in option A's term symbol (7D1) is impossible. That suggests that maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term symbol's application here. Wait, maybe the term symbol here refers to the particle X? No, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol must be for the NN system. Therefore, 7D1 would be invalid because S can't be 3. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the question uses a different notation? Let me check the problem again. The note says \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps S here is the total spin of the NN system, but L is the orbital angular momentum between the two nucleons. So for the NN system's total spin S can be 0 or 1, as two spin-1/2 particles. But in the term symbol, the 2S+1 would be 1 or 3. So any term symbol with 5, 7, etc. is impossible for the NN system. Therefore, the options must have made an error, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, maybe the term symbol is for the emitted particle? No, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol is for the NN. Therefore, perhaps the problem is using a different convention where S is the total spin of the entire system, including orbital angular momentum? Wait, no, the term symbol is standard. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me look at the options again. \n\nWait, option C is 3D3 + f. The term symbol 3D3. Here 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=2 (D), J=3. That's possible. So S=1 (allowed for two nucleons), so that works. Option D: 3P0. The P means L=1. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. J=0. Wait, J must be L + S or other combinations, but J can't be less than |L - S|. Here L=1, S=1, so J can be 0,1, or 2. So J=0 is possible. Okay, so that's okay. \n\nWait, the problem with option A is the 7. Because 2S+1=7 implies S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, option A's term symbol is invalid, so that can't be a permitted state. Wait, but the question says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". So maybe option A is invalid because the term symbol is impossible? But the question might have a different approach here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term symbol refers to the particle X? No, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol given in each option must be for the NN system. Therefore, any term symbol with 2S+1 greater than 3 is impossible. So the options A and C: \n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3 \u2192 impossible. \n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nTherefore, option A's term symbol is invalid, so that transition can't happen. But the problem might not be considering that, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the term symbol refers to the emitted particle? Let me see. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol must be for the NN. So the problem must have a typo, but perhaps the options are correct as given, and I need to proceed. Wait, perhaps the S in the term symbol refers to the spin of the emitted particle? That can't be. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the term symbol is for the entire system? No, the question states that the term symbol is for the NN state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me recheck the problem statement. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". The term symbol given in each option (like 7D1) is for the NN state. Therefore, the term symbols with 7 must be invalid. So option A's final NN state is impossible. Therefore, that transition can't happen. But the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So maybe the answer is A? But I need to check all steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbols are okay, and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let me consider that perhaps the S in the term symbol is not the spin of the NN but something else? No, according to the note given, \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.\" So for the NN system, S is their total spin. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering a different system, like the particle X? No, the problem says \"the final NN state\". So the term symbol must be for the NN. \n\nSo if that's the case, option A's term symbol 7D1 is impossible, so the process described in option A cannot occur. Therefore, the answer would be A? But let me check the other options. Let me see:\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p. The term symbol for NN is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation is L=0), J=1. That's okay because S=1 is possible for two nucleons. So that works.\n\nOption C: 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=2 (D), J=3. Since J can be L + S (2+1=3), so that's okay. \n\nOption D: 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=1 (P), J=0. Since J must be at least |L - S| = 0 (since L=1 and S=1, so |1-1|=0), so J=0 is possible. \n\nSo the only invalid term symbol is option A's 7D1. Hence, that transition is not allowed because the final NN state can't have S=3. Therefore, the answer would be A. But wait, the problem might have another angle. Let's proceed to check other constraints.\n\nAdditionally, we have to consider parity conservation. The initial parity is (+1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0 (1S0), so initial parity is +1. The final parity must also be +1. The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the emitted particle's parity. \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN). The particle X has parity -1. So total final parity is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1). This must equal initial parity of +1. Therefore,\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) = 1 \u21d2 (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u21d2 L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo the NN's orbital angular momentum L_NN must be odd. Let's check each option's L_NN:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L_NN is D (2). Which is even. But we need L_NN to be odd. So this violates parity conservation. \n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 (S). Even. But L must be odd. Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, L_NN must be odd. So option B would have L=0 (even), which would give (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1, which is not equal to initial parity +1. Therefore, that would also violate parity conservation. Wait, but the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So we need to check all constraints together. \n\nHold on, so first, for each option, the NN's final state must have T=0, which requires that S + L_NN is odd (since T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L +1 is even \u2192 S + L must be odd). \n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: \n\nTerm symbol 7D1 \u2192 S=3 (invalid?), L_NN=2 (D is L=2). But S=3 is impossible. So this term is invalid, so the state can't exist. So regardless of other factors, this is not allowed. \n\nOption B: \n\n3S1 \u2192 S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L_NN=0 (S). \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 = 1 +0 +1 mod2 = 2 mod2 =0 \u2192 T=0. So that's okay. \n\nParity: L_NN is 0 (even). Then final parity: (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1. But initial was +1. So that's a problem. So parity is not conserved here. Therefore, this transition is invalid. \n\nWait, so both A and B might be invalid? But the options must have one correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the question says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". The options are transitions, so each option's process must satisfy angular momentum, parity, and the given condition on T. \n\nSo let's go through each step for each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p (particle p has l=1, since p is l=1)\n\nFirst, the final NN state's term symbol is 7D1. Since S=3 is impossible, this term is impossible. So the process can't happen. So this is invalid. \n\nOption B: 3S1 + p (l=1). \n\nThe NN's term is 3S1. So S=1, L_NN=0. \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +0 +1 = 2 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Good. \n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^0 =1. Multiply by X's parity (-1) \u2192 total final parity 1*(-1)= -1. But initial was +1. So parity not conserved. So this transition is invalid. \n\nOption C: 3D3 + f (f is l=3). \n\nTerm symbol: 3D3 \u2192 S=1 (2S+1=3), L_NN=2 (D). \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 \u21921 +2 +1 =4 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Good. \n\nParity: NN's parity (-1)^2 =1. Multiply by X's parity (-1) \u2192 total parity 1*(-1) = -1. Not equal to initial +1. So parity not conserved. So invalid?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, so for option C, parity is also violating. Hmm. \n\nWait, let me check again: the emitted particle has l=3 (f). The particle's angular momentum l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, actually, when a particle is emitted, the angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) is part of the total angular momentum conservation. But for parity, the particle's parity is given as -1, which is its intrinsic parity, but does its orbital angular momentum affect the parity? Wait, the parity of the emitted particle would be its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. Wait, the problem states that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the total parity contribution from X is (-1)^{intrinsic} * (-1)^l. Wait, no: the parity of a particle with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity. So the total parity of X is intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. \n\nAh! I think I made a mistake here. The parity of the emitted particle X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum (the angular momentum associated with its emission). The problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1, so its parity is (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is given by intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. So the total parity of the system after emission is:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final (NN) * Parity_final (X)\n\nParity_initial = 1 (since initial state is 1S0, L=0 \u2192 parity +1)\n\nParity_final (X) = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^l \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN}\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^l ] \n\nWait, intrinsic_parity_X is -1, so:\n\nParity_X = (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l \n\nWait, no: Parity_X = intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l \u2192 since intrinsic_parity is -1, that would be (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l. Wait, no, (-1)^l is the parity contribution from the orbital angular momentum. So the total Parity_X is (intrinsic_parity) * (-1)^l. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X \n\n\u2192 1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^l ]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l +1} \n\nSo:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}\n\nThus, (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even. \n\nTherefore, L_NN + l +1 must be even \u2192 L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nThat's the parity condition. \n\nSo for each option, we need L_NN + l is odd. \n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A: \n\nFinal NN's L_NN is D (L=2). The emitted particle is p (l=1). \n\nSo 2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. But the term symbol is invalid (S=3 impossible). So the state can't exist, so the transition is invalid. \n\nOption B: \n\nNN's L_NN is 0 (S), particle l=1 (p). \n\n0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition holds. \n\nBut earlier, the T condition: T=0 requires S + L_NN must be odd. In option B, S=1, L_NN=0 \u2192 1+0=1 (odd). So that's okay. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the parity was violating? Wait, no. Let me recalculate with the corrected parity equation. \n\nThe parity equation is L_NN + l must be odd. For B, L_NN=0 and l=1 \u2192 0+1=1 (odd), so parity is okay. So that transition's parity is okay. \n\nWait, my mistake earlier was miscalculating the parity condition. So let me recast all options with the correct parity condition.\n\nSo parity condition is L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nNow, proceeding again:\n\nOption A:\n\nL_NN=2 (D), l=1 (p). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd. So parity okay. But the term symbol is invalid (S=3 for NN impossible). So this is invalid. \n\nOption B:\n\nL_NN=0, l=1. Sum is odd \u2192 okay. The term symbol is valid (S=1 possible). T condition holds. So this is allowed. \n\nOption C:\n\nTerm symbol 3D3 \u2192 L_NN=2 (D). The particle is f (l=3). \n\nL_NN + l = 2+3=5 \u2192 odd. Parity okay. \n\nCheck T: S=1 (from 2S+1=3), L_NN=2. S+L=1+2=3 \u2192 odd. So T=0 \u2192 good. \n\nThus this is allowed. \n\nOption D:\n\nTerm symbol 3P0 \u2192 L_NN=1 (P). The particle is s (l=0). \n\nL_NN + l =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity okay. \n\nCheck T: S=1 (from 3), L_NN=1. S+L=2 \u2192 even \u2192 which would mean T= S+L +1 mod2 \u2192 2 mod2=0 \u2192 T= (0 +1?) Wait the equation given is T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Wait, T(NN)=0. \n\nWait the condition is T(NN) = (S + L +1) mod2. So S + L +1 must be even (since T is 0). So S + L must be odd. \n\nFor option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2, which is even. So S+L is even \u2192 T would be (even +1) mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem states that the final NN has T=0. Thus this violates the condition. So option D is invalid. \n\nAh, that's a key point. So for option D, even though parity and angular momentum might be okay, the T condition is not satisfied. Let me verify again:\n\nOption D's NN term is 3P0. \n\n2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L_NN is P \u2192 L=1. \n\nThen T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +1 +1 =3 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2. Which is 1, but the problem states T(NN)=0. So this violates the condition. Thus, option D is invalid. \n\nSo now, the possible invalid options are A (invalid term), D (invalid T), and B and C are okay. Wait, but option A's term is impossible because S=3 for the NN. So that's invalid. \n\nThe question is asking which is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D. \n\nSo the answer could be A and D. But since the options are singular, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait let's recheck option D again. \n\nOption D's final NN state is 3P0. \n\nThe term symbol: 3P0 \u2192 S=1 (since 2S+1=3). L=1 (P). \n\nThe T condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nS + L = 1 +1 =2 \u2192 2 mod2=0. \n\nThus T= 0 +1 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem says the final state has T=0. Therefore, this violates the given condition. So D is invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are single choice. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the transition must result in a final NN state with T=0. So any option where the final NN's T is not 0 is invalid. \n\nSo for option D, since the final T would be 1, it's invalid. \n\nFor option A, the term symbol is impossible, so the transition can't occur. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options might have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol analysis for A. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the term symbol's S is not the spin of the NN but something else? The note says \"the term symbol ... where S is the total spin\". So for the NN system, that must be their total spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol refers to the emitted particle? Let's see. \n\nIf the term symbol in the options refers to the emitted particle X, then the problem would make more sense. Let me try that approach. \n\nWait, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". The term symbol given in the options (like 7D1) would then be for the NN. But then, as before, the 7 is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol is for the entire system? No, the question says \"final NN state\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is from a nuclear physics context where the NN system can have higher spins? Wait, two nucleons are each spin-1/2, so total spin can be 0 or 1. So any term symbol with 2S+1=5 or 7 is impossible. Thus, option A and any other with higher terms are invalid. \n\nSo, in the given options, A and D are invalid. But the question is a multiple-choice with options A-D, so only one is correct. \n\nWait, let's check the options again. The problem states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for each option, we must ensure that the final NN's T is 0. \n\nSo for option D: \n\nThe NN's T is not 0 (as per calculation above), so that's invalid. \n\nFor option A: the NN's term is impossible (so it can't exist), so that's invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are single choice. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in option D's T calculation. Let me check again. \n\nOption D: the term symbol is 3P0. \n\nS is 1 (since 2S+1=3). L is 1 (P). \n\nThen T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +1 +1 = 3 mod2 \u2192 1. But the problem says T(NN)=0, so this is invalid. \n\nYes. \n\nSo which of the options is invalid? The question asks which is \"not permitted\". \n\nThe options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nSo the answer must be either A or D. \n\nLooking at the options, perhaps the question expects that the parity is the key here, but I need to recheck all steps. \n\nLet me re-express all steps:\n\nFor each option, we need:\n\n1. The final NN state must have T=0 \u2192 S + L_NN must be odd (since T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 0 \u2192 S+L must be odd).\n\n2. Parity conservation: L_NN + l (emitted particle's angular momentum) must be odd. \n\n3. Angular momentum conservation: The NN's J_NN must equal the particle's l (since total J must be 0, so J_NN = l and they are opposite in direction). Wait, earlier I thought that the NN's J must equal l, but let's re-express this properly. \n\nThe total angular momentum before (initial) is 0. After emission, the total angular momentum must still be 0. The NN has angular momentum J_NN, and the emitted particle has angular momentum l. The total angular momentum is the vector sum of J_NN and l. For the total to be 0, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN must equal l, and their vectors are antiparallel. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, the NN's J_NN (given in the term symbol's subscript) must equal l (the emitted particle's angular momentum). \n\nAh! This is a crucial point I missed earlier. \n\nSo the J_NN (the subscript in the term symbol) must equal l (the emitted particle's l value). \n\nSo let's check each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 J_NN =1. The emitted particle is p (l=1). So J_NN =1 equals l=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 J_NN=1. The emitted particle is p (l=1). So 1=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 J_NN=3. The emitted particle is f (l=3). So 3=3 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 J_NN=0. The emitted particle is s (l=0). 0=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo angular momentum conservation is satisfied in all options except maybe none. Wait, so that condition is okay. \n\nNow, back to the other constraints. \n\nSo for each option:\n\nA: Term symbol 7D1 (invalid S=3) \u2192 invalid state. \n\nD: T=1 instead of 0 \u2192 invalid. \n\nB: T=0 (since S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 odd \u2192 T=0. Parity: L_NN + l=0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 okay. So B is valid. \n\nC: T=0 (S=1 + L=2 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0). Parity: L_NN (2) + l (3)=5 \u2192 odd. Okay. \n\nThus the invalid options are A and D. \n\nBut the question is a single choice. The options are A to D. The question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nThe problem might consider that the term symbol in A is impossible, so the process can't happen. So A is invalid. \n\nD is invalid because T is 1. \n\nBut the options may have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So D's final NN state has T=1, so it's invalid. So D is invalid. \n\nBut A's final NN state can't exist (term symbol invalid), so it's also invalid. \n\nHmm. The question is from an exam, so likely only one answer is correct. Let's see the options again. \n\nThe problem says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". \n\nFor option A, even if the term symbol is impossible, the problem might expect us to proceed under the given term symbols, assuming they are possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol's S. \n\nWait, let's re-express for option A: 7D1. If the S in the term symbol is not the NN's spin but something else, but according to the note, it's the NN's spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the NN system can have higher spins if they have orbital angular momentum. Wait no, spin here refers to the total spin of the two nucleons, which is their intrinsic spin. So their total spin is either 0 or 1. \n\nTherefore, the term symbol 7D1 (S=3) is impossible. Thus, the transition in A is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A and D. But since the options are single choice, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the problem's exact wording again. \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for D, even though the T is wrong, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the parity or angular momentum conservation. \n\nWait, let's re-examine option D: \n\nThe NN's J_NN is 0 (from the term symbol 3P0, J=0). The emitted particle has l=0 (s). \n\nTotal angular momentum after emission: J_NN + l = 0 +0 \u2192 can have total 0. So angular momentum is okay. \n\nBut the T condition is violated. Since T must be 0, but it's 1, so that's invalid. \n\nThus D is invalid. \n\nOption A is invalid because the term symbol's S is impossible. \n\nThe question is to pick which is \"not permitted\". \n\nAssuming that the term symbol is possible (maybe the problem allows higher S?), perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the parity is the key. \n\nWait, let's recheck parity for D:\n\nOption D: L_NN =1 (P), l=0 (s). \n\nL_NN + l =1 +0 =1 (odd). So parity is okay. \n\nThe problem is that T is wrong. \n\nSo D is invalid because of the T condition. \n\nA is invalid because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. \n\nThe partial wave refers to the emitted particle's angular momentum (the lowercase letter). \n\nWait, the question's first line says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the partial wave of X is given by the letter (p, s, etc.), but the question is about the partial wave not permitted. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using \"partial wave\" to refer to the NN's L? Or the emitted particle's l? \n\nThe term \"partial wave\" usually refers to the angular momentum of the emitted particle. Because in scattering, the partial wave is characterized by the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. \n\nSo the question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the partial wave is the l value of X (p is l=1, s=0, f=3, etc.). \n\nThus the options are transitions where the emitted particle has a certain l (partial wave), and we have to find which l is not allowed. \n\nSo even if the term symbol is invalid (like A's 7D1), the question might still consider the partial wave (p) allowed or not based on other constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may consider that the term symbol in A is impossible, so the partial wave p is not allowed in that case. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D because of the T condition. \n\nHmm. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, so any option where the final NN's T is not 0 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, D is invalid because T=1. \n\nA is invalid because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe question might have D as the answer because it's a real term symbol (the NN can have S=1, L=1), but their T is wrong. \n\nThe options given in the problem are likely to have one correct answer. Let me see the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D's term symbol 3P0. The T is 1, which is not 0. So that's invalid. \n\nOption A's term symbol is impossible (so the final NN can't be in that state), so the process can't happen. \n\nThe question is asking which partial wave (i.e., which emitted particle's l) is not permitted. \n\nSo for option A, the partial wave is p (l=1). The reason it's invalid is because the final NN state can't exist (due to S=3), so the process can't occur. Thus the partial wave p is not allowed here. \n\nSimilarly, D's partial wave is s (l=0). The process can't happen because T is wrong, so the s partial wave is not allowed here. \n\nBut the question is which of the options is not permitted. Each option is a specific transition (including the final NN state and the emitted particle's l). So the question is which of the four options is not allowed. \n\nBoth A and D are invalid, but the options may have only one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nThe problem might have intended that the T condition is the key. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D's NN state has T=1, which violates the given condition, so the transition is invalid. \n\nOption A's transition is invalid because the NN can't be in that state. \n\nSo both are invalid, but perhaps the question considers the T condition as the main point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the parity calculation. \n\nWait, let's recheck the parity condition:\n\nThe parity equation was:\n\nL_NN + l must be odd. \n\nFor option A: L_NN=2 (D), l=1 (p). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay. \n\nThus parity is okay. \n\nThe term symbol is the issue here. \n\nSince the problem is from a test, maybe the term symbols are all valid, and the S in the term symbol refers to the total spin of the NN plus orbital? No, according to the problem's note, S is the total spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the term symbols despite the spin being higher, perhaps considering that the NN's spin can be higher when combined with orbital angular momentum? No, spin is intrinsic. \n\nHmm, this is a tough one. Maybe the answer is D because it's a real term symbol but violates T condition. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is A because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe problem states that the final NN must have T=0. \n\nSo for option A, even if the term symbol is impossible, it's invalid. \n\nSince the options are given as possible, perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's the only one that violates the T condition given the problem's parameters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the T condition. Let me recheck:\n\nThe condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nT(NN) is 0. \n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2. \n\nSo S + L must be odd. \n\nFor option A's term symbol (if we ignore the impossibility of S=3):\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0. \n\nThus T is okay. \n\nBut the spin S=3 is impossible, so the term symbol is invalid. \n\nThus the process is invalid. \n\nOption D's S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 T would be (even +1)=1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. \n\nThus T is not 0. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid. \n\nThe options are A, B, C, D. The problem must have one answer. Perhaps the question expects the answer to be D because it's a real term symbol but violates T, while A is invalid for a different reason. The question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". \n\nThe parity is okay for both A and D. \n\nThe angular momentum conservation is okay for all except none. \n\nThe T condition is violated in D and A (if term is allowed). \n\nBut since A's term is impossible, it's invalid for that reason. \n\nThe question says \"not permitted\", so both are invalid. But since the options are singular, perhaps the intended answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem statement, it says \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)\". \n\nSo the question gives that equation, and the final NN must have T=0, so we have to use that equation. \n\nThus, any option where that equation is not satisfied is invalid. \n\nSo for D: S + L +1 mod2 =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1 \u2192 T=1, which contradicts T=0. So D is invalid. \n\nA's term would have S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0, so that equation is satisfied. But the spin is impossible. \n\nThus, the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the question might consider that the term symbol in A is valid, but that's physically impossible. \n\nHmm, I'm torn between A and D. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a typo and option A's term is 3D1 instead of 7D1. But assuming the problem is correct, I think the answer is D. \n\nWait, let me look at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe problem's note says the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. \n\nSo for D's term 3P0: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1; L=1 (P); J=0. \n\nThe spin of the NN is 1, which is okay (since two nucleons can have S=1). \n\nThe T condition is violated, so D is invalid. \n\nA's term is 7D1, which requires S=3, impossible. \n\nThus both A and D are invalid. \n\nBut the options must have one answer. Since the question is from an exam, perhaps the answer is A because the term is impossible, so the partial wave p (in A) is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the problem expects us to ignore the term symbol validity and focus on the other conditions. \n\nIf we ignore the term symbol validity, then:\n\nA's T is okay (S=3 + L=2 \u2192 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0). \n\nParity is okay (L_NN=2 + l=1 \u21923 odd). \n\nAngular momentum J_NN=1 equals l=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, only D is invalid. \n\nHence the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. \n\nWait, but why would the problem include an impossible term symbol in A? It's more likely that the question assumes the term symbols are valid and the T condition is the key. \n\nYes, perhaps the problem is testing the T condition and parity. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The problem states that Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. We're told that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and we need to find which of the given partial waves isn't allowed. The options are A to D, each involving different transitions and the emitted particle's angular momentum (denoted by the lowercase letter like p, f, s).\n\nFirst, let's recall some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol here is (2S+1)L_J. So for 1S0, that means S (total spin) is 0, because (2S+1)=1 implies S=0. The L here is S, which is 0 (since S in spectroscopic notation corresponds to L=0). The total angular momentum J is 0 as well, which makes sense since J = L + S when they are aligned. So the initial NN system has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Since T is the isospin, and for two nucleons (protons and neutrons), the isospin can be either 0 or 1. The condition given here is T = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T is 0, that means S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be even. So S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Therefore, either S is odd and L even, or vice versa.\n\nNext, we have to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of the initial state is determined by (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, the initial parity is (+1)^0 = 1. The final state's parity must also be conserved. The total parity before and after must be the same. The final parity is the product of the NN final parity and the particle X's parity. \n\nThe parity of the NN final state is (-1)^L_final. The particle X's parity is given as -1. So total parity after emission is (-1)^L_final * (-1). The initial parity was 1, so:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1)\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\n(-1)^{L_final} * (-1) = 1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final} = -1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_final} = -1 \u2192 so L_final must be odd. Because (-1)^odd is -1. So L_final must be an odd integer.\n\nAdditionally, we need to conserve angular momentum. The total angular momentum before (initial) is J_initial = 0. The final state's total angular momentum must be the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum. Let's denote the emitted particle's angular momentum as l (given by the lowercase letter in the options: p is l=1, f is l=3, s is l=0, etc.). \n\nSo the total angular momentum conservation requires that the NN's total angular momentum plus the particle's angular momentum must have a possible combination that includes J_initial = 0. \n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be conserved. The initial total J is 0. The final state must have the NN's J_NN plus the particle's angular momentum l such that their vector sum can result in 0. The possible total J values would be |J_NN - l| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J_NN + l. Since the total must be 0, the only possibility is that J_NN = l and their vectors are opposite. So J_NN must equal l, and the projection must be such that they cancel. Alternatively, the possible total angular momentum must include 0. So the minimum possible J is |J_NN - l|, and the maximum is J_NN + l. For 0 to be in that range, we must have that |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l \u2192 which implies that J_NN = l. Because otherwise, if J_NN > l, then the minimum would be J_NN - l, so to have 0, J_NN - l \u2264 0 \u2192 J_NN \u2264 l. But if J_NN < l, then the minimum would be l - J_NN, so that must be \u22640, which would require l - J_NN \u22640 \u2192 l \u2264 J_NN. Contradiction. So the only way is that J_NN = l, and then the total can be zero if their vectors are opposite. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the total angular momentum must have a possible value of 0. So the possible total J values are from |J_NN - l| up to J_NN + l. So 0 must be within that interval. Therefore, |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. The only way this can happen is if J_NN = l, because then the minimum and maximum would be 0 and 2l, so 0 is included. Alternatively, if J_NN and l are such that their difference is zero, so they are equal. So, J_NN must equal l. Because otherwise, if J_NN is not equal to l, the minimum would be |J_NN - l|, which would have to be \u22640, which only happens when J_NN = l. So yes, J_NN must equal l. So that's a key point. So the angular momentum of the NN system (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum l of the emitted particle. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So for example, in option A, the emitted particle is a p (l=1), so the particle has l=1. The NN's final angular momentum must then be J_NN = l =1? Hmm, but let's check each option step by step.\n\nAlso, the term symbols for the final NN state are given in each option. Let's parse each option:\n\nTake each option one by one. The options are transitions from 1S0 (initial) to a final NN state (given by the term symbol) plus a particle X with angular momentum l (given by the lowercase letter). Let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The final NN state's term symbol is 7D1. Let's parse that term symbol. The 7 comes from 2S+1, so S = 3 (since 2*3+1=7). The D means L = 2 (since S corresponds to 0, P to 1, D to 2). The J is 1 (the subscript). Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S? Wait, no, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L of the NN system and their spin S. But actually, in the term symbol, J can be any value from |L-S| to L+S in integer steps. But here the term symbol is 7D1, so J=1. So L=2, S=3 (from the 7), and J=1. \n\nWait, but S is the total spin of the NN system here. Let me check. For two nucleons, each nucleon has spin 1/2. The total spin S can be 0 or 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, the two nucleons are fermions, so their total spin S must be 0 or 1. Because each has spin 1/2, so adding two spin 1/2 gives S=0 or 1. But in the term symbol given here, the 7 suggests that 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, which is impossible. Wait a second, that can't be. That must be an error. Wait, maybe I misread the term symbol. The term symbol is given as, for example, 7D1. The first number is 2S+1. So for 7, that would require S = 3. But that's impossible because two nucleons can't have spin 3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, the problem states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So perhaps the isospin is 0, so the NN pair must be in a state where their isospin is zero. For two nucleons (proton and neutron), the isospin can be 0 or 1. To have T=0, they must be in a singlet state, so their isospin is 0. But the spin and isospin are separate. Wait, but the problem's condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, the variables here are S(NN) is the spin, L(NN) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, and T(NN) is the isospin. The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, then S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. \n\nBut back to the term symbols. Let's parse each option correctly. Let me check again. For example, option A's final NN state is 7D1. The 7 would be 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. But that's impossible for two nucleons. Wait, that's a problem. Maybe the term symbol is for the emitted particle? No, the question says the term symbol refers to the NN state. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the term symbol is written differently? Let me think again. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So for the NN system, their spin S (total spin) plus orbital angular momentum L gives J. But for two nucleons, S can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, the term symbol's first number (2S+1) can only be 1 or 3. So the 7 in option A's term symbol (7D1) is impossible. That suggests that maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term symbol's application here. Wait, maybe the term symbol here refers to the particle X? No, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol must be for the NN system. Therefore, 7D1 would be invalid because S can't be 3. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the question uses a different notation? Let me check the problem again. The note says \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps S here is the total spin of the NN system, but L is the orbital angular momentum between the two nucleons. So for the NN system's total spin S can be 0 or 1, as two spin-1/2 particles. But in the term symbol, the 2S+1 would be 1 or 3. So any term symbol with 5, 7, etc. is impossible for the NN system. Therefore, the options must have made an error, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, maybe the term symbol is for the emitted particle? No, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol is for the NN. Therefore, perhaps the problem is using a different convention where S is the total spin of the entire system, including orbital angular momentum? Wait, no, the term symbol is standard. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me look at the options again. \n\nWait, option C is 3D3 + f. The term symbol 3D3. Here 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=2 (D), J=3. That's possible. So S=1 (allowed for two nucleons), so that works. Option D: 3P0. The P means L=1. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. J=0. Wait, J must be L + S or other combinations, but J can't be less than |L - S|. Here L=1, S=1, so J can be 0,1, or 2. So J=0 is possible. Okay, so that's okay. \n\nWait, the problem with option A is the 7. Because 2S+1=7 implies S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, option A's term symbol is invalid, so that can't be a permitted state. Wait, but the question says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". So maybe option A is invalid because the term symbol is impossible? But the question might have a different approach here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term symbol refers to the particle X? No, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol given in each option must be for the NN system. Therefore, any term symbol with 2S+1 greater than 3 is impossible. So the options A and C: \n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3 \u2192 impossible. \n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nTherefore, option A's term symbol is invalid, so that transition can't happen. But the problem might not be considering that, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the term symbol refers to the emitted particle? Let me see. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so the term symbol must be for the NN. So the problem must have a typo, but perhaps the options are correct as given, and I need to proceed. Wait, perhaps the S in the term symbol refers to the spin of the emitted particle? That can't be. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the term symbol is for the entire system? No, the question states that the term symbol is for the NN state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me recheck the problem statement. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". The term symbol given in each option (like 7D1) is for the NN state. Therefore, the term symbols with 7 must be invalid. So option A's final NN state is impossible. Therefore, that transition can't happen. But the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So maybe the answer is A? But I need to check all steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbols are okay, and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let me consider that perhaps the S in the term symbol is not the spin of the NN but something else? No, according to the note given, \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.\" So for the NN system, S is their total spin. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering a different system, like the particle X? No, the problem says \"the final NN state\". So the term symbol must be for the NN. \n\nSo if that's the case, option A's term symbol 7D1 is impossible, so the process described in option A cannot occur. Therefore, the answer would be A? But let me check the other options. Let me see:\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p. The term symbol for NN is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation is L=0), J=1. That's okay because S=1 is possible for two nucleons. So that works.\n\nOption C: 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=2 (D), J=3. Since J can be L + S (2+1=3), so that's okay. \n\nOption D: 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1, L=1 (P), J=0. Since J must be at least |L - S| = 0 (since L=1 and S=1, so |1-1|=0), so J=0 is possible. \n\nSo the only invalid term symbol is option A's 7D1. Hence, that transition is not allowed because the final NN state can't have S=3. Therefore, the answer would be A. But wait, the problem might have another angle. Let's proceed to check other constraints.\n\nAdditionally, we have to consider parity conservation. The initial parity is (+1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0 (1S0), so initial parity is +1. The final parity must also be +1. The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the emitted particle's parity. \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN). The particle X has parity -1. So total final parity is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1). This must equal initial parity of +1. Therefore,\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) = 1 \u21d2 (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u21d2 L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo the NN's orbital angular momentum L_NN must be odd. Let's check each option's L_NN:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 L_NN is D (2). Which is even. But we need L_NN to be odd. So this violates parity conservation. \n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 L=0 (S). Even. But L must be odd. Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, L_NN must be odd. So option B would have L=0 (even), which would give (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1, which is not equal to initial parity +1. Therefore, that would also violate parity conservation. Wait, but the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So we need to check all constraints together. \n\nHold on, so first, for each option, the NN's final state must have T=0, which requires that S + L_NN is odd (since T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L +1 is even \u2192 S + L must be odd). \n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: \n\nTerm symbol 7D1 \u2192 S=3 (invalid?), L_NN=2 (D is L=2). But S=3 is impossible. So this term is invalid, so the state can't exist. So regardless of other factors, this is not allowed. \n\nOption B: \n\n3S1 \u2192 S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L_NN=0 (S). \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 = 1 +0 +1 mod2 = 2 mod2 =0 \u2192 T=0. So that's okay. \n\nParity: L_NN is 0 (even). Then final parity: (-1)^0 * (-1) = -1. But initial was +1. So that's a problem. So parity is not conserved here. Therefore, this transition is invalid. \n\nWait, so both A and B might be invalid? But the options must have one correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the question says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". The options are transitions, so each option's process must satisfy angular momentum, parity, and the given condition on T. \n\nSo let's go through each step for each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p (particle p has l=1, since p is l=1)\n\nFirst, the final NN state's term symbol is 7D1. Since S=3 is impossible, this term is impossible. So the process can't happen. So this is invalid. \n\nOption B: 3S1 + p (l=1). \n\nThe NN's term is 3S1. So S=1, L_NN=0. \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +0 +1 = 2 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Good. \n\nParity: NN's parity is (-1)^0 =1. Multiply by X's parity (-1) \u2192 total final parity 1*(-1)= -1. But initial was +1. So parity not conserved. So this transition is invalid. \n\nOption C: 3D3 + f (f is l=3). \n\nTerm symbol: 3D3 \u2192 S=1 (2S+1=3), L_NN=2 (D). \n\nCheck T: S + L +1 mod2 \u21921 +2 +1 =4 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0. Good. \n\nParity: NN's parity (-1)^2 =1. Multiply by X's parity (-1) \u2192 total parity 1*(-1) = -1. Not equal to initial +1. So parity not conserved. So invalid?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, so for option C, parity is also violating. Hmm. \n\nWait, let me check again: the emitted particle has l=3 (f). The particle's angular momentum l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, actually, when a particle is emitted, the angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) is part of the total angular momentum conservation. But for parity, the particle's parity is given as -1, which is its intrinsic parity, but does its orbital angular momentum affect the parity? Wait, the parity of the emitted particle would be its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. Wait, the problem states that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the total parity contribution from X is (-1)^{intrinsic} * (-1)^l. Wait, no: the parity of a particle with orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity. So the total parity of X is intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. \n\nAh! I think I made a mistake here. The parity of the emitted particle X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum (the angular momentum associated with its emission). The problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1, so its parity is (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is given by intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l. So the total parity of the system after emission is:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final (NN) * Parity_final (X)\n\nParity_initial = 1 (since initial state is 1S0, L=0 \u2192 parity +1)\n\nParity_final (X) = intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^l \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN}\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^l ] \n\nWait, intrinsic_parity_X is -1, so:\n\nParity_X = (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l \n\nWait, no: Parity_X = intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l \u2192 since intrinsic_parity is -1, that would be (-1) * (-1)^l = - (-1)^l. Wait, no, (-1)^l is the parity contribution from the orbital angular momentum. So the total Parity_X is (intrinsic_parity) * (-1)^l. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X \n\n\u2192 1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1) * (-1)^l ]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l +1} \n\nSo:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l +1}\n\nThus, (-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even. \n\nTherefore, L_NN + l +1 must be even \u2192 L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nThat's the parity condition. \n\nSo for each option, we need L_NN + l is odd. \n\nLet's check each option:\n\nOption A: \n\nFinal NN's L_NN is D (L=2). The emitted particle is p (l=1). \n\nSo 2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. But the term symbol is invalid (S=3 impossible). So the state can't exist, so the transition is invalid. \n\nOption B: \n\nNN's L_NN is 0 (S), particle l=1 (p). \n\n0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd. Parity condition holds. \n\nBut earlier, the T condition: T=0 requires S + L_NN must be odd. In option B, S=1, L_NN=0 \u2192 1+0=1 (odd). So that's okay. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the parity was violating? Wait, no. Let me recalculate with the corrected parity equation. \n\nThe parity equation is L_NN + l must be odd. For B, L_NN=0 and l=1 \u2192 0+1=1 (odd), so parity is okay. So that transition's parity is okay. \n\nWait, my mistake earlier was miscalculating the parity condition. So let me recast all options with the correct parity condition.\n\nSo parity condition is L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nNow, proceeding again:\n\nOption A:\n\nL_NN=2 (D), l=1 (p). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd. So parity okay. But the term symbol is invalid (S=3 for NN impossible). So this is invalid. \n\nOption B:\n\nL_NN=0, l=1. Sum is odd \u2192 okay. The term symbol is valid (S=1 possible). T condition holds. So this is allowed. \n\nOption C:\n\nTerm symbol 3D3 \u2192 L_NN=2 (D). The particle is f (l=3). \n\nL_NN + l = 2+3=5 \u2192 odd. Parity okay. \n\nCheck T: S=1 (from 2S+1=3), L_NN=2. S+L=1+2=3 \u2192 odd. So T=0 \u2192 good. \n\nThus this is allowed. \n\nOption D:\n\nTerm symbol 3P0 \u2192 L_NN=1 (P). The particle is s (l=0). \n\nL_NN + l =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. So parity okay. \n\nCheck T: S=1 (from 3), L_NN=1. S+L=2 \u2192 even \u2192 which would mean T= S+L +1 mod2 \u2192 2 mod2=0 \u2192 T= (0 +1?) Wait the equation given is T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Wait, T(NN)=0. \n\nWait the condition is T(NN) = (S + L +1) mod2. So S + L +1 must be even (since T is 0). So S + L must be odd. \n\nFor option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2, which is even. So S+L is even \u2192 T would be (even +1) mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem states that the final NN has T=0. Thus this violates the condition. So option D is invalid. \n\nAh, that's a key point. So for option D, even though parity and angular momentum might be okay, the T condition is not satisfied. Let me verify again:\n\nOption D's NN term is 3P0. \n\n2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L_NN is P \u2192 L=1. \n\nThen T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +1 +1 =3 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2. Which is 1, but the problem states T(NN)=0. So this violates the condition. Thus, option D is invalid. \n\nSo now, the possible invalid options are A (invalid term), D (invalid T), and B and C are okay. Wait, but option A's term is impossible because S=3 for the NN. So that's invalid. \n\nThe question is asking which is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D. \n\nSo the answer could be A and D. But since the options are singular, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait let's recheck option D again. \n\nOption D's final NN state is 3P0. \n\nThe term symbol: 3P0 \u2192 S=1 (since 2S+1=3). L=1 (P). \n\nThe T condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nS + L = 1 +1 =2 \u2192 2 mod2=0. \n\nThus T= 0 +1 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem says the final state has T=0. Therefore, this violates the given condition. So D is invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are single choice. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the transition must result in a final NN state with T=0. So any option where the final NN's T is not 0 is invalid. \n\nSo for option D, since the final T would be 1, it's invalid. \n\nFor option A, the term symbol is impossible, so the transition can't occur. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options might have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol analysis for A. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the term symbol's S is not the spin of the NN but something else? The note says \"the term symbol ... where S is the total spin\". So for the NN system, that must be their total spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol refers to the emitted particle? Let's see. \n\nIf the term symbol in the options refers to the emitted particle X, then the problem would make more sense. Let me try that approach. \n\nWait, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". The term symbol given in the options (like 7D1) would then be for the NN. But then, as before, the 7 is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol is for the entire system? No, the question says \"final NN state\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is from a nuclear physics context where the NN system can have higher spins? Wait, two nucleons are each spin-1/2, so total spin can be 0 or 1. So any term symbol with 2S+1=5 or 7 is impossible. Thus, option A and any other with higher terms are invalid. \n\nSo, in the given options, A and D are invalid. But the question is a multiple-choice with options A-D, so only one is correct. \n\nWait, let's check the options again. The problem states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for each option, we must ensure that the final NN's T is 0. \n\nSo for option D: \n\nThe NN's T is not 0 (as per calculation above), so that's invalid. \n\nFor option A: the NN's term is impossible (so it can't exist), so that's invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are single choice. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in option D's T calculation. Let me check again. \n\nOption D: the term symbol is 3P0. \n\nS is 1 (since 2S+1=3). L is 1 (P). \n\nThen T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1 +1 +1 = 3 mod2 \u2192 1. But the problem says T(NN)=0, so this is invalid. \n\nYes. \n\nSo which of the options is invalid? The question asks which is \"not permitted\". \n\nThe options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nSo the answer must be either A or D. \n\nLooking at the options, perhaps the question expects that the parity is the key here, but I need to recheck all steps. \n\nLet me re-express all steps:\n\nFor each option, we need:\n\n1. The final NN state must have T=0 \u2192 S + L_NN must be odd (since T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 0 \u2192 S+L must be odd).\n\n2. Parity conservation: L_NN + l (emitted particle's angular momentum) must be odd. \n\n3. Angular momentum conservation: The NN's J_NN must equal the particle's l (since total J must be 0, so J_NN = l and they are opposite in direction). Wait, earlier I thought that the NN's J must equal l, but let's re-express this properly. \n\nThe total angular momentum before (initial) is 0. After emission, the total angular momentum must still be 0. The NN has angular momentum J_NN, and the emitted particle has angular momentum l. The total angular momentum is the vector sum of J_NN and l. For the total to be 0, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN must equal l, and their vectors are antiparallel. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, the NN's J_NN (given in the term symbol's subscript) must equal l (the emitted particle's angular momentum). \n\nAh! This is a crucial point I missed earlier. \n\nSo the J_NN (the subscript in the term symbol) must equal l (the emitted particle's l value). \n\nSo let's check each option:\n\nOption A: 7D1 \u2192 J_NN =1. The emitted particle is p (l=1). So J_NN =1 equals l=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption B: 3S1 \u2192 J_NN=1. The emitted particle is p (l=1). So 1=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption C: 3D3 \u2192 J_NN=3. The emitted particle is f (l=3). So 3=3 \u2192 okay. \n\nOption D: 3P0 \u2192 J_NN=0. The emitted particle is s (l=0). 0=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo angular momentum conservation is satisfied in all options except maybe none. Wait, so that condition is okay. \n\nNow, back to the other constraints. \n\nSo for each option:\n\nA: Term symbol 7D1 (invalid S=3) \u2192 invalid state. \n\nD: T=1 instead of 0 \u2192 invalid. \n\nB: T=0 (since S=1, L=0 \u2192 1+0=1 odd \u2192 T=0. Parity: L_NN + l=0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 okay. So B is valid. \n\nC: T=0 (S=1 + L=2 \u2192 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0). Parity: L_NN (2) + l (3)=5 \u2192 odd. Okay. \n\nThus the invalid options are A and D. \n\nBut the question is a single choice. The options are A to D. The question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nThe problem might consider that the term symbol in A is impossible, so the process can't happen. So A is invalid. \n\nD is invalid because T is 1. \n\nBut the options may have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So D's final NN state has T=1, so it's invalid. So D is invalid. \n\nBut A's final NN state can't exist (term symbol invalid), so it's also invalid. \n\nHmm. The question is from an exam, so likely only one answer is correct. Let's see the options again. \n\nThe problem says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". \n\nFor option A, even if the term symbol is impossible, the problem might expect us to proceed under the given term symbols, assuming they are possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol's S. \n\nWait, let's re-express for option A: 7D1. If the S in the term symbol is not the NN's spin but something else, but according to the note, it's the NN's spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the NN system can have higher spins if they have orbital angular momentum. Wait no, spin here refers to the total spin of the two nucleons, which is their intrinsic spin. So their total spin is either 0 or 1. \n\nTherefore, the term symbol 7D1 (S=3) is impossible. Thus, the transition in A is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A and D. But since the options are single choice, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the problem's exact wording again. \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for D, even though the T is wrong, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the parity or angular momentum conservation. \n\nWait, let's re-examine option D: \n\nThe NN's J_NN is 0 (from the term symbol 3P0, J=0). The emitted particle has l=0 (s). \n\nTotal angular momentum after emission: J_NN + l = 0 +0 \u2192 can have total 0. So angular momentum is okay. \n\nBut the T condition is violated. Since T must be 0, but it's 1, so that's invalid. \n\nThus D is invalid. \n\nOption A is invalid because the term symbol's S is impossible. \n\nThe question is to pick which is \"not permitted\". \n\nAssuming that the term symbol is possible (maybe the problem allows higher S?), perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the parity is the key. \n\nWait, let's recheck parity for D:\n\nOption D: L_NN =1 (P), l=0 (s). \n\nL_NN + l =1 +0 =1 (odd). So parity is okay. \n\nThe problem is that T is wrong. \n\nSo D is invalid because of the T condition. \n\nA is invalid because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. \n\nThe partial wave refers to the emitted particle's angular momentum (the lowercase letter). \n\nWait, the question's first line says \"the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the partial wave of X is given by the letter (p, s, etc.), but the question is about the partial wave not permitted. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using \"partial wave\" to refer to the NN's L? Or the emitted particle's l? \n\nThe term \"partial wave\" usually refers to the angular momentum of the emitted particle. Because in scattering, the partial wave is characterized by the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. \n\nSo the question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the partial wave is the l value of X (p is l=1, s=0, f=3, etc.). \n\nThus the options are transitions where the emitted particle has a certain l (partial wave), and we have to find which l is not allowed. \n\nSo even if the term symbol is invalid (like A's 7D1), the question might still consider the partial wave (p) allowed or not based on other constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may consider that the term symbol in A is impossible, so the partial wave p is not allowed in that case. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D because of the T condition. \n\nHmm. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, so any option where the final NN's T is not 0 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, D is invalid because T=1. \n\nA is invalid because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe question might have D as the answer because it's a real term symbol (the NN can have S=1, L=1), but their T is wrong. \n\nThe options given in the problem are likely to have one correct answer. Let me see the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D's term symbol 3P0. The T is 1, which is not 0. So that's invalid. \n\nOption A's term symbol is impossible (so the final NN can't be in that state), so the process can't happen. \n\nThe question is asking which partial wave (i.e., which emitted particle's l) is not permitted. \n\nSo for option A, the partial wave is p (l=1). The reason it's invalid is because the final NN state can't exist (due to S=3), so the process can't occur. Thus the partial wave p is not allowed here. \n\nSimilarly, D's partial wave is s (l=0). The process can't happen because T is wrong, so the s partial wave is not allowed here. \n\nBut the question is which of the options is not permitted. Each option is a specific transition (including the final NN state and the emitted particle's l). So the question is which of the four options is not allowed. \n\nBoth A and D are invalid, but the options may have only one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nThe problem might have intended that the T condition is the key. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D's NN state has T=1, which violates the given condition, so the transition is invalid. \n\nOption A's transition is invalid because the NN can't be in that state. \n\nSo both are invalid, but perhaps the question considers the T condition as the main point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the parity calculation. \n\nWait, let's recheck the parity condition:\n\nThe parity equation was:\n\nL_NN + l must be odd. \n\nFor option A: L_NN=2 (D), l=1 (p). 2+1=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay. \n\nThus parity is okay. \n\nThe term symbol is the issue here. \n\nSince the problem is from a test, maybe the term symbols are all valid, and the S in the term symbol refers to the total spin of the NN plus orbital? No, according to the problem's note, S is the total spin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the term symbols despite the spin being higher, perhaps considering that the NN's spin can be higher when combined with orbital angular momentum? No, spin is intrinsic. \n\nHmm, this is a tough one. Maybe the answer is D because it's a real term symbol but violates T condition. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is A because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe problem states that the final NN must have T=0. \n\nSo for option A, even if the term symbol is impossible, it's invalid. \n\nSince the options are given as possible, perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's the only one that violates the T condition given the problem's parameters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the T condition. Let me recheck:\n\nThe condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nT(NN) is 0. \n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2. \n\nSo S + L must be odd. \n\nFor option A's term symbol (if we ignore the impossibility of S=3):\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0. \n\nThus T is okay. \n\nBut the spin S=3 is impossible, so the term symbol is invalid. \n\nThus the process is invalid. \n\nOption D's S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 T would be (even +1)=1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. \n\nThus T is not 0. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid. \n\nThe options are A, B, C, D. The problem must have one answer. Perhaps the question expects the answer to be D because it's a real term symbol but violates T, while A is invalid for a different reason. The question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". \n\nThe parity is okay for both A and D. \n\nThe angular momentum conservation is okay for all except none. \n\nThe T condition is violated in D and A (if term is allowed). \n\nBut since A's term is impossible, it's invalid for that reason. \n\nThe question says \"not permitted\", so both are invalid. But since the options are singular, perhaps the intended answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem statement, it says \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)\". \n\nSo the question gives that equation, and the final NN must have T=0, so we have to use that equation. \n\nThus, any option where that equation is not satisfied is invalid. \n\nSo for D: S + L +1 mod2 =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1 \u2192 T=1, which contradicts T=0. So D is invalid. \n\nA's term would have S=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u2192 T=0, so that equation is satisfied. But the spin is impossible. \n\nThus, the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the question might consider that the term symbol in A is valid, but that's physically impossible. \n\nHmm, I'm torn between A and D. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a typo and option A's term is 3D1 instead of 7D1. But assuming the problem is correct, I think the answer is D. \n\nWait, let me look at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe problem's note says the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. \n\nSo for D's term 3P0: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1; L=1 (P); J=0. \n\nThe spin of the NN is 1, which is okay (since two nucleons can have S=1). \n\nThe T condition is violated, so D is invalid. \n\nA's term is 7D1, which requires S=3, impossible. \n\nThus both A and D are invalid. \n\nBut the options must have one answer. Since the question is from an exam, perhaps the answer is A because the term is impossible, so the partial wave p (in A) is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, the problem expects us to ignore the term symbol validity and focus on the other conditions. \n\nIf we ignore the term symbol validity, then:\n\nA's T is okay (S=3 + L=2 \u2192 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 T=0). \n\nParity is okay (L_NN=2 + l=1 \u21923 odd). \n\nAngular momentum J_NN=1 equals l=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, only D is invalid. \n\nHence the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. \n\nWait, but why would the problem include an impossible term symbol in A? It's more likely that the question assumes the term symbols are valid and the T condition is the key. \n\nYes, perhaps the problem is testing the T condition and parity. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in a 1S0 state. This means \\( S_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\), \\( L_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\), and \\( J_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Final NN State Requirements**:\n   - \\( T_{\\text{NN}} = 0 \\), which requires \\( S_{\\text{NN}} + L_{\\text{NN}} \\) to be odd (since \\( T = S + L + 1 \\mod 2 \\)).\n   - **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity is \\( (+1)^{L_{\\text{initial}}} = (+1)^0 = 1 \\). The final parity must match, so \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}}} \\cdot (-1)^{l} \\cdot (-1) = 1 \\). Simplifying, \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l \\) must be odd.\n   - **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the final NN and emitted particle must conserve \\( J_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\). Thus, \\( J_{\\text{NN}} = l \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **Option A (1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p)**:\n     - Term symbol: \\( 7D_1 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{NN}} = 3 \\), which is impossible for two nucleons (spin can only be 0 or 1).\n     - **Invalid** due to an impossible spin value for the NN system.\n   - **Option B (1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p)**:\n     - Term symbol: \\( 3S_1 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{NN}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 0 \\).\n     - Check \\( T \\): \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (odd), so \\( T = 0 \\).\n     - Check parity: \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \\) (odd), valid.\n     - **Valid**.\n   - **Option C (1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f)**:\n     - Term symbol: \\( 3D_3 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{NN}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 2 \\).\n     - Check \\( T \\): \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) (odd), so \\( T = 0 \\).\n     - Check parity: \\( L_{\\text{NN}} + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \\) (odd), valid.\n     - **Valid**.\n   - **Option D (1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s)**:\n     - Term symbol: \\( 3P_0 \\) implies \\( S_{\\text{NN}} = 1 \\), \\( L_{\\text{NN}} = 1 \\).\n     - Check \\( T \\): \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (even), so \\( T = (2 + 1) \\mod 2 = 1 \\neq 0 \\).\n     - **Invalid** due to incorrect \\( T \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: Both options A and D are invalid. However, since the question specifies using the given conditions (and assuming the term symbols are valid unless physically impossible), the correct answer is **D**, as it violates the \\( T \\) condition explicitly.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. We need to figure out which partial wave transition isn't allowed based on the given conditions. The key points are the Pauli statistics condition, conservation of angular momentum, and parity.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol here is (2S+1)L_J, so S is the total spin of the NN system. Here, the term is 1S0, so the spin S must be 0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0). The orbital angular momentum L for S is 0, and the total angular momentum J is 0 as well (since the last number is J). So the initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN)=0. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, this means S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd. Therefore, the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN must be odd. That's one condition.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity conservation must hold. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1. The final state's parity must also equal the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X. Wait, actually, parity conservation says that the total parity before and after must be the same. The initial parity is that of the NN system. The final parity is the product of the NN final parity and the X's parity. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_X.\n\nTherefore, rearranged: Parity_final = Parity_initial / Parity_X. Since Parity_X is -1, and initial parity is +1, then Parity_final = (+1)/(-1) = -1. Wait, but the final parity of the NN system plus the emitted particle must be equal to the initial parity. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the total system. The total parity before (initial NN) must equal the total parity after (final NN plus emitted X). Since the X is a particle, its parity is part of the final state. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final(NN) * Parity(X) * (-1)^{L_X} ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that when particles are emitted, their parity is considered along with their orbital angular momentum. The parity of a particle in a partial wave with angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the total parity of the final state (NN plus X) must equal the initial parity.\n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final parity is the product of the NN's parity, X's parity, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. Wait, actually, the parity of the emitted particle X in its partial wave is (-1)^{l}, where l is the angular momentum of X (since the question says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is denoted by the lowercase letter). So the total parity after emission is [Parity(NN_final)] * [Parity(X) * (-1)^l] must equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, perhaps breaking it down:\n\nThe initial system (NN) has parity P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final system is NN (with their own parity) plus X. The parity of the X's state includes its intrinsic parity and its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN. So the X's contribution to the parity is (-1)^l (from its orbital angular momentum) multiplied by its intrinsic parity (-1). The NN's final state has parity (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the total final parity is:\n\n[ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1)^{l} * (-1) ] = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1.\n\nSo, (-1)^{L_final + l +1} = +1 \u2192 exponent must be even. So L_final + l +1 must be even \u2192 L_final + l must be odd.\n\nSo, L_final + l is odd. That's one equation.\n\nAdditionally, the NN final state must have T=0. From the given condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2 =0 mod2. So S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be odd.\n\nAlso, we need to consider conservation of angular momentum. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial =0. The final angular momentum comes from the NN's angular momentum (J_NN_final) plus the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (l, since it's the orbital angular momentum between X and NN?), but actually, in terms of the total system, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial J (0). But how exactly does that split?\n\nHmm, perhaps the angular momentum of the emitted particle is l (its orbital angular momentum), and the NN's angular momentum is J_NN = sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ...?), but maybe we need to consider that the total angular momentum J_initial (0) must be the sum of the NN's final angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l). But angular momentum addition is more complicated. The total J_final (for NN + X) must equal J_initial (0). So the vector sum of the NN's J and the X's l must give 0. Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum of the system (NN plus X) must be zero. So the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN = L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum l of the X (since it's emitted in an orbital state l) must combine to give total J=0. \n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the total angular momentum of the final state is the sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the X (l). But since they are in a compound system, their angular momenta must add up such that the total is zero. So J_NN + l must be able to form a total J=0. That requires that J_NN and l can combine to give 0. So the possible values are |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. The only way that can happen is if J_NN = l and they are aligned opposite. But since the total has to be exactly 0, the minimum possible total angular momentum when adding J_NN and l is |J_NN - l|. So to get total J=0, it must be that J_NN = l and the components are opposite. Alternatively, maybe the total J is zero, so the combination must have a possible J value of zero. For example, if J_NN and l are such that |J_NN - l| \u22640 \u2264 J_NN + l. Which implies that J_NN = l, and the total can be zero. So for instance, if J_NN = l, then the total can be 0, 2,... up to 2l. Wait, but the total must exactly equal zero. So the only way that the total angular momentum can be zero is if the two angular momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in terms of quantum numbers, the total angular momentum must be an integer or half-integer, but here all are integers because we're dealing with nucleons and orbital angular momenta (which are integers). So the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum l of the emitted particle, and their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN must equal l, and the total J is 0. So the possible J_NN and l must satisfy J_NN = l, and the combination can form a total of 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the vector sum, so the total J must be zero. So the sum of J_NN and l must have a possible value of zero. The possible total J values when adding two angular momenta J1 and J2 are |J1 - J2| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J1 + J2. To have J_total =0, the only possibility is J1 = J2, and the components are exactly opposite. So J_NN must equal l, and the total can be zero. Therefore, the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) must equal l (the l of the emitted particle). \n\nTherefore, J_NN = L_NN + S_NN must equal l. Wait, but J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN, which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ...). Wait, actually, J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of their orbital angular momentum (L_NN) and spin (S_NN). So J_NN can range from |L_NN - S_NN| to L_NN + S_NN in integer steps. But in the problem, the final NN state's term symbol would have a J value, but in the options given, the final NN state's angular momentum is part of their term. Wait, the question's options list the final NN states as, for example, \"7D1 + p\" \u2014 wait, maybe I need to parse the options correctly.\n\nLooking at the options, each is of the form Initial -> Final + X, where the final is the NN state, and the particle X's angular momentum is denoted by the lowercase letter (like p for l=1, s for l=0, d for l=2, etc.). The term symbol for the final NN state is given, e.g., 7D1 would mean (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3, L=D (so L=2), and J=1. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So in the first option, 7D1: S=3 (since 2*3+1=7), L=2 (D is l=2?), and J=1. Wait, but that would mean that the NN has S=3, L=2, so their total angular momentum J can be |L - S| to L + S. So 2-3= -1 \u2192 but absolute value 1, so J can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So J=1 is possible. \n\nBut the key here is for each option, we need to check whether the transition is allowed based on the given conditions.\n\nSo, for each option, we need to:\n\n1. Determine the final NN state's T, S, L, J.\n\n2. Check the condition T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2 =0 (since T=0 given).\n\n3. Check parity conservation: The total parity after emission must equal initial parity (which is +1).\n\nThe parity after emission is [Parity(NN_final) * Parity(X) * (-1)^l] = ?\n\nWait, let me re-derive the parity condition properly.\n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN system and the emitted particle X. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity P_X = -1, and it is emitted in an orbital angular momentum l (denoted by the lowercase letter in the option). The parity contribution from the orbital part of X is (-1)^l. So the total parity of the emitted particle's state is P_X * (-1)^l. \n\nTherefore, the total parity after emission is:\n\nP_NN_final * [P_X * (-1)^l] = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ] \n\nBecause P_X is -1, so that term is (-1)^l * (-1). \n\nSo total final parity must equal initial parity (1):\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l +1} = +1\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nThus:\n\nL_NN + l +1 is even \u2192 L_NN + l must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nSecond condition: T(NN) =0 requires that S_NN + L_NN must be odd (since T = S + L +1 mod2 =0 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2).\n\nThird condition: angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum of the initial system (0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X). \n\nThe total angular momentum of the final system is the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l. The total must be zero. So the possible way this can happen is if J_NN and l can combine to give a total of 0. \n\nThe total angular momentum when combining two angular momenta J1 and J2 can have values from |J1 - J2| to J1 + J2 in integer steps. To get a total of 0, the only possibility is that J1 = J2 and they are aligned oppositely. So J_NN must equal l, and the combination can form a total J=0. Thus, J_NN must equal l, and the total can be zero. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J and the X's l. Since the initial is zero, the final must also have total angular momentum zero. Therefore, J_NN and l must add to zero. The only way that can happen is if J_NN = l, and their vector sum is zero. So J_NN must equal l, and the total angular momentum is zero. \n\nWait, but angular momentum is a vector, so the total would be the vector sum. So the magnitudes must be equal (J_NN = l) and directions opposite. So yes, J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we need to check:\n\n1. For the final NN state:\n\n   a. Check T(NN)=0 requires S_NN + L_NN is odd. \n\n   b. The term symbol gives S_NN from (2S+1), L_NN from the letter (S=0, P=1, D=2, etc.), and J_NN from the subscript.\n\n2. Check that J_NN equals l (the l of the emitted particle's partial wave, which is given by the lowercase letter in the option).\n\n3. Check that L_NN + l is odd (from parity condition).\n\nAdditionally, the parity must satisfy the above equation. Let me go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nFirst, the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term:\n\nTerm symbol: 7D1 \u2192 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3, L=D (so L=2), J=1.\n\nCheck condition 1a: S + L = 3 +2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So T=0 is okay here.\n\nNext, the emitted particle's angular momentum l is p, which is l=1 (since p corresponds to l=1).\n\nCheck condition 2: J_NN must equal l. Here J_NN is 1 (from the subscript), and l=1. So 1=1 \u2192 okay.\n\nCheck parity condition: L_NN (2) + l (1) =3, which is odd \u2192 L_NN + l is odd. So that satisfies the parity condition. So all conditions are met for option A. So this is allowed, so not the answer.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\n\nFinal NN state: 3S1. \n\nTerm symbol: 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=S (L=0), J=1.\n\nCheck condition 1a: S + L = 1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay.\n\nEmitting particle's l is p (l=1).\n\nCheck J_NN equals l? J_NN is 1, l=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l (1) =1 \u2192 odd. So okay. \n\nThus, B is allowed. Not the answer.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nFinal NN state: 3D3. \n\nTerm symbol: 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=D (2), J=3.\n\nCheck S + L: 1 +2 =3 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay.\n\nEmitting particle's l is f \u2192 l=3 (since f is l=3).\n\nCheck J_NN must equal l. J_NN is 3, l=3 \u2192 3=3 \u2192 okay.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l (3) =5 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay. \n\nSo all conditions are met. So C is allowed. Not the answer.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nFinal NN state: 3P0 \u2192 term symbol:\n\n3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=P (L=1), J=0.\n\nCheck S + L =1+1=2 \u2192 even. Wait! This is a problem. Because T(NN)=0 requires S + L must be odd. Here it's 2, which is even \u2192 violates the condition. \n\nWait, so this would immediately disqualify D. Let me confirm.\n\nWait the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 =0 must hold. So S + L +1 must be even \u2192 S + L must be odd. Here, S=1, L=1 \u2192 S + L =2, which is even. So 2 +1 =3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. Wait, let me compute T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 T = (1+1+1)=3 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2. But the problem states that the final NN has T(NN)=0. So this would mean that this option violates the given condition (since T is 1 mod2, but they require T=0). Therefore, this transition is forbidden. So option D is not permitted, so the answer is D?\n\nWait, but let's check all other conditions just in case.\n\nEven though the T condition is violated, maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait the condition given in the problem is \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0.\"\n\nSo for the final state, T(NN)=0. So S + L +1 must be even (because mod2 it's 0). So S+L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 (even), so S+L is even \u2192 T would be (even)+1 mod2 = 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem says that the final state has T=0, so this is impossible. Thus, this transition is forbidden. Therefore, D is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check the other conditions for D to see if any other reason might also disqualify or if there's an error here.\n\nThe emitted particle's l is s, which is l=0.\n\nCheck angular momentum condition: J_NN must equal l. The final NN's J is 0 (from the term symbol's subscript). The l is 0, so J_NN (0) = l (0) \u2192 okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1, since P is L=1) + l (0) =1+0=1, which is odd \u2192 parity condition is satisfied. \n\nBut the key violation is the T condition. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, but in this case, T would be 1, so this transition is not allowed. Thus D is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I parsed the term symbols correctly. For the 3P0 term: \n\nYes, 3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=P (1), J=0. So S=1, L=1. So S+L=2, which is even, so T would be (S+L +1)=3 mod2 \u2192 1. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, this is a conflict. Thus D is forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nSo the forbidden one is D. \n\nWait, but let me check if any other options also have issues. For example, in option C, the emitted particle is f (l=3). The J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol's J=3). So J_NN equals l (3), which is okay. \n\nThus the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. We need to figure out which partial wave transition isn't allowed based on the given conditions. The key points are the Pauli statistics condition, conservation of angular momentum, and parity.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol here is (2S+1)L_J, so S is the total spin of the NN system. Here, the term is 1S0, so the spin S must be 0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0). The orbital angular momentum L for S is 0, and the total angular momentum J is 0 as well (since the last number is J). So the initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0.\n\nThe final NN state has T(NN)=0. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, this means S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd. Therefore, the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the final NN must be odd. That's one condition.\n\nNow, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity conservation must hold. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1. The final state's parity must also equal the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X. Wait, actually, parity conservation says that the total parity before and after must be the same. The initial parity is that of the NN system. The final parity is the product of the NN final parity and the X's parity. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_X.\n\nTherefore, rearranged: Parity_final = Parity_initial / Parity_X. Since Parity_X is -1, and initial parity is +1, then Parity_final = (+1)/(-1) = -1. Wait, but the final parity of the NN system plus the emitted particle must be equal to the initial parity. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the total system. The total parity before (initial NN) must equal the total parity after (final NN plus emitted X). Since the X is a particle, its parity is part of the final state. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final(NN) * Parity(X) * (-1)^{L_X} ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that when particles are emitted, their parity is considered along with their orbital angular momentum. The parity of a particle in a partial wave with angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So the total parity of the final state (NN plus X) must equal the initial parity.\n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final parity is the product of the NN's parity, X's parity, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. Wait, actually, the parity of the emitted particle X in its partial wave is (-1)^{l}, where l is the angular momentum of X (since the question says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is denoted by the lowercase letter). So the total parity after emission is [Parity(NN_final)] * [Parity(X) * (-1)^l] must equal the initial parity.\n\nWait, perhaps breaking it down:\n\nThe initial system (NN) has parity P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final system is NN (with their own parity) plus X. The parity of the X's state includes its intrinsic parity and its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN. So the X's contribution to the parity is (-1)^l (from its orbital angular momentum) multiplied by its intrinsic parity (-1). The NN's final state has parity (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the total final parity is:\n\n[ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1)^{l} * (-1) ] = (-1)^{L_final + l +1}.\n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1.\n\nSo, (-1)^{L_final + l +1} = +1 \u2192 exponent must be even. So L_final + l +1 must be even \u2192 L_final + l must be odd.\n\nSo, L_final + l is odd. That's one equation.\n\nAdditionally, the NN final state must have T=0. From the given condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2 =0 mod2. So S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be odd.\n\nAlso, we need to consider conservation of angular momentum. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial =0. The final angular momentum comes from the NN's angular momentum (J_NN_final) plus the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (l, since it's the orbital angular momentum between X and NN?), but actually, in terms of the total system, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial J (0). But how exactly does that split?\n\nHmm, perhaps the angular momentum of the emitted particle is l (its orbital angular momentum), and the NN's angular momentum is J_NN = sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ...?), but maybe we need to consider that the total angular momentum J_initial (0) must be the sum of the NN's final angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l). But angular momentum addition is more complicated. The total J_final (for NN + X) must equal J_initial (0). So the vector sum of the NN's J and the X's l must give 0. Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum of the system (NN plus X) must be zero. So the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN = L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum l of the X (since it's emitted in an orbital state l) must combine to give total J=0. \n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the total angular momentum of the final state is the sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the X (l). But since they are in a compound system, their angular momenta must add up such that the total is zero. So J_NN + l must be able to form a total J=0. That requires that J_NN and l can combine to give 0. So the possible values are |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. The only way that can happen is if J_NN = l and they are aligned opposite. But since the total has to be exactly 0, the minimum possible total angular momentum when adding J_NN and l is |J_NN - l|. So to get total J=0, it must be that J_NN = l and the components are opposite. Alternatively, maybe the total J is zero, so the combination must have a possible J value of zero. For example, if J_NN and l are such that |J_NN - l| \u22640 \u2264 J_NN + l. Which implies that J_NN = l, and the total can be zero. So for instance, if J_NN = l, then the total can be 0, 2,... up to 2l. Wait, but the total must exactly equal zero. So the only way that the total angular momentum can be zero is if the two angular momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in terms of quantum numbers, the total angular momentum must be an integer or half-integer, but here all are integers because we're dealing with nucleons and orbital angular momenta (which are integers). So the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum l of the emitted particle, and their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN must equal l, and the total J is 0. So the possible J_NN and l must satisfy J_NN = l, and the combination can form a total of 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the vector sum, so the total J must be zero. So the sum of J_NN and l must have a possible value of zero. The possible total J values when adding two angular momenta J1 and J2 are |J1 - J2| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J1 + J2. To have J_total =0, the only possibility is J1 = J2, and the components are exactly opposite. So J_NN must equal l, and the total can be zero. Therefore, the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) must equal l (the l of the emitted particle). \n\nTherefore, J_NN = L_NN + S_NN must equal l. Wait, but J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN, which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ...). Wait, actually, J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, which is the combination of their orbital angular momentum (L_NN) and spin (S_NN). So J_NN can range from |L_NN - S_NN| to L_NN + S_NN in integer steps. But in the problem, the final NN state's term symbol would have a J value, but in the options given, the final NN state's angular momentum is part of their term. Wait, the question's options list the final NN states as, for example, \"7D1 + p\" \u2014 wait, maybe I need to parse the options correctly.\n\nLooking at the options, each is of the form Initial -> Final + X, where the final is the NN state, and the particle X's angular momentum is denoted by the lowercase letter (like p for l=1, s for l=0, d for l=2, etc.). The term symbol for the final NN state is given, e.g., 7D1 would mean (2S+1)=7 \u2192 S=3, L=D (so L=2), and J=1. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So in the first option, 7D1: S=3 (since 2*3+1=7), L=2 (D is l=2?), and J=1. Wait, but that would mean that the NN has S=3, L=2, so their total angular momentum J can be |L - S| to L + S. So 2-3= -1 \u2192 but absolute value 1, so J can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So J=1 is possible. \n\nBut the key here is for each option, we need to check whether the transition is allowed based on the given conditions.\n\nSo, for each option, we need to:\n\n1. Determine the final NN state's T, S, L, J.\n\n2. Check the condition T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2 =0 (since T=0 given).\n\n3. Check parity conservation: The total parity after emission must equal initial parity (which is +1).\n\nThe parity after emission is [Parity(NN_final) * Parity(X) * (-1)^l] = ?\n\nWait, let me re-derive the parity condition properly.\n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe final state consists of the NN system and the emitted particle X. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nThe emitted particle X has intrinsic parity P_X = -1, and it is emitted in an orbital angular momentum l (denoted by the lowercase letter in the option). The parity contribution from the orbital part of X is (-1)^l. So the total parity of the emitted particle's state is P_X * (-1)^l. \n\nTherefore, the total parity after emission is:\n\nP_NN_final * [P_X * (-1)^l] = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ] \n\nBecause P_X is -1, so that term is (-1)^l * (-1). \n\nSo total final parity must equal initial parity (1):\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l +1} = +1\n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l +1} = 1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nThus:\n\nL_NN + l +1 is even \u2192 L_NN + l must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nSecond condition: T(NN) =0 requires that S_NN + L_NN must be odd (since T = S + L +1 mod2 =0 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2).\n\nThird condition: angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum of the initial system (0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X). \n\nThe total angular momentum of the final system is the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l. The total must be zero. So the possible way this can happen is if J_NN and l can combine to give a total of 0. \n\nThe total angular momentum when combining two angular momenta J1 and J2 can have values from |J1 - J2| to J1 + J2 in integer steps. To get a total of 0, the only possibility is that J1 = J2 and they are aligned oppositely. So J_NN must equal l, and the combination can form a total J=0. Thus, J_NN must equal l, and the total can be zero. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J and the X's l. Since the initial is zero, the final must also have total angular momentum zero. Therefore, J_NN and l must add to zero. The only way that can happen is if J_NN = l, and their vector sum is zero. So J_NN must equal l, and the total angular momentum is zero. \n\nWait, but angular momentum is a vector, so the total would be the vector sum. So the magnitudes must be equal (J_NN = l) and directions opposite. So yes, J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we need to check:\n\n1. For the final NN state:\n\n   a. Check T(NN)=0 requires S_NN + L_NN is odd. \n\n   b. The term symbol gives S_NN from (2S+1), L_NN from the letter (S=0, P=1, D=2, etc.), and J_NN from the subscript.\n\n2. Check that J_NN equals l (the l of the emitted particle's partial wave, which is given by the lowercase letter in the option).\n\n3. Check that L_NN + l is odd (from parity condition).\n\nAdditionally, the parity must satisfy the above equation. Let me go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nFirst, the final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term:\n\nTerm symbol: 7D1 \u2192 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3, L=D (so L=2), J=1.\n\nCheck condition 1a: S + L = 3 +2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So T=0 is okay here.\n\nNext, the emitted particle's angular momentum l is p, which is l=1 (since p corresponds to l=1).\n\nCheck condition 2: J_NN must equal l. Here J_NN is 1 (from the subscript), and l=1. So 1=1 \u2192 okay.\n\nCheck parity condition: L_NN (2) + l (1) =3, which is odd \u2192 L_NN + l is odd. So that satisfies the parity condition. So all conditions are met for option A. So this is allowed, so not the answer.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p\n\nFinal NN state: 3S1. \n\nTerm symbol: 3S1 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=S (L=0), J=1.\n\nCheck condition 1a: S + L = 1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay.\n\nEmitting particle's l is p (l=1).\n\nCheck J_NN equals l? J_NN is 1, l=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l (1) =1 \u2192 odd. So okay. \n\nThus, B is allowed. Not the answer.\n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f\n\nFinal NN state: 3D3. \n\nTerm symbol: 3D3 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=D (2), J=3.\n\nCheck S + L: 1 +2 =3 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay.\n\nEmitting particle's l is f \u2192 l=3 (since f is l=3).\n\nCheck J_NN must equal l. J_NN is 3, l=3 \u2192 3=3 \u2192 okay.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l (3) =5 \u2192 odd \u2192 okay. \n\nSo all conditions are met. So C is allowed. Not the answer.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s\n\nFinal NN state: 3P0 \u2192 term symbol:\n\n3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=P (L=1), J=0.\n\nCheck S + L =1+1=2 \u2192 even. Wait! This is a problem. Because T(NN)=0 requires S + L must be odd. Here it's 2, which is even \u2192 violates the condition. \n\nWait, so this would immediately disqualify D. Let me confirm.\n\nWait the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 =0 must hold. So S + L +1 must be even \u2192 S + L must be odd. Here, S=1, L=1 \u2192 S + L =2, which is even. So 2 +1 =3 \u2192 mod2 is 1. Wait, let me compute T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 T = (1+1+1)=3 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2. But the problem states that the final NN has T(NN)=0. So this would mean that this option violates the given condition (since T is 1 mod2, but they require T=0). Therefore, this transition is forbidden. So option D is not permitted, so the answer is D?\n\nWait, but let's check all other conditions just in case.\n\nEven though the T condition is violated, maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait the condition given in the problem is \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0.\"\n\nSo for the final state, T(NN)=0. So S + L +1 must be even (because mod2 it's 0). So S+L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 (even), so S+L is even \u2192 T would be (even)+1 mod2 = 1 mod2 \u2192 T=1. But the problem says that the final state has T=0, so this is impossible. Thus, this transition is forbidden. Therefore, D is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check the other conditions for D to see if any other reason might also disqualify or if there's an error here.\n\nThe emitted particle's l is s, which is l=0.\n\nCheck angular momentum condition: J_NN must equal l. The final NN's J is 0 (from the term symbol's subscript). The l is 0, so J_NN (0) = l (0) \u2192 okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1, since P is L=1) + l (0) =1+0=1, which is odd \u2192 parity condition is satisfied. \n\nBut the key violation is the T condition. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, but in this case, T would be 1, so this transition is not allowed. Thus D is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I parsed the term symbols correctly. For the 3P0 term: \n\nYes, 3P0 \u2192 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1, L=P (1), J=0. So S=1, L=1. So S+L=2, which is even, so T would be (S+L +1)=3 mod2 \u2192 1. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, this is a conflict. Thus D is forbidden.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nSo the forbidden one is D. \n\nWait, but let me check if any other options also have issues. For example, in option C, the emitted particle is f (l=3). The J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol's J=3). So J_NN equals l (3), which is okay. \n\nThus the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave transition is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state with \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), \\( S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\). This requires \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) to be odd.\n2. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity after emission must equal the initial parity (+1).
