      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a quantum mechanical particle in a two-dimensional potential given by V(r, \u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8. The question is asking for the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials that can be separated into radial and angular parts, sometimes you can treat them as a combination of different oscillators or something. Wait, the potential here has terms with r squared and cos squared theta multiplied by r squared. Let me think. The potential is V(r, \u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8. So that can be factored as kr\u00b2/2 [1 + 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8]. But maybe instead of that, it's better to separate the variables.\n\nAlternatively, since the potential depends on r and \u03b8, perhaps we can rewrite it in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it's a harmonic oscillator in some transformed coordinates. Let's recall that in polar coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. So maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of x and y?\n\nLet me try that. The first term is (1/2)kr\u00b2, which is (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term is (3/2)kr\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8, which would be (3/2)k (x\u00b2) because cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Wait, but substituting that in, the second term would be (3/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*(x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) ) = (3/2)k x\u00b2. Oh, right! Because the cos\u00b2\u03b8 term when multiplied by r\u00b2 gives x\u00b2. So combining both terms, the total potential becomes (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2. Let me compute that:\n\nTotal V = (1/2 k)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2 k)x\u00b2 = (1/2 k x\u00b2 + 1/2 k y\u00b2) + (3/2 k x\u00b2) \n\nAdding the x terms: (1/2 + 3/2) k x\u00b2 = 2k x\u00b2. The y term is (1/2)k y\u00b2. So overall, V(x,y) = 2k x\u00b2 + (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nWait a second, so that's a harmonic oscillator in x and y directions but with different spring constants. The x direction has a spring constant of 4k (because the standard form is (1/2)k x\u00b2, but here it's 2k x\u00b2, so that's (1/2)*(4k)x\u00b2). Similarly, the y term is (1/2)k y\u00b2. \n\nSo the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + 1/2) hbar \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) hbar \u03c9_y. \n\nNow, let's find the angular frequencies \u03c9_x and \u03c9_y. The standard harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)k x\u00b2, so \u03c9 = sqrt(k/m). Here, in the x direction, the effective k is 4k (since 2k x\u00b2 = (1/2)(4k)x\u00b2), so \u03c9_x = sqrt( (4k)/m ). Similarly, the y direction has V = (1/2)k y\u00b2, so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels would be:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) hbar \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) hbar \u03c9_y \n\nPlugging in the \u03c9's:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) hbar sqrt(4k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) hbar sqrt(k/m)\n\nSimplify sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). So:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2)*2 hbar sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)* hbar sqrt(k/m)\n\nLet me factor out hbar sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = hbar sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 \n\nWait, 2*(n_x + 0.5) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y +0.5) is n_y +0.5. Adding those together gives 2n_x + n_y + 1 +0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5. So the total is:\n\nE = hbar sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nLooking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \u210f sqrt(k/m). That's exactly what I have here. Let me check the other options again to be sure.\n\nOption A has (2n_x +3n_y +1/2). No, that doesn't match. Option B: (n_x +3n_y +3/2). No. Option D has 3n_x +2n_y. Hmm. So option C must be correct. \n\nWait but let me double-check my steps. The key was converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates, which I did by expanding the terms. Let me verify that step again. The original V(r,\u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8. The first term is indeed (1/2)k(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The second term: cos\u03b8 is x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 is x\u00b2/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Multiply that by r\u00b2 (which is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), so the second term is (3/2)k*(x\u00b2). So yes, that gives 3/2 k x\u00b2. Adding to the first term's x part (1/2 k x\u00b2), gives 2k x\u00b2. The y part is only from the first term, so 1/2 k y\u00b2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the x direction has a spring constant of 4k (since 2k x\u00b2 = (1/2)(4k)x\u00b2), leading to \u03c9_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). The y direction has k_y =k, so \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m). \n\nThe energy formula is correct. So when you add the terms, the coefficients for n_x and n_y are 2 and 1 respectively, and the constants add up to 2*(1/2) + 1*(1/2) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, so 3/2. So the total expression is exactly option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n",

Hmm, let me think. The potential looks like it's a combination of terms involving r\u00b2 and r\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8. Wait, in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance and \u03b8 is the angle. The potential is V(r,\u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 [1 + 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8]. \n\nSince the problem is in two dimensions, maybe I can separate the variables into radial and angular parts? But the potential depends on both r and \u03b8 because of the cos\u00b2\u03b8 term. That complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates to see if it becomes a harmonic oscillator?\n\nLet me recall that in polar coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8 and y = r sin\u03b8. So, cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2 / r\u00b2. Then, substituting into the potential:\n\nV(r,\u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2*(x\u00b2 / r\u00b2) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)k x\u00b2.\n\nWait, that simplifies to V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2.

The potential is V(r,\u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 [1 + 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8]. \n\nSince the problem is in two dimensions, maybe I can separate the variables into radial and angular parts? But the potential depends on both r and \u03b8 because of the cos\u00b2\u03b8 term. That complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates to see if it becomes a harmonic oscillator?\n\nLet me recall that in polar coordinates, x = r cos\u03b8 and y = r sin\u03b8. So, cos\u03b8 = x/r, so cos\u00b2\u03b8 = x\u00b2 / r\u00b2. Then, substituting into the potential:\n\nV(r,\u03b8) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)kr\u00b2*(x\u00b2 / r\u00b2) = (1/2)kr\u00b2 + (3/2)k x\u00b2.\n\nWait, that simplifies to V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3/2)k x\u00b2. Combining terms, that would be (1/2)k y\u00b2 + ( (1/2 + 3/2)k )x\u00b2 = (1/2)k y\u00b2 + 2k x\u00b2. \n\nOh, so in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = (2k)x\u00b2 + ( (k)/2 ) y\u00b2. That's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator but with different spring constants along the x and y directions. \n\nSo, the potential is V = (1/2) m \u03c9_x\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (1/2) m \u03c9_y\u00b2 y\u00b2, where \u03c9_x and \u03c9_y are the angular frequencies. Comparing, for the x-component, the coefficient is 2k, so 1/2 m \u03c9_x\u00b2 = 2k \u21d2 \u03c9_x\u00b2 = 4k/m \u21d2 \u03c9_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). \n\nSimilarly, the y-component has coefficient (k/2). So 1/2 m \u03c9_y\u00b2 = (k/2) \u21d2 \u03c9_y\u00b2 = k/m \u21d2 \u03c9_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels of a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions are given by:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_x + (n_y + 1/2) \u210f \u03c9_y.\n\nSubstituting the \u03c9's:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) \u210f * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) \u210f * sqrt(k/m).\n\nFactor out \u210f sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = \u210f sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5\n\nSo E = \u210f sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \u210f sqrt(k/m). That matches. Let me check the other options again to be sure. \n\nOption A has 2n_x + 3n_y, but the coefficients for n_x here are 2, and n_y is 1. So A's coefficients are wrong. Option B has n_x + 3n_y, which isn't right. D has 3n_x +2n_y, also incorrect. So the correct answer must be C.\n\n\nThe potential given in polar coordinates can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by substituting \\( \\cos^2\\theta = (x/r)^2 \\). This results in \\( V(x,y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 \\), representing a 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along the x and y axes. The angular frequencies are \\( \\omega_x = 2\\sqrt{k/m} \\) and \\( \\omega_y = \\sqrt{k/m} \\). The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are \\( E = \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_x + \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_y \\). Substituting the frequencies and simplifying gives \\( E = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\), matching option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
