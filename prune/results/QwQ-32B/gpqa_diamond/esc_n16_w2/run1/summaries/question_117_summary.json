      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomers are a type of stereoisomer, right? So they must have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. The key here is that optical isomers are enantiomers, which usually form when there's a chiral center or a molecule that's not superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. That sounds complicated. Let me break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' have dicarboxylate groups which are esterified with methyl. Wait, so maybe there's a possibility of a chiral center here? Not sure. Let me think. If the nitro groups are on the same side or opposite sides, that could be a geometric isomerism, but geometric isomers (like cis-trans) are a type of stereoisomer but not optical unless they have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has a chiral axis? Hmm, biphenyls can have atropisomerism if they can't rotate freely. The presence of bulky substituents might prevent free rotation. The nitro groups are big, so maybe the biphenyl can't rotate, leading to atropisomers which are a type of stereoisomer. But atropisomers can exhibit optical activity. So maybe this compound has optical isomers? Not entirely sure, but possible.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid ester. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-CH3. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl (since it's part of the carboxylic acid or ester), and the adjacent groups. Wait, let me draw it out. The structure is actually: the carboxylic acid is at the end, so the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The middle carbon (the second carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a CH3, a COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified with methyl alcohol, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has four different groups attached: a CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no. Let me count again. The chain is three carbons: first carbon is CH3, second is CH(OH), third is COOCH3. Wait, the second carbon (the CH(OH) group) is connected to the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (COOCH3), the hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen? No, wait, the second carbon would have two single bonds. Let's see: the second carbon (C2) has bonds to C1 (CH3), C3 (the COOCH3 group's carbon), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That makes it a chiral center! So this compound has a chiral center, so it can have enantiomers. So optical isomerism here. So option 2 is a yes.\n\n3. Benzophenone. That's a benzene ring attached to a ketone group (CO) on another benzene. The structure is (Ph)2CO. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (since it's a ketone). Wait, the central carbon would have two phenyl groups and the oxygen as part of the carbonyl. Wait, the carbonyl group is C=O, so the central carbon (the one between the two phenyl groups) is connected to two phenyl groups, one double-bonded O, and another single bond? Wait, no. Let me think again. Benzophenone is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon (the one in the carbonyl) has double bond to O and single bonds to the two phenyl groups. But the central carbon is sp2 hybridized, so it's planar. Since all the groups around that carbon are the same (two phenyls and the O), there's no chiral center here. The molecule is symmetrical. So no optical isomerism here. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a maleic acid isomer, the trans form. So fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. When esterified with methyl alcohol, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on the trans positions. Since it's trans, there's no chiral center here because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but wait: the double bond in fumaric acid is between the two carboxylic acid groups. The structure would be O2C-CH2-CH2-CO2CH3? No, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (if one ester, but dimethyl would have both). So dimethyl fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxyl groups are esterified. So both ends are OCH3. So the structure is O2CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is trans, so the two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is (O2C-CH2-CH2-COO-) but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, but the actual structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. So when both are methyl esters, it would be O2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the molecule is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two carboxylic acids are on either end. So both would be esterified. So the structure is (O2CH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, that can't be right. Let me get this straight. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both ends are methyl esters, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxyl groups become esters. So the structure would be O2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, the correct structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2? Wait, perhaps I should think of each carboxylic acid group as being replaced by OCH3. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be esterified. So the correct structure is (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3) \u2014 no, that would not have a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. The formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When both are esterified with methanol, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So that's dimethyl fumarate. Now, in this structure, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two methyl ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. Since the double bond is trans, the molecule is symmetrical. The molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Therefore, it cannot have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait: could there be a chiral center here? No, because all the substituents around any carbon are symmetric. The carbons in the double bond are each connected to two CH2 groups (but in this case, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are connected to the ester groups). Wait, the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have two substituents. The second carbon (in the chain) is connected to a carbonyl (from the ester on carbon 1) and the double bond, and the third carbon similarly. Wait, perhaps I should look at each carbon's substituents. Let's see:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, actually, each carboxylic group is esterified, so the ends are OMe. So the full structure would be OMe-OOC-CH=CH-COO-OMe? Wait no, that's not right. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would be (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or a lack of symmetry that would allow for optical isomerism. Since fumarate is the trans isomer, it's symmetrical. The molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, so it doesn't have optical activity. However, if it were the cis isomer (maleic acid), then the molecule would have a chiral center? Wait, maleic acid (cis) when esterified would be the cis form. In the cis case, the two ester groups are on the same side, leading to a molecule without a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Wait, the cis form of the diester would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond. Let me think of the structure. For maleic acid (cis), the structure is HOOC-CH-CH-COOH (with the hydrogens on the same side). When esterified, it becomes OMe-OOC-CH-CH-COO-OMe (cis). In this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, so it would be a meso compound if there are chiral centers, or maybe not. Wait, actually, the double bond in maleic acid (cis) would mean that the two ester groups are on the same side. But the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry if both esters are the same. Wait, if the groups on both ends are the same (both methyl esters), then the cis form would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Let me see: imagine the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon (1) has an OMe group attached to a carbonyl (the ester), and the fourth carbon (4) has another OMe similarly. If the double bond is cis, then the two OMe groups are on the same side. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond, so it would be meso. Wait, but in that case, it would not have optical activity because the enantiomers would be superimposable. Wait, no, if the molecule is meso, it's not chiral. So maybe even the cis form of dimethyl maleate is not optically active. Wait, but I'm getting confused between maleic and fumaric. The question here is about dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Since it's trans, it's symmetrical, so no optical activity. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) doesn't show optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but wait another thought: maybe the question is considering geometric isomerism (cis-trans) as contributing to stereoisomerism, but optical activity requires chiral centers or a lack of symmetry. So the fumarate (trans) is a geometric isomer but not chiral, so no optical activity. The maleate (cis) would be the same as trans in terms of symmetry if the groups are the same on both ends. So the dimethyl fumarate (trans) can't rotate plane-polarized light. So option 4 doesn't have optical isomers.\n\nSo going back to the options:\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2?\n\nWait, let's check option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to parse that. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so the two benzene rings are connected at the first carbon of each. The nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. The 2 and 2' positions (on each ring?) have the dicarboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. So each benzene ring's 2-position has a carboxyl group, which is then esterified with methyl. So the structure would have two benzene rings connected at the 1-1' positions. Each benzene has a nitro group at 6, and a methyl ester at 2. Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.\n\nThe biphenyl system: when the two rings are connected, if the substituents are placed in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it could have optical activity. Let me think: the nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. The 6 position on each ring is across from the connecting carbon. So if the nitro groups are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, the numbering in biphenyls can be a bit tricky. Let me assume that the 1-1' connection is the central axis. The 6 and 6' positions would be on the same side (if the rings are planar). Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations (like eclipsed or staggered), but if they can't rotate due to bulky groups, they can form atropisomers. Here, the nitro groups are quite bulky. The nitro groups on the 6 positions would be on the outer ends of each ring. The carboxylate groups (as esters) are on the 2 positions, which are adjacent to the connecting carbon (position 1). So the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). \n\nIf the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. Let's see: the biphenyl is connected at 1-1', so if the substituents are placed symmetrically, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. If the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But if they are on opposite sides, maybe not. Wait, but the numbering in biphenyls: the 6 position on each ring would be across from the connecting carbon. So if the nitro groups are on the same side (like both above the plane of the biphenyl), then the molecule is symmetrical. However, if they are on opposite sides (one above and one below), then the molecule would not be symmetrical. But the way the compound is named might indicate their positions. The name is 6,6'-dinitro. The prime denotes the second ring, so 6' is the sixth position on the second ring. The numbering for biphenyls is such that the first ring is numbered first, then the second. So the nitro groups are on the sixth positions of each ring. If the rings are in a conformation where the substituents are in the same direction, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the rings are twisted such that the substituents are in different positions, but since the nitro groups are bulky, maybe the molecule can't rotate freely, leading to atropisomerism. \n\nAtropisomers are a type of diastereomer resulting from restricted rotation around a single bond. In this case, the biphenyl can have two conformations (like the nitro groups on the same side or opposite sides) that can't interconvert due to steric hindrance. These would be different stereoisomers. If these conformations are not superimposable, they can exhibit optical activity. \n\nSo the compound could have atropisomers, which are stereoisomers, and if they are enantiomers, then they would have optical activity. Wait, but atropisomers are typically not chiral unless the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are in a way that the molecule as a whole is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it would be chiral. \n\nFor example, suppose the nitro groups are arranged in a way that when you look at the molecule from one side, the nitro on the first ring is up, and the second ring's nitro is also up. But if rotated 180 degrees, maybe they are mirrored. Alternatively, if one is up and the other down, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. \n\nBut how does the naming help here? The compound is named 6,6'-dinitro. The prime indicates the second ring's position. The positions 6 and 6' would be on the same side if the biphenyl is in a certain conformation. However, the exact spatial arrangement might not be indicated by the name. The key is whether the molecule has a chiral axis or not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, the dicarboxylate groups are esterified with methyl, so each of those carbons (the 2-positions on each benzene ring) have a carbonyl group (since it's a carboxylate ester). The carboxylate ester would have an OR group (methyl here). The carbon in the ester (the one from the carboxylic acid) is connected to O, O, and two other groups. Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-Ph (maybe?), so the carbon in the carboxylate would have two oxygens, a methyl group, and the benzene ring. That carbon is sp2 hybridized, so not a chiral center. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the chiral center is not here. Then maybe the molecule has a chiral axis (the biphenyl axis). If the molecule can't rotate freely, then different conformations (atropisomers) can be chiral. For instance, if the two nitro groups are arranged such that when viewed along the biphenyl axis, their positions make the molecule non-symmetrical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me consider: if both nitro groups are on the same side (say, both above the plane of the biphenyl), then the molecule would have a mirror plane through the biphenyl axis, making it symmetrical. However, if they are on opposite sides, maybe there's no plane. Wait, but the nitro groups are on the 6 positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: each ring is connected at position 1. Position 6 on each ring is three carbons away from the connection. So, in a planar arrangement, the nitro groups would be on opposite sides of the biphenyl plane? Or the same? \n\nAlternatively, the 6th position on each ring is on the same side when the rings are in a certain conformation. For example, if the rings are in a staggered conformation where the substituents are arranged symmetrically. But this is getting too vague without a diagram. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this compound does not have a chiral center or a chiral axis, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of examples. For instance, binaphthol (a biphenyl with two hydroxyl groups) can have atropisomers if the rings can't rotate, leading to chiral molecules. So if this compound has bulky groups preventing rotation, then the two possible conformations (like nitro groups on the same or opposite sides) could be chiral. \n\nAssuming that the nitro groups are large enough to restrict rotation, then the molecule could have two atropisomers that are enantiomers. If so, then option 1 would show optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro groups are on the same side, making it symmetric. But the question is about whether the compound can have optical isomers. Since the compound's structure could have different conformations that can't interconvert and are non-superimposable mirror images, then yes. So option 1 is a candidate. \n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nOption 1: possibly yes (if atropisomers exist and are chiral)\n\nOption 2: yes (has a chiral center)\n\nOption 3: no\n\nOption4: no\n\nSo the answer would be 1 and 2, which is option D (1 and 2), but wait the options are A) 1,2,4; D)1 and2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nWait the options given are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nSo according to my analysis, the correct ones are 1 and 2, so D. But let me double-check option 1 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound doesn't have a chiral center or axis. Let me think of another angle. The dicarboxylate groups are esterified, so the structure would have two methyl groups attached to the carboxyl groups on each benzene. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: the two rings connected at 1-1', each with a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. \n\nIf the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't have optical activity. For example, if the two rings are arranged such that substituents mirror each other. But if the nitro groups are placed in a way that breaks symmetry. Wait, the positions 6 on each ring would be on opposite sides relative to the connecting axis? Or same? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomerism. Maybe I was overcomplicating with the atropisomer idea. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no. Let me think of the structure: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The 2 and 6 positions on a benzene ring are opposite each other (since 1-2-3-4-5-6 are positions, so 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is three positions away, opposite). So each ring has a substituent at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). If the rings are in a planar conformation, then the substituents would be arranged symmetrically. For example, the nitro on one ring's 6 would be in the same direction as the other ring's nitro, but since they are on different rings connected at 1-1', maybe the overall molecule is symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, the two rings are in a eclipsed conformation, making the molecule symmetric. Since the nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are across from the connecting carbon, they would be on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the biphenyl axis. Hence, it is not chiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nIf that's the case, then the first compound doesn't show optical isomerism. So then only option 2 would be correct. But that would leave the answer as D (1 and 2) only if 1 does have it. But if 1 doesn't, then the correct answer would be D is incorrect. Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nIf the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, but the arrangement is such that when viewed along the axis connecting the two rings, the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side but the ester groups are also arranged symmetrically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that the biphenyl's substituents are placed in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyl doesn't have a central chiral carbon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center in the ester group? Let me see: the carboxylate ester is connected to the benzene ring at the 2-position. The ester's carbon is connected to O (from the carbonyl), O (from the OR group, methyl here), the benzene ring, and another oxygen? Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the central carbon here would be the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. The ester group's carbon (the one from the original carboxylic acid) is connected to the benzene, an oxygen (from the carbonyl), and two oxygen atoms (from the ester group)? No, the structure is: \n\nThe carboxylate (from the 2-position of the benzene) becomes an ester when reacted with methanol. So the structure would be:\n\nBenzene ring (with nitro at 6) connected to -O-CO-O-CH3 at position 2. Wait, no. The 2-position of the benzene is attached to a -COOCH3 group (the ester). The carbon in the carboxylate ester is the one attached to the benzene. That carbon is connected to the benzene ring, an oxygen (as part of the carbonyl), and another oxygen (the methoxy group). Wait, that's three bonds. The fourth bond must be another oxygen? No, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so the carbon from the original carboxylic acid (the one attached to the benzene) is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. \n\nThe carboxylic acid group at position 2 is -COOH. When it becomes an ester with methanol, it becomes -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 group is the carbonyl carbon (which is double-bonded to O), and the other O is part of the ester group (O connected to CH3). Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-C(=O)-R', so the carbonyl is between the O and the R' (CH3 here). The carbon attached to the benzene is the one in the R position. Let's say the benzene ring has a -COOCH3 group at position 2. The carbon in the COOCH3 is the one attached to the benzene. That carbon is connected to the benzene, an oxygen (double-bonded to the carbonyl), and another oxygen (which is part of the O-CH3 group). So that carbon has three bonds: benzene, O (double), and the O-CH3. Wait, that's three bonds, but carbon needs four. Oh right, the carbonyl is a double bond. The actual structure is: \n\nThe benzene ring has a -O-CO-O-CH3 group? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps I need to correct this. The carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 2 becomes an ester when reacted with methanol. The reaction forms a -COOCH3 group. The structure is: the benzene's carbon at position 2 is connected to -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 is the one from the original carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, the carboxylic acid is -COOH. The ester would be -COOCH3. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the benzene, an O (from the ester), and another O (the double bond). Wait, that's three bonds again. Hmm, perhaps the actual structure is that the benzene's carbon is connected to an oxygen, which is double-bonded to another carbon, which is connected to OCH3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the carbon from the original COOH group is the one connected to the benzene. That carbon has four bonds: benzene, O (double bond to the carbonyl), O (connected to CH3), and a single bond to the CH2 or something? No. Let me think again. The formula for the ester group: the benzene is attached to a -COOR group, where R is CH3. The carbonyl is between the carbon and the oxygen. The carbon is connected to the benzene, the carbonyl O, and the O-CH3 group. Wait, that's three bonds. Oh, the carbon must have another bond. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The carbon in the COOR group is the one connected to the benzene. It has four bonds: \n\n- Single bond to the benzene ring.\n\n- Double bond to an oxygen (the carbonyl O).\n\n- Single bond to another oxygen (which is connected to the CH3).\n\nWait, that's three bonds. That can't be. So there must be another bond. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think: the ester group is R-O-CO-R', where R is the benzene (via the COO-) and R' is CH3. The central carbon is the one in the COOCH3 part. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is between the O and the R' (CH3). The carbonyl carbon is connected to O (double bond), R' (CH3), and another O (which is connected to the benzene via an ether linkage? No. Wait, the structure should be:\n\nThe benzene ring's carbon at position 2 is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to the CH3. So the structure is:\n\nBenzene-C2-O-C(=O)-OCH3.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So the carbon from the benzene (position 2) is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon (the central one) has four bonds: double to O, single to OCH3, single to the previous O (from the benzene), and... wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to three groups: the double-bond O, the OCH3 group, and the O from the benzene. Wait that's three bonds. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the structure is actually:\n\nThe benzene ring has a -O-CO-O-CH3 group? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe original carboxylic acid is -COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH becomes -OCH3. So the group becomes -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 group is the one from the original COOH. That carbon is connected to the benzene, the carbonyl O (double bond), and the OCH3 group. But that's three bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a hydrogen? No, in esters, the carbonyl is between the O and the R group. The structure of the ester is:\n\nThe benzene ring is attached to a carbon which is double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to another oxygen which is connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond) has four bonds: double to O, single to O-CH3, single to the benzene ring via an oxygen bridge? Wait, no. Let me see a correct structure: \n\nThe benzene ring at position 2 has an ester group: -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the structure is:\n\nBenzene's C2 is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon (C). The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to another oxygen connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: double bond to one O, single to another O (which is connected to CH3), and single to the O from the benzene. Wait, that's three bonds again. I'm confused. Maybe the correct structure has the benzene connected via an ether linkage? Like benzene-O-CO-O-CH3? That would make sense. In that case, the oxygen from the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to OCH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: O (double), O (single to CH3), and two single bonds to the oxygen from the benzene? No, that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is: \n\nThe benzene ring has a group: -O-CO-O-CH3. So the first oxygen is connected to the benzene's carbon (position 2). Then the oxygen is connected to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). The carbonyl carbon is also connected to another oxygen which is connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: double bond to O, single bond to the first O (connected to benzene), single bond to the second O (connected to CH3), and what's the fourth bond? Oh, wait, the carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The second oxygen (connected to CH3) is part of an ether linkage. Wait, maybe the structure is actually:\n\nThe benzene is connected via an ester group: -COOCH3. The carbonyl carbon (the one in the COOCH3) is connected to the benzene via a single bond, the double bond to O, and the single bond to OCH3. That only accounts for three bonds. I'm missing something here. Maybe the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon via an oxygen? Like an ether? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe benzene ring has a -COOCH3 group. The carbon in the COOCH3 is the carbonyl carbon. It is double-bonded to an oxygen, and has two single bonds: one to the benzene's carbon (position 2) and one to the OCH3 group. That's three bonds again. This is perplexing. \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating and should accept that the ester group has a central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) which is sp2 hybridized and thus not a chiral center. Therefore, the first compound (option 1) doesn't have a chiral center. So the only chiral center is in option 2. \n\nIn that case, the correct answer would be option D (1 and 2) only if option 1 has optical isomerism, but if it doesn't, then the correct answer would be option D is wrong and the correct is D (1 and 2) only if 1 does have it. \n\nWait, the question asks which show optical isomerism. If option 1 doesn't have a chiral center or a chiral axis, then it won't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the biphenyl in option 1 has a chiral axis. Let me think: biphenyls can have atropisomerism when rotation is restricted. The presence of two nitro groups on each ring's 6 position (which are bulky) might restrict rotation around the central C-C bond. This would allow two different conformations: one where the nitro groups are on the same side and one where they are on opposite sides. These conformations are enantiomers if they are mirror images. \n\nFor example, imagine the biphenyl is twisted so that the nitro groups are in different orientations. If the molecule can't rotate freely, then these two forms are different stereoisomers (atropisomers). If they are non-superimposable mirror images, they are enantiomers and thus optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, the first compound would have optical isomerism. Hence, options 1 and 2 are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D (1 and 2).\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or restricted rotation leading to chiral atropisomers:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   The biphenyl structure has nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The bulky nitro groups likely restrict rotation around the central C-C bond, creating atropisomers. These atropisomers can be non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, **this compound shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   The structure is CH\u2083-CHOH-COOCH\u2083. The central carbon (second carbon) has four different substituents (CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H), forming a **chiral center**. This results in enantiomers, so **this compound shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**:  \n   The structure is (Ph)\u2082CO. The central carbon is sp\u00b2 hybridized with two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, making it symmetrical. No chiral center or restricted rotation exists, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomers are a type of stereoisomer, right? So they must have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. The key here is that optical isomers are enantiomers, which usually form when there's a chiral center or a molecule that's not superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. That sounds complicated. Let me break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' have dicarboxylate groups which are esterified with methyl. Wait, so maybe there's a possibility of a chiral center here? Not sure. Let me think. If the nitro groups are on the same side or opposite sides, that could be a geometric isomerism, but geometric isomers (like cis-trans) are a type of stereoisomer but not optical unless they have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has a chiral axis? Hmm, biphenyls can have atropisomerism if they can't rotate freely. The presence of bulky substituents might prevent free rotation. The nitro groups are big, so maybe the biphenyl can't rotate, leading to atropisomers which are a type of stereoisomer. But atropisomers can exhibit optical activity. So maybe this compound has optical isomers? Not entirely sure, but possible.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid ester. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-CH3. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a carbonyl (since it's part of the carboxylic acid or ester), and the adjacent groups. Wait, let me draw it out. The structure is actually: the carboxylic acid is at the end, so the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The middle carbon (the second carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a CH3, a COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified with methyl alcohol, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has four different groups attached: a CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no. Let me count again. The chain is three carbons: first carbon is CH3, second is CH(OH), third is COOCH3. Wait, the second carbon (the CH(OH) group) is connected to the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (COOCH3), the hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen? No, wait, the second carbon would have two single bonds. Let's see: the second carbon (C2) has bonds to C1 (CH3), C3 (the COOCH3 group's carbon), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That makes it a chiral center! So this compound has a chiral center, so it can have enantiomers. So optical isomerism here. So option 2 is a yes.\n\n3. Benzophenone. That's a benzene ring attached to a ketone group (CO) on another benzene. The structure is (Ph)2CO. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (since it's a ketone). Wait, the central carbon would have two phenyl groups and the oxygen as part of the carbonyl. Wait, the carbonyl group is C=O, so the central carbon (the one between the two phenyl groups) is connected to two phenyl groups, one double-bonded O, and another single bond? Wait, no. Let me think again. Benzophenone is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon (the one in the carbonyl) has double bond to O and single bonds to the two phenyl groups. But the central carbon is sp2 hybridized, so it's planar. Since all the groups around that carbon are the same (two phenyls and the O), there's no chiral center here. The molecule is symmetrical. So no optical isomerism here. So option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a maleic acid isomer, the trans form. So fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. When esterified with methyl alcohol, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on the trans positions. Since it's trans, there's no chiral center here because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but wait: the double bond in fumaric acid is between the two carboxylic acid groups. The structure would be O2C-CH2-CH2-CO2CH3? No, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (if one ester, but dimethyl would have both). So dimethyl fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxyl groups are esterified. So both ends are OCH3. So the structure is O2CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is trans, so the two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is (O2C-CH2-CH2-COO-) but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, but the actual structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. So when both are methyl esters, it would be O2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the molecule is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two carboxylic acids are on either end. So both would be esterified. So the structure is (O2CH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, that can't be right. Let me get this straight. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both ends are methyl esters, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxyl groups become esters. So the structure would be O2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, the correct structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2? Wait, perhaps I should think of each carboxylic acid group as being replaced by OCH3. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be esterified. So the correct structure is (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3) \u2014 no, that would not have a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. The formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When both are esterified with methanol, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So that's dimethyl fumarate. Now, in this structure, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two methyl ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. Since the double bond is trans, the molecule is symmetrical. The molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Therefore, it cannot have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait: could there be a chiral center here? No, because all the substituents around any carbon are symmetric. The carbons in the double bond are each connected to two CH2 groups (but in this case, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are connected to the ester groups). Wait, the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have two substituents. The second carbon (in the chain) is connected to a carbonyl (from the ester on carbon 1) and the double bond, and the third carbon similarly. Wait, perhaps I should look at each carbon's substituents. Let's see:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, actually, each carboxylic group is esterified, so the ends are OMe. So the full structure would be OMe-OOC-CH=CH-COO-OMe? Wait no, that's not right. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would be (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or a lack of symmetry that would allow for optical isomerism. Since fumarate is the trans isomer, it's symmetrical. The molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, so it doesn't have optical activity. However, if it were the cis isomer (maleic acid), then the molecule would have a chiral center? Wait, maleic acid (cis) when esterified would be the cis form. In the cis case, the two ester groups are on the same side, leading to a molecule without a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Wait, the cis form of the diester would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond. Let me think of the structure. For maleic acid (cis), the structure is HOOC-CH-CH-COOH (with the hydrogens on the same side). When esterified, it becomes OMe-OOC-CH-CH-COO-OMe (cis). In this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, so it would be a meso compound if there are chiral centers, or maybe not. Wait, actually, the double bond in maleic acid (cis) would mean that the two ester groups are on the same side. But the molecule as a whole would have a plane of symmetry if both esters are the same. Wait, if the groups on both ends are the same (both methyl esters), then the cis form would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Let me see: imagine the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon (1) has an OMe group attached to a carbonyl (the ester), and the fourth carbon (4) has another OMe similarly. If the double bond is cis, then the two OMe groups are on the same side. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond, so it would be meso. Wait, but in that case, it would not have optical activity because the enantiomers would be superimposable. Wait, no, if the molecule is meso, it's not chiral. So maybe even the cis form of dimethyl maleate is not optically active. Wait, but I'm getting confused between maleic and fumaric. The question here is about dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Since it's trans, it's symmetrical, so no optical activity. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) doesn't show optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but wait another thought: maybe the question is considering geometric isomerism (cis-trans) as contributing to stereoisomerism, but optical activity requires chiral centers or a lack of symmetry. So the fumarate (trans) is a geometric isomer but not chiral, so no optical activity. The maleate (cis) would be the same as trans in terms of symmetry if the groups are the same on both ends. So the dimethyl fumarate (trans) can't rotate plane-polarized light. So option 4 doesn't have optical isomers.\n\nSo going back to the options:\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2?\n\nWait, let's check option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to parse that. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so the two benzene rings are connected at the first carbon of each. The nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. The 2 and 2' positions (on each ring?) have the dicarboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. So each benzene ring's 2-position has a carboxyl group, which is then esterified with methyl. So the structure would have two benzene rings connected at the 1-1' positions. Each benzene has a nitro group at 6, and a methyl ester at 2. Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.\n\nThe biphenyl system: when the two rings are connected, if the substituents are placed in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it could have optical activity. Let me think: the nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. The 6 position on each ring is across from the connecting carbon. So if the nitro groups are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, the numbering in biphenyls can be a bit tricky. Let me assume that the 1-1' connection is the central axis. The 6 and 6' positions would be on the same side (if the rings are planar). Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations (like eclipsed or staggered), but if they can't rotate due to bulky groups, they can form atropisomers. Here, the nitro groups are quite bulky. The nitro groups on the 6 positions would be on the outer ends of each ring. The carboxylate groups (as esters) are on the 2 positions, which are adjacent to the connecting carbon (position 1). So the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). \n\nIf the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. Let's see: the biphenyl is connected at 1-1', so if the substituents are placed symmetrically, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. If the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane, then the molecule might be symmetrical. But if they are on opposite sides, maybe not. Wait, but the numbering in biphenyls: the 6 position on each ring would be across from the connecting carbon. So if the nitro groups are on the same side (like both above the plane of the biphenyl), then the molecule is symmetrical. However, if they are on opposite sides (one above and one below), then the molecule would not be symmetrical. But the way the compound is named might indicate their positions. The name is 6,6'-dinitro. The prime denotes the second ring, so 6' is the sixth position on the second ring. The numbering for biphenyls is such that the first ring is numbered first, then the second. So the nitro groups are on the sixth positions of each ring. If the rings are in a conformation where the substituents are in the same direction, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the rings are twisted such that the substituents are in different positions, but since the nitro groups are bulky, maybe the molecule can't rotate freely, leading to atropisomerism. \n\nAtropisomers are a type of diastereomer resulting from restricted rotation around a single bond. In this case, the biphenyl can have two conformations (like the nitro groups on the same side or opposite sides) that can't interconvert due to steric hindrance. These would be different stereoisomers. If these conformations are not superimposable, they can exhibit optical activity. \n\nSo the compound could have atropisomers, which are stereoisomers, and if they are enantiomers, then they would have optical activity. Wait, but atropisomers are typically not chiral unless the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are in a way that the molecule as a whole is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it would be chiral. \n\nFor example, suppose the nitro groups are arranged in a way that when you look at the molecule from one side, the nitro on the first ring is up, and the second ring's nitro is also up. But if rotated 180 degrees, maybe they are mirrored. Alternatively, if one is up and the other down, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. \n\nBut how does the naming help here? The compound is named 6,6'-dinitro. The prime indicates the second ring's position. The positions 6 and 6' would be on the same side if the biphenyl is in a certain conformation. However, the exact spatial arrangement might not be indicated by the name. The key is whether the molecule has a chiral axis or not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, the dicarboxylate groups are esterified with methyl, so each of those carbons (the 2-positions on each benzene ring) have a carbonyl group (since it's a carboxylate ester). The carboxylate ester would have an OR group (methyl here). The carbon in the ester (the one from the carboxylic acid) is connected to O, O, and two other groups. Wait, the ester group is R-O-CO-Ph (maybe?), so the carbon in the carboxylate would have two oxygens, a methyl group, and the benzene ring. That carbon is sp2 hybridized, so not a chiral center. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the chiral center is not here. Then maybe the molecule has a chiral axis (the biphenyl axis). If the molecule can't rotate freely, then different conformations (atropisomers) can be chiral. For instance, if the two nitro groups are arranged such that when viewed along the biphenyl axis, their positions make the molecule non-symmetrical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me consider: if both nitro groups are on the same side (say, both above the plane of the biphenyl), then the molecule would have a mirror plane through the biphenyl axis, making it symmetrical. However, if they are on opposite sides, maybe there's no plane. Wait, but the nitro groups are on the 6 positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: each ring is connected at position 1. Position 6 on each ring is three carbons away from the connection. So, in a planar arrangement, the nitro groups would be on opposite sides of the biphenyl plane? Or the same? \n\nAlternatively, the 6th position on each ring is on the same side when the rings are in a certain conformation. For example, if the rings are in a staggered conformation where the substituents are arranged symmetrically. But this is getting too vague without a diagram. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this compound does not have a chiral center or a chiral axis, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of examples. For instance, binaphthol (a biphenyl with two hydroxyl groups) can have atropisomers if the rings can't rotate, leading to chiral molecules. So if this compound has bulky groups preventing rotation, then the two possible conformations (like nitro groups on the same or opposite sides) could be chiral. \n\nAssuming that the nitro groups are large enough to restrict rotation, then the molecule could have two atropisomers that are enantiomers. If so, then option 1 would show optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro groups are on the same side, making it symmetric. But the question is about whether the compound can have optical isomers. Since the compound's structure could have different conformations that can't interconvert and are non-superimposable mirror images, then yes. So option 1 is a candidate. \n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nOption 1: possibly yes (if atropisomers exist and are chiral)\n\nOption 2: yes (has a chiral center)\n\nOption 3: no\n\nOption4: no\n\nSo the answer would be 1 and 2, which is option D (1 and 2), but wait the options are A) 1,2,4; D)1 and2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nWait the options given are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nSo according to my analysis, the correct ones are 1 and 2, so D. But let me double-check option 1 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound doesn't have a chiral center or axis. Let me think of another angle. The dicarboxylate groups are esterified, so the structure would have two methyl groups attached to the carboxyl groups on each benzene. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: the two rings connected at 1-1', each with a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. \n\nIf the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't have optical activity. For example, if the two rings are arranged such that substituents mirror each other. But if the nitro groups are placed in a way that breaks symmetry. Wait, the positions 6 on each ring would be on opposite sides relative to the connecting axis? Or same? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomerism. Maybe I was overcomplicating with the atropisomer idea. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no. Let me think of the structure: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The 2 and 6 positions on a benzene ring are opposite each other (since 1-2-3-4-5-6 are positions, so 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is three positions away, opposite). So each ring has a substituent at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). If the rings are in a planar conformation, then the substituents would be arranged symmetrically. For example, the nitro on one ring's 6 would be in the same direction as the other ring's nitro, but since they are on different rings connected at 1-1', maybe the overall molecule is symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, the two rings are in a eclipsed conformation, making the molecule symmetric. Since the nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are across from the connecting carbon, they would be on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the biphenyl axis. Hence, it is not chiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nIf that's the case, then the first compound doesn't show optical isomerism. So then only option 2 would be correct. But that would leave the answer as D (1 and 2) only if 1 does have it. But if 1 doesn't, then the correct answer would be D is incorrect. Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nIf the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, but the arrangement is such that when viewed along the axis connecting the two rings, the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side but the ester groups are also arranged symmetrically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that the biphenyl's substituents are placed in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyl doesn't have a central chiral carbon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center in the ester group? Let me see: the carboxylate ester is connected to the benzene ring at the 2-position. The ester's carbon is connected to O (from the carbonyl), O (from the OR group, methyl here), the benzene ring, and another oxygen? Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the central carbon here would be the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. The ester group's carbon (the one from the original carboxylic acid) is connected to the benzene, an oxygen (from the carbonyl), and two oxygen atoms (from the ester group)? No, the structure is: \n\nThe carboxylate (from the 2-position of the benzene) becomes an ester when reacted with methanol. So the structure would be:\n\nBenzene ring (with nitro at 6) connected to -O-CO-O-CH3 at position 2. Wait, no. The 2-position of the benzene is attached to a -COOCH3 group (the ester). The carbon in the carboxylate ester is the one attached to the benzene. That carbon is connected to the benzene ring, an oxygen (as part of the carbonyl), and another oxygen (the methoxy group). Wait, that's three bonds. The fourth bond must be another oxygen? No, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so the carbon from the original carboxylic acid (the one attached to the benzene) is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally. \n\nThe carboxylic acid group at position 2 is -COOH. When it becomes an ester with methanol, it becomes -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 group is the carbonyl carbon (which is double-bonded to O), and the other O is part of the ester group (O connected to CH3). Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-C(=O)-R', so the carbonyl is between the O and the R' (CH3 here). The carbon attached to the benzene is the one in the R position. Let's say the benzene ring has a -COOCH3 group at position 2. The carbon in the COOCH3 is the one attached to the benzene. That carbon is connected to the benzene, an oxygen (double-bonded to the carbonyl), and another oxygen (which is part of the O-CH3 group). So that carbon has three bonds: benzene, O (double), and the O-CH3. Wait, that's three bonds, but carbon needs four. Oh right, the carbonyl is a double bond. The actual structure is: \n\nThe benzene ring has a -O-CO-O-CH3 group? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps I need to correct this. The carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 2 becomes an ester when reacted with methanol. The reaction forms a -COOCH3 group. The structure is: the benzene's carbon at position 2 is connected to -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 is the one from the original carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, the carboxylic acid is -COOH. The ester would be -COOCH3. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the benzene, an O (from the ester), and another O (the double bond). Wait, that's three bonds again. Hmm, perhaps the actual structure is that the benzene's carbon is connected to an oxygen, which is double-bonded to another carbon, which is connected to OCH3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the carbon from the original COOH group is the one connected to the benzene. That carbon has four bonds: benzene, O (double bond to the carbonyl), O (connected to CH3), and a single bond to the CH2 or something? No. Let me think again. The formula for the ester group: the benzene is attached to a -COOR group, where R is CH3. The carbonyl is between the carbon and the oxygen. The carbon is connected to the benzene, the carbonyl O, and the O-CH3 group. Wait, that's three bonds. Oh, the carbon must have another bond. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The carbon in the COOR group is the one connected to the benzene. It has four bonds: \n\n- Single bond to the benzene ring.\n\n- Double bond to an oxygen (the carbonyl O).\n\n- Single bond to another oxygen (which is connected to the CH3).\n\nWait, that's three bonds. That can't be. So there must be another bond. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think: the ester group is R-O-CO-R', where R is the benzene (via the COO-) and R' is CH3. The central carbon is the one in the COOCH3 part. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is between the O and the R' (CH3). The carbonyl carbon is connected to O (double bond), R' (CH3), and another O (which is connected to the benzene via an ether linkage? No. Wait, the structure should be:\n\nThe benzene ring's carbon at position 2 is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to the CH3. So the structure is:\n\nBenzene-C2-O-C(=O)-OCH3.\n\nAh! That makes sense. So the carbon from the benzene (position 2) is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon (the central one) has four bonds: double to O, single to OCH3, single to the previous O (from the benzene), and... wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to three groups: the double-bond O, the OCH3 group, and the O from the benzene. Wait that's three bonds. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the structure is actually:\n\nThe benzene ring has a -O-CO-O-CH3 group? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe original carboxylic acid is -COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH becomes -OCH3. So the group becomes -COOCH3. The carbon in the -COOCH3 group is the one from the original COOH. That carbon is connected to the benzene, the carbonyl O (double bond), and the OCH3 group. But that's three bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a hydrogen? No, in esters, the carbonyl is between the O and the R group. The structure of the ester is:\n\nThe benzene ring is attached to a carbon which is double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to another oxygen which is connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond) has four bonds: double to O, single to O-CH3, single to the benzene ring via an oxygen bridge? Wait, no. Let me see a correct structure: \n\nThe benzene ring at position 2 has an ester group: -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the structure is:\n\nBenzene's C2 is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl carbon (C). The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to another oxygen connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: double bond to one O, single to another O (which is connected to CH3), and single to the O from the benzene. Wait, that's three bonds again. I'm confused. Maybe the correct structure has the benzene connected via an ether linkage? Like benzene-O-CO-O-CH3? That would make sense. In that case, the oxygen from the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to OCH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: O (double), O (single to CH3), and two single bonds to the oxygen from the benzene? No, that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is: \n\nThe benzene ring has a group: -O-CO-O-CH3. So the first oxygen is connected to the benzene's carbon (position 2). Then the oxygen is connected to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). The carbonyl carbon is also connected to another oxygen which is connected to CH3. So the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: double bond to O, single bond to the first O (connected to benzene), single bond to the second O (connected to CH3), and what's the fourth bond? Oh, wait, the carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The second oxygen (connected to CH3) is part of an ether linkage. Wait, maybe the structure is actually:\n\nThe benzene is connected via an ester group: -COOCH3. The carbonyl carbon (the one in the COOCH3) is connected to the benzene via a single bond, the double bond to O, and the single bond to OCH3. That only accounts for three bonds. I'm missing something here. Maybe the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon via an oxygen? Like an ether? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe benzene ring has a -COOCH3 group. The carbon in the COOCH3 is the carbonyl carbon. It is double-bonded to an oxygen, and has two single bonds: one to the benzene's carbon (position 2) and one to the OCH3 group. That's three bonds again. This is perplexing. \n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating and should accept that the ester group has a central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) which is sp2 hybridized and thus not a chiral center. Therefore, the first compound (option 1) doesn't have a chiral center. So the only chiral center is in option 2. \n\nIn that case, the correct answer would be option D (1 and 2) only if option 1 has optical isomerism, but if it doesn't, then the correct answer would be option D is wrong and the correct is D (1 and 2) only if 1 does have it. \n\nWait, the question asks which show optical isomerism. If option 1 doesn't have a chiral center or a chiral axis, then it won't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the biphenyl in option 1 has a chiral axis. Let me think: biphenyls can have atropisomerism when rotation is restricted. The presence of two nitro groups on each ring's 6 position (which are bulky) might restrict rotation around the central C-C bond. This would allow two different conformations: one where the nitro groups are on the same side and one where they are on opposite sides. These conformations are enantiomers if they are mirror images. \n\nFor example, imagine the biphenyl is twisted so that the nitro groups are in different orientations. If the molecule can't rotate freely, then these two forms are different stereoisomers (atropisomers). If they are non-superimposable mirror images, they are enantiomers and thus optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, the first compound would have optical isomerism. Hence, options 1 and 2 are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D (1 and 2).\n\n\nTo determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or restricted rotation leading to chiral atropisomers:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   The biphenyl structure has nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The bulky nitro groups likely restrict rotation around the central C-C bond, creating atropisomers. These atropisomers can be non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, **this compound shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   The structure is CH\u2083-CHOH-COOCH\u2083. The central carbon (second carbon) has four different substituents (CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H), forming a **chiral center**. This results in enantiomers, so **this compound shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**:  \n   The structure is (Ph)\u2082CO. The central carbon is sp\u00b2 hybridized with two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, making it symmetrical. No chiral center or restricted rotation exists, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. The trans configuration is symmetrical, lacking a chiral center. Even though it has geometric isomerism (cis vs. trans), the trans form is not chiral, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\nThe compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**, corresponding to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomerism, specifically enantiomers, which are mirror images that are non-superimposable. These usually occur when a molecule has a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, they can also arise from other factors like double bonds that can't rotate (cis-trans isomerism) but those are different types of stereoisomerism. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is specifically enantiomers, right? So maybe I need to check for chiral centers or other factors that cause chirality.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nThe compounds listed are:\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate\n\nI need to analyze each one for possible chiral centers or other sources of optical isomerism.\n\nStarting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me break that down. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' positions are part of dicarboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl groups. Wait, the dicarboxylate would have two carboxylic acid groups, but here they are esters (since it's dimethyl, so each carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group). \n\nSo the biphenyl part: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (on the first ring) and 6' (on the second ring). The 2 and 2' positions are connected to the ester groups. Let me think about possible chiral centers here. Since the biphenyl is connected at the 1-1' position, the two rings are in a straight line? Or maybe not. But the key is whether any of the carbons have four different substituents. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions. The 2 positions have the ester groups. The other positions on each benzene ring might have hydrogens. Let's see: the 1,1' positions are connected. The 6 and 6' have nitro. The 2 and 2' have the ester. The other positions (like 3,4,5 on each ring?) would have H. \n\nWait, but the central carbon between the two phenyl rings? Wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between carbons (like 1-1'). The connecting carbon (the one in the first ring's position 1 and the second ring's position 1') would be part of each benzene ring. That carbon is connected to three other carbons from each ring. Wait, maybe that central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's part of an aromatic system? Probably not a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the nitro groups and ester groups create asymmetry. Let me see: the two rings each have a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides. Wait, but the molecule might be symmetric. If the substituents are placed symmetrically, then maybe there's no chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement around the biphenyl allows for optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe the biphenyl system could have different configurations if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis? Or maybe the molecule is actually chiral because of the way the groups are placed. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. For example, if the two rings have substituents in mirror positions, then the molecule might be symmetric. For instance, if the nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are opposite to each other in the biphenyl, and the esters are on 2 positions. Maybe the overall structure is symmetrical. If so, then there's no chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, I might need to come back to this one after looking at the others.\n\nOption 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse that. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid (propanoic acid) with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. The methyl ester means the carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group. So the structure is:\n\nThe carboxylic acid group (COOH) becomes an ester (COOCH3). The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let me draw this out. The molecule is: \n\nCH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a CH2OH (no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COO-. Then the ester would have the COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nThe central carbon (the second carbon) has groups: -CH2-, but wait, let me think again. Let's number the propanoate: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 3 (since propanoate is three carbons). The hydroxy is on carbon 2. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: methyl (CH3)\nCarbon 2: connected to OH and to carbon 1 and carbon 3. Carbon 3 is the carboxylic acid, which is esterified to methyl. So carbon 3's structure is -COOCH3. \n\nSo the carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (CH3)\n- Carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group)\n- An OH group\n- A hydrogen?\n\nWait, the second carbon (position 2) would have four substituents: the CH2 group (from the methyl on carbon 1?), wait, perhaps I need to write it properly. Let me structure it as:\n\nThe molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me clarify. For 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So when it's the ester with methyl, the COOH becomes COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The carbon at position 2 has the hydroxyl group, and is connected to the methyl (CH3 on C1), the COOCH3 group (C3), and also the hydrogen. Wait, the carbon 2 would have: -CH2-? Wait, carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group, so it's CH(OH). Let's see:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: -CHOH-\nCarbon 3: -COOCH3.\n\nSo the carbon at position 2 (the central carbon) has four different groups: CH3 (from carbon 1), the OH, the COOCH3 (via carbon 3?), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is the second carbon in the chain. The structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (CH2?), but with an OH. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as CH2OH attached to the central carbon. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 2 (the middle carbon) has four substituents: \n\n- CH3 (from carbon 1)\n- OH group\n- COOCH3 group (on carbon 3)\n- a single bond to carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3), but the actual substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3)\n- Carbon 3 (which has the COOCH3)\n- OH group\n- A hydrogen? Because in a propane chain, each carbon (except the ends) has two bonds to other carbons. Wait, carbon 2 in this case is between C1 and C3. So the bonds would be: C1 (CH3) is attached to C2, which is attached to C3 (which has the COOCH3). The C2 has a hydroxyl group (OH) and also must have a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon 2 has four groups:\n\nThe carbon at position 2 (the middle one) has:\n\n- One bond to CH3 (from C1)\n- One bond to the next carbon (C3)\n- One bond to OH\n- The fourth bond must be a hydrogen. \n\nSo that carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3 (through the C3), and H. Wait, but the COOCH3 is on C3, so the bond from C2 to C3 is a single bond. So C2's substituents are CH3, OH, H, and the bond to C3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group). Therefore, the carbon at position 2 has four different groups: CH3, OH, H, and the group leading to COOCH3 (which is a different group from the others). So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule should have optical isomerism (enantiomers) because of the chiral center at C2. So option 2 should be correct.\n\nMoving to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to another benzene ring. The structure is (C6H5)CO(C6H5). The central carbon is the ketone's carbon, which is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the one in the ketone) is bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, the structure is: the ketone is between two benzene rings. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has two phenyl groups (each a benzene ring), an oxygen double bond, and the other bond is to the oxygen (as part of the carbonyl). Wait, actually, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the central carbon. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, an O (as double bond), and another single bond? Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond to O) is connected to two R groups. In benzophenone, the two R groups are both phenyl groups. So the structure is:\n\nPh-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is connected to two phenyl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and no other substituents. Wait, that's three bonds, but carbons need four. The carbonyl carbon has four bonds: two single bonds to phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and... Wait, no. The carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the carbon. So the carbon has double bond to O, and two single bonds to the phenyl groups. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's correct that. The carbonyl carbon in a ketone has two single bonds to the R groups (in this case, both are phenyl), one double bond to O, and the fourth bond is a single bond to... Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon in a ketone has two single bonds to the two R groups (like two alkyl or aryl groups), and the double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: the double bond counts as one bond (so two electron pairs), but structurally, the carbon has four single bonds? No, no. Wait, the carbonyl carbon has a double bond (counts as one bond but with two electron pairs) and two single bonds. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The structure of benzophenone is two phenyl groups connected via a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is part of the ketone. So the carbon has:\n\n- One double bond to O (the carbonyl)\n- Single bonds to two phenyl groups. \n\nWait, that's only three bonds. That can't be right. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is connected via a double bond to O, and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So that's three bonds. But carbon must have four bonds. Oh! Wait, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the carbon, and the carbon also has two single bonds to the phenyl groups. Wait, that's three bonds. That's not possible. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me correct this. The actual structure is: the ketone group is between two phenyl rings. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has a double bond to O and two single bonds to the phenyl groups. Wait, that's three bonds. So where's the fourth bond? Oh, no, the carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The mistake here is that the carbonyl group has a double bond (so one bond as a double bond) and two single bonds. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and another group? Wait, no. Wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The formula is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has two phenyl groups (each is a substituent), the oxygen (double bond), and that's it? No, that can't be. Wait, the carbon is bonded via a double bond to O (counts as one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. The fourth bond must be a single bond to... Wait, maybe the central carbon is actually part of a three-carbon chain? No. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again. The formula for benzophenone is C6H5-CO-C6H5. Wait, that would be two phenyl groups attached to either end of a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is part of the carbonyl, connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, that still gives three bonds. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The central carbon has a double bond to O (so that's one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. That leaves one more bond. Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The mistake must be here. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is part of a carbonyl group between two phenyl groups, so the carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen via a double bond. That would be three bonds. That can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups (each as a single bond), and the double bond to O. That's three bonds, but that leaves one more. Wait, maybe the central carbon is part of a three-carbon chain? Wait, no. Maybe the carbonyl group is between two phenyl groups. Let me check the actual structure of benzophenone. Oh! Wait, benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. The structure is two phenyl groups connected through a carbonyl group. So the carbonyl carbon is in the middle, connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, that still adds up to three bonds. Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O (counts as one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. The fourth bond must be a single bond to a hydrogen? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point here is whether benzophenone has a chiral center. Since the central carbon is part of the carbonyl group, which is symmetric. The two phenyl groups are identical (both phenyl), so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group. Therefore, it can't have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.\n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the anion of fumaric acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (no, wait, no). Wait, fumaric acid is a trans-diacid. The structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between the second and third carbons. When esterified with methyl groups, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, actually, both carboxylic acids are esterified. So the structure would be (OCH3)2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2? No, wait, both carboxylic groups are converted to methyl esters. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends must be methyl esters. So the correct structure is (OCH2COOCH3) or wait, perhaps it's (OOCCH2CH2COOCH3) but no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methyl, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both carboxylic groups are esterified. So both ends would have methyl groups. So the structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, that's dimethyl fumarate. Now, does this have a chiral center?\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is symmetric in the trans configuration? Let's see:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the molecule is OOC-(CH2-CH2)-COOCH3 but with a double bond between the two central carbons. Wait, the actual structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends are methyl esters. Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. So the correct structure is:\n\n(CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have two different ends. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both are esterified with methyl, it becomes (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have a methyl ester on one end and another methyl ester on the other? Wait, no, the two carboxylic acid groups are both converted to methyl esters. So the structure would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the molecule is symmetrical? Let's see: the two ends are both methyl esters. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two ends would both be OOCCH3. Wait, actually, the correct structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the two ends are the same: both are methyl esters. Wait, but the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule's structure is symmetric. Let me check: the left side is OOCCH2? No, the left side is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the left and right ends are both OOCCH3? No, the left is OOC- attached to the first carbon (which is connected to the double bond), and the right is COOCH3. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the structure as:\n\nThe molecule has four carbons: the first and fourth have the ester groups, and the central two are connected by a double bond. The molecule would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have different groups on either end. Wait, actually, if both carboxylic acids are esterified with methyl, then both ends become OOCCH3. Wait, no. Let me clarify: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When each COOH is esterified with CH3OH, replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So the structure becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends would have -OCH3. Wait, the two COOH groups become COOCH3. So the molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that's not symmetric. Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester group. The central two carbons form a double bond. The molecule's structure is symmetric if the two ester groups are the same. Since both are methyl esters, the molecule would be symmetrical. Wait, the molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, both ends must be the same. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH2(COOCH3)) but with the double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule has the structure CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond in between? No, fumaric acid's structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the esters would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be methyl esters. Wait, maybe it's OOCCH2CH2COOCH3 but with a double bond instead of single. So the correct structure is (OOCCH2) and (CH2COOCH3) but connected via a double bond between the two central carbons. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that's asymmetric because one end is OOC- and the other is COOCH3? Wait no, both are methyl esters. The first COOH becomes OOCCH3? No, the first COOH is replaced by OOC- attached to the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm confused here. Let me think again. Each COOH group is converted to COOCH3. So the two ends are both OOCCH3? No, the first carbon (the one attached to the first COOH) would have OOC- connected to it, but actually, the first carbon is part of the CH=CH group. Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is that the two ends are both ester groups. The molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the left and right ends are OOCCH3 and COOCH3, but since both are methyl esters, they are the same. Wait, the left end is OOC- attached to the first carbon, but actually, the first carbon is part of the double bond. Wait, maybe I should consider that the molecule is symmetric. Let me check: in fumaric acid, the two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). So when both are esterified with methyl, the molecule becomes (OOCCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that would have different groups on each end. Wait, no, the two COOH groups are both converted to the same ester. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would mean the first COOH becomes OOC- (still a carboxylate?), but no, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. Therefore, the molecule is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the first COOH as OOC- attached to the first carbon (which is connected to the double bond). The fourth carbon (the other end) has COOCH3. So the molecule is not symmetrical because one end is OOC- and the other is COOCH3. Wait, no, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester. Wait, the first carbon (connected to the first COOH group) would have its COOH replaced by COOCH3. So the first carbon is connected to the double bond and has a COOCH3 group. The fourth carbon (the other end) also has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is (COOCH2) but with the double bond. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think of it as:\n\nThe molecule has the structure: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, but if both ends are the same, then it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 would not be symmetric unless the two ends are identical. Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester group. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the two ends are both COOCH3 groups. Wait, that's right! Because the first and fourth carbons each have their COOH groups converted to COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the first carbon (connected to the first COOCH3) and the fourth carbon (connected to the second COOCH3). The molecule is symmetric because the two ends are mirror images. Wait, actually, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. For example, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon has a COOCH3 group, and the fourth has the same. The structure is symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, maybe there is a chiral center? Wait, the double bond is in the middle, and the groups on each side are the same. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. But the question is about optical isomerism. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound if there are chiral centers but they are arranged symmetrically. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has chiral centers but they are symmetric. Wait, the double bond in fumarate is trans, so the molecule can't rotate around the double bond. But does the molecule have any chiral carbons? Let's look at each carbon. The first carbon (attached to the first COOCH3) is connected to:\n\n- The COOCH3 group\n- The double bond to carbon 2\n- A hydrogen? Wait, the first carbon is part of the chain: the first carbon is connected to the double bond (so it's a CH2 group?), no. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Let me clarify each carbon's connections.\n\nCarbon 1: connected to O (from the COOCH3 group), two single bonds (one to carbon 2 and one to a hydrogen?), and the double bond? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 1 is part of the carboxylate group. Let me better consider the structure as:\n\nThe molecule is (CH2(COOCH3)) but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps I need to think of each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: attached to the COOCH3 group, a single bond to carbon 2, and two hydrogens? No. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:\n\nThe molecule has four carbons in a row. The first carbon (C1) has a COOCH3 group, connected via a single bond to C2. C2 is double-bonded to C3. C3 is single-bonded to C4, which has the other COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would mean the double bond is between C2 and C3. Then the structure would be:\n\nC1: COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since fumarate is a trans isomer, and when converted to dimethyl ester, does it have a chiral center?\n\nWait, in fumaric acid (the trans isomer), there are no chiral centers because the molecule is symmetrical. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, giving a symmetrical structure. Therefore, when esterified, the resulting dimethyl fumarate would also be symmetrical and not have chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. However, if the molecule were the cis isomer (maleic acid), then it would have chiral centers if the groups are arranged asymmetrically. But fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's not chiral. Therefore, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the case of maleic acid (the cis isomer of butenedioic acid), when esterified, the molecule would have two chiral centers? Or is that not the case? Let's see: maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH (cis). The double bond allows for cis/trans isomerism. But in the trans form (fumaric acid), the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans) would not have any chiral centers. So option 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\nNow, moving back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to analyze this again. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'). The 6 and 6' positions (on each ring) have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups that are esterified with methyl groups. \n\nSo each benzene ring has:\n\n- At position 1: connected to the other ring (so part of the biphenyl structure)\n- At position 2: part of the dicarboxylate, which is esterified. So position 2 has a -OOCCH3 group (since it's a carboxylate ester).\n- At position 6: a nitro group (NO2).\n\nThe other positions (3,4,5 on each ring) would have hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or an axis of chirality. Let me consider the biphenyl's configuration. Biphenyls can have different conformations, such as the s-cis or s-trans, but those are conformational isomers, not stereoisomers. However, in this case, the substituents (nitro at 6 and ester at 2) are on each ring. Let me see the positions:\n\nIn biphenyl numbering, the positions are such that the two connected carbons are 1 and 1'. The numbering proceeds around each ring. So for each ring, position 1 is the one connected to the other ring. The 6 position on each ring would be three carbons away from the 1 position. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. \n\nThe key is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize it. Suppose the two rings are in a staggered conformation. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are opposite to the 2 positions. Since the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are diametrically opposite each other (since in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite, 2 and 5, 3 and 6). Wait, maybe not exactly, but let me think. \n\nWait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged such that each is 60 degrees apart. Position 1 is connected to the other ring. Position 2 is next to it. Position 6 would be three positions away from 1, so opposite to position 4? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are placed such that the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the two rings have substituents at positions 2 and 6 in a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical. Let's suppose that each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and these are placed symmetrically. Then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then there might be no plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. \n\nAlternatively, the biphenyl might have a chiral axis. If the molecule is not symmetric, then rotating one ring relative to the other could create a non-superimposable mirror image. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations called atropisomers, which are stereoisomers due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, atropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism but not due to chiral centers. However, optical isomerism (enantiomers) specifically requires chiral centers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center. Looking at the substituents on each ring: the positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me check each carbon in the molecule for chirality. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions, and the esters on the 2 positions. The carbons at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are each attached to different substituents. Let me consider the carbon at position 2 on the first ring. It has:\n\n- The substituent from the ester group (the carboxylate ester, which is part of a larger group)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3)\n- The hydrogen? \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 on the first ring (which is part of the biphenyl's first ring) has:\n\n- The substituent at position 2 (the ester group, which is a -OOCCH3 group)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3 on the ring)\n- A hydrogen? \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's bonded to two adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3), the substituent (ester), and the fourth bond must be a hydrogen? No, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons, and two substituents (or hydrogens). Since position 2 has the ester group, one of its substituents is the ester, and the other is a hydrogen. Wait, but the ester group is a substituent taking one bond, so the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- Two bonds to the ring carbons (positions 1 and 3)\n- The ester group (-OOCCH3)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nThus, that carbon has four different groups? Wait, the two ring carbons are the same in terms of their connectivity, but each is part of the benzene ring. However, in terms of substituents, the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- The ester group (which is a large substituent)\n- Two adjacent ring carbons (each connected to other substituents)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nBut the two adjacent ring carbons (positions 1 and 3) may have different substituents. For example, position 1 is connected to the other ring, and position 3 may have a hydrogen (since position 6 is on the opposite side). \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the key is that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the biphenyl with substituents on 2 and 6. If the substituents are placed symmetrically on both rings, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the 6 positions and the esters on 2, then rotating the molecule 180 degrees might superimpose it on its mirror image. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is such that there's no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are placed in a way that when you flip the molecule, the nitro groups end up on the opposite side, making it non-superimposable. But I'm not sure. Since the question is about optical isomerism (enantiomers), which requires a chiral center, not just any stereoisomerism. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the ester group's carbon. Wait, the ester group is a carboxylate ester. The carboxylate group's carbon (the one attached to the oxygen) is part of the benzene ring? No, the carboxylate is attached to the benzene ring at position 2. The ester group would be: the benzene ring's carbon at position 2 is connected to an oxygen which is double-bonded to another oxygen and single-bonded to methyl. Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the carboxylate ester would be: the benzene ring's carbon (position 2) is connected to an -O-C(=O)-OCH3 group. \n\nThe carbon in the ester group that is the central one (the carbonyl carbon) is part of the ester and has two oxygen groups and two other groups. That carbon is not a chiral center because it has a double bond to O, so it's bonded to O (double bond), another O (single bond to methyl), and two other groups (the benzene ring's carbon and the methyl). Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the C=O) is bonded to O (double bond), the methyl group (through the oxygen), and the benzene ring's carbon. So that's three bonds. The fourth must be a single bond to another oxygen? No, I think I'm getting confused here. The ester group structure is:\n\nThe benzene ring's carbon (position 2) is connected to an oxygen which is part of an ether linkage to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the oxygen (from the benzene's ester group), another oxygen (as the double bond), and a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene's oxygen, the double-bonded oxygen, and the methyl group. That's three bonds. So that carbon can't be a chiral center. \n\nHmm, this is getting too detailed. Maybe the key is that option 1 has a chiral center? Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring creates a chiral molecule. Let me think of an example. Suppose the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring, and the esters on the 2 positions. If the molecule is not symmetric, then it could be chiral. For instance, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine that the two rings are arranged such that substituents on each are mirrored. For example, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and these are placed symmetrically across the biphenyl's axis. In that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, then it would be chiral. \n\nSince the question doesn't specify the configuration of the biphenyl (like whether it's s-cis or s-trans), but the molecule's name doesn't indicate any such configuration. The presence of substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring might lead to a lack of symmetry. Let me think of the positions again. \n\nIn a biphenyl, the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Let's number each ring from 1 to 6. On the first ring (left), position 1 is connected to the second ring. The substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). On the second ring (right), position 1' is connected to the first ring, and substituents are at 2' (ester) and 6' (nitro). \n\nIf the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are on the same side (so that the nitro on the first ring's 6 is aligned with the nitro on the second ring's 6'), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, then it might not. Wait, but the positions are fixed. The numbering would ensure that the substituents are placed in a way that creates symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents around the biphenyl creates an asymmetric environment. Without a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. \n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure. Since I'm stuck on option 1, perhaps I should look at the answer options. The options given are:\n\nA) 1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2,3\n\nD)1,2\n\nEarlier analysis suggests that option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center (the carbon at position 2) so it does show optical isomerism. Option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is the trans isomer and lacks chiral centers, so no. Option 3 (benzophenone) is symmetric, no. Option 1 is unclear but if it's chiral, then it would be included. \n\nLooking at the options, if option 1 is chiral, then the answer could be A or D. If not, then D (1 and 2) would be incorrect. Wait, but if option 1 isn't chiral, then the correct answer would be D only if option 1 is not correct. Wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2,3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nSince I concluded that option 2 is correct (has chiral center), and 4 is not. So between options D and A. \n\nIf option 1 is not a chiral molecule, then D (1 and 2) would be incorrect because 1 is not. But if option 1 is chiral, then A would include 1,2,4 but 4 is not. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. Maybe the biphenyl has a chiral axis. \n\nWait, biphenyls can have atropisomers if rotation around the central bond is restricted. These are stereoisomers due to restricted rotation, but they are not enantiomers (optical isomers). Atropisomers can have optical activity if they are chiral. For example, if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. \n\nIn the case of the given compound (option 1), the substituents are placed such that there is no plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The positions 2 and 6 are not opposite each other in a way that creates symmetry. \n\nWait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are separated by three carbons. So position 2 is next to 1 and 3, and position 6 is opposite to position 3. Hmm, perhaps the arrangement on each ring creates asymmetry when combined. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule's overall structure might have no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. If that's the case, then option 1 would be a chiral molecule, exhibiting optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central axis of the biphenyl. Let me consider: if the substituents are placed symmetrically on each ring. For example, the nitro groups on 6 and esters on 2 on each ring are arranged such that flipping the molecule over the plane would superimpose them. In that case, the molecule is achiral. \n\nBut without more detailed analysis, it's hard to tell. Given that the question is from an exam, perhaps the intended answer is that option 1 does not have optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be D (options 1 and 2). Wait, but earlier I thought option 2 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me recheck option 4 again. \n\nDimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer. When esterified, does it have a chiral center? \n\nWait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nWhen converted to dimethyl fumarate, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that's asymmetric. The left end is OOCCH3 and the right end is COOCH3? No, both ends are methyl esters. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the first carbon (position 1) has the COOCH3 group, and the fourth carbon (position 4) also has COOCH3. The double bond is between 2 and 3. So the molecule is symmetric because both ends have the same groups. \n\nThe molecule would be symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, there's a plane of symmetry, so no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the only compounds showing optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) and option 1 if it's chiral. \n\nWait, but I'm still not sure about option 1. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question asks which show optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers. \n\nOption 1: the molecule has two nitro groups on the 6 positions and two ester groups on the 2 positions of the biphenyl. \n\nIf the biphenyl is in a conformation where the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it would have a chiral axis. Wait, but optical isomerism via a chiral axis is different. Atropisomers can have optical activity if they are chiral. However, the presence of a chiral axis can lead to enantiomers if there's no symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center somewhere. For instance, the carbon at position 2 of one of the rings. Let me think of the carbon at position 2 on the first ring. \n\nThe carbon at position 2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's bonded to two adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3). The substituent at position 2 is the ester group (OOCCH3). The fourth bond is a hydrogen. \n\nNow, the adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3) have different substituents. \n\nPosition 1 is connected to the other ring (so that carbon has a substituent from the other ring), while position 3 may have a hydrogen (since position 6 has a nitro group, which is three positions away). \n\nTherefore, the carbon at position 2 has four different groups: \n\n- The ester group (OOCCH3)\n- The carbon at position 1 (connected to the other ring's substituents)\n- The carbon at position 3 (which may have a hydrogen or other groups)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 3: \n\nPosition 3 on the first ring is adjacent to position 2 and 4. Position 4 would have a hydrogen unless there's another substituent. Since the only substituents on the first ring are at 2 and 6, position 3 has a hydrogen. \n\nSo the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- Two adjacent ring carbons (positions 1 and 3), but position 1 has the other ring attached (so its substituents include the other ring's groups?), while position 3 has a hydrogen. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 1 of the first ring is connected to the other ring's position 1'. The substituents on position 1 (of the first ring) would be: \n\n- The connection to the second ring (so the substituent there includes the second ring's structure)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6? No, in the first ring, position 1 is between position 6 and 2. \n\nWait, the first ring's position 1 is connected to position 2 and position 6 (since it's a benzene ring). \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Perhaps the key is that the molecule lacks a chiral center but has a chiral axis, leading to optical isomerism. In that case, option 1 would show optical isomerism as atropisomers. \n\nAtropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism due to restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to different configurations that can be chiral. If the molecule has a chiral axis (like the biphenyl's central bond), and the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule can have enantiomers. \n\nIn the case of option 1, the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the arrangement is such that rotating the two rings relative to each other creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then there are atropisomers. These can have optical activity. \n\nTherefore, option 1 would show optical isomerism via atropisomerism. \n\nSo, in that case, option 1 and 2 would both show optical isomerism, so the answer would be D (1 and 2). \n\nWait, but I need to confirm whether the substituents would allow for such a chiral axis. \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed such that there's no symmetry, then rotating the two rings would lead to different configurations. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl's plane and the esters are on the opposite side, then rotating one ring would give a different configuration. \n\nTherefore, the molecule can have two enantiomeric forms due to the restricted rotation, making them optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, option 1 does show optical isomerism. \n\nSo then the correct options are 1 and 2. That would be answer D. \n\nWait, but what about option 4? Earlier I thought it was symmetric, so no. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 1 and 2. \n\nBut let me double-check option 2 again. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (position 2) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That's a chiral center. So it definitely has optical isomerism. \n\nOption 1's case is more ambiguous, but if it has a chiral axis leading to atropisomerism, then it counts. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we analyze each option for chiral centers or other sources of chirality:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   This compound features a biphenyl core with nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomerism, specifically enantiomers, which are mirror images that are non-superimposable. These usually occur when a molecule has a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, they can also arise from other factors like double bonds that can't rotate (cis-trans isomerism) but those are different types of stereoisomerism. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is specifically enantiomers, right? So maybe I need to check for chiral centers or other factors that cause chirality.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nThe compounds listed are:\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate\n\nI need to analyze each one for possible chiral centers or other sources of optical isomerism.\n\nStarting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me break that down. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' positions are part of dicarboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl groups. Wait, the dicarboxylate would have two carboxylic acid groups, but here they are esters (since it's dimethyl, so each carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group). \n\nSo the biphenyl part: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (on the first ring) and 6' (on the second ring). The 2 and 2' positions are connected to the ester groups. Let me think about possible chiral centers here. Since the biphenyl is connected at the 1-1' position, the two rings are in a straight line? Or maybe not. But the key is whether any of the carbons have four different substituents. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions. The 2 positions have the ester groups. The other positions on each benzene ring might have hydrogens. Let's see: the 1,1' positions are connected. The 6 and 6' have nitro. The 2 and 2' have the ester. The other positions (like 3,4,5 on each ring?) would have H. \n\nWait, but the central carbon between the two phenyl rings? Wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between carbons (like 1-1'). The connecting carbon (the one in the first ring's position 1 and the second ring's position 1') would be part of each benzene ring. That carbon is connected to three other carbons from each ring. Wait, maybe that central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's part of an aromatic system? Probably not a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the nitro groups and ester groups create asymmetry. Let me see: the two rings each have a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So the substituents on each ring are on opposite sides. Wait, but the molecule might be symmetric. If the substituents are placed symmetrically, then maybe there's no chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement around the biphenyl allows for optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe the biphenyl system could have different configurations if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis? Or maybe the molecule is actually chiral because of the way the groups are placed. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. For example, if the two rings have substituents in mirror positions, then the molecule might be symmetric. For instance, if the nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are opposite to each other in the biphenyl, and the esters are on 2 positions. Maybe the overall structure is symmetrical. If so, then there's no chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, I might need to come back to this one after looking at the others.\n\nOption 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse that. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be a carboxylic acid (propanoic acid) with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. The methyl ester means the carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group. So the structure is:\n\nThe carboxylic acid group (COOH) becomes an ester (COOCH3). The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let me draw this out. The molecule is: \n\nCH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group, a CH2OH (no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-CHOH-COO-. Then the ester would have the COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nThe central carbon (the second carbon) has groups: -CH2-, but wait, let me think again. Let's number the propanoate: the carboxylic acid is on carbon 3 (since propanoate is three carbons). The hydroxy is on carbon 2. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: methyl (CH3)\nCarbon 2: connected to OH and to carbon 1 and carbon 3. Carbon 3 is the carboxylic acid, which is esterified to methyl. So carbon 3's structure is -COOCH3. \n\nSo the carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) is connected to:\n- Carbon 1 (CH3)\n- Carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group)\n- An OH group\n- A hydrogen?\n\nWait, the second carbon (position 2) would have four substituents: the CH2 group (from the methyl on carbon 1?), wait, perhaps I need to write it properly. Let me structure it as:\n\nThe molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me clarify. For 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So when it's the ester with methyl, the COOH becomes COOCH3. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The carbon at position 2 has the hydroxyl group, and is connected to the methyl (CH3 on C1), the COOCH3 group (C3), and also the hydrogen. Wait, the carbon 2 would have: -CH2-? Wait, carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group, so it's CH(OH). Let's see:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: -CHOH-\nCarbon 3: -COOCH3.\n\nSo the carbon at position 2 (the central carbon) has four different groups: CH3 (from carbon 1), the OH, the COOCH3 (via carbon 3?), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is the second carbon in the chain. The structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (CH2?), but with an OH. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as CH2OH attached to the central carbon. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 2 (the middle carbon) has four substituents: \n\n- CH3 (from carbon 1)\n- OH group\n- COOCH3 group (on carbon 3)\n- a single bond to carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3), but the actual substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3)\n- Carbon 3 (which has the COOCH3)\n- OH group\n- A hydrogen? Because in a propane chain, each carbon (except the ends) has two bonds to other carbons. Wait, carbon 2 in this case is between C1 and C3. So the bonds would be: C1 (CH3) is attached to C2, which is attached to C3 (which has the COOCH3). The C2 has a hydroxyl group (OH) and also must have a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon 2 has four groups:\n\nThe carbon at position 2 (the middle one) has:\n\n- One bond to CH3 (from C1)\n- One bond to the next carbon (C3)\n- One bond to OH\n- The fourth bond must be a hydrogen. \n\nSo that carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3 (through the C3), and H. Wait, but the COOCH3 is on C3, so the bond from C2 to C3 is a single bond. So C2's substituents are CH3, OH, H, and the bond to C3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group). Therefore, the carbon at position 2 has four different groups: CH3, OH, H, and the group leading to COOCH3 (which is a different group from the others). So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule should have optical isomerism (enantiomers) because of the chiral center at C2. So option 2 should be correct.\n\nMoving to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to another benzene ring. The structure is (C6H5)CO(C6H5). The central carbon is the ketone's carbon, which is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms. Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the one in the ketone) is bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, the structure is: the ketone is between two benzene rings. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has two phenyl groups (each a benzene ring), an oxygen double bond, and the other bond is to the oxygen (as part of the carbonyl). Wait, actually, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the central carbon. So the central carbon has two phenyl groups, an O (as double bond), and another single bond? Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon (the one with the double bond to O) is connected to two R groups. In benzophenone, the two R groups are both phenyl groups. So the structure is:\n\nPh-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is connected to two phenyl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and no other substituents. Wait, that's three bonds, but carbons need four. The carbonyl carbon has four bonds: two single bonds to phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and... Wait, no. The carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the carbon. So the carbon has double bond to O, and two single bonds to the phenyl groups. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's correct that. The carbonyl carbon in a ketone has two single bonds to the R groups (in this case, both are phenyl), one double bond to O, and the fourth bond is a single bond to... Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon in a ketone has two single bonds to the two R groups (like two alkyl or aryl groups), and the double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, the carbonyl carbon has four bonds: the double bond counts as one bond (so two electron pairs), but structurally, the carbon has four single bonds? No, no. Wait, the carbonyl carbon has a double bond (counts as one bond but with two electron pairs) and two single bonds. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The structure of benzophenone is two phenyl groups connected via a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is part of the ketone. So the carbon has:\n\n- One double bond to O (the carbonyl)\n- Single bonds to two phenyl groups. \n\nWait, that's only three bonds. That can't be right. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is connected via a double bond to O, and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So that's three bonds. But carbon must have four bonds. Oh! Wait, the carbonyl group is O double-bonded to the carbon, and the carbon also has two single bonds to the phenyl groups. Wait, that's three bonds. That's not possible. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me correct this. The actual structure is: the ketone group is between two phenyl rings. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has a double bond to O and two single bonds to the phenyl groups. Wait, that's three bonds. So where's the fourth bond? Oh, no, the carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The mistake here is that the carbonyl group has a double bond (so one bond as a double bond) and two single bonds. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen (double bond), and another group? Wait, no. Wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The formula is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has two phenyl groups (each is a substituent), the oxygen (double bond), and that's it? No, that can't be. Wait, the carbon is bonded via a double bond to O (counts as one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. The fourth bond must be a single bond to... Wait, maybe the central carbon is actually part of a three-carbon chain? No. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again. The formula for benzophenone is C6H5-CO-C6H5. Wait, that would be two phenyl groups attached to either end of a carbonyl group. So the central carbon is part of the carbonyl, connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, that still gives three bonds. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The central carbon has a double bond to O (so that's one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. That leaves one more bond. Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon must have four bonds. The mistake must be here. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is part of a carbonyl group between two phenyl groups, so the carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the oxygen via a double bond. That would be three bonds. That can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups (each as a single bond), and the double bond to O. That's three bonds, but that leaves one more. Wait, maybe the central carbon is part of a three-carbon chain? Wait, no. Maybe the carbonyl group is between two phenyl groups. Let me check the actual structure of benzophenone. Oh! Wait, benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. The structure is two phenyl groups connected through a carbonyl group. So the carbonyl carbon is in the middle, connected to two phenyl groups and the oxygen. Wait, that still adds up to three bonds. Wait, no. The carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O (counts as one bond), and two single bonds to each phenyl group. That's three bonds. The fourth bond must be a single bond to a hydrogen? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point here is whether benzophenone has a chiral center. Since the central carbon is part of the carbonyl group, which is symmetric. The two phenyl groups are identical (both phenyl), so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group. Therefore, it can't have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.\n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the anion of fumaric acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (no, wait, no). Wait, fumaric acid is a trans-diacid. The structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between the second and third carbons. When esterified with methyl groups, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, actually, both carboxylic acids are esterified. So the structure would be (OCH3)2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2? No, wait, both carboxylic groups are converted to methyl esters. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends must be methyl esters. So the correct structure is (OCH2COOCH3) or wait, perhaps it's (OOCCH2CH2COOCH3) but no. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methyl, it becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both carboxylic groups are esterified. So both ends would have methyl groups. So the structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, that's dimethyl fumarate. Now, does this have a chiral center?\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is symmetric in the trans configuration? Let's see:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the molecule is OOC-(CH2-CH2)-COOCH3 but with a double bond between the two central carbons. Wait, the actual structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends are methyl esters. Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. So the correct structure is:\n\n(CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have two different ends. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both are esterified with methyl, it becomes (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would have a methyl ester on one end and another methyl ester on the other? Wait, no, the two carboxylic acid groups are both converted to methyl esters. So the structure would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the molecule is symmetrical? Let's see: the two ends are both methyl esters. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two ends would both be OOCCH3. Wait, actually, the correct structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the two ends are the same: both are methyl esters. Wait, but the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule's structure is symmetric. Let me check: the left side is OOCCH2? No, the left side is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the left and right ends are both OOCCH3? No, the left is OOC- attached to the first carbon (which is connected to the double bond), and the right is COOCH3. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the structure as:\n\nThe molecule has four carbons: the first and fourth have the ester groups, and the central two are connected by a double bond. The molecule would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have different groups on either end. Wait, actually, if both carboxylic acids are esterified with methyl, then both ends become OOCCH3. Wait, no. Let me clarify: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When each COOH is esterified with CH3OH, replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So the structure becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends would have -OCH3. Wait, the two COOH groups become COOCH3. So the molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that's not symmetric. Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester group. The central two carbons form a double bond. The molecule's structure is symmetric if the two ester groups are the same. Since both are methyl esters, the molecule would be symmetrical. Wait, the molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, both ends must be the same. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH2(COOCH3)) but with the double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule has the structure CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond in between? No, fumaric acid's structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the esters would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be methyl esters. Wait, maybe it's OOCCH2CH2COOCH3 but with a double bond instead of single. So the correct structure is (OOCCH2) and (CH2COOCH3) but connected via a double bond between the two central carbons. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that's asymmetric because one end is OOC- and the other is COOCH3? Wait no, both are methyl esters. The first COOH becomes OOCCH3? No, the first COOH is replaced by OOC- attached to the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm confused here. Let me think again. Each COOH group is converted to COOCH3. So the two ends are both OOCCH3? No, the first carbon (the one attached to the first COOH) would have OOC- connected to it, but actually, the first carbon is part of the CH=CH group. Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is that the two ends are both ester groups. The molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). So the left and right ends are OOCCH3 and COOCH3, but since both are methyl esters, they are the same. Wait, the left end is OOC- attached to the first carbon, but actually, the first carbon is part of the double bond. Wait, maybe I should consider that the molecule is symmetric. Let me check: in fumaric acid, the two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). So when both are esterified with methyl, the molecule becomes (OOCCH3)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that would have different groups on each end. Wait, no, the two COOH groups are both converted to the same ester. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would mean the first COOH becomes OOC- (still a carboxylate?), but no, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH with -OCH3. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. Therefore, the molecule is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3? No, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the first COOH as OOC- attached to the first carbon (which is connected to the double bond). The fourth carbon (the other end) has COOCH3. So the molecule is not symmetrical because one end is OOC- and the other is COOCH3. Wait, no, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester. Wait, the first carbon (connected to the first COOH group) would have its COOH replaced by COOCH3. So the first carbon is connected to the double bond and has a COOCH3 group. The fourth carbon (the other end) also has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is (COOCH2) but with the double bond. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think of it as:\n\nThe molecule has the structure: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, but if both ends are the same, then it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 would not be symmetric unless the two ends are identical. Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have a methyl ester group. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the two ends are both COOCH3 groups. Wait, that's right! Because the first and fourth carbons each have their COOH groups converted to COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the first carbon (connected to the first COOCH3) and the fourth carbon (connected to the second COOCH3). The molecule is symmetric because the two ends are mirror images. Wait, actually, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. For example, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon has a COOCH3 group, and the fourth has the same. The structure is symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, maybe there is a chiral center? Wait, the double bond is in the middle, and the groups on each side are the same. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. But the question is about optical isomerism. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound if there are chiral centers but they are arranged symmetrically. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has chiral centers but they are symmetric. Wait, the double bond in fumarate is trans, so the molecule can't rotate around the double bond. But does the molecule have any chiral carbons? Let's look at each carbon. The first carbon (attached to the first COOCH3) is connected to:\n\n- The COOCH3 group\n- The double bond to carbon 2\n- A hydrogen? Wait, the first carbon is part of the chain: the first carbon is connected to the double bond (so it's a CH2 group?), no. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Let me clarify each carbon's connections.\n\nCarbon 1: connected to O (from the COOCH3 group), two single bonds (one to carbon 2 and one to a hydrogen?), and the double bond? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 1 is part of the carboxylate group. Let me better consider the structure as:\n\nThe molecule is (CH2(COOCH3)) but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps I need to think of each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: attached to the COOCH3 group, a single bond to carbon 2, and two hydrogens? No. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:\n\nThe molecule has four carbons in a row. The first carbon (C1) has a COOCH3 group, connected via a single bond to C2. C2 is double-bonded to C3. C3 is single-bonded to C4, which has the other COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would mean the double bond is between C2 and C3. Then the structure would be:\n\nC1: COOCH3-CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since fumarate is a trans isomer, and when converted to dimethyl ester, does it have a chiral center?\n\nWait, in fumaric acid (the trans isomer), there are no chiral centers because the molecule is symmetrical. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, giving a symmetrical structure. Therefore, when esterified, the resulting dimethyl fumarate would also be symmetrical and not have chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. However, if the molecule were the cis isomer (maleic acid), then it would have chiral centers if the groups are arranged asymmetrically. But fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's not chiral. Therefore, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the case of maleic acid (the cis isomer of butenedioic acid), when esterified, the molecule would have two chiral centers? Or is that not the case? Let's see: maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH (cis). The double bond allows for cis/trans isomerism. But in the trans form (fumaric acid), the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans) would not have any chiral centers. So option 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\nNow, moving back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me try to analyze this again. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'). The 6 and 6' positions (on each ring) have nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups that are esterified with methyl groups. \n\nSo each benzene ring has:\n\n- At position 1: connected to the other ring (so part of the biphenyl structure)\n- At position 2: part of the dicarboxylate, which is esterified. So position 2 has a -OOCCH3 group (since it's a carboxylate ester).\n- At position 6: a nitro group (NO2).\n\nThe other positions (3,4,5 on each ring) would have hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or an axis of chirality. Let me consider the biphenyl's configuration. Biphenyls can have different conformations, such as the s-cis or s-trans, but those are conformational isomers, not stereoisomers. However, in this case, the substituents (nitro at 6 and ester at 2) are on each ring. Let me see the positions:\n\nIn biphenyl numbering, the positions are such that the two connected carbons are 1 and 1'. The numbering proceeds around each ring. So for each ring, position 1 is the one connected to the other ring. The 6 position on each ring would be three carbons away from the 1 position. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. \n\nThe key is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize it. Suppose the two rings are in a staggered conformation. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions, which are opposite to the 2 positions. Since the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are diametrically opposite each other (since in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite, 2 and 5, 3 and 6). Wait, maybe not exactly, but let me think. \n\nWait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged such that each is 60 degrees apart. Position 1 is connected to the other ring. Position 2 is next to it. Position 6 would be three positions away from 1, so opposite to position 4? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are placed such that the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the two rings have substituents at positions 2 and 6 in a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical. Let's suppose that each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and these are placed symmetrically. Then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. However, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then there might be no plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. \n\nAlternatively, the biphenyl might have a chiral axis. If the molecule is not symmetric, then rotating one ring relative to the other could create a non-superimposable mirror image. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations called atropisomers, which are stereoisomers due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. However, atropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism but not due to chiral centers. However, optical isomerism (enantiomers) specifically requires chiral centers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center. Looking at the substituents on each ring: the positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me check each carbon in the molecule for chirality. The nitro groups are on the 6 positions, and the esters on the 2 positions. The carbons at positions 2 and 6 on each ring are each attached to different substituents. Let me consider the carbon at position 2 on the first ring. It has:\n\n- The substituent from the ester group (the carboxylate ester, which is part of a larger group)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3)\n- The hydrogen? \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 on the first ring (which is part of the biphenyl's first ring) has:\n\n- The substituent at position 2 (the ester group, which is a -OOCCH3 group)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3 on the ring)\n- A hydrogen? \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's bonded to two adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3), the substituent (ester), and the fourth bond must be a hydrogen? No, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons, and two substituents (or hydrogens). Since position 2 has the ester group, one of its substituents is the ester, and the other is a hydrogen. Wait, but the ester group is a substituent taking one bond, so the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- Two bonds to the ring carbons (positions 1 and 3)\n- The ester group (-OOCCH3)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nThus, that carbon has four different groups? Wait, the two ring carbons are the same in terms of their connectivity, but each is part of the benzene ring. However, in terms of substituents, the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- The ester group (which is a large substituent)\n- Two adjacent ring carbons (each connected to other substituents)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nBut the two adjacent ring carbons (positions 1 and 3) may have different substituents. For example, position 1 is connected to the other ring, and position 3 may have a hydrogen (since position 6 is on the opposite side). \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the key is that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the biphenyl with substituents on 2 and 6. If the substituents are placed symmetrically on both rings, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on the 6 positions and the esters on 2, then rotating the molecule 180 degrees might superimpose it on its mirror image. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is such that there's no plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are placed in a way that when you flip the molecule, the nitro groups end up on the opposite side, making it non-superimposable. But I'm not sure. Since the question is about optical isomerism (enantiomers), which requires a chiral center, not just any stereoisomerism. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center at the ester group's carbon. Wait, the ester group is a carboxylate ester. The carboxylate group's carbon (the one attached to the oxygen) is part of the benzene ring? No, the carboxylate is attached to the benzene ring at position 2. The ester group would be: the benzene ring's carbon at position 2 is connected to an oxygen which is double-bonded to another oxygen and single-bonded to methyl. Wait, no. The structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', so the carboxylate ester would be: the benzene ring's carbon (position 2) is connected to an -O-C(=O)-OCH3 group. \n\nThe carbon in the ester group that is the central one (the carbonyl carbon) is part of the ester and has two oxygen groups and two other groups. That carbon is not a chiral center because it has a double bond to O, so it's bonded to O (double bond), another O (single bond to methyl), and two other groups (the benzene ring's carbon and the methyl). Wait, the carbonyl carbon (the C=O) is bonded to O (double bond), the methyl group (through the oxygen), and the benzene ring's carbon. So that's three bonds. The fourth must be a single bond to another oxygen? No, I think I'm getting confused here. The ester group structure is:\n\nThe benzene ring's carbon (position 2) is connected to an oxygen which is part of an ether linkage to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to the oxygen (from the benzene's ester group), another oxygen (as the double bond), and a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene's oxygen, the double-bonded oxygen, and the methyl group. That's three bonds. So that carbon can't be a chiral center. \n\nHmm, this is getting too detailed. Maybe the key is that option 1 has a chiral center? Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring creates a chiral molecule. Let me think of an example. Suppose the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring, and the esters on the 2 positions. If the molecule is not symmetric, then it could be chiral. For instance, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine that the two rings are arranged such that substituents on each are mirrored. For example, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and these are placed symmetrically across the biphenyl's axis. In that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, then it would be chiral. \n\nSince the question doesn't specify the configuration of the biphenyl (like whether it's s-cis or s-trans), but the molecule's name doesn't indicate any such configuration. The presence of substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring might lead to a lack of symmetry. Let me think of the positions again. \n\nIn a biphenyl, the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Let's number each ring from 1 to 6. On the first ring (left), position 1 is connected to the second ring. The substituents are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). On the second ring (right), position 1' is connected to the first ring, and substituents are at 2' (ester) and 6' (nitro). \n\nIf the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are on the same side (so that the nitro on the first ring's 6 is aligned with the nitro on the second ring's 6'), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, then it might not. Wait, but the positions are fixed. The numbering would ensure that the substituents are placed in a way that creates symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents around the biphenyl creates an asymmetric environment. Without a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. \n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure. Since I'm stuck on option 1, perhaps I should look at the answer options. The options given are:\n\nA) 1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2,3\n\nD)1,2\n\nEarlier analysis suggests that option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center (the carbon at position 2) so it does show optical isomerism. Option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is the trans isomer and lacks chiral centers, so no. Option 3 (benzophenone) is symmetric, no. Option 1 is unclear but if it's chiral, then it would be included. \n\nLooking at the options, if option 1 is chiral, then the answer could be A or D. If not, then D (1 and 2) would be incorrect. Wait, but if option 1 isn't chiral, then the correct answer would be D only if option 1 is not correct. Wait, the options are:\n\nA) 1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2,3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nSince I concluded that option 2 is correct (has chiral center), and 4 is not. So between options D and A. \n\nIf option 1 is not a chiral molecule, then D (1 and 2) would be incorrect because 1 is not. But if option 1 is chiral, then A would include 1,2,4 but 4 is not. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. Maybe the biphenyl has a chiral axis. \n\nWait, biphenyls can have atropisomers if rotation around the central bond is restricted. These are stereoisomers due to restricted rotation, but they are not enantiomers (optical isomers). Atropisomers can have optical activity if they are chiral. For example, if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. \n\nIn the case of the given compound (option 1), the substituents are placed such that there is no plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The positions 2 and 6 are not opposite each other in a way that creates symmetry. \n\nWait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are separated by three carbons. So position 2 is next to 1 and 3, and position 6 is opposite to position 3. Hmm, perhaps the arrangement on each ring creates asymmetry when combined. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule's overall structure might have no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. If that's the case, then option 1 would be a chiral molecule, exhibiting optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central axis of the biphenyl. Let me consider: if the substituents are placed symmetrically on each ring. For example, the nitro groups on 6 and esters on 2 on each ring are arranged such that flipping the molecule over the plane would superimpose them. In that case, the molecule is achiral. \n\nBut without more detailed analysis, it's hard to tell. Given that the question is from an exam, perhaps the intended answer is that option 1 does not have optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be D (options 1 and 2). Wait, but earlier I thought option 2 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me recheck option 4 again. \n\nDimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the trans isomer. When esterified, does it have a chiral center? \n\nWait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nWhen converted to dimethyl fumarate, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). Wait, but that's asymmetric. The left end is OOCCH3 and the right end is COOCH3? No, both ends are methyl esters. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the first carbon (position 1) has the COOCH3 group, and the fourth carbon (position 4) also has COOCH3. The double bond is between 2 and 3. So the molecule is symmetric because both ends have the same groups. \n\nThe molecule would be symmetric along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, there's a plane of symmetry, so no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the only compounds showing optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) and option 1 if it's chiral. \n\nWait, but I'm still not sure about option 1. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question asks which show optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers. \n\nOption 1: the molecule has two nitro groups on the 6 positions and two ester groups on the 2 positions of the biphenyl. \n\nIf the biphenyl is in a conformation where the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it would have a chiral axis. Wait, but optical isomerism via a chiral axis is different. Atropisomers can have optical activity if they are chiral. However, the presence of a chiral axis can lead to enantiomers if there's no symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a chiral center somewhere. For instance, the carbon at position 2 of one of the rings. Let me think of the carbon at position 2 on the first ring. \n\nThe carbon at position 2 is part of the benzene ring, so it's bonded to two adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3). The substituent at position 2 is the ester group (OOCCH3). The fourth bond is a hydrogen. \n\nNow, the adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3) have different substituents. \n\nPosition 1 is connected to the other ring (so that carbon has a substituent from the other ring), while position 3 may have a hydrogen (since position 6 has a nitro group, which is three positions away). \n\nTherefore, the carbon at position 2 has four different groups: \n\n- The ester group (OOCCH3)\n- The carbon at position 1 (connected to the other ring's substituents)\n- The carbon at position 3 (which may have a hydrogen or other groups)\n- A hydrogen. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 3: \n\nPosition 3 on the first ring is adjacent to position 2 and 4. Position 4 would have a hydrogen unless there's another substituent. Since the only substituents on the first ring are at 2 and 6, position 3 has a hydrogen. \n\nSo the carbon at position 2 has:\n\n- Two adjacent ring carbons (positions 1 and 3), but position 1 has the other ring attached (so its substituents include the other ring's groups?), while position 3 has a hydrogen. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 1 of the first ring is connected to the other ring's position 1'. The substituents on position 1 (of the first ring) would be: \n\n- The connection to the second ring (so the substituent there includes the second ring's structure)\n- The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6? No, in the first ring, position 1 is between position 6 and 2. \n\nWait, the first ring's position 1 is connected to position 2 and position 6 (since it's a benzene ring). \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Perhaps the key is that the molecule lacks a chiral center but has a chiral axis, leading to optical isomerism. In that case, option 1 would show optical isomerism as atropisomers. \n\nAtropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism due to restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to different configurations that can be chiral. If the molecule has a chiral axis (like the biphenyl's central bond), and the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule can have enantiomers. \n\nIn the case of option 1, the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the arrangement is such that rotating the two rings relative to each other creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then there are atropisomers. These can have optical activity. \n\nTherefore, option 1 would show optical isomerism via atropisomerism. \n\nSo, in that case, option 1 and 2 would both show optical isomerism, so the answer would be D (1 and 2). \n\nWait, but I need to confirm whether the substituents would allow for such a chiral axis. \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed such that there's no symmetry, then rotating the two rings would lead to different configurations. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl's plane and the esters are on the opposite side, then rotating one ring would give a different configuration. \n\nTherefore, the molecule can have two enantiomeric forms due to the restricted rotation, making them optical isomers. \n\nTherefore, option 1 does show optical isomerism. \n\nSo then the correct options are 1 and 2. That would be answer D. \n\nWait, but what about option 4? Earlier I thought it was symmetric, so no. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 1 and 2. \n\nBut let me double-check option 2 again. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (position 2) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That's a chiral center. So it definitely has optical isomerism. \n\nOption 1's case is more ambiguous, but if it has a chiral axis leading to atropisomerism, then it counts. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we analyze each option for chiral centers or other sources of chirality:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   This compound features a biphenyl core with nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2. The arrangement of substituents may lack symmetry due to restricted rotation around the central bond between the biphenyl rings, creating **atropisomers**. Atropisomers are stereoisomers with optical activity due to a chiral axis. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   The central carbon (position 2) has four distinct substituents: a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen, and a carboxylate ester group. This carbon is a **chiral center**, leading to optical isomerism.\n\n3. **benzophenone**:  \n   The molecule is symmetrical around its central carbonyl group, with identical phenyl groups on either side. It lacks a chiral center or asymmetry, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. The esterified form retains the trans configuration, resulting in a symmetrical molecule with no chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThe compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**, corresponding to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",
