      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x for a spin-half particle in the state 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Hmm, let's start by recalling how expectation values work for operators in quantum mechanics. The expectation value \u27e8A\u27e9 of an operator A is calculated by taking the inner product of the state vector with A applied to the state vector.\n\nFirst, the given state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9. I should check if this is normalized. Let me see: the coefficients squared should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1.0. Okay, so it's normalized. That's good.\n\nThe operator in question is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. To find the expectation value, I need to compute \u27e8\u03c8|(10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x)|\u03c8\u27e9. Since expectation values are linear, this can be split into 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. So I can compute the expectation of \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x separately, then combine them.\n\nLet's start with \u03c3_z. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, their expectation values are straightforward. The eigenvalue for |\u2191\u27e9 is +1 and for |\u2193\u27e9 is -1. \n\nThe expectation of \u03c3_z in state \u03c8 would be:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5^2)(+1) + ( (\u221a3/2)^2 )(-1) + cross terms? Wait, no. Wait, actually, since \u03c3_z acts on |\u2191\u27e9 to give +1|\u2191\u27e9 and on |\u2193\u27e9 to give -1|\u2193\u27e9, so when we compute the expectation value, the cross terms would involve the off-diagonal elements. Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully.\n\nExpanding \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nLet me write \u03c8 as a column vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is the first basis vector and |\u2193\u27e9 the second, \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. The dual vector \u27e8\u03c8| would be the conjugate transpose, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] (since coefficients are real here).\n\nThe \u03c3_z matrix in the standard basis is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So applying \u03c3_z to |\u03c8\u27e9 gives [0.5*1, (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)]^T. Then \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] with [0.5, -sqrt(3)/2]^T.\n\nCalculating that: 0.5*0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2) \n\nFirst term is 0.25. Second term: sqrt(3)/2 times -sqrt(3)/2 is -(3/4). So 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. \n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check that again. Because the coefficients squared times their eigenvalues:\n\nThe probability of measuring +1 (spin up) is (0.5)^2 =0.25, so contributes 0.25*(+1). The probability of -1 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =0.75, so contributes 0.75*(-1). Adding them gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Yes, that's correct. So that's the expectation of \u03c3_z. \n\nNow for \u03c3_x. Hmm, \u03c3_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, we need to compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9. The state |\u03c8\u27e9 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Multiplying by \u03c3_x matrix:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T. \n\nThen, \u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the inner product is:\n\n0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 \n\nWhich is (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) \n\nAdding those terms gives two times (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866...\n\nWait, let me compute that again. \n\nThe first term: 0.5 multiplied by sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3)/4). The second term: sqrt(3)/2 multiplied by 0.5 is also (sqrt(3)/4). So adding them gives sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the expectation formula. \n\nAlternatively, since \u03c3_x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]], then the expectation is the sum over i,j of \u03c8_i*(\u03c3_x)_{i,j} \u03c8_j. So:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = (0.5)(0)(0.5) + (0.5)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0)(sqrt(3)/2). \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst term: \u03c8_up* \u03c3_x_{11} * \u03c8_up \u2192 0.5 *0 *0.5 =0\n\nSecond term: \u03c8_up * \u03c3_x_{12} * \u03c8_down \u21920.5 *1 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4)\n\nThird term: \u03c8_down * \u03c3_x_{21} * \u03c8_up \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*1 *0.5 = sqrt(3)/4\n\nFourth term: \u03c8_down * \u03c3_x_{22} * \u03c8_down \u2192 (sqrt(3)/2)*0*(sqrt(3)/2) =0 \n\nAdding the second and third terms gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. Yep, same as before. So that's correct. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is:\n\n10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 10*(-0.5) = -5.0\n\nSecond term: 5*(sqrt(3)/2) \u2192 sqrt(3) is approx 1.732, so 5*(1.732)/2 = (5*1.732)/2. Let me calculate 5*1.732 =8.66, divided by 2 gives 4.33. \n\nSo total expectation value: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is -0.7. \n\nWait but let me check again. Let me do the exact calculation without approximating sqrt(3):\n\nThe exact value is 10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2. \n\nsqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 5*1.732 =8.66. 8.66/2 =4.33. So -5 +4.33 is indeed -0.67, so -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C) -0.7. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the sign. The expectation of \u03c3_z was -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5. The \u03c3_x term is positive 4.33. So yes, total is -0.67. \n\nLooking at the options, C is -0.7. So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me see again. \n\nWait, the question says \"up to one decimal place\". So -0.67 would round to -0.7, correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the \u03c3_x calculation. Let me recheck that. \n\nThe state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. The \u03c3_x expectation is the inner product of \u03c8 with \u03c3_x \u03c8. \n\n\u03c3_x applied to \u03c8 gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. The inner product with \u03c8 (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). \n\nWait, that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation seems right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

So -5 +4.33 is indeed -0.67, so -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C) -0.7. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the sign. The expectation of \u03c3_z was -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5. The \u03c3_x term is positive 4.33. So yes, total is -0.67. \n\nLooking at the options, C is -0.7. So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me see again. \n\nWait, the question says \"up to one decimal place\". So -0.67 would round to -0.7, correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the \u03c3_x calculation. Let me recheck that. \n\nThe state is 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9.

The inner product with \u03c8 (which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). \n\nWait, that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, first I need to confirm if those coefficients are normalized. Let me check the modulus squared of each coefficient and add them up. The first coefficient is 0.5, so 0.5 squared is 0.25. The second term is (\u221a3)/2, so squaring that gives (3/4) = 0.75. Adding 0.25 + 0.75 gives exactly 1, so that's normalized. Good, so the state is properly normalized. \n\nNow, the operator given is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. The expectation value \u27e810\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x\u27e9 would be 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. So I need to find the expectation values of \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x separately, then multiply by the coefficients and add them up. \n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, that should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3_z are +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. \n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_z is calculated as follows:\n\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = (0.5)^2*(+1) + ( (\u221a3)/2 )^2*(-1) + cross terms? Wait no, wait, actually, no. Wait, the expectation value of an operator in a state |\u03c8\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8|O|\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3_z is diagonal in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis, the cross terms will vanish because \u03c3_z acting on |\u2193\u27e9 gives -|\u2193\u27e9, so when we take the inner product, the cross terms would involve terms like \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3_z|\u2193\u27e9 which is zero. Let me write this out properly.\n\nThe state |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The dual vector \u27e8\u03c8| is 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)*\u27e8\u2193|. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193|] * \u03c3_z [0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9]\n\nSince \u03c3_z acts on |\u2191\u27e9 gives +1|\u2191\u27e9, and on |\u2193\u27e9 gives -1|\u2193\u27e9. So applying \u03c3_z to the state:\n\n\u03c3_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5*(1)|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)*(-1)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThen, the inner product with \u27e8\u03c8|:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5\u27e8\u2191| [0.5|\u2191\u27e9 - (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9] + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| [0.5|\u2191\u27e9 - (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9]\n\nNow, the terms:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * 0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = 0.25*(1) since the inner product of same states is 1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5 * (-\u221a3/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5*(-\u221a3/2)*0 = 0 because \u2191 and \u2193 are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: (\u221a3/2)*0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = (\u221a3/2 * 0.5)*0 = 0.\n\nFourth term: (\u221a3/2)* (-\u221a3/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = ( (\u221a3)(-\u221a3) )/(2*2) *1. \n\nCalculating that: (\u221a3 * -\u221a3) is -3, so -3/(4). \n\nAdding all the terms: 0.25 + 0 +0 + (-3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Wait, that can't be right? Wait let me re-calculate.\n\nWait the fourth term:\n\nThe coefficient from the first bracket is (\u221a3/2) from \u27e8\u03c8|, and the coefficient from \u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 is (-\u221a3/2) for the |\u2193\u27e9 term. So when multiplied, (\u221a3/2)*( -\u221a3/2 ) = ( (\u221a3)(-\u221a3) )/(2*2) ) = (-3)/4. \n\nSo total \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is (0.25) + (-3/4) = (0.25 - 0.75) = -0.5. Wait so that's -0.5? Hmm, okay, that seems correct. \n\nWait but let me think again. Alternatively, since \u03c3_z in this basis is a diagonal matrix with +1 and -1. The expectation value can be calculated as the sum over |c_i|^2 eigenvalues. So for |\u2191\u27e9 component squared (0.5)^2 times +1, plus |\u2193\u27e9 component squared ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) times -1. \n\nSo that would be (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh right! That's a quicker way. So that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is indeed -0.5. \n\nOkay, so that part is done. Now onto \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. \n\nHmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli matrix for x, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis, \u03c3_x acting on |\u2191\u27e9 gives |\u2193\u27e9, and on |\u2193\u27e9 gives |\u2191\u27e9. So when calculating \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, we have to consider the off-diagonal terms. \n\nLet me write out the expectation value again:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193|]\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03c3_x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9 ) = 0.5 \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2) \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 \n\nBut \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9. So substituting:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9. \n\nNow, the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n[0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193|] * [0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| * 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 0.25 * \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 0.25 *0 =0.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (0.5 * \u221a3/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/4)*1 = \u221a3/4.\n\nThird term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/2 *0.5)* \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/4)*1 = \u221a3/4.\n\nFourth term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 ( (\u221a3)(\u221a3)/ (2*2) ) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nSo adding up all the terms: the second and third terms are each \u221a3/4, so total is \u221a3/4 + \u221a3/4 = (2*\u221a3)/4 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660...\n\nWait, so \u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so divided by 2 gives about 0.866. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. The expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(\u221a3/2). Let me compute each part:\n\n10*(-0.5) is -5. \n\n5*(\u221a3/2) is (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u22484.33. \n\nAdding them together: -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67. \n\nHmm, so that's approximately -0.67. But the options given are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85. \n\nWait, so -0.67 is closest to -0.7 (option C). But let me check my calculations again, maybe I made an error in the cross terms?\n\nWait let me recalculate \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 again. Wait when I did the calculation:\n\nThe first term was 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: yes, that's 0.25 * 0. \n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3/4. \n\nThird term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| times 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/2 * 0.5) = \u221a3/4. \n\nFourth term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3 *\u221a3)/ (2*2) = 3/4 but times \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 which is zero. So the cross terms only contribute \u221a3/4 + \u221a3/4, which is \u221a3/2. That's correct. \n\nSo \u221a3/2 is approximately 0.866, so 5*(\u221a3/2) is 5*(0.866) \u22484.33. Then 10*(-0.5) is -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7. So the answer should be option C) -0.7. \n\nWait but let me check if I messed up the operator. The operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. Yes. And the expectation is 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once again the \u03c3_z expectation was indeed -0.5. \n\nYes, because (0.5)^2*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options: C is -0.7. So that's the right one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of \u221a3/2? Let me compute it more precisely. \n\n\u221a3 is approximately 1.73205. So \u221a3/2 is 0.866025. So 5*(0.866025) =4.330125. \n\nThen 10*(-0.5) = -5. \n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. Exactly. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait the options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85. So yes, C is correct. \n\nHmm, okay, that seems solid. I think that's the right approach. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So the answer is C.\n",

So when calculating \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, we have to consider the off-diagonal terms. \n\nLet me write out the expectation value again:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| is [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193|]\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03c3_x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2193\u27e9 ) = 0.5 \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2) \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 \n\nBut \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2193\u27e9, and \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9. So substituting:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9. \n\nNow, the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n[0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193|] * [0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| * 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 0.25 * \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 0.25 *0 =0.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (0.5 * \u221a3/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/4)*1 = \u221a3/4.\n\nThird term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/2 *0.5)* \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/4)*1 = \u221a3/4.\n\nFourth term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 ( (\u221a3)(\u221a3)/ (2*2) ) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nSo adding up all the terms: the second and third terms are each \u221a3/4, so total is \u221a3/4 + \u221a3/4 = (2*\u221a3)/4 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660...\n\nWait, so \u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so divided by 2 gives about 0.866. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 \u2248 0.866. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. The expectation value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(\u221a3/2). Let me compute each part:\n\n10*(-0.5) is -5. \n\n5*(\u221a3/2) is (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 \u22484.33. \n\nAdding them together: -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67. \n\nHmm, so that's approximately -0.67. But the options given are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85. \n\nWait, so -0.67 is closest to -0.7 (option C). But let me check my calculations again, maybe I made an error in the cross terms?\n\nWait let me recalculate \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 again. Wait when I did the calculation:\n\nThe first term was 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: yes, that's 0.25 * 0. \n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (0.5)*(\u221a3/2) = \u221a3/4. \n\nThird term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| times 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3/2 * 0.5) = \u221a3/4. \n\nFourth term: (\u221a3/2)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u221a3/2)|\u2191\u27e9 \u2192 (\u221a3 *\u221a3)/ (2*2) = 3/4 but times \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 which is zero. So the cross terms only contribute \u221a3/4 + \u221a3/4, which is \u221a3/2. That's correct. \n\nSo \u221a3/2 is approximately 0.866, so 5*(\u221a3/2) is 5*(0.866) \u22484.33. Then 10*(-0.5) is -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7. So the answer should be option C) -0.7. \n\nWait but let me check if I messed up the operator. The operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. Yes. And the expectation is 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once again the \u03c3_z expectation was indeed -0.5. \n\nYes, because (0.5)^2*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options: C is -0.7. So that's the right one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of \u221a3/2? Let me compute it more precisely. \n\n\u221a3 is approximately 1.73205. So \u221a3/2 is 0.866025. So 5*(0.866025) =4.330125. \n\nThen 10*(-0.5) = -5. \n\nAdding them: -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. Exactly. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait the options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85. So yes, C is correct. \n\nHmm, okay, that seems solid. I think that's the right approach. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo find the expectation value of the operator \\(10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x\\) for the given state \\(|\\psi\\rangle = 0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle\\), we first compute the expectation values of \\(\\sigma_z\\) and \\(\\sigma_x\\) separately.\n\n**Expectation value of \\(\\sigma_z\\):**\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\(\\sigma_z\\) are \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) for \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\downarrow\\rangle\\), respectively.
