      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. So the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down each piece of data provided.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The user mentioned a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around 3000-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9 are usually indicative of O-H stretching vibrations, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but here the peak is at 3000. That might be a bit lower than the typical broad O-H peak, which is usually around 3200-3600. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. The broad peak is mentioned as very broad, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid's O-H (around 3200-3500) or an alcohol (around 3400-3600). But the exact value given is 3000, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe I should check other peaks first.\n\nThe other two strong absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. The 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak is a common carbonyl group (C=O) like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C double bond (like in alkenes, around 1600-1680) or maybe the conjugated carbonyl in something like an enol or an aromatic ring? Wait, but in carboxylic acids, the C=O is at 1700, and the COOH group would have that O-H at a higher wavenumber. Wait, maybe if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1700 is the C=O, and the 1650 could be the C-O-H bending? Or maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated system?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a C=C group. For instance, in a ketone or ester with a double bond nearby. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring? But aromatic rings typically have peaks around 1600 and 1500, so maybe that's possible. Wait, but if there's a peak at 1650 and another at 1700, perhaps it's a conjugated system like in an ester or an amide? Hmm.\n\nMoving on to the 1H NMR spectrum: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogens on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So that suggests there's a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- or CH2=CH-CH2- etc.) in the structure. The presence of vinyl hydrogens implies an alkene group, so there's a C=C double bond present in the molecule.\n\nNow, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about possible fragments that would give m/z 45. Common fragments for m/z 45 could be the formyl group (CHO, which is 12+1+16=29? Wait, no. Wait, formyl is CH2O? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me calculate: CHO would be 12 (C) + 1 (H) + 16 (O) = 29? Wait, that's not right. Wait, formyl group is CH2O? No, formyl is -CHO. So the molecular formula is CH2O, which would be 12+2+16=30? Wait, no. Wait, C is 12, H is 1 each, O is 16. So for CHO, that's 12 (C) + 2 (H) + 16 (O) = 30? So that's 30. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45. Maybe another possibility: maybe the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO) which would be 43 (C2H3O?), but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a different fragment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. The COOH group would be 45: C=12*2, O=16*2, H=2. So 24 + 32 + 2 = 58? Wait, no. Wait, COOH is C2H2O2, so 12*2=24, 2*1=2, 16*2=32. Total is 24+2+32=58. Hmm, not 45. Maybe the fragment is something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group? Like CH3CO would be 43, but again not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl ester (CH3O) which would be 12 + 3 + 16 + 1 = 32? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a different part of the molecule. Let me think again. Let's see, m/z 45. The molecular weight of the fragment is 45. Let's see: possible fragments could be:\n\n- The COOH group (carboxylic acid) is 45? Let me recalculate. COOH: molecular formula is C2H2O2. So 2(12) + 2(1) + 2(16) = 24 +2 +32=58. No, that's 58. Not 45. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a carbonyl group plus something else. Wait, maybe a formate group (HCOO-) would be 45? Wait, HCOO is HCOO- (but the mass would be 12 + 1 + 16*2 = 45? Let me check: H is 1, C is 12, O is 16*2. 1+12=13, 13+32=45. Oh, that's right! So the formate anion (HCOO\u207b) has a molecular weight of 45. So if the fragment is the formate group, that would make sense. So maybe the compound has a formate group, like in an ester or a carboxylic acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from an aldehyde group (CHO) but that's 29. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone with some other groups. Let's think of another possibility. Wait, maybe the fragment is from a vinyl group? Like CH2=CH2 would be 28, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe an acrylate group? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the fragment is the COOH group minus a water molecule? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the parent ion is something else. Wait, the fragment at m/z 45 could be a significant clue. So if the fragment is 45, that's formate (HCOO-), which suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Because formate is part of that.\n\nPutting this together with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 (maybe a typo? Or perhaps I misread the number). Wait, the user says \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\". Wait, O-H stretching in carboxylic acid is around 3200-3500. So maybe the 3000 is actually a typo, but the question says exactly 3000. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol? But alcohols are also around 3200-3600. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine? But amine N-H is around 3300-3500. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 peak is not O-H but something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is actually a stretching peak of something else. Wait, maybe the O-H is at a higher wavenumber, but maybe the 3000 is part of an alkyl group. Wait, but the vinyl hydrogens are mentioned in the NMR, so maybe the 3000 is part of a C-H stretch. Wait, but the vinyl hydrogens would be around 5-6 ppm in NMR, but in IR, the C-H stretching for alkanes is around 2800-3000. So maybe the broad peak is not O-H but an O-H, but that would need to be higher. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake, but the question states 3000. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is actually the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, but just at a lower wavenumber. Maybe in some cases, the O-H stretch can be a bit lower? Not sure, but maybe I should consider that the presence of a carboxylic acid group is indicated here. Because the fragment at 45 (HCOO-) would come from a carboxylic acid group. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) because when it breaks, a fragment of HCOO (45) would form.\n\nSo, putting that together, the compound has a carboxylic acid group (since the fragment is 45, and the O-H in FTIR). The FTIR also shows peaks at 1700 (C=O of the carboxylic acid) and 1650. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the C=O is at ~1700, and the O-H is around 3200-3600. The 1650 peak could be the C=C stretching if there's an alkene present (since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens). So the molecule has both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. That would mean the formula must account for both.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) C6H12O2\n\nB) C6H10O\n\nC) C6H10O2\n\nD) C6H12O\n\nSo, if the compound has a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH (two oxygens), and an alkene (which reduces the number of hydrogens by 2 compared to the corresponding alkane). Let me think of the degrees of unsaturation.\n\nDegrees of unsaturation are calculated as:\n\nUnsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nAssuming no halogens or nitrogen here. Let's compute for each option.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the compound must contain. Since there's a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH (two oxygens), and an alkene (C=C), so that's two degrees of unsaturation (one from the double bond, one from the carboxylic acid's C=O, but wait, carboxylic acid has a C=O, which counts as one degree, but the COOH also has an -OH which doesn't contribute. Wait, degrees of unsaturation count each double bond or ring as one, each triple bond as one, and each ring as one. For oxygen, the formula is adjusted by adding O into the equation.\n\nWait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nBut since oxygen doesn't affect the calculation (because it's already accounted for in the formula by considering that each O is part of the molecule but doesn't add H), so we can ignore O here.\n\nWait, actually the formula is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nSo for each compound:\n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: C6H12O2\n\nC=6, H=12, O=2. Ignoring O for the calculation:\n\nDegrees = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (12+2-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1 degree of unsaturation? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nWait, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So 1 degree.\n\nBut the compound has a carboxylic acid (which is a C=O, so that's 1 degree), and an alkene (another degree), so total would be 2 degrees. But this would require 2 degrees of unsaturation. But the calculation for option A gives only 1. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H)/2 when there are no halogens or nitrogen. Because O is ignored here.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nEach degree of unsaturation is equivalent to a double bond or ring. Each degree subtracts 2 H from the maximum.\n\nThe maximum number of H is 2C+2. So the number of hydrogens less than that divided by 2 gives the degrees.\n\nSo for a molecule with formula CxHyOz, the degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H)/2. Because O is considered as part of the molecule but doesn't add or subtract H (since it's part of functional groups like -OH, -COOH, etc., which have H's accounted for in the formula).\n\nSo for option A (C6H12O2):\n\nDegrees = (12 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree.\n\nBut the compound has a carboxylic acid (C=O: 1 degree) and an alkene (another degree) so total 2. So that's conflicting. So option A can't be correct.\n\nOption B: C6H10O\n\nDegrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 =4/2=2. So 2 degrees. That matches the required 2 (carboxylic acid C=O and alkene). But let's check the oxygen count. The compound has an O, so maybe it's an ester or something else. Wait, but we thought it's a carboxylic acid (which has two O's). Wait, the formula here has only one O. So that's conflicting. Because a carboxylic acid has two O's (COOH). So if the compound has a carboxylic acid, the formula must have at least two O's. So option B has only one O, so that can't be a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's another group?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a ketone (which has one O) plus an alkene? Then the O would be from the ketone. But the mass fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid. Hmm. So maybe option B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: C6H10O2.\n\nDegrees: (12+2 -10)/2 =4/2=2. So 2 degrees. Oxygens are 2. So that would fit a carboxylic acid (two O's) plus an alkene (one degree) and the C=O (another degree) so total 2 degrees. Wait, wait, the carboxylic acid gives one degree (from the C=O), and the alkene gives another. So total two. That matches the calculation. So this formula could work.\n\nOption D: C6H12O.\n\nDegrees: (12+2-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So 1 degree. So if it had a carboxylic acid (needs two O's?), but here O is 1. So that can't be.\n\nSo based on the degrees of unsaturation, the correct formula must be either C (C6H10O2) or B (but B has only one O which can't form a carboxylic acid). So option C is the candidate.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's see: The NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, which implies an alkene group. The FTIR has a C=O at 1700 and C=C at 1650? Wait, the 1650 could be the alkene's C=C stretch. The C=C stretch is typically around 1600-1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, so that's possible. The 1700 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid. So that fits.\n\nSo the compound has a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. So the formula must have two O's (from the COOH) and the hydrogens account for the alkene and the double bond.\n\nLet me check the molecular formula for a carboxylic acid with an alkene. Let's think of a structure like CH2=CHCH2COOH. That would be C5H8O2. But we need C6. Let's see: maybe something like CH2=CH(CH2)2COOH? That would be C6H10O2. Exactly option C. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.\n\nWait, let me count the hydrogens in that structure. Let's say the compound is hex-2-enoic acid. Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. Let's count H:\n\nThe double bond: each CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would have 2 H each. Wait, the structure would be:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nC: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nHex-2-enoic acid would be:\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. Let's count H:\n\nThe double bond between C2 and C3. So:\n\nC1: CH2- (2 H)\nC2: CH- (attached to the double bond, so 1 H here? Wait, no. Wait, in the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH:\n\nWait, actually, the first two carbons are CH2=CH- so each has two H? Wait, no. The double bond between C1 and C2:\n\nC1: CH2= (so two H on C1)\nC2: CH- (since it's double-bonded to C1, so only one H here)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nLet me write it as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nC1: CH2- (so two H on C1)\nC2: CH- (since it's double-bonded to C1, so only one H on C2)\nC3: CH2- (two H)\nC4: CH2- (two H)\nC5: COOH (the COOH group has two O's and the -OH gives H. The COOH group is -COOH, which is -C(O)OH. So the carbon here (C5) is connected to the C4 (CH2-) and has the COOH group. The COOH has two O's and the H from the -OH.\n\nSo total H:\n\nC1: 2 H\n\nC2: 1 H (since double bond, so only one H left)\n\nC3: 2 H\n\nC4: 2 H\n\nC5: The COOH group has two oxygens. The COOH's carbonyl is C=O, so the C5 (the one with the COOH) has no H attached (since it's bonded to the carbonyl O and the O of the -OH, plus the CH2 from C4). Wait, let me see:\n\nThe COOH group is -COOH. The carbon in the COOH (the one attached to the rest of the chain) has two bonds: one to the previous CH2, one to the carbonyl O, and one to the -OH group. So that carbon has no H attached. So the H in COOH come from the -OH (one H) and the carbonyl doesn't contribute. Wait, actually the COOH has the -OH (so one H there) plus the carbonyl is double bond, so no H there. The other part is the CH2-CH2- part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's count all H:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH\n\nBreaking down each part:\n\nThe double bond between C1 and C2: each has 2 and 1 H.\n\nWait, maybe better to count all H:\n\nCH2=CH (the first two carbons) contributes 2 + 1 = 3 H (since the double bond takes away two H's from each? Wait, maybe better to think each CH2 group has two H, but in the double bond:\n\nThe first carbon (C1) is CH2= so it has two H attached.\n\nThe second carbon (C2) is =CH- so it has one H attached (since one bond is double bond, so two bonds left: one to C1, one to the next CH2 group).\n\nThen C3 is CH2- (two H)\n\nC4 is CH2- (two H)\n\nC5 is the COOH group: the carbonyl (C=O) and the -OH. The carbon in the COOH (C5) has no H attached. The -OH contributes one H. So total H from COOH: 1 H (from the -OH).\n\nNow, adding all H:\n\nC1:2, C2:1, C3:2, C4:2, C5:0 (except the -OH's H). Plus the H from the -OH (1). Also, the COOH group has the O's but no other H except the -OH.\n\nWait, the COOH group is -COOH, which is:\n\n- The carbon (C5) is bonded to:\n\n- The previous CH2 (C4)\n\n- The carbonyl O (double bond)\n\n- The -OH group (single bond)\n\n- And the other side is the second O in the COOH? Wait, no. The COOH is -C(O)OH. So the carbon (C5) has bonds: one to C4, one double bond to O, one single bond to O (which has an OH group). So that's four bonds. Therefore, no H on that carbon. The -OH has one H. So total H from COOH is 1.\n\nSo total H:\n\nC1:2 + C2:1 + C3:2 + C4:2 + C5:0 (except the -OH's H) \u2192 2+1+2+2 =7, plus the H from -OH (1) \u2192 total 8? Wait, but the formula would be C6H8O2? Wait that can't be right. Wait maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the molecular formula for hex-2-enoic acid. The general formula for an enoic acid (carboxylic acid with a double bond) would be CnH2n-1O2? Wait, let's see for n=6:\n\nThe general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2 (if it's a straight-chain without any double bonds). Adding a double bond reduces two H, so it becomes C6H10O2. Exactly option C. So that's correct. So the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), which has 10 H.\n\nSo that matches. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose the compound is an ester. For example, an ester would have a structure RCOOR', which would have one O (from the ester group) and another O from the alcohol part? Wait, no, the ester has two O's (the carbonyl and the ester oxygen). Wait, an ester group is -COOR, so the formula would have two O's (one from the carbonyl and one from the ester oxygen). But in that case, the O count would still be two. So if it's an ester with an alkene, but the mass fragment at m/z 45 is formate (HCOO-), which is part of a carboxylic acid. So an ester wouldn't give that fragment. Because the ester's fragment would be different. So the presence of the fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThus, the compound is a carboxylic acid with an alkene, which would have the formula C6H10O2 (option C).\n\nThe FTIR has the O-H at 3000 (though that seems a bit low, but perhaps acceptable), the carbonyl at 1700, and the alkene at 1650. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (so the alkene is present), and the mass spec fragment at 45 (formate) indicating a carboxylic acid. The degrees of unsaturation for option C gives 2, which matches the two (alkene and C=O). So that's correct.\n\nThe other options: option A is C6H12O2 which would have one degree of unsaturation. So maybe a cyclohexane carboxylic acid? But then there's no alkene. Option B has only one O, so can't have a carboxylic acid. Option D has only one O and one degree, which would not have both groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) C6H10O2.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe FTIR spectrum indicates a broad peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, likely due to an O-H group (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl group at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a C=C double bond at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9. The 1H NMR confirms vinyl hydrogens, supporting the presence of an alkene.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. So the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down each piece of data provided.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The user mentioned a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around 3000-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9 are usually indicative of O-H stretching vibrations, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but here the peak is at 3000. That might be a bit lower than the typical broad O-H peak, which is usually around 3200-3600. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. The broad peak is mentioned as very broad, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid's O-H (around 3200-3500) or an alcohol (around 3400-3600). But the exact value given is 3000, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe I should check other peaks first.\n\nThe other two strong absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. The 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak is a common carbonyl group (C=O) like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C double bond (like in alkenes, around 1600-1680) or maybe the conjugated carbonyl in something like an enol or an aromatic ring? Wait, but in carboxylic acids, the C=O is at 1700, and the COOH group would have that O-H at a higher wavenumber. Wait, maybe if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1700 is the C=O, and the 1650 could be the C-O-H bending? Or maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated system?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a C=C group. For instance, in a ketone or ester with a double bond nearby. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring? But aromatic rings typically have peaks around 1600 and 1500, so maybe that's possible. Wait, but if there's a peak at 1650 and another at 1700, perhaps it's a conjugated system like in an ester or an amide? Hmm.\n\nMoving on to the 1H NMR spectrum: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the hydrogens on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So that suggests there's a vinyl group (like CH2=CH- or CH2=CH-CH2- etc.) in the structure. The presence of vinyl hydrogens implies an alkene group, so there's a C=C double bond present in the molecule.\n\nNow, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about possible fragments that would give m/z 45. Common fragments for m/z 45 could be the formyl group (CHO, which is 12+1+16=29? Wait, no. Wait, formyl is CH2O? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me calculate: CHO would be 12 (C) + 1 (H) + 16 (O) = 29? Wait, that's not right. Wait, formyl group is CH2O? No, formyl is -CHO. So the molecular formula is CH2O, which would be 12+2+16=30? Wait, no. Wait, C is 12, H is 1 each, O is 16. So for CHO, that's 12 (C) + 2 (H) + 16 (O) = 30? So that's 30. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45. Maybe another possibility: maybe the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO) which would be 43 (C2H3O?), but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a different fragment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. The COOH group would be 45: C=12*2, O=16*2, H=2. So 24 + 32 + 2 = 58? Wait, no. Wait, COOH is C2H2O2, so 12*2=24, 2*1=2, 16*2=32. Total is 24+2+32=58. Hmm, not 45. Maybe the fragment is something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group? Like CH3CO would be 43, but again not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl ester (CH3O) which would be 12 + 3 + 16 + 1 = 32? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a different part of the molecule. Let me think again. Let's see, m/z 45. The molecular weight of the fragment is 45. Let's see: possible fragments could be:\n\n- The COOH group (carboxylic acid) is 45? Let me recalculate. COOH: molecular formula is C2H2O2. So 2(12) + 2(1) + 2(16) = 24 +2 +32=58. No, that's 58. Not 45. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a carbonyl group plus something else. Wait, maybe a formate group (HCOO-) would be 45? Wait, HCOO is HCOO- (but the mass would be 12 + 1 + 16*2 = 45? Let me check: H is 1, C is 12, O is 16*2. 1+12=13, 13+32=45. Oh, that's right! So the formate anion (HCOO\u207b) has a molecular weight of 45. So if the fragment is the formate group, that would make sense. So maybe the compound has a formate group, like in an ester or a carboxylic acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from an aldehyde group (CHO) but that's 29. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone with some other groups. Let's think of another possibility. Wait, maybe the fragment is from a vinyl group? Like CH2=CH2 would be 28, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe an acrylate group? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the fragment is the COOH group minus a water molecule? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the parent ion is something else. Wait, the fragment at m/z 45 could be a significant clue. So if the fragment is 45, that's formate (HCOO-), which suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Because formate is part of that.\n\nPutting this together with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 (maybe a typo? Or perhaps I misread the number). Wait, the user says \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\". Wait, O-H stretching in carboxylic acid is around 3200-3500. So maybe the 3000 is actually a typo, but the question says exactly 3000. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol? But alcohols are also around 3200-3600. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine? But amine N-H is around 3300-3500. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 peak is not O-H but something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is actually a stretching peak of something else. Wait, maybe the O-H is at a higher wavenumber, but maybe the 3000 is part of an alkyl group. Wait, but the vinyl hydrogens are mentioned in the NMR, so maybe the 3000 is part of a C-H stretch. Wait, but the vinyl hydrogens would be around 5-6 ppm in NMR, but in IR, the C-H stretching for alkanes is around 2800-3000. So maybe the broad peak is not O-H but an O-H, but that would need to be higher. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake, but the question states 3000. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is actually the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, but just at a lower wavenumber. Maybe in some cases, the O-H stretch can be a bit lower? Not sure, but maybe I should consider that the presence of a carboxylic acid group is indicated here. Because the fragment at 45 (HCOO-) would come from a carboxylic acid group. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) because when it breaks, a fragment of HCOO (45) would form.\n\nSo, putting that together, the compound has a carboxylic acid group (since the fragment is 45, and the O-H in FTIR). The FTIR also shows peaks at 1700 (C=O of the carboxylic acid) and 1650. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the C=O is at ~1700, and the O-H is around 3200-3600. The 1650 peak could be the C=C stretching if there's an alkene present (since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens). So the molecule has both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. That would mean the formula must account for both.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) C6H12O2\n\nB) C6H10O\n\nC) C6H10O2\n\nD) C6H12O\n\nSo, if the compound has a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH (two oxygens), and an alkene (which reduces the number of hydrogens by 2 compared to the corresponding alkane). Let me think of the degrees of unsaturation.\n\nDegrees of unsaturation are calculated as:\n\nUnsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nAssuming no halogens or nitrogen here. Let's compute for each option.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the compound must contain. Since there's a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH (two oxygens), and an alkene (C=C), so that's two degrees of unsaturation (one from the double bond, one from the carboxylic acid's C=O, but wait, carboxylic acid has a C=O, which counts as one degree, but the COOH also has an -OH which doesn't contribute. Wait, degrees of unsaturation count each double bond or ring as one, each triple bond as one, and each ring as one. For oxygen, the formula is adjusted by adding O into the equation.\n\nWait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nBut since oxygen doesn't affect the calculation (because it's already accounted for in the formula by considering that each O is part of the molecule but doesn't add H), so we can ignore O here.\n\nWait, actually the formula is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nSo for each compound:\n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: C6H12O2\n\nC=6, H=12, O=2. Ignoring O for the calculation:\n\nDegrees = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (12+2-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1 degree of unsaturation? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nWait, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So 1 degree.\n\nBut the compound has a carboxylic acid (which is a C=O, so that's 1 degree), and an alkene (another degree), so total would be 2 degrees. But this would require 2 degrees of unsaturation. But the calculation for option A gives only 1. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H)/2 when there are no halogens or nitrogen. Because O is ignored here.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nEach degree of unsaturation is equivalent to a double bond or ring. Each degree subtracts 2 H from the maximum.\n\nThe maximum number of H is 2C+2. So the number of hydrogens less than that divided by 2 gives the degrees.\n\nSo for a molecule with formula CxHyOz, the degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H)/2. Because O is considered as part of the molecule but doesn't add or subtract H (since it's part of functional groups like -OH, -COOH, etc., which have H's accounted for in the formula).\n\nSo for option A (C6H12O2):\n\nDegrees = (12 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree.\n\nBut the compound has a carboxylic acid (C=O: 1 degree) and an alkene (another degree) so total 2. So that's conflicting. So option A can't be correct.\n\nOption B: C6H10O\n\nDegrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 =4/2=2. So 2 degrees. That matches the required 2 (carboxylic acid C=O and alkene). But let's check the oxygen count. The compound has an O, so maybe it's an ester or something else. Wait, but we thought it's a carboxylic acid (which has two O's). Wait, the formula here has only one O. So that's conflicting. Because a carboxylic acid has two O's (COOH). So if the compound has a carboxylic acid, the formula must have at least two O's. So option B has only one O, so that can't be a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's another group?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a ketone (which has one O) plus an alkene? Then the O would be from the ketone. But the mass fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid. Hmm. So maybe option B is not the answer.\n\nOption C: C6H10O2.\n\nDegrees: (12+2 -10)/2 =4/2=2. So 2 degrees. Oxygens are 2. So that would fit a carboxylic acid (two O's) plus an alkene (one degree) and the C=O (another degree) so total 2 degrees. Wait, wait, the carboxylic acid gives one degree (from the C=O), and the alkene gives another. So total two. That matches the calculation. So this formula could work.\n\nOption D: C6H12O.\n\nDegrees: (12+2-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So 1 degree. So if it had a carboxylic acid (needs two O's?), but here O is 1. So that can't be.\n\nSo based on the degrees of unsaturation, the correct formula must be either C (C6H10O2) or B (but B has only one O which can't form a carboxylic acid). So option C is the candidate.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's see: The NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, which implies an alkene group. The FTIR has a C=O at 1700 and C=C at 1650? Wait, the 1650 could be the alkene's C=C stretch. The C=C stretch is typically around 1600-1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, so that's possible. The 1700 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid. So that fits.\n\nSo the compound has a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. So the formula must have two O's (from the COOH) and the hydrogens account for the alkene and the double bond.\n\nLet me check the molecular formula for a carboxylic acid with an alkene. Let's think of a structure like CH2=CHCH2COOH. That would be C5H8O2. But we need C6. Let's see: maybe something like CH2=CH(CH2)2COOH? That would be C6H10O2. Exactly option C. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.\n\nWait, let me count the hydrogens in that structure. Let's say the compound is hex-2-enoic acid. Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. Let's count H:\n\nThe double bond: each CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would have 2 H each. Wait, the structure would be:\n\nPositions: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nC: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nHex-2-enoic acid would be:\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, that's 6 carbons. Let's count H:\n\nThe double bond between C2 and C3. So:\n\nC1: CH2- (2 H)\nC2: CH- (attached to the double bond, so 1 H here? Wait, no. Wait, in the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH:\n\nWait, actually, the first two carbons are CH2=CH- so each has two H? Wait, no. The double bond between C1 and C2:\n\nC1: CH2= (so two H on C1)\nC2: CH- (since it's double-bonded to C1, so only one H here)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nLet me write it as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nC1: CH2- (so two H on C1)\nC2: CH- (since it's double-bonded to C1, so only one H on C2)\nC3: CH2- (two H)\nC4: CH2- (two H)\nC5: COOH (the COOH group has two O's and the -OH gives H. The COOH group is -COOH, which is -C(O)OH. So the carbon here (C5) is connected to the C4 (CH2-) and has the COOH group. The COOH has two O's and the H from the -OH.\n\nSo total H:\n\nC1: 2 H\n\nC2: 1 H (since double bond, so only one H left)\n\nC3: 2 H\n\nC4: 2 H\n\nC5: The COOH group has two oxygens. The COOH's carbonyl is C=O, so the C5 (the one with the COOH) has no H attached (since it's bonded to the carbonyl O and the O of the -OH, plus the CH2 from C4). Wait, let me see:\n\nThe COOH group is -COOH. The carbon in the COOH (the one attached to the rest of the chain) has two bonds: one to the previous CH2, one to the carbonyl O, and one to the -OH group. So that carbon has no H attached. So the H in COOH come from the -OH (one H) and the carbonyl doesn't contribute. Wait, actually the COOH has the -OH (so one H there) plus the carbonyl is double bond, so no H there. The other part is the CH2-CH2- part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's count all H:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH\n\nBreaking down each part:\n\nThe double bond between C1 and C2: each has 2 and 1 H.\n\nWait, maybe better to count all H:\n\nCH2=CH (the first two carbons) contributes 2 + 1 = 3 H (since the double bond takes away two H's from each? Wait, maybe better to think each CH2 group has two H, but in the double bond:\n\nThe first carbon (C1) is CH2= so it has two H attached.\n\nThe second carbon (C2) is =CH- so it has one H attached (since one bond is double bond, so two bonds left: one to C1, one to the next CH2 group).\n\nThen C3 is CH2- (two H)\n\nC4 is CH2- (two H)\n\nC5 is the COOH group: the carbonyl (C=O) and the -OH. The carbon in the COOH (C5) has no H attached. The -OH contributes one H. So total H from COOH: 1 H (from the -OH).\n\nNow, adding all H:\n\nC1:2, C2:1, C3:2, C4:2, C5:0 (except the -OH's H). Plus the H from the -OH (1). Also, the COOH group has the O's but no other H except the -OH.\n\nWait, the COOH group is -COOH, which is:\n\n- The carbon (C5) is bonded to:\n\n- The previous CH2 (C4)\n\n- The carbonyl O (double bond)\n\n- The -OH group (single bond)\n\n- And the other side is the second O in the COOH? Wait, no. The COOH is -C(O)OH. So the carbon (C5) has bonds: one to C4, one double bond to O, one single bond to O (which has an OH group). So that's four bonds. Therefore, no H on that carbon. The -OH has one H. So total H from COOH is 1.\n\nSo total H:\n\nC1:2 + C2:1 + C3:2 + C4:2 + C5:0 (except the -OH's H) \u2192 2+1+2+2 =7, plus the H from -OH (1) \u2192 total 8? Wait, but the formula would be C6H8O2? Wait that can't be right. Wait maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the molecular formula for hex-2-enoic acid. The general formula for an enoic acid (carboxylic acid with a double bond) would be CnH2n-1O2? Wait, let's see for n=6:\n\nThe general formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2 (if it's a straight-chain without any double bonds). Adding a double bond reduces two H, so it becomes C6H10O2. Exactly option C. So that's correct. So the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), which has 10 H.\n\nSo that matches. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose the compound is an ester. For example, an ester would have a structure RCOOR', which would have one O (from the ester group) and another O from the alcohol part? Wait, no, the ester has two O's (the carbonyl and the ester oxygen). Wait, an ester group is -COOR, so the formula would have two O's (one from the carbonyl and one from the ester oxygen). But in that case, the O count would still be two. So if it's an ester with an alkene, but the mass fragment at m/z 45 is formate (HCOO-), which is part of a carboxylic acid. So an ester wouldn't give that fragment. Because the ester's fragment would be different. So the presence of the fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThus, the compound is a carboxylic acid with an alkene, which would have the formula C6H10O2 (option C).\n\nThe FTIR has the O-H at 3000 (though that seems a bit low, but perhaps acceptable), the carbonyl at 1700, and the alkene at 1650. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (so the alkene is present), and the mass spec fragment at 45 (formate) indicating a carboxylic acid. The degrees of unsaturation for option C gives 2, which matches the two (alkene and C=O). So that's correct.\n\nThe other options: option A is C6H12O2 which would have one degree of unsaturation. So maybe a cyclohexane carboxylic acid? But then there's no alkene. Option B has only one O, so can't have a carboxylic acid. Option D has only one O and one degree, which would not have both groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) C6H10O2.\n\n\nThe FTIR spectrum indicates a broad peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, likely due to an O-H group (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl group at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a C=C double bond at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9. The 1H NMR confirms vinyl hydrogens, supporting the presence of an alkene. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45 suggests a carboxylic acid (HCOO\u207b fragment). \n\nCalculating degrees of unsaturation: \n- **C6H10O2** (Option C) yields (2\u00d76 + 2 \u2212 10)/2 = 2 degrees, matching one from the C=O (carboxylic acid) and one from the alkene. \n- Other options either lack sufficient oxygen (B, D) or incorrect degrees of unsaturation (A). \n\nThus, the compound is **C6H10O2**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the unknown compound has been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The question is asking for its chemical formula among the four options provided. Let me break down each piece of data given and see what they tell me.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak at around 3000 wavenumbers. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around 3200-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9 are usually from O-H bonds, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but here it's at 3000. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the ranges. Let me think again. Oh right, actually, the O-H stretch is indeed around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe the peak is a bit lower? Alternatively, maybe that's not O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 region is for other groups. Wait, maybe the broad peak here is actually a mistake? Or perhaps the question is correct. Let me see the other peaks. The other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. \n\nLooking at the 1700 region, that's typical for carbonyl groups (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C stretch (alkenes) or maybe the C=O in something like an amide, but amides have a different carbonyl stretch. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H bending around 1700? Or maybe that's the carbonyl. Wait, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H stretch. Since the O-H is mentioned as a broad peak, maybe that's from a carboxylic acid. So if there's a carboxylic acid group, that would account for the broad O-H peak at around 3000? Wait, no, the O-H in carboxylic acid is around 3200-3600. The 3000 might actually be from something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is not O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is part of the carboxylic acid structure. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 3000? Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 is the C=O in an amide, but then the carbonyl would be around 1650? Wait no, amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but the N-H bending might be elsewhere. Hmm, maybe this is a conjugated system. Let me think. The presence of both 1700 and 1650 peaks. If the 1700 is a carbonyl and 1650 is a C=C, that would suggest an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like a conjugated enone or an ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=O in a ketone? No, ketones are around 1700-1720. Wait, perhaps the 1650 is part of an aromatic ring? But aromatic C=Cs are around 1600 and 1500. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an amide's carbonyl? Amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but that's possible. But then where's the O-H?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3000 peak is not O-H. Let's consider the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, so like CH2=CH- would have vinyl protons. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene or part of a conjugated system. The mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, m/z 45. Let me think, what common fragments give that? Acetone (C3H6O) has a molecular ion at 58, but a fragment? Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO (which is 43) plus 2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2O (30 + 14 + 2?) Wait, CH2O is 30 (C:12*2=24? Wait no, CH2O: 12 + 2 +16=30. Hmm, but 45. Let me think, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. For example, if the molecule is something like propanoic acid (C3H6O2), the molecular ion would be 74, but a fragment like CH2CO (m/z 44) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a CO (mass 28), but that's not 45. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the molecular formula first.\n\nThe options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me note the degrees of unsaturation. The formula can be calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So for each formula:\n\nFor C6H12O: (12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (12*2 is 24? Wait the formula is 2*C +2 - H - X + N. Wait, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So for each formula:\n\nTake C6H12O: \n\n2*6 +2 -12 -0 = 12 +2 -12 = 2 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 1 degree of unsaturation. \n\nC6H10O: (12+2 -10) = 4 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 2 degrees.\n\nC6H10O2: (12+2 -10 - (O counts as 0 here since it's subtracted? Wait no, the formula is for degrees of unsaturation, which is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oxygen doesn't affect it. So for C6H10O2: same as C6H10O, so same calculation: (12+2 -10)=4 \u2192 2 degrees. Wait but the oxygen is not part of the calculation except as part of the molecule's structure. So O doesn't add or subtract. So yes, same as C6H10O, so 2.\n\nC6H12O2: (12 +2 -12) = 2 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 1 degree.\n\nWait, so the options are:\n\nA: C6H12O2 \u2192 1 degree.\n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 2 degrees.\n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 (same as B in terms of H: 10 H, so same degrees as B? Wait no, the formula for C6H10O2 would be (2*6 +2 -10 -0 (since O doesn't count)) \u2192 12+2=14-10=4 \u2192 4/2=2. So same as B and C have 2 degrees. D is C6H12O has 1.\n\nNow, the FTIR data: the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think. A carbonyl (C=O) at 1700 would be one degree of unsaturation (since each double bond counts as one). The 1650 could be another double bond (like a C=C) or maybe another carbonyl? But 1650 is lower than typical carbonyls (which are around 1700-1750). Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1600 and 1500. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide's carbonyl? Amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but that's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Let's see:\n\nIf there's a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C, that would give two double bonds, so two degrees of unsaturation. Which would match formulas with 2 degrees. The options B and C have 2 degrees, while A and D have 1. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests there is a C=C double bond. So that's one double bond. The carbonyl is another, so total two degrees. So the formula must have two degrees, so either B or C. \n\nNow, the O in the formula. The options B has one O, C has two. Let's look again at the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000. Wait, I'm confused because the O-H stretch is usually higher. If the compound has an -OH group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), that would require an oxygen. Let me see:\n\nIf the formula has an O (like B: C6H10O), that could be an alcohol, but the O-H would be around 3200-3600. The question says the peak is at 3000. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe that peak isn't an O-H. Maybe the 3000 is from some other group. Wait, maybe the 3000 region is actually the C-H stretching for alkanes, but a broad peak would not be that. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake and the actual O-H is at 3300, but the question says 3000. Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 3000 is from an aldehyde's -CHO group? The aldehyde's O-H is at around 2500-2800? Wait, no. Wait, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2720 cm\u207b\u00b9 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch. The O-H in an aldehyde would be around 2500-2800 but as a sharp peak. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is not O-H. Maybe the 3000 is actually part of the C-H stretch of the vinyl group? But vinyl protons are usually around 5-10 ppm in NMR, but in IR, their stretching would be around 3000-3100, maybe overlapping with other peaks. But the question says it's a very broad peak. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the O-H is missing. Wait, maybe the compound doesn't have an O-H group. Let me think again. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. Maybe that's not O-H. Let me check typical IR peaks again. \n\nThe carbonyl at 1700 could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid. The 1650 could be a C=C (like in an alkene) or maybe part of an aromatic ring. \n\nIf the compound has a carboxylic acid group, that would require an O-H (so a broad peak around 3200-3600). But since the given peak is at 3000, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have a carbonyl (1700-1750), and their O-H is only present if they are free, but esters are usually without O-H unless it's a hemiester. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with a double bond. For example, something like cyclohexenone. That would have a C=O at ~1700 and a C=C at ~1650. The O is one, so the formula would be C6H10O (option B). But then the O-H peak isn't present. Wait, but the question's FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has a carbonyl and an ether group. Wait, but then the O count would be higher. \n\nWait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the presence of a double bond. The carbonyl plus the double bond gives two degrees of unsaturation. So the formula must have two degrees. So B or C. \n\nThe mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecule is something like pent-2-en-4-one (C6H10O), the molecular formula would be C6H10O (option B). The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1) +16= 72+10+16= 98. The fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule. Let's see, 45 could be CH3CO (43) plus 2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a group. \n\nAlternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which would have two oxygen atoms, like an ester. For example, an ester group has two oxygens (R-CO-O-R'). The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. The fragment at 45 could be, for instance, the acetyl group (43) plus a hydrogen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone and an ether? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a formate group (COOH minus H? Not sure). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketene? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone. Its molecular formula is C6H10O (option B), molecular weight 98. The fragment at m/z 45 could come from a cleavage that gives a fragment like CH2CH2O (but not sure). Wait, 45 is 12*3 (C3) + 4 (H4) + O (16) \u2192 12*3 is 36, plus 4 gives 40, plus 16 would be too much. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO (43) plus 2 (maybe a proton?), but that's 45. So maybe the fragment is the acetyl group (C3H4O), which would be 44 (12*3 +16 +4= 36+16+4=56? Wait no, wait. Wait, C3H4O: Carbon 12*3=36, H4 is 4, O is 16. Total 36+4+16=56. Hmm, that's not 45. Maybe a different group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a methoxy group (CH3O) which is 31 (12+16+3*1?), but that's 31. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group plus some hydrogens. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester like ethyl propenoate (methyl acrylate?), which would have formula C5H8O2. Wait, but the options are for C6. Maybe another example. \n\nWait, let me think of the options again. The options are C6H12O (D), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O2 (A). \n\nLet me think of possible structures. \n\nOption B: C6H10O. Two degrees of unsaturation. So maybe a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone (C6H10O). Its IR would have a carbonyl at ~1710, and a C=C at ~1650. The O-H would not be present, so the broad peak at 3000 is confusing. Unless that peak is from something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is actually from the C-H stretching of the vinyl group? Vinyl groups have C-H stretches around 3000-3100 cm\u207b\u00b9. A broad peak might be from overlapping peaks, but the question says it's very broad, which is more characteristic of O-H. Hmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound has an alcohol group. Then the O-H would be at ~3300, but the question says 3000. Maybe the O-H is involved in hydrogen bonding and the peak is shifted lower? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an ester (so option C, C6H10O2). For example, something like methyl acrylate (C5H6O2) but with an extra CH2 group. Let's see, a possible structure could be something like ethyl propenoate (C6H8O2?), no. Maybe another structure. \n\nWait, let's think of the fragment at m/z 45. Let me calculate the molecular weight for each option:\n\nA: C6H12O2 \u2192 6*12=72 +12 + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+12=84 +32=116? Wait, no: C6H12O2 would be 6*12=72 +12 (H12) + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+12=84 +32=116. \n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 72 +10 +16= 98.\n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 72+10 +32= 114.\n\nD: C6H12O \u2192 72+12+16= 100.\n\nThe fragment at m/z 45. Let's consider possible fragments. \n\nIf the molecular weight is 98 (B), then a fragment of 45 would be possible. Let's see, 98-45=53. Maybe the molecule breaks into a 45 and 53. \n\nSuppose it's a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone. The structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. Breaking the molecule could give a fragment like the ketone part (maybe a methyl group? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a cleavage that releases a CO (carbon monoxide, m/z 28) but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a formate fragment? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of option C, C6H10O2 (114). The fragment at 45 could be, for example, a methyl acetate (C3H6O2) fragment? Wait, methyl acetate is C3H6O2, which would have a molecular weight of 74. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, a fragment like a methoxy group plus something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, like hex-2-enoic acid (C6H10O2), then the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at m/z 45 might be from the COOH group losing something? Wait, the molecular ion would be 114, so a fragment at 45 could be from the loss of 69 (114-45=69). 69 could be C4H9+ (57?) No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the -COOH group minus some atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene (COCH2?), but that's unlikely. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me re-examine the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. That suggests the presence of a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond (one degree of unsaturation). The carbonyl adds another, so two degrees. Thus, the formula must be either B or C. \n\nThe O count: If the compound has an O-H group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), then the broad peak at 3000 might not be O-H, but maybe the question has a mistake in the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is actually the O-H of a carboxylic acid, but that would be higher. \n\nWait, maybe the peak at 1700 is a carboxylic acid (around 1700) and the 1650 is the O-H bending? No, the O-H bending is usually around 1600-1700. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch and a sharp carbonyl. So if there's a carboxylic acid group, then O count is 2 (the O in COOH has two oxygens?), wait no: carboxylic acid is -COOH, which has two oxygen atoms. So that would be O2. So the formula would have two oxygens. So that would point towards option C (C6H10O2) or A (C6H12O2). But degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2 is 2, which fits with the two double bonds (carbonyl and double bond). \n\nWait, carboxylic acid has one double bond (the C=O) and the other double bond from the vinyl group. So that would give two degrees. So the formula would need two oxygens (like in a carboxylic acid), so C6H10O2 (option C). \n\nThe broad peak at 3000 might actually be the O-H of the carboxylic acid, but that should be higher. Maybe the question meant 3300? Or maybe it's a mistake, but I have to go with what's given. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is from an alcohol's O-H, but then the O count would be 1 (alcohol) plus the carbonyl's O, making two oxygens. Wait, if it's an ester, which has two oxygens but no O-H, then the broad peak isn't from O-H. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the O count is two (from the -COOH), so that would be option C (C6H10O2). The broad peak would then be the O-H around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. That's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Then O count would be 2, so option C (C6H10O2) but that would have two O's. Wait, the formula would be C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation would still be 2 (carbonyl and double bond). The O-H would be present (alcohol), so the broad peak at 3000 would have to be that. But again, the O-H should be higher. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the mass spec fragment. The fragment at 45. Let's think of possible fragments for option C (C6H10O2, MW 114). Suppose the compound is something like propiolic acid (but that's smaller). Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone? Unlikely. \n\nWait, the fragment at 45. Let me think of common fragments. For example, the ethyl group (C2H5) is 29, but 45 is higher. Acetone (C3H6O) is 58. Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of a formate (HCOO-), but that's 45 (H=1, C=12, O2=32 \u2192 1+12+32=45). Oh! Formate is HCOO-, which has a molecular weight of 45 (1 + 12 + 16*2 = 45). So if the compound has a formate group (like in a formate ester or something), then a fragment losing the formate group would give that. \n\nIf the compound is something like methyl formate (C2H4O2, MW 74), but that's smaller. Wait, if the compound is a larger molecule, say, pent-2-en-4-oic acid (C6H10O2), then the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 would correspond to the formate group (HCOO-), so maybe the molecule breaks at the carboxylic acid part, releasing the formate fragment (45) and leaving the rest (C4H6O, MW 70? 114-45=69. Hmm, not exact). Wait, maybe another fragmentation. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester like methyl propenoate (C5H8O2, MW 100), but that's not C6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl acrylate (C5H6O2), but again not C6. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a different group. Let me consider option B (C6H10O). If the compound is cyclohexenone (MW 98), then a fragment at 45 would be possible. Let's see, 98-45=53. 53 could be C4H5O (4*12 +5 +16=48+5+16=69?), no. Hmm. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2CH2O (but that's 44). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from the vinyl group. The vinyl hydrogens suggest the presence of a double bond. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the options and see which formulas fit with the given data. \n\nThe compound has a carbonyl (1700 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a double bond (1650 cm\u207b\u00b9?), so two degrees of unsaturation. The formula must have two degrees, so B or C. \n\nThe NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. \n\nThe FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. If that's an O-H, then the compound has an alcohol or carboxylic acid, which would add an O. \n\nIf the broad peak is an O-H, then the O count is at least 1 (for alcohol) or 2 (for carboxylic acid). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 O=1. So that would be an alcohol (O-H), but then the O-H should be around 3200-3600. The given peak is at 3000, which doesn't fit. Unless it's a different O-H, but I don't think so. \n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 O=2. So maybe a carboxylic acid (two O's), which would have an O-H. Then the broad peak should be around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the broad peak is not O-H but something else. Like an amine? No, the options don't have N. \n\nWait, maybe the 3000 peak is actually the C-H stretch of an aldehyde group. Aldehydes have a strong peak around 2820 cm\u207b\u00b9 for the -CH2O group, but their O-H (if present, like in formic acid) is around 2500-2800. Wait, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. \n\nIf the compound has an aldehyde group (CHO), then the carbonyl is at 1700, and the aldehyde's C-H around 2800. The broad peak at 3000 might not fit that. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an anhydride, but that would require two carbonyls and more oxygens. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is not O-H but due to overlapping peaks from the vinyl hydrogens and other C-H stretches, making a broad absorption there. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake, and the correct peak is at a higher wavenumber. But I have to go with the given info. \n\nLet me think of possible compounds that fit:\n\nOption C (C6H10O2) could be a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like hex-2-enoic acid. Its IR would have a broad O-H peak around 3000? No, it should be higher. But maybe in some cases it's lower? Not sure. The carbonyl of the acid would be around 1700, and the C=C at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would be present. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (since -COOH has two O's, plus the rest of the structure). \n\nThe mass spec fragment at 45: If the molecular ion is 114 (for C6H10O2), then a fragment at 45 could be the formate group (HCOO-), which is 45. That would make sense if the molecule breaks at the carboxylic acid part, releasing the formate fragment. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\n- Two degrees of unsaturation (so B or C).\n\n- The presence of a carboxylic acid group (O=2, so C) would explain the carbonyl at 1700 and the O-H (though the wavenumber is an issue).\n\n- The fragment at 45 as formate (45) fits with option C.\n\n- The vinyl hydrogens are present because of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the formula is C6H10O2 (option C). \n\nWait, but the degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2 is 2, which matches the two double bonds (C=O and C=C). \n\nAlternatively, the O-H peak being at 3000 might be a mistake, but the other data points fit better with option C. \n\nSo I think the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe FTIR spectrum indicates a broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, which could be due to an O-H group (though typically at higher wavenumbers), a carbonyl group at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a C=C double bond at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the \u00b9H NMR confirms a double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z 45 suggests a formate group (HCOO\u207b, molecular weight 45), implying an acid or ester. \n\nCalculating degrees of unsaturation:\n- **C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082** (Option C) has 2 degrees (from a double bond and a carbonyl), matching the FTIR peaks. \n- The O count (2) aligns with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which explains the carbonyl and the potential O-H peak (despite the wavenumber discrepancy). \n- The fragment at 45 supports a carboxylic acid structure, as the formate group (HCOO\u207b) is a plausible fragment.\n\nThus, the formula **C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082** (Option C) best fits all data.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the unknown compound has been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The question is asking for its chemical formula among the four options provided. Let me break down each piece of data given and see what they tell me.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak at around 3000 wavenumbers. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around 3200-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9 are usually from O-H bonds, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but here it's at 3000. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the ranges. Let me think again. Oh right, actually, the O-H stretch is indeed around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe the peak is a bit lower? Alternatively, maybe that's not O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 region is for other groups. Wait, maybe the broad peak here is actually a mistake? Or perhaps the question is correct. Let me see the other peaks. The other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. \n\nLooking at the 1700 region, that's typical for carbonyl groups (C=O), like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C stretch (alkenes) or maybe the C=O in something like an amide, but amides have a different carbonyl stretch. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H bending around 1700? Or maybe that's the carbonyl. Wait, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H stretch. Since the O-H is mentioned as a broad peak, maybe that's from a carboxylic acid. So if there's a carboxylic acid group, that would account for the broad O-H peak at around 3000? Wait, no, the O-H in carboxylic acid is around 3200-3600. The 3000 might actually be from something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is not O-H. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is part of the carboxylic acid structure. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 3000? Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 is the C=O in an amide, but then the carbonyl would be around 1650? Wait no, amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but the N-H bending might be elsewhere. Hmm, maybe this is a conjugated system. Let me think. The presence of both 1700 and 1650 peaks. If the 1700 is a carbonyl and 1650 is a C=C, that would suggest an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, like a conjugated enone or an ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=O in a ketone? No, ketones are around 1700-1720. Wait, perhaps the 1650 is part of an aromatic ring? But aromatic C=Cs are around 1600 and 1500. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an amide's carbonyl? Amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but that's possible. But then where's the O-H?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3000 peak is not O-H. Let's consider the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, so like CH2=CH- would have vinyl protons. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene or part of a conjugated system. The mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, m/z 45. Let me think, what common fragments give that? Acetone (C3H6O) has a molecular ion at 58, but a fragment? Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO (which is 43) plus 2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2O (30 + 14 + 2?) Wait, CH2O is 30 (C:12*2=24? Wait no, CH2O: 12 + 2 +16=30. Hmm, but 45. Let me think, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. For example, if the molecule is something like propanoic acid (C3H6O2), the molecular ion would be 74, but a fragment like CH2CO (m/z 44) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a CO (mass 28), but that's not 45. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the molecular formula first.\n\nThe options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me note the degrees of unsaturation. The formula can be calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So for each formula:\n\nFor C6H12O: (12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (12*2 is 24? Wait the formula is 2*C +2 - H - X + N. Wait, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So for each formula:\n\nTake C6H12O: \n\n2*6 +2 -12 -0 = 12 +2 -12 = 2 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 1 degree of unsaturation. \n\nC6H10O: (12+2 -10) = 4 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 2 degrees.\n\nC6H10O2: (12+2 -10 - (O counts as 0 here since it's subtracted? Wait no, the formula is for degrees of unsaturation, which is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oxygen doesn't affect it. So for C6H10O2: same as C6H10O, so same calculation: (12+2 -10)=4 \u2192 2 degrees. Wait but the oxygen is not part of the calculation except as part of the molecule's structure. So O doesn't add or subtract. So yes, same as C6H10O, so 2.\n\nC6H12O2: (12 +2 -12) = 2 \u2192 divided by 2 \u2192 1 degree.\n\nWait, so the options are:\n\nA: C6H12O2 \u2192 1 degree.\n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 2 degrees.\n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 (same as B in terms of H: 10 H, so same degrees as B? Wait no, the formula for C6H10O2 would be (2*6 +2 -10 -0 (since O doesn't count)) \u2192 12+2=14-10=4 \u2192 4/2=2. So same as B and C have 2 degrees. D is C6H12O has 1.\n\nNow, the FTIR data: the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think. A carbonyl (C=O) at 1700 would be one degree of unsaturation (since each double bond counts as one). The 1650 could be another double bond (like a C=C) or maybe another carbonyl? But 1650 is lower than typical carbonyls (which are around 1700-1750). Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1600 and 1500. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide's carbonyl? Amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, but that's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Let's see:\n\nIf there's a carbonyl (C=O) and a C=C, that would give two double bonds, so two degrees of unsaturation. Which would match formulas with 2 degrees. The options B and C have 2 degrees, while A and D have 1. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests there is a C=C double bond. So that's one double bond. The carbonyl is another, so total two degrees. So the formula must have two degrees, so either B or C. \n\nNow, the O in the formula. The options B has one O, C has two. Let's look again at the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000. Wait, I'm confused because the O-H stretch is usually higher. If the compound has an -OH group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), that would require an oxygen. Let me see:\n\nIf the formula has an O (like B: C6H10O), that could be an alcohol, but the O-H would be around 3200-3600. The question says the peak is at 3000. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe that peak isn't an O-H. Maybe the 3000 is from some other group. Wait, maybe the 3000 region is actually the C-H stretching for alkanes, but a broad peak would not be that. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake and the actual O-H is at 3300, but the question says 3000. Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 3000 is from an aldehyde's -CHO group? The aldehyde's O-H is at around 2500-2800? Wait, no. Wait, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2720 cm\u207b\u00b9 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch. The O-H in an aldehyde would be around 2500-2800 but as a sharp peak. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is not O-H. Maybe the 3000 is actually part of the C-H stretch of the vinyl group? But vinyl protons are usually around 5-10 ppm in NMR, but in IR, their stretching would be around 3000-3100, maybe overlapping with other peaks. But the question says it's a very broad peak. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the O-H is missing. Wait, maybe the compound doesn't have an O-H group. Let me think again. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. Maybe that's not O-H. Let me check typical IR peaks again. \n\nThe carbonyl at 1700 could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid. The 1650 could be a C=C (like in an alkene) or maybe part of an aromatic ring. \n\nIf the compound has a carboxylic acid group, that would require an O-H (so a broad peak around 3200-3600). But since the given peak is at 3000, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have a carbonyl (1700-1750), and their O-H is only present if they are free, but esters are usually without O-H unless it's a hemiester. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with a double bond. For example, something like cyclohexenone. That would have a C=O at ~1700 and a C=C at ~1650. The O is one, so the formula would be C6H10O (option B). But then the O-H peak isn't present. Wait, but the question's FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has a carbonyl and an ether group. Wait, but then the O count would be higher. \n\nWait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the presence of a double bond. The carbonyl plus the double bond gives two degrees of unsaturation. So the formula must have two degrees. So B or C. \n\nThe mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecule is something like pent-2-en-4-one (C6H10O), the molecular formula would be C6H10O (option B). The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1) +16= 72+10+16= 98. The fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule. Let's see, 45 could be CH3CO (43) plus 2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a group. \n\nAlternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which would have two oxygen atoms, like an ester. For example, an ester group has two oxygens (R-CO-O-R'). The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. The fragment at 45 could be, for instance, the acetyl group (43) plus a hydrogen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone and an ether? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a formate group (COOH minus H? Not sure). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketene? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone. Its molecular formula is C6H10O (option B), molecular weight 98. The fragment at m/z 45 could come from a cleavage that gives a fragment like CH2CH2O (but not sure). Wait, 45 is 12*3 (C3) + 4 (H4) + O (16) \u2192 12*3 is 36, plus 4 gives 40, plus 16 would be too much. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH3CO (43) plus 2 (maybe a proton?), but that's 45. So maybe the fragment is the acetyl group (C3H4O), which would be 44 (12*3 +16 +4= 36+16+4=56? Wait no, wait. Wait, C3H4O: Carbon 12*3=36, H4 is 4, O is 16. Total 36+4+16=56. Hmm, that's not 45. Maybe a different group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a methoxy group (CH3O) which is 31 (12+16+3*1?), but that's 31. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group plus some hydrogens. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester like ethyl propenoate (methyl acrylate?), which would have formula C5H8O2. Wait, but the options are for C6. Maybe another example. \n\nWait, let me think of the options again. The options are C6H12O (D), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O2 (A). \n\nLet me think of possible structures. \n\nOption B: C6H10O. Two degrees of unsaturation. So maybe a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone (C6H10O). Its IR would have a carbonyl at ~1710, and a C=C at ~1650. The O-H would not be present, so the broad peak at 3000 is confusing. Unless that peak is from something else. Wait, maybe the 3000 is actually from the C-H stretching of the vinyl group? Vinyl groups have C-H stretches around 3000-3100 cm\u207b\u00b9. A broad peak might be from overlapping peaks, but the question says it's very broad, which is more characteristic of O-H. Hmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound has an alcohol group. Then the O-H would be at ~3300, but the question says 3000. Maybe the O-H is involved in hydrogen bonding and the peak is shifted lower? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an ester (so option C, C6H10O2). For example, something like methyl acrylate (C5H6O2) but with an extra CH2 group. Let's see, a possible structure could be something like ethyl propenoate (C6H8O2?), no. Maybe another structure. \n\nWait, let's think of the fragment at m/z 45. Let me calculate the molecular weight for each option:\n\nA: C6H12O2 \u2192 6*12=72 +12 + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+12=84 +32=116? Wait, no: C6H12O2 would be 6*12=72 +12 (H12) + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+12=84 +32=116. \n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 72 +10 +16= 98.\n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 72+10 +32= 114.\n\nD: C6H12O \u2192 72+12+16= 100.\n\nThe fragment at m/z 45. Let's consider possible fragments. \n\nIf the molecular weight is 98 (B), then a fragment of 45 would be possible. Let's see, 98-45=53. Maybe the molecule breaks into a 45 and 53. \n\nSuppose it's a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexenone. The structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. Breaking the molecule could give a fragment like the ketone part (maybe a methyl group? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a cleavage that releases a CO (carbon monoxide, m/z 28) but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a formate fragment? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of option C, C6H10O2 (114). The fragment at 45 could be, for example, a methyl acetate (C3H6O2) fragment? Wait, methyl acetate is C3H6O2, which would have a molecular weight of 74. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, a fragment like a methoxy group plus something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, like hex-2-enoic acid (C6H10O2), then the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at m/z 45 might be from the COOH group losing something? Wait, the molecular ion would be 114, so a fragment at 45 could be from the loss of 69 (114-45=69). 69 could be C4H9+ (57?) No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the -COOH group minus some atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene (COCH2?), but that's unlikely. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me re-examine the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. That suggests the presence of a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond (one degree of unsaturation). The carbonyl adds another, so two degrees. Thus, the formula must be either B or C. \n\nThe O count: If the compound has an O-H group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), then the broad peak at 3000 might not be O-H, but maybe the question has a mistake in the wavenumber. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is actually the O-H of a carboxylic acid, but that would be higher. \n\nWait, maybe the peak at 1700 is a carboxylic acid (around 1700) and the 1650 is the O-H bending? No, the O-H bending is usually around 1600-1700. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch and a sharp carbonyl. So if there's a carboxylic acid group, then O count is 2 (the O in COOH has two oxygens?), wait no: carboxylic acid is -COOH, which has two oxygen atoms. So that would be O2. So the formula would have two oxygens. So that would point towards option C (C6H10O2) or A (C6H12O2). But degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2 is 2, which fits with the two double bonds (carbonyl and double bond). \n\nWait, carboxylic acid has one double bond (the C=O) and the other double bond from the vinyl group. So that would give two degrees. So the formula would need two oxygens (like in a carboxylic acid), so C6H10O2 (option C). \n\nThe broad peak at 3000 might actually be the O-H of the carboxylic acid, but that should be higher. Maybe the question meant 3300? Or maybe it's a mistake, but I have to go with what's given. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is from an alcohol's O-H, but then the O count would be 1 (alcohol) plus the carbonyl's O, making two oxygens. Wait, if it's an ester, which has two oxygens but no O-H, then the broad peak isn't from O-H. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the O count is two (from the -COOH), so that would be option C (C6H10O2). The broad peak would then be the O-H around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. That's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Then O count would be 2, so option C (C6H10O2) but that would have two O's. Wait, the formula would be C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation would still be 2 (carbonyl and double bond). The O-H would be present (alcohol), so the broad peak at 3000 would have to be that. But again, the O-H should be higher. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the mass spec fragment. The fragment at 45. Let's think of possible fragments for option C (C6H10O2, MW 114). Suppose the compound is something like propiolic acid (but that's smaller). Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone? Unlikely. \n\nWait, the fragment at 45. Let me think of common fragments. For example, the ethyl group (C2H5) is 29, but 45 is higher. Acetone (C3H6O) is 58. Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of a formate (HCOO-), but that's 45 (H=1, C=12, O2=32 \u2192 1+12+32=45). Oh! Formate is HCOO-, which has a molecular weight of 45 (1 + 12 + 16*2 = 45). So if the compound has a formate group (like in a formate ester or something), then a fragment losing the formate group would give that. \n\nIf the compound is something like methyl formate (C2H4O2, MW 74), but that's smaller. Wait, if the compound is a larger molecule, say, pent-2-en-4-oic acid (C6H10O2), then the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 would correspond to the formate group (HCOO-), so maybe the molecule breaks at the carboxylic acid part, releasing the formate fragment (45) and leaving the rest (C4H6O, MW 70? 114-45=69. Hmm, not exact). Wait, maybe another fragmentation. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester like methyl propenoate (C5H8O2, MW 100), but that's not C6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl acrylate (C5H6O2), but again not C6. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a different group. Let me consider option B (C6H10O). If the compound is cyclohexenone (MW 98), then a fragment at 45 would be possible. Let's see, 98-45=53. 53 could be C4H5O (4*12 +5 +16=48+5+16=69?), no. Hmm. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2CH2O (but that's 44). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from the vinyl group. The vinyl hydrogens suggest the presence of a double bond. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the options and see which formulas fit with the given data. \n\nThe compound has a carbonyl (1700 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a double bond (1650 cm\u207b\u00b9?), so two degrees of unsaturation. The formula must have two degrees, so B or C. \n\nThe NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. \n\nThe FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. If that's an O-H, then the compound has an alcohol or carboxylic acid, which would add an O. \n\nIf the broad peak is an O-H, then the O count is at least 1 (for alcohol) or 2 (for carboxylic acid). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nB: C6H10O \u2192 O=1. So that would be an alcohol (O-H), but then the O-H should be around 3200-3600. The given peak is at 3000, which doesn't fit. Unless it's a different O-H, but I don't think so. \n\nC: C6H10O2 \u2192 O=2. So maybe a carboxylic acid (two O's), which would have an O-H. Then the broad peak should be around 3200-3600, but the question says 3000. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the broad peak is not O-H but something else. Like an amine? No, the options don't have N. \n\nWait, maybe the 3000 peak is actually the C-H stretch of an aldehyde group. Aldehydes have a strong peak around 2820 cm\u207b\u00b9 for the -CH2O group, but their O-H (if present, like in formic acid) is around 2500-2800. Wait, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. \n\nIf the compound has an aldehyde group (CHO), then the carbonyl is at 1700, and the aldehyde's C-H around 2800. The broad peak at 3000 might not fit that. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an anhydride, but that would require two carbonyls and more oxygens. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is not O-H but due to overlapping peaks from the vinyl hydrogens and other C-H stretches, making a broad absorption there. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3000 is a mistake, and the correct peak is at a higher wavenumber. But I have to go with the given info. \n\nLet me think of possible compounds that fit:\n\nOption C (C6H10O2) could be a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like hex-2-enoic acid. Its IR would have a broad O-H peak around 3000? No, it should be higher. But maybe in some cases it's lower? Not sure. The carbonyl of the acid would be around 1700, and the C=C at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR would be present. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (since -COOH has two O's, plus the rest of the structure). \n\nThe mass spec fragment at 45: If the molecular ion is 114 (for C6H10O2), then a fragment at 45 could be the formate group (HCOO-), which is 45. That would make sense if the molecule breaks at the carboxylic acid part, releasing the formate fragment. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\n- Two degrees of unsaturation (so B or C).\n\n- The presence of a carboxylic acid group (O=2, so C) would explain the carbonyl at 1700 and the O-H (though the wavenumber is an issue).\n\n- The fragment at 45 as formate (45) fits with option C.\n\n- The vinyl hydrogens are present because of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the formula is C6H10O2 (option C). \n\nWait, but the degrees of unsaturation for C6H10O2 is 2, which matches the two double bonds (C=O and C=C). \n\nAlternatively, the O-H peak being at 3000 might be a mistake, but the other data points fit better with option C. \n\nSo I think the answer is C.\n\n\nThe FTIR spectrum indicates a broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, which could be due to an O-H group (though typically at higher wavenumbers), a carbonyl group at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a C=C double bond at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the \u00b9H NMR confirms a double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z 45 suggests a formate group (HCOO\u207b, molecular weight 45), implying an acid or ester. \n\nCalculating degrees of unsaturation:\n- **C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082** (Option C) has 2 degrees (from a double bond and a carbonyl), matching the FTIR peaks. \n- The O count (2) aligns with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which explains the carbonyl and the potential O-H peak (despite the wavenumber discrepancy). \n- The fragment at 45 supports a carboxylic acid structure, as the formate group (HCOO\u207b) is a plausible fragment.\n\nThus, the formula **C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082** (Option C) best fits all data.\n\nAnswer: C",
