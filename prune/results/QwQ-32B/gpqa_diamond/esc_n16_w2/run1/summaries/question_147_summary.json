      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me read it again. The question is about the annihilation process p plus antiproton gives two A+ and two A- particles. They tell me that the antiproton is slowly moving and that the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, that probably means we can treat it as being at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. The proton and antiproton would annihilate each other, creating those particles. So maybe I can model this as a center-of-mass frame problem where the total energy is just the sum of the rest masses?\n\nWait, the proton and antiproton each have a rest mass. The proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, right? So each of them has a rest mass energy of 938 MeV. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is small, so maybe the total energy available is just twice the rest mass of the proton? Because the proton's kinetic energy might be considered negligible too, but maybe they are at rest? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm. So perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving very slowly. In that case, the total energy would be approximately the sum of their rest masses plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since it's slow, maybe we can approximate the total energy as just 2*(938 MeV)? Let me see.\n\nThe products are two A+ and two A- particles. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So each has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. Since there are four particles (two positive and two negative), the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. \n\nWait, but the initial rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. So the total energy from the initial particles (if they are at rest) would be 1876 MeV, but the products' rest mass is 1200. That leaves 676 MeV as kinetic energy? But how does this relate to the velocity of the A particles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial particles are moving, so the total energy is higher. But since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe we can consider that the total energy is roughly the sum of their rest masses. So, the total energy available is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. The products have a rest mass of 4*300=1200 MeV, so the remaining energy must be the kinetic energy of the A particles. But since the A particles are produced in pairs, maybe they move in opposite directions to conserve momentum?\n\nWait, let's think in terms of conservation laws. The total momentum before annihilation must be zero. Because if the antiproton is moving very slowly, and the proton is presumably at rest, then the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton. But if it's \"slowly moving\", maybe we can approximate it as zero? Hmm, but that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, perhaps the proton and antiproton are colliding head-on with equal and opposite momenta, but the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe they are both at rest? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's considered that the initial momentum is negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is considered in the center of mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the proton is at rest, so the center of mass frame would have some momentum, but maybe the antiproton's speed is so low that the center of mass is approximately at rest? Not sure. Hmm, maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that the initial particles are at rest. Let me try that.\n\nSo assuming both proton and antiproton are at rest (since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe they are both considered at rest?), then their total energy is 2*(938) MeV. The total energy must be equal to the total energy of the four A particles. Since energy is conserved.\n\nEach A particle has energy given by gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since they are moving, their energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. The total energy of the four particles would then be 2*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2) + 2*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the two A+ and two A- each have the same energy if they are moving symmetrically. Since momentum must be conserved, and the initial momentum is zero (if the initial particles are at rest), then the total momentum of the four A particles must also be zero. So they must be moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out. The most straightforward case is that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite direction with equal speeds. Or maybe each pair is opposite. But since they are charged, but the problem doesn't specify direction, so maybe all four have the same speed but opposite momenta. Wait, perhaps they form two pairs moving in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nIn any case, since the total momentum is zero, each pair must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me think of the system's total energy. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles. Since all particles are identical in mass (assuming A+ and A- have the same mass), then each will have the same energy. Wait, but A+ and A- have same mass, so their energies are same. Therefore, each of the four particles has energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, so total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSo setting that equal to the initial energy:\n\n4 * gamma * (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV\n\nSo solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) = (1876)/(1200) \u2248 1.5633\n\nHmm, so gamma is about 1.56. Then to find the velocity, we can compute v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. Let me compute 1/gamma\u00b2 first. 1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.444) \u2248 0.409. Then 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. The square root of that is sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769. So v \u2248 0.769c, which is approximately 0.77c. That would be option A. But let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me verify the energy calculation again. The initial rest mass energy is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. The total energy of the products must equal that. The products are four particles each with energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, so 4*gamma*300. So 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(1200) \u2248 1.5633. So that part is okay.\n\nThen, the velocity is calculated from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So solving for v:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\n=> sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma\n\n=> 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2\n\n=> v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2\n\n=> v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in gamma \u22481.5633:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 \u2248 (1/1.5633)^2 \u2248 (0.64)\u00b2? Wait, 1.5633 squared is approximately 2.444, so 1/2.444 \u22480.409. So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. sqrt(0.591) is about sqrt(0.6) is 0.7746, so sqrt(0.591) is slightly less. Let's calculate more accurately:\n\nsqrt(0.591):\n\nLet me see: 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, exactly. 0.77^2 = 0.5929. So sqrt(0.591) is just a bit less than 0.77. Hmm. So maybe 0.769c. So that would be approximately 0.77c. So option A is 0.77c, which is the first option. But wait, the options are A) 0.77c, B)0.96c etc. So that would point to A. But let me see if I made a mistake in the assumption.\n\nWait, but what if the initial particles are not at rest? The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. Then the total initial energy would be a bit more than 2*938 MeV? But since it's slowly moving, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible. So the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the antiproton's kinetic energy is part of the total energy. Let me see: the total energy would be the sum of the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is 938 MeV. The antiproton, moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m_p c\u00b2. Since it's slowly moving, gamma \u22481 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). But maybe the problem wants us to neglect the antiproton's kinetic energy, so that total energy is 2*938. Hence the previous calculation holds. So the answer would be A. \n\nWait, but another thought: when particles annihilate, the products must have enough energy to account for their rest mass and kinetic energy. The calculation seems okay. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming all four particles have the same gamma. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Let me think of two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with the same speed. So each pair (like two particles going left and two going right) would have their momenta cancel. But each particle's momentum is gamma m v. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So, for example, two particles moving in +x direction and two in -x, each with momentum p and -p. \n\nIn that case, the total momentum is zero. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles, each of which is gamma m_A c\u00b2. So the total energy is indeed 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the gamma is about 1.563, leading to v \u22480.77c. So option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)0.77, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma:\n\nTotal energy from initial: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal energy of products: 4 * gamma * 300 = 1200 gamma MeV.\n\nSo 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633.\n\nYes. Then v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute 1/gamma squared again: (1/1.5633)^2 \u2248 (0.64) squared? 1.5633 squared is (approx 1.5^2 is 2.25, 1.56^2 is 2.4336). So 1/(2.4336) is ~0.4109. So 1 - 0.4109 = 0.5891. sqrt(0.5891) is sqrt(0.5891). Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.5891)? Let me see:\n\n0.77 squared is 0.5929, as before. 0.76 squared is 0.5776. The difference between 0.5776 and 0.5891 is 0.0115. Between 0.76 and 0.77, the value increases by 0.0153 per 0.01 increment. Hmm, so 0.5891 is 0.5776 + 0.0115. So 0.0115 / 0.0153 \u2248 0.75 of the interval. So approx 0.76 + 0.0075 \u2248 0.7675. So about 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c. So that would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a calculator for better precision. Let's compute sqrt(0.5891):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5891):\n\nLet me note that sqrt(0.5929) is exactly 0.77. Since 0.5891 is 0.5929 minus 0.0038. Let me use a Taylor expansion around x=0.5929:\n\nLet f(x) = sqrt(x). Let x0 =0.5929, f(x0)=0.77. We want f(x0 - 0.0038). The derivative f\u2019(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So f(x0 - \u0394x) \u2248 f(x0) - (\u0394x)/(2 f(x0)).\n\n\u0394x is 0.0038. So:\n\nApproximate sqrt(0.5891) \u2248 0.77 - (0.0038)/(2 * 0.77) = 0.77 - (0.0038)/(1.54) \u2248 0.77 - 0.002467 \u2248 0.7675. So about 0.7675c, which is ~0.77c. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe considering that the kinetic energy is shared between the four particles. Wait, but the problem says \"what is the velocity of particle A\". Since all particles are the same mass and the system is symmetric, they should all have the same speed, so the velocity is the same. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total momentum is zero, so each pair must have equal and opposite momenta, but maybe I need to do a more detailed calculation with vectors? Let me think. Let's assume that the two A+ and two A- particles are moving in two opposite directions with equal speeds. Let me suppose that two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction. Each has momentum gamma m_A v. The total momentum is then 2 gamma m_A v (from the +x particles) minus 2 gamma m_A v (from the -x), so total momentum is zero. So that works. \n\nThe energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2, as before. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that all four particles have the same gamma. Because if they are moving in opposite directions, their gamma factors would be the same since speed is the same. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be A) 0.77c. But wait, the options have B as 0.96, which is a higher velocity. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy?\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, the antiproton and proton have rest mass energy each of 938 MeV, so total is 1876. The products are four particles each with rest mass 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the total energy of the products must be 1876 MeV. \n\nBut the total energy of the products is the sum of their relativistic energies. So each A particle's energy is gamma * 300 MeV. So 4 gamma * 300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(1200) \u22481.5633, which is what I had. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in natural units where c=1, but the way the question is written, the mass is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV, so that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the antiproton and proton have kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, but not necessarily at rest. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. Let me denote the antiproton's velocity as v_antiproton, which is small. The total initial energy is then (m_p c\u00b2 + K_p) + (gamma_antiproton m_p c\u00b2), where K_p is the proton's kinetic energy. But the proton is presumably at rest, so K_p =0. The antiproton's kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_p c\u00b2. Since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). \n\nBut if the antiproton's speed is small, then its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. So maybe the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, if the antiproton is moving, the total energy would be a bit higher, so gamma would be a bit higher. But since it's \"slowly moving\", the correction is negligible. Therefore, the answer should still be A. \n\nHmm, but why is 0.96 an option? That's a very high velocity. Let me see. If gamma was 3, then v would be sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = ~0.94c. Hmm, so if gamma were 3, then. But in that case, gamma would be 3, so 4*300*3 = 3600 MeV. But initial energy is 1876, so that's way higher. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the rest mass of the proton and antiproton. Let me check their masses. The proton rest mass is indeed about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the proton and antiproton each have a mass of 300 MeV? No, the problem states m_A c\u00b2 =300. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use conservation of momentum in a different way? Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider that in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. The total energy is the sum of the rest masses of proton and antiproton (since their kinetic energy is negligible). Then the products must have zero total momentum. \n\nThe four particles must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me assume two move in +p and two in -p. Each has momentum p. The total momentum is then zero. \n\nThe energy of each particle is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ). Since all four have the same magnitude of momentum, each has the same energy. \n\nTotal energy is 4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ) = 2 m_p c\u00b2 (since the initial energy is sum of proton and antiproton rest masses). \n\nSo setting that equal:\n\n4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (300)^2 ) = 2 * 938 \n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + 90000 ) = 938 \n\nWait, units? Wait, m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV, so m_A\u00b2 c^4 is (300)^2 (MeV)^2. The momentum pc would be in units of MeV (since c is in units where c=1, but perhaps here we need to track units). Hmm, maybe better to write in terms of variables. Let me use units where c=1 for simplicity. Then:\n\nTotal energy equation becomes 4 * sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ) = 2 m_p \n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ) = (2 m_p)/4 = m_p /2 \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me see. Let me use variables properly. Let me denote all energies in MeV. Then m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, but with c=1, m_p is 938 MeV. Similarly, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so m_A is 300 MeV. \n\nSo equation:\n\n4 * sqrt( (p)^2 + (300)^2 ) = 2 * 938 \n\nDivide both sides by 2: \n\n2 * sqrt(p\u00b2 + 300\u00b2) = 938 \n\nThen sqrt(p\u00b2 + 90000) = 938 /2 = 469 \n\nSquare both sides: \n\np\u00b2 + 90000 = (469)^2 \n\nCalculate 469 squared: 400\u00b2 is 160000, 69\u00b2 is 4761, cross term 2*400*69 = 55200. So 160000 +55200 +4761 = 219, 961? Wait, 469^2 = (400 +69)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*69 +69\u00b2 = 160000 + 55200 + 4761 = 160000 +55200 is 215200 +4761 is 219,961. \n\nSo p\u00b2 + 90000 = 219961 \n\np\u00b2 = 219961 - 90000 = 129961 \n\nSo p = sqrt(129961) \n\nWhat's sqrt(129961)? Let me see. 360^2 = 129600. 360^2 is 129600, so sqrt(129961) is 360.5? Let's compute 360.5 squared: (360 +0.5)^2 = 360\u00b2 + 2*360*0.5 +0.25 = 129600 + 360 +0.25 = 129960.25. Oh, exactly. So p is 360.5 MeV/c (since units are in MeV/c when c=1). \n\nSo the momentum of each particle is 360.5 MeV/c. \n\nNow, the velocity can be found from the relation between momentum and energy. \n\nThe energy of each particle is sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 c^4 ) but in natural units (c=1), that's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ). Which we already know is 469 MeV (from above: sqrt(360.5\u00b2 + 300\u00b2 ) = sqrt(129961 +90000)= sqrt(219961)=469). \n\nThe velocity v is given by v = p c / E. \n\nWait, in natural units (c=1), v = p / E. Because momentum p = gamma m v, energy E = gamma m. So p = gamma m v = E v. Therefore, v = p / E. \n\nSo here, p is 360.5 MeV/c (but in natural units, p is 360.5 MeV), and E is 469 MeV. \n\nSo v = (360.5) / 469 \u2248 0.768c. Which matches the earlier result. \n\nSo this also gives approximately 0.768c, so 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. \n\nBut the options include B as 0.96. Maybe I made an error in the initial assumption. Let me check if the question says the antiproton is moving slowly, but perhaps the proton is moving? Wait, the question says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\"\u2014so the proton is presumably at rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the proton and antiproton have kinetic energy. Wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, then its kinetic energy is (\u03b3 -1)m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 (v\u00b2/(2c\u00b2))m_p c\u00b2 = (m_p v\u00b2)/2. But since v is small, that term is negligible compared to the rest mass. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the rest frame of the proton, so the antiproton has some velocity, but because it's slow, the initial kinetic energy is negligible. \n\nHmm, I think the calculation is correct, so the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the number of particles? The reaction produces 2A+ and 2A-. So four particles total. \n\nYes, so 4 particles. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A) 0.77c.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the antiproton is slowly moving, so its kinetic energy is negligible.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me read it again. The question is about the annihilation process p plus antiproton gives two A+ and two A- particles. They tell me that the antiproton is slowly moving and that the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's think. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, that probably means we can treat it as being at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. The proton and antiproton would annihilate each other, creating those particles. So maybe I can model this as a center-of-mass frame problem where the total energy is just the sum of the rest masses?\n\nWait, the proton and antiproton each have a rest mass. The proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, right? So each of them has a rest mass energy of 938 MeV. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is small, so maybe the total energy available is just twice the rest mass of the proton? Because the proton's kinetic energy might be considered negligible too, but maybe they are at rest? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm. So perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving very slowly. In that case, the total energy would be approximately the sum of their rest masses plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since it's slow, maybe we can approximate the total energy as just 2*(938 MeV)? Let me see.\n\nThe products are two A+ and two A- particles. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So each has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. Since there are four particles (two positive and two negative), the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. \n\nWait, but the initial rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. So the total energy from the initial particles (if they are at rest) would be 1876 MeV, but the products' rest mass is 1200. That leaves 676 MeV as kinetic energy? But how does this relate to the velocity of the A particles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial particles are moving, so the total energy is higher. But since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe we can consider that the total energy is roughly the sum of their rest masses. So, the total energy available is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. The products have a rest mass of 4*300=1200 MeV, so the remaining energy must be the kinetic energy of the A particles. But since the A particles are produced in pairs, maybe they move in opposite directions to conserve momentum?\n\nWait, let's think in terms of conservation laws. The total momentum before annihilation must be zero. Because if the antiproton is moving very slowly, and the proton is presumably at rest, then the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton. But if it's \"slowly moving\", maybe we can approximate it as zero? Hmm, but that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, perhaps the proton and antiproton are colliding head-on with equal and opposite momenta, but the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe they are both at rest? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's considered that the initial momentum is negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is considered in the center of mass frame where the total momentum is zero. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the proton is at rest, so the center of mass frame would have some momentum, but maybe the antiproton's speed is so low that the center of mass is approximately at rest? Not sure. Hmm, maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that the initial particles are at rest. Let me try that.\n\nSo assuming both proton and antiproton are at rest (since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe they are both considered at rest?), then their total energy is 2*(938) MeV. The total energy must be equal to the total energy of the four A particles. Since energy is conserved.\n\nEach A particle has energy given by gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since they are moving, their energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. The total energy of the four particles would then be 2*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2) + 2*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the two A+ and two A- each have the same energy if they are moving symmetrically. Since momentum must be conserved, and the initial momentum is zero (if the initial particles are at rest), then the total momentum of the four A particles must also be zero. So they must be moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out. The most straightforward case is that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite direction with equal speeds. Or maybe each pair is opposite. But since they are charged, but the problem doesn't specify direction, so maybe all four have the same speed but opposite momenta. Wait, perhaps they form two pairs moving in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nIn any case, since the total momentum is zero, each pair must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me think of the system's total energy. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles. Since all particles are identical in mass (assuming A+ and A- have the same mass), then each will have the same energy. Wait, but A+ and A- have same mass, so their energies are same. Therefore, each of the four particles has energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, so total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSo setting that equal to the initial energy:\n\n4 * gamma * (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV\n\nSo solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) = (1876)/(1200) \u2248 1.5633\n\nHmm, so gamma is about 1.56. Then to find the velocity, we can compute v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. Let me compute 1/gamma\u00b2 first. 1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.444) \u2248 0.409. Then 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. The square root of that is sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769. So v \u2248 0.769c, which is approximately 0.77c. That would be option A. But let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me verify the energy calculation again. The initial rest mass energy is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. The total energy of the products must equal that. The products are four particles each with energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, so 4*gamma*300. So 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(1200) \u2248 1.5633. So that part is okay.\n\nThen, the velocity is calculated from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So solving for v:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\n=> sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma\n\n=> 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/gamma\u00b2\n\n=> v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2\n\n=> v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in gamma \u22481.5633:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 \u2248 (1/1.5633)^2 \u2248 (0.64)\u00b2? Wait, 1.5633 squared is approximately 2.444, so 1/2.444 \u22480.409. So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. sqrt(0.591) is about sqrt(0.6) is 0.7746, so sqrt(0.591) is slightly less. Let's calculate more accurately:\n\nsqrt(0.591):\n\nLet me see: 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, exactly. 0.77^2 = 0.5929. So sqrt(0.591) is just a bit less than 0.77. Hmm. So maybe 0.769c. So that would be approximately 0.77c. So option A is 0.77c, which is the first option. But wait, the options are A) 0.77c, B)0.96c etc. So that would point to A. But let me see if I made a mistake in the assumption.\n\nWait, but what if the initial particles are not at rest? The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. Then the total initial energy would be a bit more than 2*938 MeV? But since it's slowly moving, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible. So the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the antiproton's kinetic energy is part of the total energy. Let me see: the total energy would be the sum of the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is 938 MeV. The antiproton, moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m_p c\u00b2. Since it's slowly moving, gamma \u22481 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). But maybe the problem wants us to neglect the antiproton's kinetic energy, so that total energy is 2*938. Hence the previous calculation holds. So the answer would be A. \n\nWait, but another thought: when particles annihilate, the products must have enough energy to account for their rest mass and kinetic energy. The calculation seems okay. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming all four particles have the same gamma. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Let me think of two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions with the same speed. So each pair (like two particles going left and two going right) would have their momenta cancel. But each particle's momentum is gamma m v. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So, for example, two particles moving in +x direction and two in -x, each with momentum p and -p. \n\nIn that case, the total momentum is zero. The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles, each of which is gamma m_A c\u00b2. So the total energy is indeed 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the gamma is about 1.563, leading to v \u22480.77c. So option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)0.77, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma:\n\nTotal energy from initial: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal energy of products: 4 * gamma * 300 = 1200 gamma MeV.\n\nSo 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633.\n\nYes. Then v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute 1/gamma squared again: (1/1.5633)^2 \u2248 (0.64) squared? 1.5633 squared is (approx 1.5^2 is 2.25, 1.56^2 is 2.4336). So 1/(2.4336) is ~0.4109. So 1 - 0.4109 = 0.5891. sqrt(0.5891) is sqrt(0.5891). Let me compute that more precisely.\n\nWhat's sqrt(0.5891)? Let me see:\n\n0.77 squared is 0.5929, as before. 0.76 squared is 0.5776. The difference between 0.5776 and 0.5891 is 0.0115. Between 0.76 and 0.77, the value increases by 0.0153 per 0.01 increment. Hmm, so 0.5891 is 0.5776 + 0.0115. So 0.0115 / 0.0153 \u2248 0.75 of the interval. So approx 0.76 + 0.0075 \u2248 0.7675. So about 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c. So that would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a calculator for better precision. Let's compute sqrt(0.5891):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5891):\n\nLet me note that sqrt(0.5929) is exactly 0.77. Since 0.5891 is 0.5929 minus 0.0038. Let me use a Taylor expansion around x=0.5929:\n\nLet f(x) = sqrt(x). Let x0 =0.5929, f(x0)=0.77. We want f(x0 - 0.0038). The derivative f\u2019(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So f(x0 - \u0394x) \u2248 f(x0) - (\u0394x)/(2 f(x0)).\n\n\u0394x is 0.0038. So:\n\nApproximate sqrt(0.5891) \u2248 0.77 - (0.0038)/(2 * 0.77) = 0.77 - (0.0038)/(1.54) \u2248 0.77 - 0.002467 \u2248 0.7675. So about 0.7675c, which is ~0.77c. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe considering that the kinetic energy is shared between the four particles. Wait, but the problem says \"what is the velocity of particle A\". Since all particles are the same mass and the system is symmetric, they should all have the same speed, so the velocity is the same. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total momentum is zero, so each pair must have equal and opposite momenta, but maybe I need to do a more detailed calculation with vectors? Let me think. Let's assume that the two A+ and two A- particles are moving in two opposite directions with equal speeds. Let me suppose that two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction. Each has momentum gamma m_A v. The total momentum is then 2 gamma m_A v (from the +x particles) minus 2 gamma m_A v (from the -x), so total momentum is zero. So that works. \n\nThe energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2, as before. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that all four particles have the same gamma. Because if they are moving in opposite directions, their gamma factors would be the same since speed is the same. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be A) 0.77c. But wait, the options have B as 0.96, which is a higher velocity. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy?\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, the antiproton and proton have rest mass energy each of 938 MeV, so total is 1876. The products are four particles each with rest mass 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the total energy of the products must be 1876 MeV. \n\nBut the total energy of the products is the sum of their relativistic energies. So each A particle's energy is gamma * 300 MeV. So 4 gamma * 300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(1200) \u22481.5633, which is what I had. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in natural units where c=1, but the way the question is written, the mass is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV, so that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the antiproton and proton have kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, but not necessarily at rest. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. Let me denote the antiproton's velocity as v_antiproton, which is small. The total initial energy is then (m_p c\u00b2 + K_p) + (gamma_antiproton m_p c\u00b2), where K_p is the proton's kinetic energy. But the proton is presumably at rest, so K_p =0. The antiproton's kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_p c\u00b2. Since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). \n\nBut if the antiproton's speed is small, then its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. So maybe the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, if the antiproton is moving, the total energy would be a bit higher, so gamma would be a bit higher. But since it's \"slowly moving\", the correction is negligible. Therefore, the answer should still be A. \n\nHmm, but why is 0.96 an option? That's a very high velocity. Let me see. If gamma was 3, then v would be sqrt(1 - 1/9) = sqrt(8/9) = ~0.94c. Hmm, so if gamma were 3, then. But in that case, gamma would be 3, so 4*300*3 = 3600 MeV. But initial energy is 1876, so that's way higher. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the rest mass of the proton and antiproton. Let me check their masses. The proton rest mass is indeed about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the proton and antiproton each have a mass of 300 MeV? No, the problem states m_A c\u00b2 =300. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use conservation of momentum in a different way? Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider that in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. The total energy is the sum of the rest masses of proton and antiproton (since their kinetic energy is negligible). Then the products must have zero total momentum. \n\nThe four particles must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me assume two move in +p and two in -p. Each has momentum p. The total momentum is then zero. \n\nThe energy of each particle is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ). Since all four have the same magnitude of momentum, each has the same energy. \n\nTotal energy is 4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c\u00b2)^2 ) = 2 m_p c\u00b2 (since the initial energy is sum of proton and antiproton rest masses). \n\nSo setting that equal:\n\n4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (300)^2 ) = 2 * 938 \n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + 90000 ) = 938 \n\nWait, units? Wait, m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV, so m_A\u00b2 c^4 is (300)^2 (MeV)^2. The momentum pc would be in units of MeV (since c is in units where c=1, but perhaps here we need to track units). Hmm, maybe better to write in terms of variables. Let me use units where c=1 for simplicity. Then:\n\nTotal energy equation becomes 4 * sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ) = 2 m_p \n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ) = (2 m_p)/4 = m_p /2 \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me see. Let me use variables properly. Let me denote all energies in MeV. Then m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, but with c=1, m_p is 938 MeV. Similarly, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so m_A is 300 MeV. \n\nSo equation:\n\n4 * sqrt( (p)^2 + (300)^2 ) = 2 * 938 \n\nDivide both sides by 2: \n\n2 * sqrt(p\u00b2 + 300\u00b2) = 938 \n\nThen sqrt(p\u00b2 + 90000) = 938 /2 = 469 \n\nSquare both sides: \n\np\u00b2 + 90000 = (469)^2 \n\nCalculate 469 squared: 400\u00b2 is 160000, 69\u00b2 is 4761, cross term 2*400*69 = 55200. So 160000 +55200 +4761 = 219, 961? Wait, 469^2 = (400 +69)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*69 +69\u00b2 = 160000 + 55200 + 4761 = 160000 +55200 is 215200 +4761 is 219,961. \n\nSo p\u00b2 + 90000 = 219961 \n\np\u00b2 = 219961 - 90000 = 129961 \n\nSo p = sqrt(129961) \n\nWhat's sqrt(129961)? Let me see. 360^2 = 129600. 360^2 is 129600, so sqrt(129961) is 360.5? Let's compute 360.5 squared: (360 +0.5)^2 = 360\u00b2 + 2*360*0.5 +0.25 = 129600 + 360 +0.25 = 129960.25. Oh, exactly. So p is 360.5 MeV/c (since units are in MeV/c when c=1). \n\nSo the momentum of each particle is 360.5 MeV/c. \n\nNow, the velocity can be found from the relation between momentum and energy. \n\nThe energy of each particle is sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 c^4 ) but in natural units (c=1), that's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_A\u00b2 ). Which we already know is 469 MeV (from above: sqrt(360.5\u00b2 + 300\u00b2 ) = sqrt(129961 +90000)= sqrt(219961)=469). \n\nThe velocity v is given by v = p c / E. \n\nWait, in natural units (c=1), v = p / E. Because momentum p = gamma m v, energy E = gamma m. So p = gamma m v = E v. Therefore, v = p / E. \n\nSo here, p is 360.5 MeV/c (but in natural units, p is 360.5 MeV), and E is 469 MeV. \n\nSo v = (360.5) / 469 \u2248 0.768c. Which matches the earlier result. \n\nSo this also gives approximately 0.768c, so 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. \n\nBut the options include B as 0.96. Maybe I made an error in the initial assumption. Let me check if the question says the antiproton is moving slowly, but perhaps the proton is moving? Wait, the question says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\"\u2014so the proton is presumably at rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the proton and antiproton have kinetic energy. Wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, then its kinetic energy is (\u03b3 -1)m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 (v\u00b2/(2c\u00b2))m_p c\u00b2 = (m_p v\u00b2)/2. But since v is small, that term is negligible compared to the rest mass. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the rest frame of the proton, so the antiproton has some velocity, but because it's slow, the initial kinetic energy is negligible. \n\nHmm, I think the calculation is correct, so the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the number of particles? The reaction produces 2A+ and 2A-. So four particles total. \n\nYes, so 4 particles. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A) 0.77c.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the antiproton is slowly moving, so its kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is thus the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton: \\(2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}\\). The products are four particles (two \\(A^+\\) and two \\(A^-\\)), each with rest mass energy \\(300 \\, \\text{MeV}\\). \n\nThe total energy of the products must equal the initial energy. Let \\(\\gamma\\) be the Lorentz factor of each particle. The total energy of the four particles is \\(4 \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}\\). Setting this equal to the initial energy gives:\n\n\\[\n4 \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633\n\\]\n\nThe velocity \\(v\\) of the particles is found using the relation:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(v\\):\n\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\gamma \\approx 1.5633\\):\n\n\\[\nv \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} \\approx c \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.77c\n\\]\n\nThus, the velocity of particle \\(A\\) is closest to **0.77c**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. The reaction given is a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two positively charged A particles and two negatively charged ones. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Hmm, right, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe I can assume it's at rest? Wait, but the proton must have some velocity? Wait, no, if the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the system's total momentum is negligible? Or perhaps since it's a slow-moving antiproton, we can approximate that the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton?\n\nLet me think. The annihilation process converts mass into energy. The proton and antiproton at rest would each have rest mass energy. The total energy available would be the sum of their rest masses. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass? So the total energy would be approximately 2*(mass of proton)*c\u00b2. But the proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, right? So that's 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But then the products are two A+ and two A-, each with mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So each A particle has rest mass energy 300 MeV. So total rest mass of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. So there's some energy left over, which must be kinetic energy of the A particles.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible. Let me assume that both the proton and antiproton are at rest. Wait, but they can't both be at rest if they're annihilating, unless they are colliding head-on. Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a small velocity? Hmm, but perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Since the antiproton is slow, maybe the proton's momentum is negligible, so the total momentum is approximately the antiproton's, which is small. Alternatively, perhaps we can take the rest frame of the proton and antiproton system. Wait, maybe the problem wants us to assume that the initial momentum is zero. Because when they annihilate, the products must have zero net momentum. Because if the antiproton is slowly moving, then the initial momentum is approximately the proton's momentum plus the antiproton's. But if they are approaching each other, maybe their momenta cancel. Wait, perhaps the problem wants us to consider the case where the total initial momentum is zero. Because otherwise, calculating the velocity would depend on the frame. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the total energy is approximately the sum of their rest masses. Let me proceed under that assumption. So the total energy available is (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2. Since proton and antiproton have the same mass, that's 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The products are four particles, each of mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. So the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. This excess energy must be the kinetic energy of the particles. Since the particles are moving, their total energy is the sum of their rest mass and kinetic energy. \n\nBut how does this distribute? Since the products are two positive and two negative, maybe they are moving symmetrically. Let me assume that all four particles have the same speed and direction? No, probably they move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Wait, the total momentum must be zero. So maybe each pair (like A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions with the same speed? Or maybe all four are moving symmetrically in such a way that their momenta cancel out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame (where the initial momentum is zero), the products must have zero net momentum. So the four particles must have momenta that cancel each other. Since they are two positive and two negative, perhaps they form a symmetric configuration. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed. Let's assume that all four particles have the same speed v, and their momenta cancel. For instance, two moving in +x and two in -x, each with momentum p, so total momentum is (2p - 2p) = 0. So each of the four particles has momentum p. \n\nSo the total energy from the products is the sum of their total energies. Each particle's total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since there are four particles, total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. This must equal the initial energy, which is 2*m_p c\u00b2 (assuming both proton and antiproton are at rest). Wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the initial energy is slightly more than 2*m_p c\u00b2. Hmm, but perhaps the problem wants us to approximate that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so initial energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nSo setting 4*gamma*(300) = 1876. Then, gamma = 1876/(4*300) = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nThen, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So:\n\n1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1.5633\n\nTake reciprocal:\n\nsqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64.\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 0.4096\n\nThen v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904\n\nSo v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768. Which is approximately 0.77c. That's option A. \n\nWait, but the options include 0.96c, which is higher. Hmm, did I do the calculation right?\n\nWait let me check the numbers again. 1876 divided by 4*300 is indeed 1876 / 1200. Let me compute that again:\n\n4 * 300 = 1200. 1876 divided by 1200. Let's see, 1200 * 1.5 = 1800, so 1876-1800 is 76. 76/1200 = ~0.0633. So total is 1.5633. Correct.\n\nThen 1/1.5633 is approximately 0.64. Squared gives 0.4096. 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904. Square root of that is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904). Let's see, sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so sqrt(0.59) is a bit less. 0.768 squared is 0.5898, yes. So approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A. \n\nBut wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Did I make an assumption that they are both at rest? Because if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, then the initial momentum isn't zero. But maybe the problem expects us to ignore that and take the rest frame where the total momentum is zero? Because otherwise, the calculation would be more complicated. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, the kinetic energy is small, so the total energy is still approximately the sum of the rest masses. So maybe the approach is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are at rest. Then the calculation is correct, giving 0.77c. So the answer would be A. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The rest mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so two of them sum to 1876. The four A particles have a total rest mass of 1200. So the excess energy is 676 MeV. This excess energy must be the kinetic energy of the four particles. Each A has kinetic energy (gamma -1)*m_A c\u00b2. So total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma -1)*300 = 4*(gamma*300 - 300) = 4*gamma*300 - 1200. But the total energy is 4*gamma*300 = 1876. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. Which matches. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Then the velocity is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)) c. Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. \n\ngamma is 1.5633. So 1/gamma squared is (0.64)^2 = 0.4096, so 1-0.4096 = 0.5904, sqrt of that is ~0.768c. So yes. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B as 0.96c. Maybe I messed up the rest mass of the proton? Wait, wait a second, perhaps the proton and antiproton have rest mass energy 938 MeV each, so total 1876. But maybe the problem is considering that the antiproton is at rest and the proton is moving? No, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all four particles have the same speed? What if the particles are produced in pairs with some other configuration? But the problem states 2A+ and 2A-, so maybe they are moving in opposite directions. But regardless, the total momentum must be zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects relativistic momentum considerations. Let me think again. Let's denote variables properly. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the rest mass of proton as m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2. The antiproton has the same mass. So initial total energy is (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final products are four particles, each with mass m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Let\u2019s denote their speeds as v. Assuming all particles have the same speed, but moving in directions such that the total momentum cancels. \n\nEach particle's momentum is gamma m_A v. Since there are two moving in each direction, the total momentum would be 2 gamma m_A v (from one direction) minus 2 gamma m_A v (from the opposite), so net zero. \n\nTherefore, each particle's momentum is gamma m_A v. The total energy from all four is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSetting this equal to the initial energy:\n\n4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A)\n\nWait, wait, let me do the algebra again. \n\nTotal energy after reaction: 4 * (gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \n\nSet equal to initial energy 2 m_p c\u00b2:\n\n4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p c\u00b2)/(4 m_A c\u00b2) = m_p/(2 m_A)\n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nm_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\ngamma = 938/(2 * 300) = 938 / 600 \u2248 1.5633. Which matches the earlier calculation. \n\nSo gamma is correct, so the velocity calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but why is 0.96c an option? Let me see. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the proton. Wait, maybe the problem is using a different mass for the proton? Or perhaps I miscalculated the square root. Let me recalculate the velocity. \n\ngamma is 1.5633. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nSo sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64\n\nThen, 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = (0.64)^2 \u2248 0.4096\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768, so 0.77c. So the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the relativistic kinetic energy formula differently? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other, so their kinetic energy adds? But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But then the total energy would be m_p c\u00b2 + m_pbar c\u00b2 + KE_pbar. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, KE_pbar is negligible, so the initial energy is still ~ 2*938. \n\nHmm, perhaps the error is in assuming that the rest mass of the proton is 938. Let me confirm. Yes, proton rest mass energy is approximately 938 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants to use the invariant quantity, like the total energy squared minus momentum squared. Let me try that approach. \n\nIn the center of mass frame, the total initial momentum is zero. The total energy is 2m_p c\u00b2. The final state has four particles with total energy 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 and momentum zero. \n\nThe invariant mass squared (s) is (E_total)^2 - (pc)^2. Since momentum is zero, s = (E_total)^2. \n\nSo initial s = (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 \n\nFinal s = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 \n\nThese must be equal, so:\n\n(2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 \n\nTake square roots both sides:\n\n2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \n\nWhich gives the same equation as before. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be A) 0.77c. So the options given include that as option A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. The reaction given is a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two positively charged A particles and two negatively charged ones. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Hmm, right, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe I can assume it's at rest? Wait, but the proton must have some velocity? Wait, no, if the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the system's total momentum is negligible? Or perhaps since it's a slow-moving antiproton, we can approximate that the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton?\n\nLet me think. The annihilation process converts mass into energy. The proton and antiproton at rest would each have rest mass energy. The total energy available would be the sum of their rest masses. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass? So the total energy would be approximately 2*(mass of proton)*c\u00b2. But the proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, right? So that's 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But then the products are two A+ and two A-, each with mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So each A particle has rest mass energy 300 MeV. So total rest mass of the products is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. So there's some energy left over, which must be kinetic energy of the A particles.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible. Let me assume that both the proton and antiproton are at rest. Wait, but they can't both be at rest if they're annihilating, unless they are colliding head-on. Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a small velocity? Hmm, but perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. Since the antiproton is slow, maybe the proton's momentum is negligible, so the total momentum is approximately the antiproton's, which is small. Alternatively, perhaps we can take the rest frame of the proton and antiproton system. Wait, maybe the problem wants us to assume that the initial momentum is zero. Because when they annihilate, the products must have zero net momentum. Because if the antiproton is slowly moving, then the initial momentum is approximately the proton's momentum plus the antiproton's. But if they are approaching each other, maybe their momenta cancel. Wait, perhaps the problem wants us to consider the case where the total initial momentum is zero. Because otherwise, calculating the velocity would depend on the frame. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the total energy is approximately the sum of their rest masses. Let me proceed under that assumption. So the total energy available is (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2. Since proton and antiproton have the same mass, that's 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The products are four particles, each of mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. So the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. This excess energy must be the kinetic energy of the particles. Since the particles are moving, their total energy is the sum of their rest mass and kinetic energy. \n\nBut how does this distribute? Since the products are two positive and two negative, maybe they are moving symmetrically. Let me assume that all four particles have the same speed and direction? No, probably they move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Wait, the total momentum must be zero. So maybe each pair (like A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions with the same speed?

For instance, two moving in +x and two in -x, each with momentum p, so total momentum is (2p - 2p) = 0. So each of the four particles has momentum p. \n\nSo the total energy from the products is the sum of their total energies. Each particle's total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since there are four particles, total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. This must equal the initial energy, which is 2*m_p c\u00b2 (assuming both proton and antiproton are at rest). Wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe the initial energy is slightly more than 2*m_p c\u00b2. Hmm, but perhaps the problem wants us to approximate that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so initial energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nSo setting 4*gamma*(300) = 1876. Then, gamma = 1876/(4*300) = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nThen, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2).

Which is approximately 0.77c. That's option A. \n\nWait, but the options include 0.96c, which is higher. Hmm, did I do the calculation right?\n\nWait let me check the numbers again. 1876 divided by 4*300 is indeed 1876 / 1200. Let me compute that again:\n\n4 * 300 = 1200. 1876 divided by 1200. Let's see, 1200 * 1.5 = 1800, so 1876-1800 is 76. 76/1200 = ~0.0633. So total is 1.5633. Correct.\n\nThen 1/1.5633 is approximately 0.64. Squared gives 0.4096. 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904. Square root of that is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904). Let's see, sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so sqrt(0.59) is a bit less. 0.768 squared is 0.5898, yes. So approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A. \n\nBut wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Did I make an assumption that they are both at rest?

The four A particles have a total rest mass of 1200. So the excess energy is 676 MeV. This excess energy must be the kinetic energy of the four particles. Each A has kinetic energy (gamma -1)*m_A c\u00b2. So total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma -1)*300 = 4*(gamma*300 - 300) = 4*gamma*300 - 1200. But the total energy is 4*gamma*300 = 1876. So the kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. Which matches. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Then the velocity is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)) c. Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. \n\ngamma is 1.5633. So 1/gamma squared is (0.64)^2 = 0.4096, so 1-0.4096 = 0.5904, sqrt of that is ~0.768c. So yes. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B as 0.96c. Maybe I messed up the rest mass of the proton? Wait, wait a second, perhaps the proton and antiproton have rest mass energy 938 MeV each, so total 1876. But maybe the problem is considering that the antiproton is at rest and the proton is moving?

Let's denote variables properly. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the rest mass of proton as m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2. The antiproton has the same mass. So initial total energy is (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final products are four particles, each with mass m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Let\u2019s denote their speeds as v. Assuming all particles have the same speed, but moving in directions such that the total momentum cancels. \n\nEach particle's momentum is gamma m_A v. Since there are two moving in each direction, the total momentum would be 2 gamma m_A v (from one direction) minus 2 gamma m_A v (from the opposite), so net zero. \n\nTherefore, each particle's momentum is gamma m_A v. The total energy from all four is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSetting this equal to the initial energy:\n\n4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A)\n\nWait, wait, let me do the algebra again. \n\nTotal energy after reaction: 4 * (gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \n\nSet equal to initial energy 2 m_p c\u00b2:\n\n4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p c\u00b2)/(4 m_A c\u00b2) = m_p/(2 m_A)\n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nm_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\ngamma = 938/(2 * 300) = 938 / 600 \u2248 1.5633.

So the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the relativistic kinetic energy formula differently? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other, so their kinetic energy adds? But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But then the total energy would be m_p c\u00b2 + m_pbar c\u00b2 + KE_pbar. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, KE_pbar is negligible, so the initial energy is still ~ 2*938. \n\nHmm, perhaps the error is in assuming that the rest mass of the proton is 938. Let me confirm. Yes, proton rest mass energy is approximately 938 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants to use the invariant quantity, like the total energy squared minus momentum squared.

Thus, the total initial energy is \\( 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\nThe products are four particles (two \\( A^+ \\) and two \\( A^- \\)), each with rest mass energy \\( 300 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). The total rest mass energy of the products is \\( 4 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). The remaining energy \\( 1876 \\, \\text{MeV} - 1200 \\, \\text{MeV} = 676 \\, \\text{MeV} \\) must be the kinetic energy of the particles.\n\nUsing conservation of energy, the total energy of the products is given by \\( 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor. Setting this equal to the initial energy:\n\n\\[\n4 \\gamma (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{4 \\times 300} \\approx 1.5633\n\\]\n\nThe Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\). Solving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1.5633} \\approx 0.64\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 - v^2/c^2 \\approx 0.4096 \\implies v^2/c^2 \\approx 0.5904 \\implies v \\approx \\sqrt{0.5904} \\, c \\approx 0.768c\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the velocity is approximately \\( 0.77c \\), corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
