      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about determining the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and cosmological parameters. Let me start by recalling what each part means.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a drop at shorter wavelengths. Wait, the peak might be related to some emission line. Oh right, quasars often have strong emission lines like Lyman-alpha, which is usually around 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But here the observed peak is at 790 nm. If that's the case, then the redshift can be calculated. Let's see: the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the rest wavelength \u03bb_rest by (1 + z) = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest. \n\nAssuming the peak is Lyman-alpha, the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So (1+z) = 790 / 121.6 \u2248 6.5. Therefore, z \u2248 5.5. But I should confirm if that's the correct assumption. The question mentions that at shorter wavelengths (<790 nm) the flux drops. Since Lyman-alpha is a strong emission line, if it's observed at 790 nm, then the line is redshifted. That makes sense. So the redshift z is around 5.5.\n\nNow, the next part is using the Lambda-CDM model parameters to find the comoving distance. The parameters given are H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density \u03a9_m=0.3, dark energy \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so \u03a9_total=1). \n\nComoving distance (also called comoving radial distance) for a flat universe is given by the integral from 0 to z of [c / H0] * (1/(sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda))) dz. But this integral doesn't have an analytical solution, so we need to approximate or use a calculator. Alternatively, maybe there's a standard approximation or a way to estimate it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect using the approximation for high redshift, but since z is about 5.5, which isn't extremely high but maybe manageable. Wait, perhaps the question expects using the angular diameter distance or luminosity distance? Wait, the question specifically asks for comoving distance. Let me recall the definitions:\n\nComoving distance is the distance to the object in today's coordinates. For a flat universe, the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of (c/H0) * (1/E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use different parametrizations. Since calculating this integral requires either a calculator or a lookup table, maybe in the context of a multiple-choice question, they expect an approximate value based on standard values or maybe using a simplified formula?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using the approximation for the matter-dominated era, but with dark energy, so maybe not. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to use the Hubble distance (c/H0) and multiply by some factor based on redshift. But the Hubble distance is about 4250 Mpc (since H0=70, so c/(70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc) \u2248 4286 Mpc \u2248 4.286 Gpc). But the comoving distance at high z is more than that. Wait, but for high redshift, the comoving distance depends on the expansion history. Since the universe is accelerating now (due to dark energy), but at higher redshifts (like z=5.5) the matter density was more dominant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. The integral can be expressed as:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+x)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda)] dx/(1+x)\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The integral is:\n\nD_C = c/H0 \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+x) sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+x)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) ] dx \n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the exact form. Let me recall the formula for the comoving distance. The formula is:\n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] \n\nBut in terms of redshift, since 1 + z = a_0/a(t), so dz/dt = -H(z)(1 + z). So substituting variables, the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1 / ( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz \n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda )\n\nTherefore, the integral is from 0 to z of [1/( (1+z) sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) ] dz multiplied by c/H0.\n\nHmm, this is complicated. Since I can't compute this integral by hand here, perhaps the question expects me to use an approximate value or a standard redshift-distance relation? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate value for z=5.5 with given parameters. Let me see if I can estimate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate formula for the scale factor. Wait, but maybe the options are close enough that using an approximate method would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to recall that for a flat universe with \u03a9_m=0.3 and \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5.5 is around 8-9 Gpc. Let me think of some standard distances. \n\nWait, I remember that for high redshift objects, the comoving distance can be up to ~9-10 Gpc for z around 6-7. Let me see, for example, the cosmic microwave background is at z ~ 1100, but that's way higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall some approximate values. For instance, the comoving distance for z=2 is roughly 7 Gpc, and z=3 is about 9 Gpc? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the luminosity distance and then convert it to comoving.\n\nWait, the luminosity distance D_L is related to the comoving distance D_C by D_L = (1+z)^2 D_C. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a standard table or approximate values. Let me try to think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the Hubble distance multiplied by some factor. The Hubble distance is ~4.28 Gpc. But for a redshift of 5.5, the comoving distance would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation for a matter-dominated universe (ignoring dark energy), which would give D_C \u2248 (c/H0) * (2/3)(1+z)^(3/2) - 2/3. But that's only valid when dark energy is negligible, which at z=5.5 (since dark energy becomes significant at lower redshifts, like z<1), so maybe that's okay? Let me try that. \n\nWait, in a matter-dominated universe (\u03a9_m=1), the scale factor a(t) grows as t^(2/3). The Hubble parameter H(z) = H0*(1+z)^(3/2). The comoving distance would be (c/H0) \u222b0^z [1/( (1+z)*(H(z)/H0) ) ] dz. Wait, substituting H(z)= H0*(1+z)^3/(2E(z))? Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, if we ignore dark energy (assuming \u03a9_Lambda=0), then E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3). Then the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z) * (1+z)^(3/2) ) ] dz \n\nWait, that would be:\n\n= (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z)^(5/2) ) ] dz \n\nWhich integrates to (c/H0) * [ (1+z)^(-3/2) * (-2/3) ) ] from 0 to z \n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me see:\n\n\u222b [ (1+z)^{-5/2} dz ] \n\nLet u = 1+z, then du = dz. So integral becomes \u222b u^{-5/2} du = (-2/3) u^{-3/2} + C \n\nThus the integral from 0 to z is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ] from 1 to (1+z):\n\n[ -2/(3 (1+z)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*1) ]\n\nSo overall:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) * [ 2/(3) - 2/(3 (1+z)^{3/2} ) ]\n\n= (c/H0) * (2/3)[1 - 1/(1+z)^{3/2} ]\n\nSo, if \u03a9_m=1 (matter-dominated), then the comoving distance at z would be that expression. But in our case, the actual universe has \u03a9_m=0.3, so dark energy is present. But maybe this gives an estimate. Let's try with z=5.5.\n\nPlugging in z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. \n\nSo 1/(6.5)^{3/2} = 1/(sqrt(6.5)^3) \n\nsqrt(6.5) \u2248 2.55, so 2.55^3 \u2248 16.58. So 1/(6.5)^{3/2} \u2248 1/16.58 \u2248 0.0603.\n\nThus the term inside becomes [1 - 0.0603] = 0.9397. Multiply by 2/3 gives 0.6265. \n\nThen D_C \u2248 (c/H0)*0.6265 \n\nc/H0 is 4286 Mpc (since c=3e5 km/s, so 3e5 /70 \u22484285.7 Mpc). So 4286 * 0.6265 \u2248 2689 Mpc, which is about 2.69 Gpc. But that's way too low. Wait, but this is under a matter-only universe, but in reality with dark energy, the expansion is accelerating, so the actual distance should be larger. So this approach is underestimating.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach isn't the right way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. I recall that there's an approximation for the luminosity distance, but perhaps I can find an approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Python code to calculate the integral numerically. But since I can't do that here, perhaps I can recall that for z=5.5 with these parameters, the comoving distance is about 8-9 Gpc. Let me see if I can find some standard values.\n\nWait, let me think of the current comoving distance to the particle horizon. The particle horizon's comoving distance is the maximum possible, which for our universe is around 15-20 Gpc. But for z=5.5, it's less than that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the age of the universe. The age of the universe in a Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, \u03a9_m=0.3 is about 13.8 billion years. Wait, actually, the standard age is around 13.8 Gyr, so maybe that's correct. \n\nThe light travel time to the quasar is the lookback time, which is the time since the light was emitted. But the comoving distance is related to that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula for comoving distance. \n\nAnother approach: Let me look up approximate values for comoving distances. \n\nWait, for example, the Planck 2018 results give some parameters similar to this question (H0=67.4, but close enough). Let me see, maybe some standard redshifts and distances. \n\nFor instance, at z=2, the comoving distance is roughly 8 Gpc? Not sure. Wait, maybe I can think of the following:\n\nIf I recall that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc? Wait no, that seems low. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the calculator from the University of Oregon's cosmology calculator (online), but since I can't access it, I need to think through.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the Hubble parameter at high redshift (z=5.5) is dominated by matter, so E(z) \u2248 sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3). \n\nCalculating that: 6.5 cubed is 274.625. 0.3 * 274.625 \u2248 82.3875. sqrt of that is \u22489.08. So E(z)= ~9.08. \n\nWait, but E(z) is sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). Wait, but at high z, the dark energy term is negligible. So at z=5.5, the dark energy term (0.7) is much smaller than the matter term (0.3*(6.5)^3 \u224882.38). So indeed, the E(z) is sqrt(82.38) \u22489.08. \n\nSo, the integrand at high redshift (near z=5.5) would be dominated by the matter term, so the integral from, say, z=0 to 5.5 would have most of its contribution from the lower redshifts where dark energy is important. Hmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the approximation that at high redshift, the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) * (2/(3 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) (1+z)^{3/2} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in a matter-dominated universe, the comoving distance at high z would be (c/H0)*(2/3)(1+z)^{3/2} - 2/3, but as before that gives 2.6 Gpc, but since dark energy makes the expansion accelerate, the actual distance would be larger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for z=5.5, the comoving distance is around 8-9 Gpc. Let me see. \n\nLooking at the options given (6,8,9,7 Gpc). Let me think of some approximate values. \n\nSuppose I consider that the angular diameter distance D_A is related to the comoving distance by D_A = D_C / (1+z). So if I could get the angular diameter distance, then multiply by (1+z) to get D_C. \n\nAlternatively, for a flat universe, the luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C. \n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the luminosity distance in a flat universe:\n\nD_L(z) = (c/H0) * (1+z) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(x)] dx \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the luminosity distance is D_L = (1+z) * D_C. \n\nAssuming that, then if I can get an approximate value for D_L at z=5.5, then divide by (1+z) to get D_C. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for z=1, the luminosity distance in a flat universe with these parameters would be about 4 Gpc. For z=2, maybe 8 Gpc? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that the luminosity distance for z=1.5 is around 3 Gpc? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the relation between the redshift and the scale factor. Wait, but without more info, perhaps I should think of the options. \n\nThe options are 6,8,9,7 Gpc. The Hubble distance is ~4.28 Gpc. The comoving distance must be larger than the Hubble distance times (1+z) or something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the age of the universe. The lookback time to z=5.5 would be the age of the universe minus the time since then. Let's see: the age of the universe is ~13.8 Gyr. The lookback time at z=5.5 would be the time since emission. Let me see, but how to compute that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate formula for the age of the universe:\n\nt_age = (2/(3 H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) ) * (1+z)^(3/2) ??? No, that's for matter-dominated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too involved, and I need to think that the answer is 8 or 9 Gpc. Since the redshift is ~5.5, which is high. \n\nLooking at the options, 9 Gpc is an option (C) and 8 is B. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the question is from an exam where standard values are used. For example, in the Planck cosmology with similar parameters, a quasar at z=6 has a comoving distance of ~ 9 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe at z=5.5, the comoving distance would be around 8 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, I think the correct answer is C) 9 Gpc. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's see. \n\nSuppose that for a redshift z=5.5, using a cosmology calculator. Let me try to do a rough approximation. \n\nThe integral for D_C is (c/H0) times the integral from 0 to z of 1/( (1+z') sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) dz'.\n\nLet me approximate this integral by splitting it into two parts: from z=0 to z=1 where dark energy is significant, and from z=1 to z=5.5 where matter dominates. \n\nFirst, compute the integral from 0 to 1:\n\nAt low redshift, say up to z=1, the E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). Let's compute E(z) at z=0: sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1. At z=1, sqrt(0.3*(8)+0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.76. \n\nThe integral from 0 to 1 of [1/( (1+z)*E(z) )] dz. \n\nApproximate this using trapezoidal rule with a few points. Let me take z=0,0.5,1.\n\nAt z=0: integrand is 1/(1*1)=1.\n\nAt z=0.5: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*3.375 +0.7)= sqrt(1.0125 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=~1.308.\n\nSo integrand at 0.5: 1/(1.5 *1.308)= ~1/(1.962)= ~0.510.\n\nAt z=1: integrand is 1/(2 *1.76)= ~0.284.\n\nUsing trapezoidal between 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0 to 0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.510 is 0.755, multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.3775.\n\nSecond interval (0.5 to1):\n\nAverage of 0.510 and 0.284 is 0.397, multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.1985.\n\nTotal for 0 to1: 0.3775+0.1985\u22480.576.\n\nNow, the integral from z=1 to z=5.5 where matter dominates (since dark energy term is negligible). So E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nSo the integrand here is 1/( (1+z)*sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3) ) = 1/( (1+z) * (1+z)^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3) )) \n\n= 1/( (1+z)^(5/2) * sqrt(0.3) )\n\nThus, the integral from z=1 to z=5.5:\n\nLet me make substitution u=1+z. Then the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=2}^{6.5} [1/( u^(5/2) * sqrt(0.3) ) ] du\n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-5/2} du from 2 to6.5\n\nThe integral of u^{-5/2} is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ]\n\nThus the integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ -2/(3*(6.5)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*(2)^{3/2}) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term at upper limit (6.5):\n\n6.5^(3/2) = sqrt(6.5)^3 \u2248 2.55^3\u224816.58. So 1/16.58 \u22480.0603. Multiply by -2/(3*16.58) \u2192 Wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait the integral is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ] evaluated from 2 to 6.5:\n\nSo the value is [ -2/(3*(6.5)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*(2)^{3/2}) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -2/(3 *16.58) \u2248 -2/(49.74) \u2248-0.0402\n\nSecond term: 2/(3*(2.828)) \u22482/(8.485)\u22480.2357\n\nTotal: ( -0.0402 +0.2357 ) = 0.1955 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3): sqrt(0.3)\u22480.5477, so 1/0.5477\u22481.825. \n\nSo 0.1955 *1.825 \u22480.3566 \n\nThus the integral from z=1 to5.5 is ~0.3566.\n\nAdding the two parts: 0.576 (from 0-1) +0.3566 (from1-5.5)= ~0.9326 \n\nTotal integral over all z is ~0.9326. \n\nMultiply by c/H0: c/H0 is 4286 Mpc. So 4286 *0.9326 \u2248 4286*0.9=3857, 4286*0.0326\u2248140 \u2192 total ~4000 Mpc. \n\nWait, 4000 Mpc is 4 Gpc. That can't be right because that's less than the Hubble distance. But this can't be correct. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, the integral result was 0.9326, but the units: the integral is in terms of (1/E(z) dz/(1+z)), so the total integral is 0.9326, then multiplied by (c/H0) gives the comoving distance. \n\nWait, but c/H0 is ~4286 Mpc. So 0.9326 *4286 \u2248 4000 Mpc =4 Gpc. That can't be right because for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be much larger. \n\nHmm, clearly my approximation is wrong. Maybe splitting the integral that way isn't sufficient. \n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the substitution. Let me check again:\n\nWait, in the integral from z=1 to z=5.5, I considered E(z) as sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). But that's only valid when dark energy term is negligible. Let me check at z=5.5, the dark energy term is 0.7, and matter term is 0.3*(6.5)^3\u224882.38. So sqrt(82.38+0.7)=sqrt(83.08)=~9.115. So E(z)= ~9.115. So the integrand at z=5.5 is 1/( (1+5.5)*E(z) )= 1/(6.5 *9.115)\u22481/59.25\u22480.0169. \n\nBut in my earlier approach, I assumed E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3)=sqrt(82.38)=~9.076, which is correct. So that part is okay. \n\nWait, but the integral from 1 to5.5 was calculated as 0.3566. The first part (0-1) gave ~0.576. So total integral is ~0.9326, leading to ~4 Gpc. But that can't be right because the Hubble distance is 4.28 Gpc, and for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be larger. \n\nHmm. So maybe my approximation for the integral from 0-1 was too low? Let me recheck that part. \n\nThe integral from 0 to1 of [1/( (1+z) E(z) )] dz. \n\nI used trapezoidal with points at 0,0.5,1. Let me recalculate more precisely:\n\nAt z=0: integrand is 1/(1*sqrt(0.3*1 +0.7))=1/(sqrt(1))=1.\n\nAt z=0.5: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*3.375 +0.7)=sqrt(1.0125+0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=1.308.\n\nSo integrand is 1/(1.5 *1.308)=1/(1.962)=0.510.\n\nAt z=1: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.760.\n\nIntegrand is 1/(2*1.76)=1/3.52\u22480.284.\n\nUsing the trapezoidal rule for three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nThe trapezoidal rule for intervals 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0 to 0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.510 is (1+0.51)/2 =0.755. Multiply by delta_z=0.5 \u2192 0.3775.\n\nSecond interval (0.5-1):\n\nAverage of 0.51 and 0.284 is (0.51+0.284)/2=0.397. Multiply by 0.5 \u21920.1985.\n\nTotal for 0-1 is 0.3775+0.1985=0.576. That part seems correct.\n\nHmm. So the integral from 0-1 is ~0.576. The integral from1-5.5 is 0.3566. So total is ~0.9326. \n\nThen the comoving distance is (c/H0)*0.9326. \n\nc/H0 is 4286 Mpc, so 0.9326 *4286 \u2248 4000 Mpc =4 Gpc. \n\nBut this can't be right. Because for a matter-dominated universe with z=5.5, the comoving distance would be 2.6 Gpc, but with dark energy, it's higher. But according to this calculation, it's 4 Gpc? That seems low. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral for the high-z part. Let me re-calculate the integral from z=1 to z=5.5:\n\nThe integral is \u222b\u2081^5.5 [1/( (1+z)*E(z) )] dz, where E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nLet me make substitution u = (1+z). Then du = dz. \n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{2}^{6.5} [1/(u * sqrt(0.3 u^3))] du \n\n= \u222b [1/(u * u^(3/2) sqrt(0.3)) ) ] du \n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-5/2} du \n\nThe integral of u^{-5/2} is (-2/3) u^{-3/2} + C \n\nThus:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) * [ (-2/3) (6.5)^{-3/2} + (2/3)(2)^{-3/2} ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term (upper limit 6.5):\n\n6.5^{-3/2} = 1/(6.5)^{3/2} \u22481/ (sqrt(6.5)^3). \n\nsqrt(6.5)=~2.55, so cubed is ~16.58. So 1/16.58\u22480.0603. \n\nMultiply by -2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)):\n\nWait, the entire expression is:\n\n[ (-2/3)*(6.5)^{-3/2} + (2/3)*(2)^{-3/2} ] * (1/sqrt(0.3))\n\nWait, no: the entire expression is:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) multiplied by [ (-2/3)(6.5^{-3/2}) + (2/3)(2^{-3/2}) ]\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (-2/3)*0.0603 = -0.0402 \n\nSecond term: (2/3)*(1/(2^{3/2})) = (2/3)*(1/(2.828)) \u2248 (2/3)*(0.3535)\u22480.2357 \n\nSum of terms inside: -0.0402 +0.2357\u22480.1955 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)\u22481.8257:\n\n0.1955 *1.8257\u22480.3566 \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm, so total integral is ~0.9326. So the comoving distance is ~4 Gpc. But that seems too low. Wait, but in this calculation, the dark energy term was neglected in the high-z part, but maybe the contribution from lower redshifts (where dark energy is present) is more important?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that dark energy is negligible beyond z=1 is not correct. Let me check at z=2. \n\nAt z=2, E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(8.1+0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966. So E(z) is ~3, so dark energy term is 0.7, but the matter term is 8.1, so still dominated by matter. \n\nAt z=3, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(4)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=4.46. So matter still dominant. \n\nAt z=5, 0.3*(6)^3 =0.3*216=64.8. sqrt(64.8+0.7)=~8.06. So yes, matter is still dominant. \n\nSo the assumption that dark energy is negligible for z>1 is okay. \n\nHmm, but even so, getting 4 Gpc for comoving distance at z=5.5? That seems low. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The comoving distance is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral. \n\nWait, c is in km/s, H0 is km/s/Mpc. \n\nWait, let me recheck the units:\n\nc = 3e5 km/s \n\nH0 =70 km/s/Mpc \n\nc/H0 has units (km/s)/(km/s/Mpc) ) \u2192 Mpc. \n\nSo 3e5 /70 = ~4285.7 Mpc, which is ~4.285 Gpc. \n\nSo the integral result is 0.9326, so the comoving distance is 4.285 *0.9326 \u22484 Gpc. \n\nHmm. But this contradicts my intuition. Maybe I'm missing a factor? \n\nWait, let me check the formula again. \n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/(E(z') (1+z') ) ] dz'\n\nWait, wait, is that correct? Wait, the integral is:\n\n\u222b\u2080^z [1/(E(z') (1+z') ) ] dz' \n\nWait, no, the formula I used earlier was:\n\nThe integrand is [1/( (1+z) * E(z) ) ] dz. \n\nWait, but in the derivation, the integral is \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz multiplied by (c/H0). \n\nSo the integral result of ~0.9326 is unitless (since it's \u222b [1/( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz ), so multiplying by (c/H0) which is in Mpc gives the distance in Mpc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check a reference formula. \n\nWait, according to standard cosmology:\n\nThe comoving distance is \n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] \n\nBut in terms of redshift, since 1+z = a0/a(t), so dt = dz/(a H(z)). \n\nWait, let me derive it properly. \n\nThe scale factor a(t) is related to the redshift via 1+z = a0/a(t). \n\nThe differential dt is expressed as dt = dz/( -H(z) (1+z) ), because dz/dt = -H(z) (1+z). \n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] = c \u222b\u2080^z [ 1/(a(t) ) * ( dz/( -H(z)(1+z) ) ) ]\n\nBut a(t) = a0/(1+z), so 1/a(t) = (1+z)/a0. \n\nThus:\n\nD_C = c/a0 \u222b\u2080^z [ (1+z) / ( H(z) (1+z) ) ] dz \n\nWait, that simplifies to:\n\nD_C = (c/a0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/H(z) ] dz \n\nBut H(z) = H0 E(z), so:\n\nD_C = (c/(a0 H0)) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z) ] dz \n\nWait, but c/a0 is the Hubble distance? Because H0 = (d a/dt)/a, so H0 = (a0 d a/dt )/ (a0 a) )? Hmm, perhaps another way:\n\nThe Hubble parameter H0 = 100 h km/s/Mpc, so the Hubble distance is c/H0 \u2248 3000 h^-1 Mpc. \n\nWait, the Hubble distance is c/H0, yes. \n\nSo, the expression for comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z)] dz \n\nWait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier. The integral should be \u222b [1/E(z) ] dz, not divided by (1+z). That changes everything. \n\nOh no! I think I messed up the derivation earlier. \n\nSo, the correct formula for comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / E(z) ] dz \n\nWhere E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda )\n\nSo I had an extra division by (1+z) in my previous calculation. That's why my previous result was too low. \n\nOkay, this is a crucial mistake. Let me recalculate with the correct formula. \n\nSo the correct integral is \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z)] dz multiplied by (c/H0). \n\nLet's recompute the integral. \n\nFirst, let's re-calculate the integral from 0 to5.5:\n\nSplit into two parts: 0-1 and 1-5.5. \n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to1:\n\nE(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7). \n\nWe can use trapezoidal again. \n\nAt z=0: E(0)=sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1. \n\nAt z=0.5: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(1.0125+0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=~1.308. \n\nAt z=1: E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.760. \n\nThe integrand [1/E(z)] at these points:\n\nz=0: 1/1=1 \n\nz=0.5:1/1.308\u22480.764 \n\nz=1:1/1.76\u22480.568 \n\nUsing trapezoidal for 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0-0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.764 is 0.882. Multiply by 0.5 \u2192 0.441 \n\nSecond interval (0.5-1):\n\nAverage of 0.764 and0.568 is 0.666. Multiply by0.5 \u21920.333 \n\nTotal for 0-1: 0.441+0.333=0.774 \n\nNow the integral from z=1 to5.5 where matter dominates. \n\nHere, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nSo integrand is 1/E(z)=1/sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 )\n\n= (1+z)^{-3/2}/sqrt(0.3) \n\nLet me make substitution u=1+z, so from 2 to6.5:\n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{2}^{6.5} [1/(sqrt(0.3) * u^{3/2}) ] du \n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-3/2} du \n\nThe integral of u^{-3/2} is [-2 u^{-1/2} ]\n\nThus:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) [ (-2/(sqrt(6.5)) ) + 2/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term at upper limit (6.5): -2/sqrt(6.5) \u2248-2/2.55\u2248-0.784 \n\nSecond term at lower limit (2): 2/sqrt(2)=2/1.414\u22481.414 \n\nTotal inside the brackets: (-0.784 +1.414)=0.63 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1.8257 \u21920.63 *1.8257\u22481.152 \n\nSo the integral from 1-5.5 is ~1.152 \n\nTotal integral from 0-5.5 is 0.774 (from 0-1) +1.152 (from1-5.5)=1.926 \n\nMultiply by (c/H0)=4286 Mpc gives D_C\u22481.926*4286\u22488250 Mpc=8.25 Gpc \n\nAh! That makes more sense. So the comoving distance is approximately 8.25 Gpc, which would round to 8 or 9 Gpc. \n\nLooking at the options: B is 8, C is 9. The calculation gives ~8.25, so closer to 8.25, so 8 Gpc is option B. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check the integral again. \n\nLet me verify the integral from 1-5.5:\n\nThe integral was calculated as 1/sqrt(0.3) [ ( -2/sqrt(6.5) + 2/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nLet me compute more precisely:\n\nsqrt(0.3)=0.5477225575\n\nsqrt(6.5)=2.549509757\n\nsqrt(2)=1.414213562\n\nSo:\n\n-2/2.5495 \u2248-0.7845 \n\n+2/1.4142\u22481.4142 \n\nTotal inside the bracket: (-0.7845 +1.4142)=0.6297 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1/0.5477\u22481.8257 \u21920.6297*1.8257\u22481.148 \n\nAdding to the 0.774 gives total 1.922. \n\n1.922*4286 \u2248 1.922 *4000=7688, plus 1.922*286\u2248550 \u2192 total ~8238 Mpc \u2192 ~8.24 Gpc. \n\nSo about 8.2 Gpc, so the closest option is B) 8 Gpc. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) 8 Gpc. \n\nWait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives approximately 8.2 Gpc, so the closest is B (8). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more accurate way. Let me see if I can use another approximation. \n\nAlternatively, using the approximation from the University of Oregon's cosmology calculator (even though I can't access it now), but I recall that for z=5.5, with H0=70, \u03a9_m=0.3, the comoving distance is about 8-9 Gpc. \n\nWait, but my approximate calculation here gives ~8.2, so 8 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the trapezoidal for the first part. Let me recheck the 0-1 integral. \n\nThe integral from 0 to1 using three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nAt z=0: 1 \n\nz=0.5:1/E(z)=1/1.308\u22480.764 \n\nz=1:0.568 \n\nThe trapezoidal rule for three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nThe formula is:\n\nIntegral \u2248 (delta_z/2)*[f(z0) + 2f(z1) + f(z2) ]\n\nHere delta_z is 0.5 between the first two points and between the next two. \n\nWait, using the composite trapezoidal rule over the interval from 0 to1 with two intervals (each of 0.5 width):\n\nTotal = (0.5/2)[f(0) + 2f(0.5) + f(1)] \n\n=0.25 [1 + 2*(0.764) +0.568] \n\n=0.25 [1 +1.528 +0.568] \n\n=0.25*(3.096)=0.774. That's the same as before. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. \n\nThus, the comoving distance is approximately 8.2 Gpc, so the closest option is B)8 Gpc. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about determining the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and cosmological parameters. Let me start by recalling what each part means.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum with a peak at 790 nm and a drop at shorter wavelengths. Wait, the peak might be related to some emission line. Oh right, quasars often have strong emission lines like Lyman-alpha, which is usually around 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But here the observed peak is at 790 nm. If that's the case, then the redshift can be calculated. Let's see: the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs is related to the rest wavelength \u03bb_rest by (1 + z) = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest. \n\nAssuming the peak is Lyman-alpha, the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So (1+z) = 790 / 121.6 \u2248 6.5. Therefore, z \u2248 5.5. But I should confirm if that's the correct assumption. The question mentions that at shorter wavelengths (<790 nm) the flux drops. Since Lyman-alpha is a strong emission line, if it's observed at 790 nm, then the line is redshifted. That makes sense. So the redshift z is around 5.5.\n\nNow, the next part is using the Lambda-CDM model parameters to find the comoving distance. The parameters given are H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density \u03a9_m=0.3, dark energy \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so \u03a9_total=1). \n\nComoving distance (also called comoving radial distance) for a flat universe is given by the integral from 0 to z of [c / H0] * (1/(sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda))) dz. But this integral doesn't have an analytical solution, so we need to approximate or use a calculator. Alternatively, maybe there's a standard approximation or a way to estimate it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect using the approximation for high redshift, but since z is about 5.5, which isn't extremely high but maybe manageable. Wait, perhaps the question expects using the angular diameter distance or luminosity distance? Wait, the question specifically asks for comoving distance. Let me recall the definitions:\n\nComoving distance is the distance to the object in today's coordinates. For a flat universe, the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of (c/H0) * (1/E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use different parametrizations. Since calculating this integral requires either a calculator or a lookup table, maybe in the context of a multiple-choice question, they expect an approximate value based on standard values or maybe using a simplified formula?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using the approximation for the matter-dominated era, but with dark energy, so maybe not. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting us to use the Hubble distance (c/H0) and multiply by some factor based on redshift. But the Hubble distance is about 4250 Mpc (since H0=70, so c/(70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc) \u2248 4286 Mpc \u2248 4.286 Gpc). But the comoving distance at high z is more than that. Wait, but for high redshift, the comoving distance depends on the expansion history. Since the universe is accelerating now (due to dark energy), but at higher redshifts (like z=5.5) the matter density was more dominant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. The integral can be expressed as:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m(1+x)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda)] dx/(1+x)\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The integral is:\n\nD_C = c/H0 \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+x) sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+x)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) ] dx \n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the exact form. Let me recall the formula for the comoving distance. The formula is:\n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] \n\nBut in terms of redshift, since 1 + z = a_0/a(t), so dz/dt = -H(z)(1 + z). So substituting variables, the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1 / ( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz \n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda )\n\nTherefore, the integral is from 0 to z of [1/( (1+z) sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) ] dz multiplied by c/H0.\n\nHmm, this is complicated. Since I can't compute this integral by hand here, perhaps the question expects me to use an approximate value or a standard redshift-distance relation? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate value for z=5.5 with given parameters. Let me see if I can estimate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate formula for the scale factor. Wait, but maybe the options are close enough that using an approximate method would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to recall that for a flat universe with \u03a9_m=0.3 and \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5.5 is around 8-9 Gpc. Let me think of some standard distances. \n\nWait, I remember that for high redshift objects, the comoving distance can be up to ~9-10 Gpc for z around 6-7. Let me see, for example, the cosmic microwave background is at z ~ 1100, but that's way higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall some approximate values. For instance, the comoving distance for z=2 is roughly 7 Gpc, and z=3 is about 9 Gpc? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the luminosity distance and then convert it to comoving.\n\nWait, the luminosity distance D_L is related to the comoving distance D_C by D_L = (1+z)^2 D_C. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a standard table or approximate values. Let me try to think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the Hubble distance multiplied by some factor. The Hubble distance is ~4.28 Gpc. But for a redshift of 5.5, the comoving distance would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation for a matter-dominated universe (ignoring dark energy), which would give D_C \u2248 (c/H0) * (2/3)(1+z)^(3/2) - 2/3. But that's only valid when dark energy is negligible, which at z=5.5 (since dark energy becomes significant at lower redshifts, like z<1), so maybe that's okay? Let me try that. \n\nWait, in a matter-dominated universe (\u03a9_m=1), the scale factor a(t) grows as t^(2/3). The Hubble parameter H(z) = H0*(1+z)^(3/2). The comoving distance would be (c/H0) \u222b0^z [1/( (1+z)*(H(z)/H0) ) ] dz. Wait, substituting H(z)= H0*(1+z)^3/(2E(z))? Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, if we ignore dark energy (assuming \u03a9_Lambda=0), then E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3). Then the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z) * (1+z)^(3/2) ) ] dz \n\nWait, that would be:\n\n= (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z)^(5/2) ) ] dz \n\nWhich integrates to (c/H0) * [ (1+z)^(-3/2) * (-2/3) ) ] from 0 to z \n\nWait, let's compute that. Let me see:\n\n\u222b [ (1+z)^{-5/2} dz ] \n\nLet u = 1+z, then du = dz. So integral becomes \u222b u^{-5/2} du = (-2/3) u^{-3/2} + C \n\nThus the integral from 0 to z is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ] from 1 to (1+z):\n\n[ -2/(3 (1+z)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*1) ]\n\nSo overall:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) * [ 2/(3) - 2/(3 (1+z)^{3/2} ) ]\n\n= (c/H0) * (2/3)[1 - 1/(1+z)^{3/2} ]\n\nSo, if \u03a9_m=1 (matter-dominated), then the comoving distance at z would be that expression. But in our case, the actual universe has \u03a9_m=0.3, so dark energy is present. But maybe this gives an estimate. Let's try with z=5.5.\n\nPlugging in z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. \n\nSo 1/(6.5)^{3/2} = 1/(sqrt(6.5)^3) \n\nsqrt(6.5) \u2248 2.55, so 2.55^3 \u2248 16.58. So 1/(6.5)^{3/2} \u2248 1/16.58 \u2248 0.0603.\n\nThus the term inside becomes [1 - 0.0603] = 0.9397. Multiply by 2/3 gives 0.6265. \n\nThen D_C \u2248 (c/H0)*0.6265 \n\nc/H0 is 4286 Mpc (since c=3e5 km/s, so 3e5 /70 \u22484285.7 Mpc). So 4286 * 0.6265 \u2248 2689 Mpc, which is about 2.69 Gpc. But that's way too low. Wait, but this is under a matter-only universe, but in reality with dark energy, the expansion is accelerating, so the actual distance should be larger. So this approach is underestimating.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach isn't the right way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the approximation formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy. I recall that there's an approximation for the luminosity distance, but perhaps I can find an approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Python code to calculate the integral numerically. But since I can't do that here, perhaps I can recall that for z=5.5 with these parameters, the comoving distance is about 8-9 Gpc. Let me see if I can find some standard values.\n\nWait, let me think of the current comoving distance to the particle horizon. The particle horizon's comoving distance is the maximum possible, which for our universe is around 15-20 Gpc. But for z=5.5, it's less than that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the age of the universe. The age of the universe in a Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, \u03a9_m=0.3 is about 13.8 billion years. Wait, actually, the standard age is around 13.8 Gyr, so maybe that's correct. \n\nThe light travel time to the quasar is the lookback time, which is the time since the light was emitted. But the comoving distance is related to that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula for comoving distance. \n\nAnother approach: Let me look up approximate values for comoving distances. \n\nWait, for example, the Planck 2018 results give some parameters similar to this question (H0=67.4, but close enough). Let me see, maybe some standard redshifts and distances. \n\nFor instance, at z=2, the comoving distance is roughly 8 Gpc? Not sure. Wait, maybe I can think of the following:\n\nIf I recall that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc? Wait no, that seems low. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the calculator from the University of Oregon's cosmology calculator (online), but since I can't access it, I need to think through.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the Hubble parameter at high redshift (z=5.5) is dominated by matter, so E(z) \u2248 sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3). \n\nCalculating that: 6.5 cubed is 274.625. 0.3 * 274.625 \u2248 82.3875. sqrt of that is \u22489.08. So E(z)= ~9.08. \n\nWait, but E(z) is sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). Wait, but at high z, the dark energy term is negligible. So at z=5.5, the dark energy term (0.7) is much smaller than the matter term (0.3*(6.5)^3 \u224882.38). So indeed, the E(z) is sqrt(82.38) \u22489.08. \n\nSo, the integrand at high redshift (near z=5.5) would be dominated by the matter term, so the integral from, say, z=0 to 5.5 would have most of its contribution from the lower redshifts where dark energy is important. Hmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the approximation that at high redshift, the comoving distance is roughly (c/H0) * (2/(3 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) (1+z)^{3/2} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in a matter-dominated universe, the comoving distance at high z would be (c/H0)*(2/3)(1+z)^{3/2} - 2/3, but as before that gives 2.6 Gpc, but since dark energy makes the expansion accelerate, the actual distance would be larger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for z=5.5, the comoving distance is around 8-9 Gpc. Let me see. \n\nLooking at the options given (6,8,9,7 Gpc). Let me think of some approximate values. \n\nSuppose I consider that the angular diameter distance D_A is related to the comoving distance by D_A = D_C / (1+z). So if I could get the angular diameter distance, then multiply by (1+z) to get D_C. \n\nAlternatively, for a flat universe, the luminosity distance D_L is (1+z) * D_C. \n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the luminosity distance in a flat universe:\n\nD_L(z) = (c/H0) * (1+z) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(x)] dx \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the luminosity distance is D_L = (1+z) * D_C. \n\nAssuming that, then if I can get an approximate value for D_L at z=5.5, then divide by (1+z) to get D_C. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for z=1, the luminosity distance in a flat universe with these parameters would be about 4 Gpc. For z=2, maybe 8 Gpc? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that the luminosity distance for z=1.5 is around 3 Gpc? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the relation between the redshift and the scale factor. Wait, but without more info, perhaps I should think of the options. \n\nThe options are 6,8,9,7 Gpc. The Hubble distance is ~4.28 Gpc. The comoving distance must be larger than the Hubble distance times (1+z) or something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the age of the universe. The lookback time to z=5.5 would be the age of the universe minus the time since then. Let's see: the age of the universe is ~13.8 Gyr. The lookback time at z=5.5 would be the time since emission. Let me see, but how to compute that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the approximate formula for the age of the universe:\n\nt_age = (2/(3 H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) ) * (1+z)^(3/2) ??? No, that's for matter-dominated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too involved, and I need to think that the answer is 8 or 9 Gpc. Since the redshift is ~5.5, which is high. \n\nLooking at the options, 9 Gpc is an option (C) and 8 is B. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the question is from an exam where standard values are used. For example, in the Planck cosmology with similar parameters, a quasar at z=6 has a comoving distance of ~ 9 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe at z=5.5, the comoving distance would be around 8 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, I think the correct answer is C) 9 Gpc. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's see. \n\nSuppose that for a redshift z=5.5, using a cosmology calculator. Let me try to do a rough approximation. \n\nThe integral for D_C is (c/H0) times the integral from 0 to z of 1/( (1+z') sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ) dz'.\n\nLet me approximate this integral by splitting it into two parts: from z=0 to z=1 where dark energy is significant, and from z=1 to z=5.5 where matter dominates. \n\nFirst, compute the integral from 0 to 1:\n\nAt low redshift, say up to z=1, the E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). Let's compute E(z) at z=0: sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1. At z=1, sqrt(0.3*(8)+0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.76. \n\nThe integral from 0 to 1 of [1/( (1+z)*E(z) )] dz. \n\nApproximate this using trapezoidal rule with a few points. Let me take z=0,0.5,1.\n\nAt z=0: integrand is 1/(1*1)=1.\n\nAt z=0.5: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*3.375 +0.7)= sqrt(1.0125 +0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=~1.308.\n\nSo integrand at 0.5: 1/(1.5 *1.308)= ~1/(1.962)= ~0.510.\n\nAt z=1: integrand is 1/(2 *1.76)= ~0.284.\n\nUsing trapezoidal between 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0 to 0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.510 is 0.755, multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.3775.\n\nSecond interval (0.5 to1):\n\nAverage of 0.510 and 0.284 is 0.397, multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.1985.\n\nTotal for 0 to1: 0.3775+0.1985\u22480.576.\n\nNow, the integral from z=1 to z=5.5 where matter dominates (since dark energy term is negligible). So E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nSo the integrand here is 1/( (1+z)*sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3) ) = 1/( (1+z) * (1+z)^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3) )) \n\n= 1/( (1+z)^(5/2) * sqrt(0.3) )\n\nThus, the integral from z=1 to z=5.5:\n\nLet me make substitution u=1+z. Then the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{u=2}^{6.5} [1/( u^(5/2) * sqrt(0.3) ) ] du\n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-5/2} du from 2 to6.5\n\nThe integral of u^{-5/2} is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ]\n\nThus the integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ -2/(3*(6.5)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*(2)^{3/2}) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term at upper limit (6.5):\n\n6.5^(3/2) = sqrt(6.5)^3 \u2248 2.55^3\u224816.58. So 1/16.58 \u22480.0603. Multiply by -2/(3*16.58) \u2192 Wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait the integral is [ -2/(3 u^{3/2}) ] evaluated from 2 to 6.5:\n\nSo the value is [ -2/(3*(6.5)^{3/2}) + 2/(3*(2)^{3/2}) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -2/(3 *16.58) \u2248 -2/(49.74) \u2248-0.0402\n\nSecond term: 2/(3*(2.828)) \u22482/(8.485)\u22480.2357\n\nTotal: ( -0.0402 +0.2357 ) = 0.1955 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3): sqrt(0.3)\u22480.5477, so 1/0.5477\u22481.825. \n\nSo 0.1955 *1.825 \u22480.3566 \n\nThus the integral from z=1 to5.5 is ~0.3566.\n\nAdding the two parts: 0.576 (from 0-1) +0.3566 (from1-5.5)= ~0.9326 \n\nTotal integral over all z is ~0.9326. \n\nMultiply by c/H0: c/H0 is 4286 Mpc. So 4286 *0.9326 \u2248 4286*0.9=3857, 4286*0.0326\u2248140 \u2192 total ~4000 Mpc. \n\nWait, 4000 Mpc is 4 Gpc. That can't be right because that's less than the Hubble distance. But this can't be correct. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, the integral result was 0.9326, but the units: the integral is in terms of (1/E(z) dz/(1+z)), so the total integral is 0.9326, then multiplied by (c/H0) gives the comoving distance. \n\nWait, but c/H0 is ~4286 Mpc. So 0.9326 *4286 \u2248 4000 Mpc =4 Gpc. That can't be right because for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be much larger. \n\nHmm, clearly my approximation is wrong. Maybe splitting the integral that way isn't sufficient. \n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the substitution. Let me check again:\n\nWait, in the integral from z=1 to z=5.5, I considered E(z) as sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). But that's only valid when dark energy term is negligible. Let me check at z=5.5, the dark energy term is 0.7, and matter term is 0.3*(6.5)^3\u224882.38. So sqrt(82.38+0.7)=sqrt(83.08)=~9.115. So E(z)= ~9.115. So the integrand at z=5.5 is 1/( (1+5.5)*E(z) )= 1/(6.5 *9.115)\u22481/59.25\u22480.0169. \n\nBut in my earlier approach, I assumed E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3)=sqrt(82.38)=~9.076, which is correct. So that part is okay. \n\nWait, but the integral from 1 to5.5 was calculated as 0.3566. The first part (0-1) gave ~0.576. So total integral is ~0.9326, leading to ~4 Gpc. But that can't be right because the Hubble distance is 4.28 Gpc, and for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be larger. \n\nHmm. So maybe my approximation for the integral from 0-1 was too low? Let me recheck that part. \n\nThe integral from 0 to1 of [1/( (1+z) E(z) )] dz. \n\nI used trapezoidal with points at 0,0.5,1. Let me recalculate more precisely:\n\nAt z=0: integrand is 1/(1*sqrt(0.3*1 +0.7))=1/(sqrt(1))=1.\n\nAt z=0.5: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*3.375 +0.7)=sqrt(1.0125+0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=1.308.\n\nSo integrand is 1/(1.5 *1.308)=1/(1.962)=0.510.\n\nAt z=1: E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.760.\n\nIntegrand is 1/(2*1.76)=1/3.52\u22480.284.\n\nUsing the trapezoidal rule for three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nThe trapezoidal rule for intervals 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0 to 0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.510 is (1+0.51)/2 =0.755. Multiply by delta_z=0.5 \u2192 0.3775.\n\nSecond interval (0.5-1):\n\nAverage of 0.51 and 0.284 is (0.51+0.284)/2=0.397. Multiply by 0.5 \u21920.1985.\n\nTotal for 0-1 is 0.3775+0.1985=0.576. That part seems correct.\n\nHmm. So the integral from 0-1 is ~0.576. The integral from1-5.5 is 0.3566. So total is ~0.9326. \n\nThen the comoving distance is (c/H0)*0.9326. \n\nc/H0 is 4286 Mpc, so 0.9326 *4286 \u2248 4000 Mpc =4 Gpc. \n\nBut this can't be right. Because for a matter-dominated universe with z=5.5, the comoving distance would be 2.6 Gpc, but with dark energy, it's higher. But according to this calculation, it's 4 Gpc? That seems low. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral for the high-z part. Let me re-calculate the integral from z=1 to z=5.5:\n\nThe integral is \u222b\u2081^5.5 [1/( (1+z)*E(z) )] dz, where E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nLet me make substitution u = (1+z). Then du = dz. \n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b_{2}^{6.5} [1/(u * sqrt(0.3 u^3))] du \n\n= \u222b [1/(u * u^(3/2) sqrt(0.3)) ) ] du \n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-5/2} du \n\nThe integral of u^{-5/2} is (-2/3) u^{-3/2} + C \n\nThus:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) * [ (-2/3) (6.5)^{-3/2} + (2/3)(2)^{-3/2} ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term (upper limit 6.5):\n\n6.5^{-3/2} = 1/(6.5)^{3/2} \u22481/ (sqrt(6.5)^3). \n\nsqrt(6.5)=~2.55, so cubed is ~16.58. So 1/16.58\u22480.0603. \n\nMultiply by -2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)):\n\nWait, the entire expression is:\n\n[ (-2/3)*(6.5)^{-3/2} + (2/3)*(2)^{-3/2} ] * (1/sqrt(0.3))\n\nWait, no: the entire expression is:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) multiplied by [ (-2/3)(6.5^{-3/2}) + (2/3)(2^{-3/2}) ]\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (-2/3)*0.0603 = -0.0402 \n\nSecond term: (2/3)*(1/(2^{3/2})) = (2/3)*(1/(2.828)) \u2248 (2/3)*(0.3535)\u22480.2357 \n\nSum of terms inside: -0.0402 +0.2357\u22480.1955 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)\u22481.8257:\n\n0.1955 *1.8257\u22480.3566 \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm, so total integral is ~0.9326. So the comoving distance is ~4 Gpc. But that seems too low. Wait, but in this calculation, the dark energy term was neglected in the high-z part, but maybe the contribution from lower redshifts (where dark energy is present) is more important?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that dark energy is negligible beyond z=1 is not correct. Let me check at z=2. \n\nAt z=2, E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(8.1+0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966. So E(z) is ~3, so dark energy term is 0.7, but the matter term is 8.1, so still dominated by matter. \n\nAt z=3, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(4)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=4.46. So matter still dominant. \n\nAt z=5, 0.3*(6)^3 =0.3*216=64.8. sqrt(64.8+0.7)=~8.06. So yes, matter is still dominant. \n\nSo the assumption that dark energy is negligible for z>1 is okay. \n\nHmm, but even so, getting 4 Gpc for comoving distance at z=5.5? That seems low. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The comoving distance is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral. \n\nWait, c is in km/s, H0 is km/s/Mpc. \n\nWait, let me recheck the units:\n\nc = 3e5 km/s \n\nH0 =70 km/s/Mpc \n\nc/H0 has units (km/s)/(km/s/Mpc) ) \u2192 Mpc. \n\nSo 3e5 /70 = ~4285.7 Mpc, which is ~4.285 Gpc. \n\nSo the integral result is 0.9326, so the comoving distance is 4.285 *0.9326 \u22484 Gpc. \n\nHmm. But this contradicts my intuition. Maybe I'm missing a factor? \n\nWait, let me check the formula again. \n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/(E(z') (1+z') ) ] dz'\n\nWait, wait, is that correct? Wait, the integral is:\n\n\u222b\u2080^z [1/(E(z') (1+z') ) ] dz' \n\nWait, no, the formula I used earlier was:\n\nThe integrand is [1/( (1+z) * E(z) ) ] dz. \n\nWait, but in the derivation, the integral is \u222b\u2080^z [1/( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz multiplied by (c/H0). \n\nSo the integral result of ~0.9326 is unitless (since it's \u222b [1/( (1+z) E(z) ) ] dz ), so multiplying by (c/H0) which is in Mpc gives the distance in Mpc. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check a reference formula. \n\nWait, according to standard cosmology:\n\nThe comoving distance is \n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] \n\nBut in terms of redshift, since 1+z = a0/a(t), so dt = dz/(a H(z)). \n\nWait, let me derive it properly. \n\nThe scale factor a(t) is related to the redshift via 1+z = a0/a(t). \n\nThe differential dt is expressed as dt = dz/( -H(z) (1+z) ), because dz/dt = -H(z) (1+z). \n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\nD_C = c \u222b\u2080^t [dt/a(t)] = c \u222b\u2080^z [ 1/(a(t) ) * ( dz/( -H(z)(1+z) ) ) ]\n\nBut a(t) = a0/(1+z), so 1/a(t) = (1+z)/a0. \n\nThus:\n\nD_C = c/a0 \u222b\u2080^z [ (1+z) / ( H(z) (1+z) ) ] dz \n\nWait, that simplifies to:\n\nD_C = (c/a0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/H(z) ] dz \n\nBut H(z) = H0 E(z), so:\n\nD_C = (c/(a0 H0)) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z) ] dz \n\nWait, but c/a0 is the Hubble distance? Because H0 = (d a/dt)/a, so H0 = (a0 d a/dt )/ (a0 a) )? Hmm, perhaps another way:\n\nThe Hubble parameter H0 = 100 h km/s/Mpc, so the Hubble distance is c/H0 \u2248 3000 h^-1 Mpc. \n\nWait, the Hubble distance is c/H0, yes. \n\nSo, the expression for comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z)] dz \n\nWait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier. The integral should be \u222b [1/E(z) ] dz, not divided by (1+z). That changes everything. \n\nOh no! I think I messed up the derivation earlier. \n\nSo, the correct formula for comoving distance is:\n\nD_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / E(z) ] dz \n\nWhere E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda )\n\nSo I had an extra division by (1+z) in my previous calculation. That's why my previous result was too low. \n\nOkay, this is a crucial mistake. Let me recalculate with the correct formula. \n\nSo the correct integral is \u222b\u2080^z [1/E(z)] dz multiplied by (c/H0). \n\nLet's recompute the integral. \n\nFirst, let's re-calculate the integral from 0 to5.5:\n\nSplit into two parts: 0-1 and 1-5.5. \n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to1:\n\nE(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7). \n\nWe can use trapezoidal again. \n\nAt z=0: E(0)=sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1. \n\nAt z=0.5: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(1.0125+0.7)=sqrt(1.7125)=~1.308. \n\nAt z=1: E(z)= sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4+0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.760. \n\nThe integrand [1/E(z)] at these points:\n\nz=0: 1/1=1 \n\nz=0.5:1/1.308\u22480.764 \n\nz=1:1/1.76\u22480.568 \n\nUsing trapezoidal for 0-0.5 and 0.5-1:\n\nFirst interval (0-0.5):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.764 is 0.882. Multiply by 0.5 \u2192 0.441 \n\nSecond interval (0.5-1):\n\nAverage of 0.764 and0.568 is 0.666. Multiply by0.5 \u21920.333 \n\nTotal for 0-1: 0.441+0.333=0.774 \n\nNow the integral from z=1 to5.5 where matter dominates. \n\nHere, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3). \n\nSo integrand is 1/E(z)=1/sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 )\n\n= (1+z)^{-3/2}/sqrt(0.3) \n\nLet me make substitution u=1+z, so from 2 to6.5:\n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{2}^{6.5} [1/(sqrt(0.3) * u^{3/2}) ] du \n\n= 1/sqrt(0.3) \u222b u^{-3/2} du \n\nThe integral of u^{-3/2} is [-2 u^{-1/2} ]\n\nThus:\n\n1/sqrt(0.3) [ (-2/(sqrt(6.5)) ) + 2/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term at upper limit (6.5): -2/sqrt(6.5) \u2248-2/2.55\u2248-0.784 \n\nSecond term at lower limit (2): 2/sqrt(2)=2/1.414\u22481.414 \n\nTotal inside the brackets: (-0.784 +1.414)=0.63 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1.8257 \u21920.63 *1.8257\u22481.152 \n\nSo the integral from 1-5.5 is ~1.152 \n\nTotal integral from 0-5.5 is 0.774 (from 0-1) +1.152 (from1-5.5)=1.926 \n\nMultiply by (c/H0)=4286 Mpc gives D_C\u22481.926*4286\u22488250 Mpc=8.25 Gpc \n\nAh! That makes more sense. So the comoving distance is approximately 8.25 Gpc, which would round to 8 or 9 Gpc. \n\nLooking at the options: B is 8, C is 9. The calculation gives ~8.25, so closer to 8.25, so 8 Gpc is option B. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check the integral again. \n\nLet me verify the integral from 1-5.5:\n\nThe integral was calculated as 1/sqrt(0.3) [ ( -2/sqrt(6.5) + 2/sqrt(2) ) ]\n\nLet me compute more precisely:\n\nsqrt(0.3)=0.5477225575\n\nsqrt(6.5)=2.549509757\n\nsqrt(2)=1.414213562\n\nSo:\n\n-2/2.5495 \u2248-0.7845 \n\n+2/1.4142\u22481.4142 \n\nTotal inside the bracket: (-0.7845 +1.4142)=0.6297 \n\nMultiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)=1/0.5477\u22481.8257 \u21920.6297*1.8257\u22481.148 \n\nAdding to the 0.774 gives total 1.922. \n\n1.922*4286 \u2248 1.922 *4000=7688, plus 1.922*286\u2248550 \u2192 total ~8238 Mpc \u2192 ~8.24 Gpc. \n\nSo about 8.2 Gpc, so the closest option is B) 8 Gpc. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) 8 Gpc. \n\nWait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives approximately 8.2 Gpc, so the closest is B (8). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more accurate way. Let me see if I can use another approximation. \n\nAlternatively, using the approximation from the University of Oregon's cosmology calculator (even though I can't access it now), but I recall that for z=5.5, with H0=70, \u03a9_m=0.3, the comoving distance is about 8-9 Gpc. \n\nWait, but my approximate calculation here gives ~8.2, so 8 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the trapezoidal for the first part. Let me recheck the 0-1 integral. \n\nThe integral from 0 to1 using three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nAt z=0: 1 \n\nz=0.5:1/E(z)=1/1.308\u22480.764 \n\nz=1:0.568 \n\nThe trapezoidal rule for three points (0,0.5,1):\n\nThe formula is:\n\nIntegral \u2248 (delta_z/2)*[f(z0) + 2f(z1) + f(z2) ]\n\nHere delta_z is 0.5 between the first two points and between the next two. \n\nWait, using the composite trapezoidal rule over the interval from 0 to1 with two intervals (each of 0.5 width):\n\nTotal = (0.5/2)[f(0) + 2f(0.5) + f(1)] \n\n=0.25 [1 + 2*(0.764) +0.568] \n\n=0.25 [1 +1.528 +0.568] \n\n=0.25*(3.096)=0.774. That's the same as before. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. \n\nThus, the comoving distance is approximately 8.2 Gpc, so the closest option is B)8 Gpc. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we first identify its redshift using the observed peak wavelength. Assuming the peak corresponds to the Lyman-\u03b1 line (rest wavelength 121.6 nm), the redshift is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{790 \\, \\text{nm}}{121.6 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 6.5 \\implies z \\approx 5.5.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the given cosmological parameters (H\u2080 = 70 km/s/Mpc, \u03a9\u2098 = 0.3, \u03a9\u1d5b = 0.7, flat universe) to compute the comoving distance \\( D_C \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the comoving distance of the quasar based on the given information. Let's start by recalling what the question is asking. The problem mentions that in the near infrared and optical spectrum of a quasar, there's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I think this peak might be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is typically at around 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But here, the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So maybe this is due to redshift?\n\nRight, the Lyman-alpha line is a common feature in quasars, and when it's observed at a much longer wavelength, that's a sign of redshift. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. Let's compute that.\n\nThe rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. The observed is 790 nm. So, z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let me do that math. 790 - 121.6 is 668.4. Dividing that by 121.6 gives approximately 5.5. Wait, 121.6 *5 is 608, so 668.4 -608 is 60.4, so 60.4/121.6 is about 0.5. So total z is about 5.5. So the redshift z is around 5.5?\n\nWait, but the question mentions that at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, the flux drops. That might be due to the Lyman-alpha forest, which is absorption features at lower redshifts, but maybe here the peak is the emission line. Anyway, the key point is the observed wavelength gives us the redshift.\n\nSo, assuming that the 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha line, then the redshift z would be (790/121.6) -1. Let me compute that exactly. 790 divided by 121.6 equals approximately 6.495. Subtract 1 gives z\u22485.495, so about z\u22485.5. Let me check that again. 121.6 * 6.5 is 121.6*6 =729.6 plus 60.8 is 790.4. Oh, so actually 790 is very close to exactly 6.5 times 121.6. So z =6.5-1 =5.5 exactly? Wait, 790 divided by 121.6 is 6.5? Let me check:\n\n121.6 *6.5 = 121.6*(6 +0.5) = 729.6 +60.8 = 790.4. Oh, so the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is just a bit less than 790.4. So maybe z is slightly less than 5.5, but very close. For the purposes of this problem, I think we can assume that the redshift is approximately z=5.5.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the comoving distance using the Lambda-CDM model parameters given. The Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter \u03a9_m =0.3, dark energy \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat. The question is asking for the comoving distance at scale factor a=1 (which is the current time, so the distance now).\n\nThe comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The formula for comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(z)(1+z)) dz, but that's complicated. Alternatively, there's an approximation or a standard way to compute this with the given parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the relation between redshift and comoving distance. Since the parameters are given, perhaps we can use an online calculator or a standard formula. Wait, but since this is a problem to be solved manually, maybe they expect an approximate value or using some standard redshift-distance relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the approximation for high redshifts. But let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the Hubble parameter H(z) in a flat universe is given by:\n\nH(z)^2 = H0^2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^3/(exp(3(1+w)z) ) ??? Wait no, for dark energy, assuming it's a cosmological constant, w = -1, so the dark energy density doesn't change with scale factor. Wait, the dark energy density term is actually \u03a9_\u039b a^{-3(1+w)}, but for w = -1 (cosmological constant), then 1+w =0, so the term becomes \u03a9_\u039b a^0 = \u03a9_\u039b. Since a=1/(1+z), so in terms of z, the dark energy term is \u03a9_\u039b. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the Friedmann equation is H\u00b2 = H\u2080\u00b2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_k (1+z)^2 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^0 ].\n\nSince the universe is flat, \u03a9_k =0, so H(z)\u00b2 = H\u2080\u00b2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ].\n\nTherefore, the integral for comoving distance is:\n\nd_comoving = c \u222b\u2080^z [ H\u2080\u00b2 (\u03a9_m (1+z')\u00b3 + \u03a9_\u039b) ]^{-1/2} (1 + z') dz' / (1+z') ?\n\nWait, let me get the exact formula. The comoving distance is the integral from a=0 (or z=0) to a=1/(1+z) of a/H(a) da. Alternatively, expressed in terms of z:\n\nd_comoving = c \u222b\u2080^z \\frac{dz'}{H(z)/(1+z)}.\n\nWait, the correct formula is:\n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z')},\n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^3/( (1+z)^3 ) ? Wait no, let me re-derive E(z):\n\nWait, H(z) = H0 sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ), because for dark energy (cosmological constant), its density is proportional to a^{-3(1 + w)}, and since w = -1 for cosmological constant, so 1 + w =0, so exponent is 0. So the density is constant. Thus, H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ]\n\nThus, E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nTherefore, the integrand is 1/(E(z') (1 + z')), since the integral for comoving distance is:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z') (1 + z')}.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me check:\n\nThe relation between comoving distance and redshift is:\n\nd_C = c \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')} \n\nBut since H(t) = (da/dt)/a, so dt = da/(a H). So,\n\nd_C = c \\int_{a_i}^{1} \\frac{da}{a^2 H(a)} \n\nBut integrating from a=0 (the time of emission) to a=1 (now). Alternatively, changing variables to z = 1/a -1, so when a=1/(1+z), so da/dz = -1/(1+z)^2. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to look up the standard expression. The comoving distance is:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z') (1 + z')}\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Let me recall that the comoving distance is the integral from the time of emission to now of c dt/a(t). \n\nExpressed in terms of redshift:\n\nThe relation between redshift and scale factor is 1 + z = 1/a. \n\nThe time derivative of the scale factor is da/dt = H a. \n\nWe can express dt in terms of da: dt = da/(H a). \n\nThus,\n\nd_C = c \u222b_{t_em}^{t_0} (dt /a) \n\n= c \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(H a^2) ]\n\nBecause substituting dt = da/(H a), so dt/a becomes da/(H a^2). \n\nThus,\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a^2 E(a)) ]\n\nwhere E(a) = H/H0 = sqrt( \u03a9_m a^{-3} + \u03a9_\u039b a^{-3(1 + w)} )\n\nBut since for cosmological constant, w = -1, so the exponent for dark energy is 0, so E(a) = sqrt( \u03a9_m a^{-3} + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nAlternatively, changing variables to z, since a = 1/(1+z), so when a_em = 1/(1+z), so the integral becomes from z=0 to z= z_quasar. \n\nLet me substitute a = 1/(1+z), so da = - dz/(1+z)^2. The limits go from a=1/(1+z) to a=1, so when a goes from a_em to 1, z goes from z to 0. \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{0}^{z} [ ( - dz/(1+z)^2 ) / ( (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nThe denominator a^2 is (1/(1+z))^2. \n\nSo the integrand becomes [ dz/(1+z)^2 ] divided by [ (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 terms cancel, so the integrand is 1/(E(z)) * dz/(1 + z) ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWait, the integrand after substitution is:\n\n[ da/(a^2 E(a)) ] \u2192 [ (-dz/(1+z)^2) / ( (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nSo that's:\n\n- dz/(1+z)^2 divided by [ (1/(1+z))^2 E(z) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 in the denominator and numerator cancel out, so the integrand becomes -dz / E(z). The negative sign is because we are going from higher a to lower a, but when changing variables, the limits flip. So the integral from a_em to 1 becomes the integral from z=0 to z= z_quasar of dz / [ E(z) (1 + z) )? Wait, maybe I messed up here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me try to redo this carefully.\n\nOriginal integral for d_C is (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a\u00b2 E(a)) ]\n\nExpress a = 1/(1+z), so when a = a_em, z = z_quasar; when a=1, z=0. \n\nThen, da = - dz/(1+z)^2.\n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a\u00b2 E(a)) ]\n\nbecomes \n\n(c/H0) \u222b_{z_quasar}^0 [ (- dz/(1+z)^2 ) / ( (1/(1+z))\u00b2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1/(1+z)) squared is a\u00b2. \n\nThe denominator a\u00b2 E(a) is (1/(1+z))\u00b2 * E(z). \n\nSo the entire fraction is [ -dz/(1+z)^2 ] divided by [ (1/(1+z))\u00b2 E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 terms cancel, so the integrand becomes -dz / E(z). \n\nThe limits are from z_quasar to 0, so flipping the limits removes the negative:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z_quasar [ dz / E(z) ]\n\nWait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. So the correct formula is:\n\nd_C = (c / H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / E(z) ] dz\n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nWait, so that's the key formula. So the integral is from 0 to z of 1/E(z) dz, multiplied by c/H0. \n\nTherefore, to compute the comoving distance, we need to compute this integral. Since this is a bit complex, maybe there's an approximation for high z?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the approximation for high redshift, but let's see. Since z is 5.5, which is high, but maybe not extremely so. Alternatively, perhaps the answer options are such that we can estimate the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the relation between luminosity distance and comoving distance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use a calculator, but since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a standard value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redshift z is about 5.5, and with the given parameters (H0=70, \u03a9m=0.3, \u03a9\u039b=0.7), the comoving distance can be approximated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximate formula for the comoving distance at high redshift. Wait, but I need to think of a way to compute this without doing the integral numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation for matter-dominated universe, but since dark energy is dominant here (since z=5.5, and matter density term (1+z)^3 *0.3 vs dark energy term 0.7. Let's see:\n\nAt z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5. So the matter term is 0.3*(6.5)^3, and the dark energy term is 0.7. \n\nCalculating (6.5)^3: 6.5*6.5 =42.25, 42.25*6.5 = 274.625. So 0.3 * 274.625 = 82.3875. So E(z)^2 = 82.3875 + 0.7 \u224883.0875. So E(z) is sqrt(83.0875) \u2248 9.115. \n\nSo E(z) is about 9.115 at z=5.5. So the integrand 1/E(z) is 1/9.115 \u22480.1097. But the integral from 0 to 5.5 of (1/E(z)) dz. But this is a very rough approximation because E(z) isn't constant over the integral. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral is dominated by the high-z part where E(z) is large, so maybe the integral is roughly (z) / E_avg. But this is not precise. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for high redshift, when dark energy is negligible (since at high z, matter term dominates), but wait, at z=5.5, the matter term is much bigger than dark energy. Wait, at z=5.5, the matter term is 82, and dark energy is 0.7, so yes, matter dominates. So in that case, maybe E(z) is approx sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3). \n\nSo in that case, E(z) ~ sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^{3/2}. Wait, sqrt(\u03a9_m) is sqrt(0.3) \u22480.5477. So E(z) \u22480.5477*(1+z)^{3/2}. \n\nThen the integral becomes \u222b\u2080^z [1/(0.5477*(1+z')^{3/2}) ] dz'\n\nBut this is only valid if dark energy can be neglected. But at lower redshifts (say z < 5.5), the dark energy term becomes non-negligible. So this approximation might not be so good over the entire integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use a standard formula or a known value. Let me think: the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redshift is 5.5 and with H0=70, the comoving distance can be estimated using some calculator. Since I can't do the integral here, perhaps I can recall that for a redshift of around 6, the comoving distance in a Lambda-CDM model with these parameters is roughly 9 Gpc? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the angular diameter distance. Wait, but the question is about comoving distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rough formula. The comoving distance can be approximated for high z (but not extremely high) using the matter-dominated approximation. But in that case, the Hubble parameter would be H(z) = H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}.\n\nThen the comoving distance would be (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [1/( sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z')^{3/2} ) ] dz'\n\n= (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) \u222b\u2080^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'\n\nThe integral of (1+z)^{-3/2} dz from 0 to z is [ -2 (1+z)^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z, so:\n\n-2 ( (1+z)^{-1/2} -1 ) \n\nThus, the integral becomes 2 [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ]\n\nSo the comoving distance would be (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) * 2 [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers, with \u03a9_m=0.3, z=5.5:\n\nsqrt(0.3) \u22480.5477\n\nSo denominator term: sqrt(0.3) =0.5477\n\nThus,\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(70 km/s/Mpc * 0.5477 )) * 2 [ 1 - (6.5)^{-0.5} ]\n\nFirst compute (6.5)^{-0.5} is 1/sqrt(6.5) \u2248 1/2.55 \u22480.392.\n\nSo 1 - 0.392 =0.608\n\nMultiply by 2 gives 1.216.\n\nThus,\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(70 *0.5477 )) * 1.216\n\nBut c in units of km/s is 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo let's compute the constants:\n\n(c / H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m)) = (3e5 km/s ) / (70 km/s/Mpc * 0.5477 )\n\nCompute denominator: 70 *0.5477 \u224838.34 km/s/Mpc.\n\nSo 3e5 / 38.34 \u2248 (3e5)/38.34 \u22487824 Mpc. \n\nMultiply by 1.216 gives 7824 *1.216 \u2248 9500 Mpc. \n\nWait, 7824 *1.2 is 9389, plus 7824*0.016\u2248125, total \u22489514 Mpc. \n\nSo approximately 9.5 Gpc? But this is under the assumption that dark energy is negligible, which it isn't at lower redshifts. Since we're integrating from z=0 to z=5.5, at lower redshifts (like z=0 to z=2), dark energy starts to dominate, so this approximation overestimates the comoving distance because it doesn't account for the dark energy term which would make H(z) smaller than the matter-dominated case, leading to larger distances. Wait, actually, if dark energy is present, then at lower redshifts (z < where matter and dark energy cross), the H(z) would be lower than the matter-only case, which would mean that the integral (comoving distance) would be larger. Since in the previous calculation we neglected dark energy, the approximation gives a lower value than the actual. Wait, let me think again:\n\nIn the matter-dominated case, H(z) is higher than in the Lambda-CDM model because dark energy adds to the energy density. Wait, no. Wait in the matter-dominated model (without dark energy), E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}. In the Lambda-CDM model, E(z) is sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). Since we have a dark energy term, when z is low (like z=0), the dark energy term is significant, so E(z) would be larger than the matter-only case. Wait, but when z is high (like z=5.5), the matter term dominates, so E(z) would be almost the same as the matter-only case. \n\nTherefore, in the approximation where we neglected dark energy (i.e., assuming matter-only), we get a certain value. The actual E(z) at high z is similar to matter-only, so the integral from high z down to some point would be similar. However, the lower part of the integral (z from 0 up to maybe z=1 or so) would have a different E(z) because dark energy is important there. \n\nTherefore, the matter-only approximation gives an underestimate of the comoving distance, because in the lower redshift part (where dark energy is present), the Hubble parameter is larger (since dark energy adds to the energy density), which would make the integral (comoving distance) smaller. Wait, let's think again:\n\nThe comoving distance is (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z 1/E(z') dz'\n\nIf E(z') is larger in the actual model (because of dark energy) at lower z, then 1/E(z') would be smaller, leading to a smaller integral. Therefore, the matter-only approximation (which neglects dark energy, so E(z) is smaller there, leading to 1/E(z) being larger) would overestimate the integral. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:\n\nIn the matter-only model (without dark energy), E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}. \n\nIn the Lambda-CDM model with \u03a9_m=0.3 and \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, at high z (z=5.5), the matter term dominates, so E(z) is roughly the same as the matter-only case. But at lower z, the dark energy term becomes significant, so E(z) is larger than the matter-only case. \n\nTherefore, when integrating from 0 to z=5.5, the integrand 1/E(z') in the Lambda-CDM model is smaller than in the matter-only case for the lower redshift parts (z < some value), leading to a smaller total integral. Thus, the actual comoving distance would be less than the matter-only approximation. \n\nIn our previous calculation with matter-only, we got ~9.5 Gpc. But since the actual case has a smaller integral (because parts of the integrand are smaller), the real value would be less than 9.5 Gpc. The options given are 6,7,8,9. So maybe the correct answer is 8 or 9? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximation with dark energy is better. Let me try another approach. Maybe using the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:\n\nThe comoving distance can be written as:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ] dz'\n\nGiven that z is 5.5, and \u03a9_m =0.3, \u03a9_Lambda=0.7. \n\nWe can approximate this integral numerically. Let's split the integral into two parts: from z=0 to z=5.5, but maybe approximate it in chunks. Alternatively, since doing this by hand is tough, perhaps I can use the fact that for high z, the dark energy term is negligible, so the integral is dominated by the high-z part where E(z) ~ sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral from z=5.5 to higher would be negligible, but our upper limit is 5.5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that at very high z, the comoving distance approaches the Hubble radius at that time, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is around 9 Gpc, but my earlier matter-only gave 9.5, which is close to 9 or 10. The options have 9 as option C. But since in reality the distance would be a bit less, maybe 8 or 9? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance at high z can be approximated as:\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) * [ 2/(sqrt(\u03a9_m)) (1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ) ] \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard value.\n\nWait, let me think of the age of the universe. The age would be the comoving time, but that's a different integral. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that for a redshift of z=6, the comoving distance is about 30 billion light-years. Let's see:\n\n1 Gpc is about 3.26 million light-years. So 30 billion light-years is about 9.2 Gpc. Hmm, so that would be around 9 Gpc. \n\nWait, let me check with approximate values. Suppose the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. The light travel time to a quasar at z=5.5 would be less than the age, but the comoving distance would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 9 Gpc (option C), but the options include 9 and 8 and 7. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use a simple relation between redshift and distance, but that's probably not precise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm making it. Since the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is redshifted from 121.6 nm, so z= (790/121.6)-1\u22485.5. \n\nThen, using the Hubble constant H0=70, but comoving distance is not directly Hubble's law (which is v=H0*d for small distances). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the formula for luminosity distance, but the question asks for comoving distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are in the ballpark of 8-9 Gpc. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me try to approximate the integral numerically. Let's split the integral from z=0 to z=5.5 into two parts: from 0 to 5 and from 5 to 5.5. \n\nFirst, compute E(z) at z=5.5:\n\nE(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+5.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7). \n\nAs before, 6.5^3=274.625, so 0.3*274.625=82.3875, plus 0.7 gives 83.0875. Square root is ~9.115. \n\nAt z=5, (1+z)=6, so 0.3*(6)^3 =0.3*216=64.8, plus 0.7 gives 65.5. sqrt(65.5)=8.093.\n\nAt z=4, 1+z=5, 0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2, sqrt\u22486.18.\n\nAt z=3, 1+z=4: 0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9, sqrt\u22484.46.\n\nAt z=2, 0.3*(27)+0.7=8.1+0.7=8.8 \u2192 sqrt\u22482.966.\n\nAt z=1: 0.3*(8)+0.7=2.4+0.7=3.1 \u2192 sqrt\u22481.76.\n\nAt z=0: sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1.\n\nSo, the integrand 1/E(z) at various points:\n\nAt z=0: 1/1=1.\n\nAt z=1: 1/1.76\u22480.568.\n\nz=2: ~1/2.966\u22480.337.\n\nz=3: ~1/4.46\u22480.224.\n\nz=4: ~1/6.093\u22480.164.\n\nz=5: ~1/8.093\u22480.1236.\n\nz=5.5: ~0.1097.\n\nNow, to approximate the integral \u222b\u2080^5.5 (1/E(z)) dz, we can use the trapezoidal rule with these points.\n\nLet's divide the interval into segments:\n\nFrom z=0 to z=1 (\u0394z=1):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.568 is (1+0.568)/2 \u22480.784.

Area\u22480.1438*1=0.1438.\n\nz=5 to5.5 (\u0394z=0.5):\n\nAvg (0.1236 +0.1097)/2\u22480.11665. Area\u22480.11665*0.5\u22480.0583.\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n0.784 +0.4525 =1.2365\n\n+0.2805 \u21921.517\n\n+0.194 \u21921.711\n\n+0.1438 \u21921.8548\n\n+0.0583 \u21921.9131.\n\nSo the total integral \u222b\u2080^5.5 (1/E(z)) dz \u22481.9131.\n\nThen, the comoving distance is (c/H0)*1.9131.\n\nc is 3e5 km/s.\n\nH0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.\n\nSo (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5/70) Mpc \u22484285.7 Mpc.\n\nMultiply by 1.9131:\n\n4285.7 *1.9131 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n4285.7 *1.9 = 8142.83,\n\n4285.7 *0.0131 \u2248 4285.7 *0.01=42.857; 4285.7 *0.0031\u224813.305. Total extra\u224856.16.\n\nTotal \u22488142.83 +56.16 \u22488199 Mpc, which is ~8.2 Gpc (since 1 Gpc =10^3 Mpc). \n\nSo approximately 8.2 Gpc. The options are 6,7,8,9. So 8 Gpc is the closest. Hence the answer is B) 8 Gpc?\n\nWait, but my approximation might be off. Let me check the calculation steps again. \n\nWait, the integral approximation using trapezoidal gives ~1.9131. Then, (c/H0) is 3e5 /70 = ~4285.7 Mpc. So 4285.7 *1.9131 \u22484285.7*2 is ~8571, subtract 4285.7*0.0869 (since 2-1.9131=0.0869). 4285.7 *0.0869 \u2248 4285.7*0.08=342.86, 4285.7*0.0069\u224829.6, total \u2248372.5. So 8571-372.5\u22488198 Mpc, so ~8.2 Gpc. \n\nSo the approximate answer is 8.2 Gpc, which would be option B (8 Gpc). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact calculation, but given the options, 8 Gpc is the closest. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) 8 Gpc.\n\nWait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps my trapezoidal approximation is underestimating the integral? Let me see: the function 1/E(z) is decreasing, so the trapezoidal rule on intervals where the function is concave or convex?\n\nThe function E(z) is increasing, so 1/E(z) is decreasing. The trapezoidal rule for a decreasing function over an interval might underestimate or overestimate depending on the curvature. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approximation would use more points. For instance, between z=0 and z=1, the function is dropping from 1 to ~0.568. The trapezoid there is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual integral is a bit higher. Let's see, if I compute with more points. Let's add a point at z=5.25 between 5 and 5.5. \n\nAt z=5.25, (1+z)=6.25, so 0.3*(6.25)^3 +0.7. \n\n6.25^3 is 244.14, 0.3*244.14=73.242 +0.7=73.942 \u2192 sqrt\u22488.598. \n\nSo 1/E(z)=1/8.598\u22480.1163. \n\nSo between z=5 and 5.5:\n\nThe trapezoid between z=5 and 5.25 would be (0.1236 +0.1163)/2 *0.25= (0.2399)/2 *0.25\u22480.0300.\n\nThen between 5.25 and 5.5:\n\n(0.1163 +0.1097)/2 *0.25\u2248 (0.226)/2 *0.25\u22480.02825.\n\nTotal for the 0.5 interval would be 0.03+0.02825\u22480.05825, which is similar to what I had before. So the total remains ~1.913.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my trapezoidal approach is okay. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the exact value might be around 8 Gpc. The options include that, so the answer should be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the comoving distance of the quasar based on the given information. Let's start by recalling what the question is asking. The problem mentions that in the near infrared and optical spectrum of a quasar, there's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I think this peak might be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is typically at around 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But here, the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So maybe this is due to redshift?\n\nRight, the Lyman-alpha line is a common feature in quasars, and when it's observed at a much longer wavelength, that's a sign of redshift. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. Let's compute that.\n\nThe rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. The observed is 790 nm. So, z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let me do that math. 790 - 121.6 is 668.4. Dividing that by 121.6 gives approximately 5.5. Wait, 121.6 *5 is 608, so 668.4 -608 is 60.4, so 60.4/121.6 is about 0.5. So total z is about 5.5. So the redshift z is around 5.5?\n\nWait, but the question mentions that at shorter wavelengths than 790 nm, the flux drops. That might be due to the Lyman-alpha forest, which is absorption features at lower redshifts, but maybe here the peak is the emission line. Anyway, the key point is the observed wavelength gives us the redshift.\n\nSo, assuming that the 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha line, then the redshift z would be (790/121.6) -1. Let me compute that exactly. 790 divided by 121.6 equals approximately 6.495. Subtract 1 gives z\u22485.495, so about z\u22485.5. Let me check that again. 121.6 * 6.5 is 121.6*6 =729.6 plus 60.8 is 790.4. Oh, so actually 790 is very close to exactly 6.5 times 121.6. So z =6.5-1 =5.5 exactly? Wait, 790 divided by 121.6 is 6.5? Let me check:\n\n121.6 *6.5 = 121.6*(6 +0.5) = 729.6 +60.8 = 790.4. Oh, so the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is just a bit less than 790.4. So maybe z is slightly less than 5.5, but very close. For the purposes of this problem, I think we can assume that the redshift is approximately z=5.5.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the comoving distance using the Lambda-CDM model parameters given. The Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter \u03a9_m =0.3, dark energy \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat. The question is asking for the comoving distance at scale factor a=1 (which is the current time, so the distance now).\n\nThe comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The formula for comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(z)(1+z)) dz, but that's complicated. Alternatively, there's an approximation or a standard way to compute this with the given parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the relation between redshift and comoving distance. Since the parameters are given, perhaps we can use an online calculator or a standard formula. Wait, but since this is a problem to be solved manually, maybe they expect an approximate value or using some standard redshift-distance relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the approximation for high redshifts. But let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the Hubble parameter H(z) in a flat universe is given by:\n\nH(z)^2 = H0^2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^3/(exp(3(1+w)z) ) ??? Wait no, for dark energy, assuming it's a cosmological constant, w = -1, so the dark energy density doesn't change with scale factor. Wait, the dark energy density term is actually \u03a9_\u039b a^{-3(1+w)}, but for w = -1 (cosmological constant), then 1+w =0, so the term becomes \u03a9_\u039b a^0 = \u03a9_\u039b. Since a=1/(1+z), so in terms of z, the dark energy term is \u03a9_\u039b. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the Friedmann equation is H\u00b2 = H\u2080\u00b2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_k (1+z)^2 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^0 ].\n\nSince the universe is flat, \u03a9_k =0, so H(z)\u00b2 = H\u2080\u00b2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ].\n\nTherefore, the integral for comoving distance is:\n\nd_comoving = c \u222b\u2080^z [ H\u2080\u00b2 (\u03a9_m (1+z')\u00b3 + \u03a9_\u039b) ]^{-1/2} (1 + z') dz' / (1+z') ?\n\nWait, let me get the exact formula. The comoving distance is the integral from a=0 (or z=0) to a=1/(1+z) of a/H(a) da. Alternatively, expressed in terms of z:\n\nd_comoving = c \u222b\u2080^z \\frac{dz'}{H(z)/(1+z)}.\n\nWait, the correct formula is:\n\nThe comoving distance is given by:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z')},\n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b (1+z)^3/( (1+z)^3 ) ? Wait no, let me re-derive E(z):\n\nWait, H(z) = H0 sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ), because for dark energy (cosmological constant), its density is proportional to a^{-3(1 + w)}, and since w = -1 for cosmological constant, so 1 + w =0, so exponent is 0. So the density is constant. Thus, H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b ]\n\nThus, E(z) = sqrt( \u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nTherefore, the integrand is 1/(E(z') (1 + z')), since the integral for comoving distance is:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z') (1 + z')}.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me check:\n\nThe relation between comoving distance and redshift is:\n\nd_C = c \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')} \n\nBut since H(t) = (da/dt)/a, so dt = da/(a H). So,\n\nd_C = c \\int_{a_i}^{1} \\frac{da}{a^2 H(a)} \n\nBut integrating from a=0 (the time of emission) to a=1 (now). Alternatively, changing variables to z = 1/a -1, so when a=1/(1+z), so da/dz = -1/(1+z)^2. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to look up the standard expression. The comoving distance is:\n\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z') (1 + z')}\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Let me recall that the comoving distance is the integral from the time of emission to now of c dt/a(t). \n\nExpressed in terms of redshift:\n\nThe relation between redshift and scale factor is 1 + z = 1/a. \n\nThe time derivative of the scale factor is da/dt = H a. \n\nWe can express dt in terms of da: dt = da/(H a). \n\nThus,\n\nd_C = c \u222b_{t_em}^{t_0} (dt /a) \n\n= c \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(H a^2) ]\n\nBecause substituting dt = da/(H a), so dt/a becomes da/(H a^2). \n\nThus,\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a^2 E(a)) ]\n\nwhere E(a) = H/H0 = sqrt( \u03a9_m a^{-3} + \u03a9_\u039b a^{-3(1 + w)} )\n\nBut since for cosmological constant, w = -1, so the exponent for dark energy is 0, so E(a) = sqrt( \u03a9_m a^{-3} + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nAlternatively, changing variables to z, since a = 1/(1+z), so when a_em = 1/(1+z), so the integral becomes from z=0 to z= z_quasar. \n\nLet me substitute a = 1/(1+z), so da = - dz/(1+z)^2. The limits go from a=1/(1+z) to a=1, so when a goes from a_em to 1, z goes from z to 0. \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{0}^{z} [ ( - dz/(1+z)^2 ) / ( (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nThe denominator a^2 is (1/(1+z))^2. \n\nSo the integrand becomes [ dz/(1+z)^2 ] divided by [ (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 terms cancel, so the integrand is 1/(E(z)) * dz/(1 + z) ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWait, the integrand after substitution is:\n\n[ da/(a^2 E(a)) ] \u2192 [ (-dz/(1+z)^2) / ( (1/(1+z))^2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nSo that's:\n\n- dz/(1+z)^2 divided by [ (1/(1+z))^2 E(z) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 in the denominator and numerator cancel out, so the integrand becomes -dz / E(z). The negative sign is because we are going from higher a to lower a, but when changing variables, the limits flip. So the integral from a_em to 1 becomes the integral from z=0 to z= z_quasar of dz / [ E(z) (1 + z) )? Wait, maybe I messed up here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me try to redo this carefully.\n\nOriginal integral for d_C is (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a\u00b2 E(a)) ]\n\nExpress a = 1/(1+z), so when a = a_em, z = z_quasar; when a=1, z=0. \n\nThen, da = - dz/(1+z)^2.\n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b_{a_em}^1 [ da/(a\u00b2 E(a)) ]\n\nbecomes \n\n(c/H0) \u222b_{z_quasar}^0 [ (- dz/(1+z)^2 ) / ( (1/(1+z))\u00b2 * E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1/(1+z)) squared is a\u00b2. \n\nThe denominator a\u00b2 E(a) is (1/(1+z))\u00b2 * E(z). \n\nSo the entire fraction is [ -dz/(1+z)^2 ] divided by [ (1/(1+z))\u00b2 E(z) ) ]\n\nThe (1+z)^2 terms cancel, so the integrand becomes -dz / E(z). \n\nThe limits are from z_quasar to 0, so flipping the limits removes the negative:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z_quasar [ dz / E(z) ]\n\nWait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. So the correct formula is:\n\nd_C = (c / H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / E(z) ] dz\n\nwhere E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_\u039b )\n\nWait, so that's the key formula. So the integral is from 0 to z of 1/E(z) dz, multiplied by c/H0. \n\nTherefore, to compute the comoving distance, we need to compute this integral. Since this is a bit complex, maybe there's an approximation for high z?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the approximation for high redshift, but let's see. Since z is 5.5, which is high, but maybe not extremely so. Alternatively, perhaps the answer options are such that we can estimate the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the relation between luminosity distance and comoving distance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use a calculator, but since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a standard value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redshift z is about 5.5, and with the given parameters (H0=70, \u03a9m=0.3, \u03a9\u039b=0.7), the comoving distance can be approximated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the approximate formula for the comoving distance at high redshift. Wait, but I need to think of a way to compute this without doing the integral numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation for matter-dominated universe, but since dark energy is dominant here (since z=5.5, and matter density term (1+z)^3 *0.3 vs dark energy term 0.7. Let's see:\n\nAt z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5. So the matter term is 0.3*(6.5)^3, and the dark energy term is 0.7. \n\nCalculating (6.5)^3: 6.5*6.5 =42.25, 42.25*6.5 = 274.625. So 0.3 * 274.625 = 82.3875. So E(z)^2 = 82.3875 + 0.7 \u224883.0875. So E(z) is sqrt(83.0875) \u2248 9.115. \n\nSo E(z) is about 9.115 at z=5.5. So the integrand 1/E(z) is 1/9.115 \u22480.1097. But the integral from 0 to 5.5 of (1/E(z)) dz. But this is a very rough approximation because E(z) isn't constant over the integral. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral is dominated by the high-z part where E(z) is large, so maybe the integral is roughly (z) / E_avg. But this is not precise. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for high redshift, when dark energy is negligible (since at high z, matter term dominates), but wait, at z=5.5, the matter term is much bigger than dark energy. Wait, at z=5.5, the matter term is 82, and dark energy is 0.7, so yes, matter dominates. So in that case, maybe E(z) is approx sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3). \n\nSo in that case, E(z) ~ sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^{3/2}. Wait, sqrt(\u03a9_m) is sqrt(0.3) \u22480.5477. So E(z) \u22480.5477*(1+z)^{3/2}. \n\nThen the integral becomes \u222b\u2080^z [1/(0.5477*(1+z')^{3/2}) ] dz'\n\nBut this is only valid if dark energy can be neglected. But at lower redshifts (say z < 5.5), the dark energy term becomes non-negligible. So this approximation might not be so good over the entire integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use a standard formula or a known value. Let me think: the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redshift is 5.5 and with H0=70, the comoving distance can be estimated using some calculator. Since I can't do the integral here, perhaps I can recall that for a redshift of around 6, the comoving distance in a Lambda-CDM model with these parameters is roughly 9 Gpc? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the angular diameter distance. Wait, but the question is about comoving distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rough formula. The comoving distance can be approximated for high z (but not extremely high) using the matter-dominated approximation. But in that case, the Hubble parameter would be H(z) = H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}.\n\nThen the comoving distance would be (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [1/( sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z')^{3/2} ) ] dz'\n\n= (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) \u222b\u2080^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'\n\nThe integral of (1+z)^{-3/2} dz from 0 to z is [ -2 (1+z)^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z, so:\n\n-2 ( (1+z)^{-1/2} -1 ) \n\nThus, the integral becomes 2 [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ]\n\nSo the comoving distance would be (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) * 2 [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers, with \u03a9_m=0.3, z=5.5:\n\nsqrt(0.3) \u22480.5477\n\nSo denominator term: sqrt(0.3) =0.5477\n\nThus,\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(70 km/s/Mpc * 0.5477 )) * 2 [ 1 - (6.5)^{-0.5} ]\n\nFirst compute (6.5)^{-0.5} is 1/sqrt(6.5) \u2248 1/2.55 \u22480.392.\n\nSo 1 - 0.392 =0.608\n\nMultiply by 2 gives 1.216.\n\nThus,\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(70 *0.5477 )) * 1.216\n\nBut c in units of km/s is 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo let's compute the constants:\n\n(c / H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m)) = (3e5 km/s ) / (70 km/s/Mpc * 0.5477 )\n\nCompute denominator: 70 *0.5477 \u224838.34 km/s/Mpc.\n\nSo 3e5 / 38.34 \u2248 (3e5)/38.34 \u22487824 Mpc. \n\nMultiply by 1.216 gives 7824 *1.216 \u2248 9500 Mpc. \n\nWait, 7824 *1.2 is 9389, plus 7824*0.016\u2248125, total \u22489514 Mpc. \n\nSo approximately 9.5 Gpc? But this is under the assumption that dark energy is negligible, which it isn't at lower redshifts. Since we're integrating from z=0 to z=5.5, at lower redshifts (like z=0 to z=2), dark energy starts to dominate, so this approximation overestimates the comoving distance because it doesn't account for the dark energy term which would make H(z) smaller than the matter-dominated case, leading to larger distances. Wait, actually, if dark energy is present, then at lower redshifts (z < where matter and dark energy cross), the H(z) would be lower than the matter-only case, which would mean that the integral (comoving distance) would be larger. Since in the previous calculation we neglected dark energy, the approximation gives a lower value than the actual. Wait, let me think again:\n\nIn the matter-dominated case, H(z) is higher than in the Lambda-CDM model because dark energy adds to the energy density. Wait, no. Wait in the matter-dominated model (without dark energy), E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}. In the Lambda-CDM model, E(z) is sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z)^3 + \u03a9_Lambda). Since we have a dark energy term, when z is low (like z=0), the dark energy term is significant, so E(z) would be larger than the matter-only case. Wait, but when z is high (like z=5.5), the matter term dominates, so E(z) would be almost the same as the matter-only case. \n\nTherefore, in the approximation where we neglected dark energy (i.e., assuming matter-only), we get a certain value. The actual E(z) at high z is similar to matter-only, so the integral from high z down to some point would be similar. However, the lower part of the integral (z from 0 up to maybe z=1 or so) would have a different E(z) because dark energy is important there. \n\nTherefore, the matter-only approximation gives an underestimate of the comoving distance, because in the lower redshift part (where dark energy is present), the Hubble parameter is larger (since dark energy adds to the energy density), which would make the integral (comoving distance) smaller. Wait, let's think again:\n\nThe comoving distance is (c/H0) \u222b\u2080^z 1/E(z') dz'\n\nIf E(z') is larger in the actual model (because of dark energy) at lower z, then 1/E(z') would be smaller, leading to a smaller integral. Therefore, the matter-only approximation (which neglects dark energy, so E(z) is smaller there, leading to 1/E(z) being larger) would overestimate the integral. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me recap:\n\nIn the matter-only model (without dark energy), E(z) = sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}. \n\nIn the Lambda-CDM model with \u03a9_m=0.3 and \u03a9_Lambda=0.7, at high z (z=5.5), the matter term dominates, so E(z) is roughly the same as the matter-only case. But at lower z, the dark energy term becomes significant, so E(z) is larger than the matter-only case. \n\nTherefore, when integrating from 0 to z=5.5, the integrand 1/E(z') in the Lambda-CDM model is smaller than in the matter-only case for the lower redshift parts (z < some value), leading to a smaller total integral. Thus, the actual comoving distance would be less than the matter-only approximation. \n\nIn our previous calculation with matter-only, we got ~9.5 Gpc. But since the actual case has a smaller integral (because parts of the integrand are smaller), the real value would be less than 9.5 Gpc. The options given are 6,7,8,9. So maybe the correct answer is 8 or 9? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximation with dark energy is better. Let me try another approach. Maybe using the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe:\n\nThe comoving distance can be written as:\n\nd_C = (c/H0) * \u222b\u2080^z [ 1 / sqrt(\u03a9_m (1+z')^3 + \u03a9_Lambda) ] dz'\n\nGiven that z is 5.5, and \u03a9_m =0.3, \u03a9_Lambda=0.7. \n\nWe can approximate this integral numerically. Let's split the integral into two parts: from z=0 to z=5.5, but maybe approximate it in chunks. Alternatively, since doing this by hand is tough, perhaps I can use the fact that for high z, the dark energy term is negligible, so the integral is dominated by the high-z part where E(z) ~ sqrt(\u03a9_m) (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral from z=5.5 to higher would be negligible, but our upper limit is 5.5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that at very high z, the comoving distance approaches the Hubble radius at that time, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is around 9 Gpc, but my earlier matter-only gave 9.5, which is close to 9 or 10. The options have 9 as option C. But since in reality the distance would be a bit less, maybe 8 or 9? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance at high z can be approximated as:\n\nd_C \u2248 (c/(H0 sqrt(\u03a9_m))) * [ 2/(sqrt(\u03a9_m)) (1 - (1+z)^{-1/2} ) ] \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard value.\n\nWait, let me think of the age of the universe. The age would be the comoving time, but that's a different integral. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that for a redshift of z=6, the comoving distance is about 30 billion light-years. Let's see:\n\n1 Gpc is about 3.26 million light-years. So 30 billion light-years is about 9.2 Gpc. Hmm, so that would be around 9 Gpc. \n\nWait, let me check with approximate values. Suppose the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. The light travel time to a quasar at z=5.5 would be less than the age, but the comoving distance would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 9 Gpc (option C), but the options include 9 and 8 and 7. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use a simple relation between redshift and distance, but that's probably not precise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm making it. Since the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is redshifted from 121.6 nm, so z= (790/121.6)-1\u22485.5. \n\nThen, using the Hubble constant H0=70, but comoving distance is not directly Hubble's law (which is v=H0*d for small distances). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the formula for luminosity distance, but the question asks for comoving distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are in the ballpark of 8-9 Gpc. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me try to approximate the integral numerically. Let's split the integral from z=0 to z=5.5 into two parts: from 0 to 5 and from 5 to 5.5. \n\nFirst, compute E(z) at z=5.5:\n\nE(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+5.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7). \n\nAs before, 6.5^3=274.625, so 0.3*274.625=82.3875, plus 0.7 gives 83.0875. Square root is ~9.115. \n\nAt z=5, (1+z)=6, so 0.3*(6)^3 =0.3*216=64.8, plus 0.7 gives 65.5. sqrt(65.5)=8.093.\n\nAt z=4, 1+z=5, 0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2, sqrt\u22486.18.\n\nAt z=3, 1+z=4: 0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9, sqrt\u22484.46.\n\nAt z=2, 0.3*(27)+0.7=8.1+0.7=8.8 \u2192 sqrt\u22482.966.\n\nAt z=1: 0.3*(8)+0.7=2.4+0.7=3.1 \u2192 sqrt\u22481.76.\n\nAt z=0: sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1.\n\nSo, the integrand 1/E(z) at various points:\n\nAt z=0: 1/1=1.\n\nAt z=1: 1/1.76\u22480.568.\n\nz=2: ~1/2.966\u22480.337.\n\nz=3: ~1/4.46\u22480.224.\n\nz=4: ~1/6.093\u22480.164.\n\nz=5: ~1/8.093\u22480.1236.\n\nz=5.5: ~0.1097.\n\nNow, to approximate the integral \u222b\u2080^5.5 (1/E(z)) dz, we can use the trapezoidal rule with these points.\n\nLet's divide the interval into segments:\n\nFrom z=0 to z=1 (\u0394z=1):\n\nAverage of 1 and 0.568 is (1+0.568)/2 \u22480.784. Area \u22480.784*1=0.784.\n\nz=1 to z=2 (\u0394z=1):\n\nAvg of 0.568 and 0.337: (0.568+0.337)/2\u22480.4525. Area \u22480.4525*1=0.4525.\n\nz=2 to 3:\n\nAvg (0.337+0.224)/2\u22480.2805.

Area\u22480.1438*1=0.1438.\n\nz=5 to5.5 (\u0394z=0.5):\n\nAvg (0.1236 +0.1097)/2\u22480.11665. Area\u22480.11665*0.5\u22480.0583.\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n0.784 +0.4525 =1.2365\n\n+0.2805 \u21921.517\n\n+0.194 \u21921.711\n\n+0.1438 \u21921.8548\n\n+0.0583 \u21921.9131.\n\nSo the total integral \u222b\u2080^5.5 (1/E(z)) dz \u22481.9131.\n\nThen, the comoving distance is (c/H0)*1.9131.\n\nc is 3e5 km/s.\n\nH0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.\n\nSo (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) = (3e5/70) Mpc \u22484285.7 Mpc.\n\nMultiply by 1.9131:\n\n4285.7 *1.9131 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n4285.7 *1.9 = 8142.83,\n\n4285.7 *0.0131 \u2248 4285.7 *0.01=42.857; 4285.7 *0.0031\u224813.305. Total extra\u224856.16.\n\nTotal \u22488142.83 +56.16 \u22488199 Mpc, which is ~8.2 Gpc (since 1 Gpc =10^3 Mpc). \n\nSo approximately 8.2 Gpc. The options are 6,7,8,9. So 8 Gpc is the closest. Hence the answer is B) 8 Gpc?\n\nWait, but my approximation might be off. Let me check the calculation steps again. \n\nWait, the integral approximation using trapezoidal gives ~1.9131. Then, (c/H0) is 3e5 /70 = ~4285.7 Mpc. So 4285.7 *1.9131 \u22484285.7*2 is ~8571, subtract 4285.7*0.0869 (since 2-1.9131=0.0869). 4285.7 *0.0869 \u2248 4285.7*0.08=342.86, 4285.7*0.0069\u224829.6, total \u2248372.5. So 8571-372.5\u22488198 Mpc, so ~8.2 Gpc. \n\nSo the approximate answer is 8.2 Gpc, which would be option B (8 Gpc). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact calculation, but given the options, 8 Gpc is the closest. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) 8 Gpc.\n\nWait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps my trapezoidal approximation is underestimating the integral? Let me see: the function 1/E(z) is decreasing, so the trapezoidal rule on intervals where the function is concave or convex?\n\nThe function E(z) is increasing, so 1/E(z) is decreasing. The trapezoidal rule for a decreasing function over an interval might underestimate or overestimate depending on the curvature. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approximation would use more points. For instance, between z=0 and z=1, the function is dropping from 1 to ~0.568. The trapezoid there is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual integral is a bit higher. Let's see, if I compute with more points. Let's add a point at z=5.25 between 5 and 5.5. \n\nAt z=5.25, (1+z)=6.25, so 0.3*(6.25)^3 +0.7. \n\n6.25^3 is 244.14, 0.3*244.14=73.242 +0.7=73.942 \u2192 sqrt\u22488.598. \n\nSo 1/E(z)=1/8.598\u22480.1163. \n\nSo between z=5 and 5.5:\n\nThe trapezoid between z=5 and 5.25 would be (0.1236 +0.1163)/2 *0.25= (0.2399)/2 *0.25\u22480.0300.\n\nThen between 5.25 and 5.5:\n\n(0.1163 +0.1097)/2 *0.25\u2248 (0.226)/2 *0.25\u22480.02825.\n\nTotal for the 0.5 interval would be 0.03+0.02825\u22480.05825, which is similar to what I had before. So the total remains ~1.913.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my trapezoidal approach is okay. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the exact value might be around 8 Gpc. The options include that, so the answer should be B.\n\n\nThe observed Lyman-alpha peak at 790 nm corresponds to a redshift \\( z \\approx 5.5 \\), calculated from \\( z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} - 1 \\). Using the Lambda-CDM model parameters (\\( H_0 = 70 \\, \\text{km/s/Mpc} \\), \\( \\Omega_m = 0.3 \\), \\( \\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7 \\)), the comoving distance is computed via the integral:\n\n\\[\nd_C = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^{z} \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \\Omega_\\Lambda}}.\n\\]\n\nApproximating this integral using the trapezoidal rule for \\( z = 5.5 \\), the integral evaluates to approximately \\( 1.91 \\). Multiplying by \\( \\frac{c}{H_0} \\approx 4286 \\, \\text{Mpc} \\), the comoving distance is roughly \\( 8.2 \\, \\text{Gpc} \\). The closest option is **8 Gpc**.\n\nAnswer: B",
