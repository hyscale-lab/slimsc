      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The compound is C9H11NO2. I need to figure out which option matches the given IR and NMR data. Let me start by analyzing each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, the IR spectrum has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. These are likely from N-H stretching vibrations. Since there are two peaks here, maybe an amide (which has two N-H vibrations) or something like an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a carboxylic acid derivative, like an ester or amide. Wait, carboxylic acid derivatives usually have C=O stretches around 1700-1750 cm\u207b\u00b9. The presence of both N-H and a C=O suggests maybe an amide? But esters have a C=O too. Let me think. Amides have a C=O around 1650-1700, so 1720 might be more of an ester? Wait, esters are around 1730-1750. Hmm. The 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is close to that. Wait, maybe the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. But the N-H bands could be from an amine or amide. \n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break down the peaks. The integrals are given as 3H, 2H (but broad?), 2H, 2H, 2H. Wait, the total protons should add up to 11. Let's check: 3+2+2+2+2=11? Wait, 3+2 is 5, plus next 2 (7), then 2 (9), then 2 (11). Yes. So that matches the formula's 11 H.\n\nStarting with the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H). That's probably a methyl group attached to a carbon with two neighboring hydrogens, so like a CH3CH2-O-... structure, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's a methyl adjacent to a methylene.\n\nThen at 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad peaks often indicate exchangeable protons, like -OH or -NH. But the IR shows N-H, so maybe this is an amine group? Amines can show as broad singlets. Alternatively, maybe the -NH2, but that would be two protons? Wait, the integration here is 2H, so maybe it's an amino group (-NH2) but that's two protons. But then why is it a singlet? Alternatively, maybe an amide's NH? Wait, amide N-H's in NMR can be broad but vary. Wait, the IR has two peaks at around 3420 and 3325, which could be two N-H groups. Like an amine (primary amine has two N-H, so two peaks in IR). So maybe the 4.0 ppm is an amino group (-NH2), but as a singlet? Hmm, maybe in a symmetric position?\n\nNext peak at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with three protons. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, and 4.5 is a quartet. Let's think: the 1.20 ppm is the methyl of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the oxygen in an ethoxy group (like CH2CH3-O-). Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen (like in an ester) would have a triplet (since the CH3 is three protons), but here it's a quartet. Wait, maybe the structure is an ester where the ethyl is attached via an oxygen, so the ethoxy group. Let me think. For example, in ethyl acetate, the ethoxy CH2 is a triplet (from the CH3), but here the CH2 is a quartet. Hmm, that suggests maybe the CH2 is next to another group that's causing more splitting? Or perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is part of an ester group, so the structure is something like O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm might be the methylene adjacent to the oxygen in an ethyl ester group. Wait, in ethyl ester (like CH2CH3-O-CO-), the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3 (3H), so triplet. So that would be a triplet. But here it's a quartet. Hmm. Maybe the adjacent group has more hydrogens? Or maybe it's part of a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl is in a different position. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a methylene adjacent to another methylene? Wait, maybe the structure is an amide with an ethyl group. Let's hold that thought.\n\nThe next peaks are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. The doublet patterns suggest coupling with one proton each, typical of ortho or para positions. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are typical for aromatic rings. The 8.0 is a bit higher, maybe meta to something electron-withdrawing? Or maybe the substituents are in the para positions. Let me consider the aromatic regions. \n\nPutting it all together. The compound has an ethyl group (from the 1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet), which suggests an ethyl ester or ethoxy group. The NMR peaks at 7 and 8 ppm for aromatic protons suggest a benzene ring with substituents. The presence of N-H groups in the IR suggests an amine or amide. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be. Wait, formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 + N - H + X)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 +1 -11)/2 = (18+2+1-11)=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That would be one benzene ring (4) plus one carbonyl (1), totaling 5. So that fits with an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (like ester or amide). \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be: benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and an amide group (CONH2) at position 4? Wait, benzamide is when the amide is directly attached to the benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the amide (CONH2) at one position and ethoxy at another. Let's see the NMR. The amide's N-H would be around 8-9 ppm, but in the NMR given, the aromatic peaks are at 7 and 8. Wait, the amide's N-H might be in the IR, but in the 1H NMR, maybe it's a singlet. Wait, the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). That could be the amide's NH2? Wait, benzamide would have CONH2, so two N-H protons. But in an amide, the NH2 would be part of the amide, but actually, benzamide is RCONH2, so the amide has an NH2. Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is benzene-C(=O)-NH2. So the amide has two N-H protons. So their chemical shift would be around 8-9 ppm? Wait, but in the given data, the N-H is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is lower. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the amide's N-H is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the amide is in a different position. Let me think.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (HCONH-). Wait, structure would be H2N-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be HCONH-Ph-O-CH2CH3? Wait, the formamide group is HCONH- attached to a phenyl group which has an ethoxy group at para. The formamide would have a carbonyl (so 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 matches the ester? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1700, but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which is more like an ester. Maybe that's not the right option.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propionic acid's ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate group would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, so the ester. The structure would have an ethyl group in the propionate? Wait, maybe the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that would add more carbons. Let's see the molecular formula. The options are C9H11NO2. Let me count for option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The benzene ring (C6) plus the propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) would be C6 + (COOCH2CH2CH3) which is 3 carbons from the propyl, so total C6+3+2 (the COO?) Wait, wait, the propionate group is -COOCH2CH2CH3, so that's 3 carbons from the propyl. The benzene ring is 6, so total 6+5 (COOCH2CH2CH3 has 5 carbons?) Wait, no: the propionate ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the propionate is three carbons (the propyl group). The benzene is 6, so total 6 + (COO- is two C's) plus the propyl's 3 gives 6+2+3=11 C? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9. Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate: the benzene ring (6 C) plus the propionate group (COOCH2CH2CH3) which has 3 (propyl) + 2 (COO) = 5 C. Total 6+5=11? But the compound is supposed to be C9. So that might not add up. Maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is an ester where the propionic acid is esterified with another group. Hmm, perhaps this option is not correct.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure is: benzene ring with a COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 4 and an NH2 at position 4? Wait, no, wait. The name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate part is the carboxylate esterified. So the structure is: O-CO-O-CH2CH3 attached to the benzene at position 4, and an NH2 group also at position 4? No, the aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the same carbon as the COO group? Wait, no. The correct structure would be the benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and a COOEt group at another position? Wait, no. Wait, \"4-aminobenzoate\" means the amino is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? No, that's not possible. Wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So 4-aminobenzoic acid would have a COOH at position 4 and an NH2 at another position? Wait, no. The name would be 4-aminobenzoic acid, which has the amino group on the same carbon as the COOH? That's not possible. Wait, actually, the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the benzene ring, with the carboxylic acid group (which is then esterified with ethyl). So the structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt group at another position (maybe position 1?), but the numbering would have the substituents as close as possible. So the structure would be: benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and an ethyl ester (COOEt) at position 2 or 3? Wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are as low as possible. So the ethyl ester would be at position 1, and the amino at 4. So the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to position 1 and NH2 at position 4. \n\nLet me think of the NMR for option D. The ethyl group would have the CH3 at ~1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 at ~4 ppm (quartet? Wait, in an ethyl ester group, the ethyl is attached via the oxygen. So the structure is: COO-CH2-CH3. The CH2 next to the oxygen would have the protons in the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen. The chemical shift for that CH2 in ethyl esters is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet. Because the CH2 is adjacent to the oxygen and the CH3 is three protons. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm matches that. The CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2 ppm, which matches the given data. The NH2 group would be an amino group, which in the NMR is a broad singlet. The IR has two N-H peaks (the amino group has two N-H bonds), which matches. The carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is the ester's carbonyl (which is around 1720-1740, so that fits). \n\nThe aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's see: in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and an ester group (O-CO-OEt) at position 1 (assuming numbering where the substituents are numbered as low as possible). The amino group is electron-donating, which would deshield the aromatic protons adjacent to it. The ester group is electron-withdrawing. Let's see the positions. The ester is at position 1, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) might be shifted upfield or downfield. The amino at position 4 would affect positions 3 and 5. \n\nWait, let's think of the specific peaks. The given NMR has two sets of aromatic protons: a doublet at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). The 8.0 ppm is higher, so maybe those are the meta positions relative to the amino group. Let's see:\n\nIf the amino is at position 4 and the ester at position 1, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the ester (position 1), so maybe they are downfield-shifted. The amino at 4 would affect positions 3 and 5. The amino is electron-donating, so those protons (3 and 5) would be upfield. But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is lower (upfield) and 8.0 is higher. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, the ester is at position 4? Wait no, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the carboxylate is at the 4 position. Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Let me clarify the structure again. The benzoate part: the carboxylic acid is at position 4, and the ester is formed by replacing the -OH with -OEt. So the structure is: the benzene ring with a COOEt group at position 4 and an NH2 group also at position 4? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the name is 4-aminobenzoic acid, which has the amino group on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? No, that's impossible. Wait, the correct structure is that the amino group is on a different carbon. Wait, maybe the 4-aminobenzoate has the amino group on the fourth carbon, and the carboxylic acid (now esterified) is on the same ring. So the carboxylic acid is on the same ring, but at a different position. Wait, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate is the carboxylate group. So the structure is: benzene ring with a COOEt group (from the ester) and an NH2 group on the fourth carbon. So the two groups are on different carbons. Let's say the COOEt is at position 1 (to minimize numbering), and the NH2 is at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be arranged as follows:\n\nPositions 1: attached to COOEt (electron-withdrawing, so adjacent protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded (higher field? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups like esters typically cause adjacent protons to be downfield. So positions 2 and 6 would be higher. The NH2 at position 4 is electron-donating, so the protons adjacent (3 and 5) would be upfield. The proton at position 4 is the NH2 itself, but that's not an aromatic proton. \n\nSo the aromatic protons would be:\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to the ester (position 1) so higher field (maybe around 7.5 ppm?)\n\nPosition 3: adjacent to the amino (position 4), so lower field (maybe around 6.8 ppm?)\n\nPosition 5: same as position 3, so similar to 6.8?\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to the ester (position 1), so like position 2.\n\nWait, but the given NMR has peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the ester is at position 4 along with the amino? Wait, that can't be because the ester is on the same carbon as the amino? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the ester is at position 4, making it 4-ethoxybenzoate? No, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the amino is on the benzene ring, and the ester is on the carboxylic acid group. So the carboxylic acid is at position 4 (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), so the COOEt group is attached at position 4. Wait, that would mean the amino group is also at position 4? That can't be. Oh, I see my confusion. The correct structure is: the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 4 (which is esterified with ethyl to make the ester group), and an amino group on another carbon, say position 2? Wait, no, the name is 4-aminobenzoate, meaning the amino is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? That's impossible. Wait, perhaps the name is 4-aminobenzoic acid, so the amino is on position 4 and the carboxylic acid is on another position. Wait, no, the carboxylic acid is part of the benzoate. Let me think again. The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate group is the carboxylate ester. So the carboxylic acid (before esterification) was on the benzene ring. The 4-aminobenzoate implies that the amino group is on the fourth carbon of the benzene ring, and the carboxylic acid group (now esterified) is on another position? Wait, no. The benzoate group must have the carboxylic acid on the benzene ring. So in 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is on the fourth carbon, and the carboxylic acid is on the same benzene ring but at a different position. Wait, but the numbering must be such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. Let me try to number the ring.\n\nSuppose the carboxylic acid is at position 1 (to make the numbering minimal), then the amino group would be at position 4. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OEt. So the structure would be: benzene with a COOEt at position 1 and an NH2 at position 4. \n\nIn this case, the aromatic protons would be:\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to the COOEt (position 1), so deshielded (higher ppm).\n\nPosition 3: next to the amino (position 4), so shielded (lower ppm).\n\nPosition 5: adjacent to the amino (position 4), so also shielded.\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to the COOEt (position 1), so higher ppm.\n\nThe NH2 is at position 4, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be around 7.5-8 ppm, and the protons at 3 and 5 around 6.5-7 ppm. The given NMR has peaks at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That matches if positions 2 and 6 are at 8.0 (doublet) and 3 and 5 at 7.0 (another doublet). The doublets would be due to coupling with adjacent protons. \n\nSo the NMR data for option D seems to fit. Let me check the other options again quickly.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have an ethoxy at position 3 and a benzamide (CONH2) at position 4 (or another position). The benzamide's NH2 would be two protons, but in the NMR, the NH2 would be a singlet around 8 ppm? Wait, but the given NH is at 4.0 ppm. Also, the ester's carbonyl would be present in benzamide? Wait, benzamide has a ketone (CONH2), so the carbonyl is around 1670 cm\u207b\u00b9, but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which is more like an ester. So that might not fit. \n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has a carbonyl (around 1650-1700?), but the IR shows 1720, which would be an ester. So that's inconsistent. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me check the molecular formula again. If it's propionate ester, the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the propionate adds 3 carbons plus the COO (so total 5 carbons from the ester group). The benzene is 6, so total 11 carbons. The given formula is C9, so that's 2 too many. So that can't be right. So option C is out. \n\nThus, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound has an IR spectrum with N-H bands (3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 (indicative of an ester). The 1H NMR shows a methyl group (1.20 ppm, triplet), an ethyl group (4.5 ppm quartet), and two sets of aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm). The molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and degrees of unsaturation (5) suggest an aromatic ring with an ester group. \n\nOption D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, fits best: the ethyl ester provides the methyl and quartet signals, the amino group (NH2) accounts for the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, and the aromatic peaks align with the substituent positions. Other options either have inconsistent IR peaks (e.g., amide vs. ester carbonyl) or incorrect molecular formulas (e.g., option C). \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The compound is C9H11NO2. I need to figure out which option matches the given IR and NMR data. Let me start by analyzing each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, the IR spectrum has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. These are likely from N-H stretching vibrations. Since there are two peaks here, maybe an amide (which has two N-H vibrations) or something like an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a carboxylic acid derivative, like an ester or amide. Wait, carboxylic acid derivatives usually have C=O stretches around 1700-1750 cm\u207b\u00b9.

Wait, esters are around 1730-1750. Hmm. The 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is close to that. Wait, maybe the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. But the N-H bands could be from an amine or amide. \n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break down the peaks. The integrals are given as 3H, 2H (but broad?), 2H, 2H, 2H. Wait, the total protons should add up to 11. Let's check: 3+2+2+2+2=11? Wait, 3+2 is 5, plus next 2 (7), then 2 (9), then 2 (11). Yes. So that matches the formula's 11 H.\n\nStarting with the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H). That's probably a methyl group attached to a carbon with two neighboring hydrogens, so like a CH3CH2-O-... structure, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's a methyl adjacent to a methylene.\n\nThen at 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad peaks often indicate exchangeable protons, like -OH or -NH. But the IR shows N-H, so maybe this is an amine group? Amines can show as broad singlets. Alternatively, maybe the -NH2, but that would be two protons? Wait, the integration here is 2H, so maybe it's an amino group (-NH2) but that's two protons. But then why is it a singlet? Alternatively, maybe an amide's NH? Wait, amide N-H's in NMR can be broad but vary. Wait, the IR has two peaks at around 3420 and 3325, which could be two N-H groups. Like an amine (primary amine has two N-H, so two peaks in IR). So maybe the 4.0 ppm is an amino group (-NH2), but as a singlet? Hmm, maybe in a symmetric position?\n\nNext peak at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with three protons. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, and 4.5 is a quartet. Let's think: the 1.20 ppm is the methyl of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 would be the CH2 next to the oxygen in an ethoxy group (like CH2CH3-O-). Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen (like in an ester) would have a triplet (since the CH3 is three protons), but here it's a quartet. Wait, maybe the structure is an ester where the ethyl is attached via an oxygen, so the ethoxy group. Let me think. For example, in ethyl acetate, the ethoxy CH2 is a triplet (from the CH3), but here the CH2 is a quartet. Hmm, that suggests maybe the CH2 is next to another group that's causing more splitting? Or perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is part of an ester group, so the structure is something like O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm might be the methylene adjacent to the oxygen in an ethyl ester group. Wait, in ethyl ester (like CH2CH3-O-CO-), the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3 (3H), so triplet. So that would be a triplet. But here it's a quartet. Hmm. Maybe the adjacent group has more hydrogens? Or maybe it's part of a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl is in a different position. Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a methylene adjacent to another methylene? Wait, maybe the structure is an amide with an ethyl group. Let's hold that thought.\n\nThe next peaks are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. The doublet patterns suggest coupling with one proton each, typical of ortho or para positions. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are typical for aromatic rings. The 8.0 is a bit higher, maybe meta to something electron-withdrawing? Or maybe the substituents are in the para positions. Let me consider the aromatic regions. \n\nPutting it all together. The compound has an ethyl group (from the 1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet), which suggests an ethyl ester or ethoxy group. The NMR peaks at 7 and 8 ppm for aromatic protons suggest a benzene ring with substituents. The presence of N-H groups in the IR suggests an amine or amide. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be. Wait, formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 + N - H + X)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 +1 -11)/2 = (18+2+1-11)=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That would be one benzene ring (4) plus one carbonyl (1), totaling 5. So that fits with an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (like ester or amide). \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be: benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and an amide group (CONH2) at position 4? Wait, benzamide is when the amide is directly attached to the benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the amide (CONH2) at one position and ethoxy at another. Let's see the NMR. The amide's N-H would be around 8-9 ppm, but in the NMR given, the aromatic peaks are at 7 and 8. Wait, the amide's N-H might be in the IR, but in the 1H NMR, maybe it's a singlet. Wait, the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). That could be the amide's NH2? Wait, benzamide would have CONH2, so two N-H protons. But in an amide, the NH2 would be part of the amide, but actually, benzamide is RCONH2, so the amide has an NH2. Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is benzene-C(=O)-NH2. So the amide has two N-H protons. So their chemical shift would be around 8-9 ppm? Wait, but in the given data, the N-H is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is lower. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the amide's N-H is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the amide is in a different position. Let me think.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (HCONH-). Wait, structure would be H2N-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be HCONH-Ph-O-CH2CH3? Wait, the formamide group is HCONH- attached to a phenyl group which has an ethoxy group at para. The formamide would have a carbonyl (so 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 matches the ester? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1700, but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which is more like an ester. Maybe that's not the right option.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propionic acid's ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate group would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, so the ester. The structure would have an ethyl group in the propionate? Wait, maybe the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that would add more carbons. Let's see the molecular formula. The options are C9H11NO2. Let me count for option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The benzene ring (C6) plus the propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) would be C6 + (COOCH2CH2CH3) which is 3 carbons from the propyl, so total C6+3+2 (the COO?) Wait, wait, the propionate group is -COOCH2CH2CH3, so that's 3 carbons from the propyl. The benzene ring is 6, so total 6+5 (COOCH2CH2CH3 has 5 carbons?) Wait, no: the propionate ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the propionate is three carbons (the propyl group). The benzene is 6, so total 6 + (COO- is two C's) plus the propyl's 3 gives 6+2+3=11 C? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9. Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate: the benzene ring (6 C) plus the propionate group (COOCH2CH2CH3) which has 3 (propyl) + 2 (COO) = 5 C. Total 6+5=11? But the compound is supposed to be C9. So that might not add up. Maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is an ester where the propionic acid is esterified with another group. Hmm, perhaps this option is not correct.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure is: benzene ring with a COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 4 and an NH2 at position 4? Wait, no, wait. The name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate part is the carboxylate esterified. So the structure is: O-CO-O-CH2CH3 attached to the benzene at position 4, and an NH2 group also at position 4? No, the aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the same carbon as the COO group? Wait, no. The correct structure would be the benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and a COOEt group at another position? Wait, no. Wait, \"4-aminobenzoate\" means the amino is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? No, that's not possible. Wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So 4-aminobenzoic acid would have a COOH at position 4 and an NH2 at another position? Wait, no. The name would be 4-aminobenzoic acid, which has the amino group on the same carbon as the COOH? That's not possible. Wait, actually, the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the benzene ring, with the carboxylic acid group (which is then esterified with ethyl). So the structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt group at another position (maybe position 1?), but the numbering would have the substituents as close as possible. So the structure would be: benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and an ethyl ester (COOEt) at position 2 or 3? Wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are as low as possible. So the ethyl ester would be at position 1, and the amino at 4. So the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to position 1 and NH2 at position 4. \n\nLet me think of the NMR for option D. The ethyl group would have the CH3 at ~1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 at ~4 ppm (quartet? Wait, in an ethyl ester group, the ethyl is attached via the oxygen. So the structure is: COO-CH2-CH3. The CH2 next to the oxygen would have the protons in the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen. The chemical shift for that CH2 in ethyl esters is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet. Because the CH2 is adjacent to the oxygen and the CH3 is three protons. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm matches that. The CH3 would be a triplet at 1.2 ppm, which matches the given data. The NH2 group would be an amino group, which in the NMR is a broad singlet. The IR has two N-H peaks (the amino group has two N-H bonds), which matches. The carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is the ester's carbonyl (which is around 1720-1740, so that fits). \n\nThe aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's see: in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and an ester group (O-CO-OEt) at position 1 (assuming numbering where the substituents are numbered as low as possible). The amino group is electron-donating, which would deshield the aromatic protons adjacent to it. The ester group is electron-withdrawing. Let's see the positions. The ester is at position 1, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) might be shifted upfield or downfield. The amino at position 4 would affect positions 3 and 5. \n\nWait, let's think of the specific peaks. The given NMR has two sets of aromatic protons: a doublet at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). The 8.0 ppm is higher, so maybe those are the meta positions relative to the amino group. Let's see:\n\nIf the amino is at position 4 and the ester at position 1, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the ester (position 1), so maybe they are downfield-shifted. The amino at 4 would affect positions 3 and 5. The amino is electron-donating, so those protons (3 and 5) would be upfield. But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is lower (upfield) and 8.0 is higher. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, the ester is at position 4? Wait no, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the carboxylate is at the 4 position. Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Let me clarify the structure again. The benzoate part: the carboxylic acid is at position 4, and the ester is formed by replacing the -OH with -OEt. So the structure is: the benzene ring with a COOEt group at position 4 and an NH2 group also at position 4? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, the name is 4-aminobenzoic acid, which has the amino group on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? No, that's impossible. Wait, the correct structure is that the amino group is on a different carbon. Wait, maybe the 4-aminobenzoate has the amino group on the fourth carbon, and the carboxylic acid (now esterified) is on the same ring. So the carboxylic acid is on the same ring, but at a different position. Wait, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate is the carboxylate group. So the structure is: benzene ring with a COOEt group (from the ester) and an NH2 group on the fourth carbon. So the two groups are on different carbons. Let's say the COOEt is at position 1 (to minimize numbering), and the NH2 is at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be arranged as follows:\n\nPositions 1: attached to COOEt (electron-withdrawing, so adjacent protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded (higher field? Wait, electron-withdrawing groups like esters typically cause adjacent protons to be downfield. So positions 2 and 6 would be higher. The NH2 at position 4 is electron-donating, so the protons adjacent (3 and 5) would be upfield. The proton at position 4 is the NH2 itself, but that's not an aromatic proton. \n\nSo the aromatic protons would be:\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to the ester (position 1) so higher field (maybe around 7.5 ppm?)\n\nPosition 3: adjacent to the amino (position 4), so lower field (maybe around 6.8 ppm?)\n\nPosition 5: same as position 3, so similar to 6.8?\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to the ester (position 1), so like position 2.\n\nWait, but the given NMR has peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the ester is at position 4 along with the amino? Wait, that can't be because the ester is on the same carbon as the amino? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the ester is at position 4, making it 4-ethoxybenzoate? No, the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, so the amino is on the benzene ring, and the ester is on the carboxylic acid group. So the carboxylic acid is at position 4 (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), so the COOEt group is attached at position 4. Wait, that would mean the amino group is also at position 4? That can't be. Oh, I see my confusion. The correct structure is: the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 4 (which is esterified with ethyl to make the ester group), and an amino group on another carbon, say position 2? Wait, no, the name is 4-aminobenzoate, meaning the amino is on the same carbon as the carboxylic acid? That's impossible. Wait, perhaps the name is 4-aminobenzoic acid, so the amino is on position 4 and the carboxylic acid is on another position. Wait, no, the carboxylic acid is part of the benzoate. Let me think again. The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate group is the carboxylate ester. So the carboxylic acid (before esterification) was on the benzene ring. The 4-aminobenzoate implies that the amino group is on the fourth carbon of the benzene ring, and the carboxylic acid group (now esterified) is on another position? Wait, no. The benzoate group must have the carboxylic acid on the benzene ring. So in 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is on the fourth carbon, and the carboxylic acid is on the same benzene ring but at a different position. Wait, but the numbering must be such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. Let me try to number the ring.\n\nSuppose the carboxylic acid is at position 1 (to make the numbering minimal), then the amino group would be at position 4. The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OEt. So the structure would be: benzene with a COOEt at position 1 and an NH2 at position 4. \n\nIn this case, the aromatic protons would be:\n\nPosition 2: adjacent to the COOEt (position 1), so deshielded (higher ppm).\n\nPosition 3: next to the amino (position 4), so shielded (lower ppm).\n\nPosition 5: adjacent to the amino (position 4), so also shielded.\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to the COOEt (position 1), so higher ppm.\n\nThe NH2 is at position 4, so the protons at 2 and 6 would be around 7.5-8 ppm, and the protons at 3 and 5 around 6.5-7 ppm. The given NMR has peaks at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That matches if positions 2 and 6 are at 8.0 (doublet) and 3 and 5 at 7.0 (another doublet). The doublets would be due to coupling with adjacent protons. \n\nSo the NMR data for option D seems to fit. Let me check the other options again quickly.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have an ethoxy at position 3 and a benzamide (CONH2) at position 4 (or another position). The benzamide's NH2 would be two protons, but in the NMR, the NH2 would be a singlet around 8 ppm? Wait, but the given NH is at 4.0 ppm. Also, the ester's carbonyl would be present in benzamide? Wait, benzamide has a ketone (CONH2), so the carbonyl is around 1670 cm\u207b\u00b9, but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which is more like an ester. So that might not fit. \n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has a carbonyl (around 1650-1700?), but the IR shows 1720, which would be an ester. So that's inconsistent. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me check the molecular formula again. If it's propionate ester, the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the propionate adds 3 carbons plus the COO (so total 5 carbons from the ester group). The benzene is 6, so total 11 carbons. The given formula is C9, so that's 2 too many. So that can't be right. So option C is out. \n\nThus, the correct answer is D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n\nThe compound has an IR spectrum with N-H bands (3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 (indicative of an ester). The 1H NMR shows a methyl group (1.20 ppm, triplet), an ethyl group (4.5 ppm quartet), and two sets of aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm). The molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and degrees of unsaturation (5) suggest an aromatic ring with an ester group. \n\nOption D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, fits best: the ethyl ester provides the methyl and quartet signals, the amino group (NH2) accounts for the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, and the aromatic peaks align with the substituent positions. Other options either have inconsistent IR peaks (e.g., amide vs. ester carbonyl) or incorrect molecular formulas (e.g., option C). \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data. Let me see. The compound is C9H11NO2. The options are A to D. Let me start by breaking down the data given.\n\nFirst, the IR spectrum. There's a medium to strong band at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those are probably N-H stretches. Formamide might have a strong N-H, but maybe an amide? Wait, amides usually have a broad N-H stretch if they're primary. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. That's a carbonyl, right? Like a ketone or ester. Since the compound has an amide or amine, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl at around 1740, but maybe this is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. Wait, amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1680, so that 1720 is more likely an ester or maybe a ketone. So the compound has both an ester and an amide? Or maybe just one?\n\nLooking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 18+2=20, minus 11 gives 9, plus 1 (since N adds 1) so 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5 degrees of unsaturation. So 5 degrees. Each ring is one, each double bond one, triple bonds count as one. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) plus another double bond or ring? Or maybe another amide group or something.\n\nNow the 1H NMR data. Let's look at each signal. Starting from the downfield regions first. The highest is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Then 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are probably aromatic protons. The 8.0 and 7.0 could be ortho, meta, para. The two doublets each with 2H might suggest a disubstituted benzene? Or maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in positions that split the signals. Like maybe an ortho or para substitution. Let me think. For example, if there's an amide group and an ester group on the benzene ring, maybe in the para positions?\n\nThen the other signals. At 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. A quartet usually comes from a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 (like ethyl group). Wait, the quartet would be from a CH2 next to a CH3 with 3H, so splitting into quartet (3+1=4 peaks). Then the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad could indicate exchangeable protons, like an -NH2 group or an -OH. But since the IR has peaks at ~3400, which are N-H, so that's likely an amine. The 1.20 ppm is a triplet (t, 3H), which is probably an ethyl group's methyl (since triplet from CH2CH3, so the CH3 is triplet from the adjacent CH2's two protons? Wait, actually, the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 triplet. Wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (2H), so that's the CH2 of an ethoxy group (like OCH2CH3). The 1.20 is the CH3 of that ethoxy. So that would fit an ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. \n\nSo putting that together: the compound has an ethoxy group (since the NMR shows the ethyl signals). The carbonyl at 1720 in IR is an ester (since esters have around 1740 but maybe a bit lower here?), so that would mean there's an ester group. The amide N-H is from the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325. Wait, but amide carbonyl would be around 1650-1680. The IR here has 1720, which is an ester carbonyl. So the compound must have both an ester and an amide? Wait, that might complicate the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: an ester (RCOOR') would have one O, and an amide (RCONR''2) would add another O? Wait, no. Wait, the formula has two O's. So maybe it's an ester (which has two oxygens?) Wait, no. Let me think again. An ester is RCOOR', so that's one O in the carbonyl and one in the ether, so two O atoms. An amide is RCONR2, so only one O. Wait, but the formula here has two O's. So if it's an ester, that would account for the two O's. Wait, but then where's the amide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an amide. Wait, the IR shows N-H stretches (the 3420 and 3325 cm-1). An amide would have N-H if it's primary or secondary. The carbonyl of the amide would be around 1650-1680. But the IR has a strong band at 1720, which is an ester carbonyl. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group? Like an ester and an amine, but then the amine's N-H would give the peaks at ~3400. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would be a benzene with a CONH2 group. But 3-ethoxybenzamide would have an ethoxy group and an amide. Let's see the structure: OCH2CH3 on C3, and CONH2 on another position. Wait, but the molecular formula here would be C8H9NO2 (since benzamide is C7H7NO2, adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches. Let me check the NMR for that. \n\nThe structure would be: benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and amide at another position (maybe para? Let me think. Wait, the NMR shows two aromatic signals: 8.0 and 7.0. Each as doublets. Let's see. For 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at position 3, so the amide would be at another position. Suppose the amide is at position 4 (so meta to ethoxy). Then the aromatic protons would be split. Alternatively, maybe the amide is ortho or para. Wait, but the aromatic signals are two doublets. Let's think about the coupling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethoxy is in the para position to the amide? Let me think. For example, if the amide is at position 4 and the ethoxy at position 3, but that might not give symmetric signals. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is at position 4 and the amide at position 3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and amide are in the para positions? Wait, but the ethoxy is part of the benzene ring's substituents. Let me try to draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOEt group (the ester) and a -NH2 group on the para position. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's confirm: benzene (C6) plus COOEt (COOCH2CH3 is 5 carbons, so total 6+5=11? Wait, benzene is 6, plus COOEt (which is 3 more: COO is two oxygens and the ethyl is C2H5. Wait, the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C7 (benzene ring) + COOCH2CH3 (4 carbons? Wait, no: the benzoate is C7H5O2, then adding ethyl (C2H5) would make C7 + 2 = C9. The aminobenzoate would have NH2, so the formula would be C9H11NO2 (since the amine adds two H and the ester's O's). Let me check:\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2) becomes the ester with ethyl: C7H5O2 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3? Wait, maybe better to count all. The structure is: \n\nThe formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has -COOEt and -NH2. The formula is C6H5(COOCH2CH3)NH2? Wait, no, the aminobenzoate would be:\n\nThe benzoate ester is R-COO- where R is ethyl, and the benzene ring has an NH2 group. So the formula: the benzene (6C) plus COOCH2CH3 (which is 3C from COO and 2 from ethyl? Wait, COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (COO is two oxygens, but the ethyl is two carbons, so the COOCH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the ester part. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (from ester) = 9, which matches. The nitrogens: the amine (NH2) gives one N. The oxygens: two from the ester (COO) plus the two oxygens? Wait, COO is two O. So total O: 2 (from ester) + the others? Wait, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see:\n\nThe molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: \n\nThe benzoate part is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but when esterified, it's C7H5O2 (losing one H). The ethyl group adds 2 more carbons (so total 9C?), but wait, the ester group is -O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me do the count properly. The ester group: the benzoate is from benzoic acid (C7H6O2). When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester becomes C7H5O2 (from benzoate) plus C2H5 (since the -OH is replaced by O-C2H5). So the total carbons: 7 (from benzene and COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9. The hydrogens: benzoic acid has 6 H, but when forming the ester with ethanol (which has 5 H in the ethyl group?), so total H: (benzoic acid minus 1 H for the -OH) plus ethanol's ethyl group (which is 5 H). So 5 (from benzoate) +5 (ethyl) gives 10? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see, the options D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The aminobenzoate would have an NH2 group, so that adds an N and two H. The ester part has the O's. So the formula would be correct.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR data for D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with -NH2 on the 4-position and a -COOEt group on another position? Wait, no, the 4-aminobenzoate means the amine is on the same carbon as the carboxyl group? Wait, no. Wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So 4-aminobenzoate would have the amine on the 4-position, and the carboxyl group (which is esterified) on the same ring. So the structure is: benzene ring with -COOEt (the ester) at one position, and -NH2 at the 4 position. Wait, but the positions have to be numbered such that the substituents are in the correct places. Let me see: if the amine is on the 4-position, then the ester would be on the carboxylic acid's original position (position 1?), so maybe the ester is on the para position? Wait, perhaps the 4-aminobenzoate is the benzene ring with -NH2 at position 4 and the COOEt at position 1 (so the ester is at the carboxylic acid's original position, making it para to the amine? Then the aromatic protons would be split into different positions. \n\nLooking at the NMR data: The aromatic signals are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.0 (d, 2H). That suggests that the aromatic protons are in two sets of doublets, each with two hydrogens. That would happen if the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if the benzene ring has two substituents (the ester and the amine) in the para positions, then the remaining protons would be ortho to each other but split into two doublets. Wait, maybe the substituents are para, so the aromatic protons are in two different positions. Let me think: if the substituents are on positions 1 and 4 (assuming the ester is at 1 and the amine at 4), then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, maybe in such a case, the splitting would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to ortho and meta positions. Alternatively, maybe the two substituents are in positions such that the remaining protons form two doublets. Let me think of the structure for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group is on the carboxylic acid's original position (position 1), and the amine is on position 4. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. The other positions are 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the ester (position 1) and amine (position 4?), so their chemical shifts would vary. Wait, perhaps the protons next to the substituents are deshielded. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.0 are from two different sets of protons. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would be a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at position 3 and an amide group (CONH2) at another position. Let's say the amide is at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,5,6, and the others. The ethoxy is at 3, amide at 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to ethoxy and meta to amide, maybe giving a certain pattern. But the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each. Wait, maybe the benzamide has the amide group in the para position to the ethoxy. So ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1? Then the remaining protons would be at 2,4,5,6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the NMR shows two doublets, each with two H. So maybe the aromatic ring has two sets of protons that are each in a doublet. For example, if the substituents are in positions that cause the remaining protons to be split into two doublets. Let's think of the structure for option D again. If the ester is at position 1 and the amine at position 4, the remaining protons are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the amine (position4) and meta to the ester (position1). Those might be in a similar environment. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the ester and amine. Wait, maybe they form two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are such that they split into doublets. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the 1H NMR data: the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. That's the ethoxy's CH2. The ethoxy is OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet (from the three protons of the methyl group), so that's consistent. The 1.20 is the methyl triplet from the ethoxy (since it's CH2CH3, the methyl would couple with the adjacent CH2's two protons, giving a triplet). The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, which would be the NH2 group (since amines can be broad in NMR due to exchange). \n\nSo if the compound is D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, that would have the NH2 (giving the broad singlet), the ester (carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), and the ethoxy group's signals. The aromatic region would have the two doublets. Let me see the aromatic signals again. \n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ester) and 4 (the amine). The remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the amine (position4) and opposite the ester (position1). Their chemical shifts would be around 7-8 ppm. The protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the ester (position1) and the amine (position4), so maybe they are in a different environment. Wait, perhaps the protons at positions 2 and 6 are in one environment, and 3 and 5 in another, leading to two doublets. The doublet at 8.0 and 7.0 would correspond to those. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions (positions 1 and 4), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to the amine (position4) and meta to the ester (position1). Their chemical shifts might be higher (like around 8 ppm), and positions 3 and 5 are ortho to the ester and meta to the amine, so maybe lower (around 7 ppm). That would give two doublets: one at ~8 ppm (2H) and another at ~7 ppm (2H). That matches the NMR data given. \n\nThe other signals: the ethyl group's CH2 (quartet at 4.5 ppm) and the CH3 (triplet at 1.2 ppm). The NH2 is the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. \n\nNow looking at the options again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide would have a structure where the carbonyl is connected to NH and a hydrogen (since formamide is HCONR2). Wait, formamide is HCONH2, but if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, then it would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is HCON(Ph-OEt). Let me see: the formamide is HCONR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the carbonyl is part of the formamide (which would have a carbonyl at ~1660 cm\u207b\u00b9?), but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which would be an ester carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case. Also, the molecular formula for option B would be: the phenyl group (C6) with ethoxy (C2) on para, plus formamide (HCONH-). The formamide would add two more carbons? Wait, formamide is HCONH2, so the total formula would be C6 (phenyl) + C2 (ethoxy) + HCONH2 (which is C1, so total C9?), but let me count. The phenyl is C6, ethoxy is C2, and formamide's HCONH2 adds 1 more C (the formyl group). So total C6 +2+1=9. The N is present in the amide. The O: ethoxy has one O, the formamide's carbonyl has one O, so total O2. So the formula matches. But the IR's carbonyl at 1720 would be the formamide's carbonyl? Formamide's carbonyl is around 1660 cm\u207b\u00b9, so that's inconsistent. So B's carbonyl wouldn't match the IR's 1720. So B is probably out.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with an amine on 4 and a propionyl group (CH2COO-) perhaps? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-Ph. Wait, the structure would be benzene with a -COOCH2CH2CH3 group (if it's propionate). Let me see the molecular formula. The benzene (6C) plus the propionate (C3 for the COOCH2CH3? Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons (COO is two, plus three from propyl?), so total carbons would be 6 +4 = 10, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's phenyl propionate where the propionate is attached to the benzene, but perhaps the aminophenyl part. Let me check the formula again. The formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be: the benzene (C6) with an NH2 (so one N), and a propionate group (COOCH2CH2CH3). That would be 6 + 4 (COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons: COO is two, plus the propyl (three? Wait, the propionate ester would be -OOCR where R is propyl (C3H7). So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) + 2 (from the COO?) Wait, COO is two oxygens but the carbons in the propionate group are the propyl (3C) plus the two from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is part of the ester, so the propionate group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be butanoate. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think: propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH3CH2COO-Ph. So the ester group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? No, the propionate ester is -OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), so the total for the ester group is 3 carbons (the propyl) plus the two from the COO? Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons in the ester group (excluding the benzene) would be 3 (propyl) + 2 (COO)? No, the COO is part of the ester's carbonyl and oxygen, so the propionate ester would add 3 carbons (the propyl group) plus the two from the COO? No, the COO is part of the ester's structure. The propionate group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe ester group from propionic acid would be R-OOCR, where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. When esterified with an alcohol, say benzene, it would form CH3CH2COO-Ph. So the propionate group is CH2CH2COO-Ph. The total carbons in that group are 3 (from CH2CH2CH3?), wait, no: the propionic acid's part is CH3CH2COO-, so that's three carbons (the propyl chain is three carbons?), so the ester group would contribute 3 carbons. Adding to the benzene (6), that's 9. The oxygen count: the ester has two oxygens (the COO), plus any others? The benzene ring has no other O, and the amine has no O. So total O is two. The N is from the amine. So the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches. \n\nBut the NMR of option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have an amine on the benzene and a propionate ester group. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate ester is -OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), so the ester would have an ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the propionate ester group would be -OOCCH2CH2CH3 (since propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH). The NMR for that would have the propyl group's signals. The propionate would have a CH2COO-Ph. Wait, the ester's carbonyl would be at around 1740 cm\u207b\u00b9 (so the IR's 1720 is close but maybe possible). The NMR would have the propionate's CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet (from the adjacent CH2?), but maybe different. Alternatively, the structure would have the ester's carbonyl, and the propyl chain. Let's see the NMR given has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would be a CH2 next to an ethyl group. But in the propionate ester, the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet (since it's between the carbonyl and the CH2CH3). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate group has a CH2CH2CH3, so the middle CH2 would be a quartet if it's between a CH3 and another CH2. Wait, the propionate ester would have the structure: O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. The CH2 between the carbonyl and the second CH2 would be a triplet (from the two protons of the adjacent CH2?), and the second CH2 would be a quartet from the three protons of the methyl. But the NMR here shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) which would suggest that's a CH2 with a neighboring CH3. But in the propionate ester, the CH2CH2CH3 would have the first CH2 (adjacent to carbonyl) as triplet, the middle CH2 as quartet (from the methyl's three protons), but that's three carbons, so three CH groups? Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the propionate would be CH2CH2CH3 attached via the carbonyl. So the structure is: \n\nPh-OOC-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is between the O and the first CH2. The first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would be a triplet (from the next CH2's two H), the second CH2 would be a quartet (from the three H of the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet from the previous CH2's two H. \n\nBut in the given NMR data, there is a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) which would be the second CH2 (the one next to CH3). Its chemical shift would be around 1.7 or so, but the given data has it at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. That suggests maybe it's not a propionate group. Alternatively, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is from an ethoxy group (like in D), which would make sense because the ethoxy's CH2 is near oxygen, so higher chemical shift. \n\nIn option C's case, the propionate's CH2CH2CH3 would have lower chemical shifts (like 1-2 ppm), but the given data has the quartet at 4.5, which is more like an ethoxy's CH2. So perhaps option C is not the right one. \n\nBack to option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group is -COOCH2CH3. The ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The CH2 would have a chemical shift around 4.1-4.2 ppm typically, which matches the 4.5 given here (maybe slightly different). The CH3 would be around 1.2 ppm as a triplet, which matches. The amine's NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic signals at 8.0 and 7.0 ppm as doublets. \n\nAnother point: the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which would be the ester's carbonyl (around 1740 is typical, but maybe a bit lower here). The amide N-H is at 3420 and 3325, which are broad and strong, which matches the amine group (but wait, amine's N-H is around 3300-3500, so that's okay). \n\nSo putting it all together, the structure that fits all the data is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. \n\nWait, but let me check option A again: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The structure would be Ph-CO-NH2 with an ethoxy at position 3. The carbonyl would be around 1660-1680 (amide), but the IR shows a strong band at 1720, which would have to be an ester. Since benzamide doesn't have an ester, that's inconsistent. So option A is out because the IR's 1720 can't be an amide carbonyl. \n\nThus, the correct answer must be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 has an IR spectrum with N-H stretches (3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong ester carbonyl band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. The 1H NMR shows an ethoxy group (quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.2 ppm), a broad singlet for an amine (4.0 ppm), and two aromatic doublets (8.0 and 7.0 ppm). These features align with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D)**, which contains an ester (carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), an amine (broad N-H signals), and an ethoxy group. The aromatic signals arise from protons para to the substituents, consistent with the given doublets. Other options are inconsistent with the IR or NMR data (e.g., amide carbonyl mismatch for A, formamide's carbonyl for B, or propionate's chemical shifts for C). \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question here about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data. Let me see. The compound is C9H11NO2. The options are A to D. Let me start by breaking down the data given.\n\nFirst, the IR spectrum. There's a medium to strong band at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those are probably N-H stretches. Formamide might have a strong N-H, but maybe an amide? Wait, amides usually have a broad N-H stretch if they're primary. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. That's a carbonyl, right? Like a ketone or ester. Since the compound has an amide or amine, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl at around 1740, but maybe this is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe the 1720 is an ester carbonyl. Wait, amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1680, so that 1720 is more likely an ester or maybe a ketone. So the compound has both an ester and an amide? Or maybe just one?\n\nLooking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 18+2=20, minus 11 gives 9, plus 1 (since N adds 1) so 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5 degrees of unsaturation. So 5 degrees. Each ring is one, each double bond one, triple bonds count as one. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) plus another double bond or ring? Or maybe another amide group or something.\n\nNow the 1H NMR data. Let's look at each signal. Starting from the downfield regions first. The highest is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Then 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are probably aromatic protons. The 8.0 and 7.0 could be ortho, meta, para. The two doublets each with 2H might suggest a disubstituted benzene? Or maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in positions that split the signals. Like maybe an ortho or para substitution. Let me think. For example, if there's an amide group and an ester group on the benzene ring, maybe in the para positions?\n\nThen the other signals. At 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. A quartet usually comes from a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 (like ethyl group). Wait, the quartet would be from a CH2 next to a CH3 with 3H, so splitting into quartet (3+1=4 peaks). Then the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad could indicate exchangeable protons, like an -NH2 group or an -OH. But since the IR has peaks at ~3400, which are N-H, so that's likely an amine. The 1.20 ppm is a triplet (t, 3H), which is probably an ethyl group's methyl (since triplet from CH2CH3, so the CH3 is triplet from the adjacent CH2's two protons? Wait, actually, the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 triplet. Wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (2H), so that's the CH2 of an ethoxy group (like OCH2CH3). The 1.20 is the CH3 of that ethoxy. So that would fit an ethoxy group: OCH2CH3. \n\nSo putting that together: the compound has an ethoxy group (since the NMR shows the ethyl signals). The carbonyl at 1720 in IR is an ester (since esters have around 1740 but maybe a bit lower here?), so that would mean there's an ester group. The amide N-H is from the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325. Wait, but amide carbonyl would be around 1650-1680. The IR here has 1720, which is an ester carbonyl. So the compound must have both an ester and an amide? Wait, that might complicate the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: an ester (RCOOR') would have one O, and an amide (RCONR''2) would add another O? Wait, no. Wait, the formula has two O's. So maybe it's an ester (which has two oxygens?) Wait, no. Let me think again. An ester is RCOOR', so that's one O in the carbonyl and one in the ether, so two O atoms. An amide is RCONR2, so only one O. Wait, but the formula here has two O's. So if it's an ester, that would account for the two O's. Wait, but then where's the amide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an amide. Wait, the IR shows N-H stretches (the 3420 and 3325 cm-1). An amide would have N-H if it's primary or secondary. The carbonyl of the amide would be around 1650-1680. But the IR has a strong band at 1720, which is an ester carbonyl. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group? Like an ester and an amine, but then the amine's N-H would give the peaks at ~3400. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would be a benzene with a CONH2 group. But 3-ethoxybenzamide would have an ethoxy group and an amide. Let's see the structure: OCH2CH3 on C3, and CONH2 on another position. Wait, but the molecular formula here would be C8H9NO2 (since benzamide is C7H7NO2, adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H11NO2. Yes, that matches. Let me check the NMR for that. \n\nThe structure would be: benzene ring with ethoxy at position 3 and amide at another position (maybe para? Let me think. Wait, the NMR shows two aromatic signals: 8.0 and 7.0. Each as doublets. Let's see. For 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at position 3, so the amide would be at another position. Suppose the amide is at position 4 (so meta to ethoxy). Then the aromatic protons would be split. Alternatively, maybe the amide is ortho or para. Wait, but the aromatic signals are two doublets. Let's think about the coupling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ethoxy is in the para position to the amide? Let me think. For example, if the amide is at position 4 and the ethoxy at position 3, but that might not give symmetric signals. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is at position 4 and the amide at position 3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy and amide are in the para positions? Wait, but the ethoxy is part of the benzene ring's substituents. Let me try to draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOEt group (the ester) and a -NH2 group on the para position. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's confirm: benzene (C6) plus COOEt (COOCH2CH3 is 5 carbons, so total 6+5=11? Wait, benzene is 6, plus COOEt (which is 3 more: COO is two oxygens and the ethyl is C2H5. Wait, the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C7 (benzene ring) + COOCH2CH3 (4 carbons? Wait, no: the benzoate is C7H5O2, then adding ethyl (C2H5) would make C7 + 2 = C9. The aminobenzoate would have NH2, so the formula would be C9H11NO2 (since the amine adds two H and the ester's O's). Let me check:\n\nBenzoic acid (C7H6O2) becomes the ester with ethyl: C7H5O2 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3? Wait, maybe better to count all. The structure is: \n\nThe formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has -COOEt and -NH2. The formula is C6H5(COOCH2CH3)NH2? Wait, no, the aminobenzoate would be:\n\nThe benzoate ester is R-COO- where R is ethyl, and the benzene ring has an NH2 group. So the formula: the benzene (6C) plus COOCH2CH3 (which is 3C from COO and 2 from ethyl? Wait, COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (COO is two oxygens, but the ethyl is two carbons, so the COOCH2CH3 is 3 carbons in the ester part. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (from ester) = 9, which matches. The nitrogens: the amine (NH2) gives one N. The oxygens: two from the ester (COO) plus the two oxygens? Wait, COO is two O. So total O: 2 (from ester) + the others? Wait, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see:\n\nThe molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: \n\nThe benzoate part is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but when esterified, it's C7H5O2 (losing one H). The ethyl group adds 2 more carbons (so total 9C?), but wait, the ester group is -O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me do the count properly. The ester group: the benzoate is from benzoic acid (C7H6O2). When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester becomes C7H5O2 (from benzoate) plus C2H5 (since the -OH is replaced by O-C2H5). So the total carbons: 7 (from benzene and COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9. The hydrogens: benzoic acid has 6 H, but when forming the ester with ethanol (which has 5 H in the ethyl group?), so total H: (benzoic acid minus 1 H for the -OH) plus ethanol's ethyl group (which is 5 H). So 5 (from benzoate) +5 (ethyl) gives 10? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see, the options D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The aminobenzoate would have an NH2 group, so that adds an N and two H. The ester part has the O's. So the formula would be correct.\n\nNow, looking at the NMR data for D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be a benzene ring with -NH2 on the 4-position and a -COOEt group on another position? Wait, no, the 4-aminobenzoate means the amine is on the same carbon as the carboxyl group? Wait, no. Wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So 4-aminobenzoate would have the amine on the 4-position, and the carboxyl group (which is esterified) on the same ring. So the structure is: benzene ring with -COOEt (the ester) at one position, and -NH2 at the 4 position. Wait, but the positions have to be numbered such that the substituents are in the correct places. Let me see: if the amine is on the 4-position, then the ester would be on the carboxylic acid's original position (position 1?), so maybe the ester is on the para position? Wait, perhaps the 4-aminobenzoate is the benzene ring with -NH2 at position 4 and the COOEt at position 1 (so the ester is at the carboxylic acid's original position, making it para to the amine? Then the aromatic protons would be split into different positions. \n\nLooking at the NMR data: The aromatic signals are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.0 (d, 2H). That suggests that the aromatic protons are in two sets of doublets, each with two hydrogens. That would happen if the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if the benzene ring has two substituents (the ester and the amine) in the para positions, then the remaining protons would be ortho to each other but split into two doublets. Wait, maybe the substituents are para, so the aromatic protons are in two different positions. Let me think: if the substituents are on positions 1 and 4 (assuming the ester is at 1 and the amine at 4), then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, maybe in such a case, the splitting would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to ortho and meta positions. Alternatively, maybe the two substituents are in positions such that the remaining protons form two doublets. Let me think of the structure for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group is on the carboxylic acid's original position (position 1), and the amine is on position 4. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. The other positions are 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the ester (position 1) and amine (position 4?), so their chemical shifts would vary. Wait, perhaps the protons next to the substituents are deshielded. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.0 are from two different sets of protons. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would be a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at position 3 and an amide group (CONH2) at another position. Let's say the amide is at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,5,6, and the others. The ethoxy is at 3, amide at 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to ethoxy and meta to amide, maybe giving a certain pattern. But the NMR shows two doublets of 2H each. Wait, maybe the benzamide has the amide group in the para position to the ethoxy. So ethoxy at 3 and amide at 1? Then the remaining protons would be at 2,4,5,6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the NMR shows two doublets, each with two H. So maybe the aromatic ring has two sets of protons that are each in a doublet. For example, if the substituents are in positions that cause the remaining protons to be split into two doublets. Let's think of the structure for option D again. If the ester is at position 1 and the amine at position 4, the remaining protons are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the amine (position4) and meta to the ester (position1). Those might be in a similar environment. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the ester and amine. Wait, maybe they form two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are such that they split into doublets. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the 1H NMR data: the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) with 2H. That's the ethoxy's CH2. The ethoxy is OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet (from the three protons of the methyl group), so that's consistent. The 1.20 is the methyl triplet from the ethoxy (since it's CH2CH3, the methyl would couple with the adjacent CH2's two protons, giving a triplet). The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, which would be the NH2 group (since amines can be broad in NMR due to exchange). \n\nSo if the compound is D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, that would have the NH2 (giving the broad singlet), the ester (carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), and the ethoxy group's signals. The aromatic region would have the two doublets. Let me see the aromatic signals again. \n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ester) and 4 (the amine). The remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the amine (position4) and opposite the ester (position1). Their chemical shifts would be around 7-8 ppm. The protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the ester (position1) and the amine (position4), so maybe they are in a different environment. Wait, perhaps the protons at positions 2 and 6 are in one environment, and 3 and 5 in another, leading to two doublets. The doublet at 8.0 and 7.0 would correspond to those. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions (positions 1 and 4), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to the amine (position4) and meta to the ester (position1). Their chemical shifts might be higher (like around 8 ppm), and positions 3 and 5 are ortho to the ester and meta to the amine, so maybe lower (around 7 ppm). That would give two doublets: one at ~8 ppm (2H) and another at ~7 ppm (2H). That matches the NMR data given. \n\nThe other signals: the ethyl group's CH2 (quartet at 4.5 ppm) and the CH3 (triplet at 1.2 ppm). The NH2 is the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. \n\nNow looking at the options again. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide would have a structure where the carbonyl is connected to NH and a hydrogen (since formamide is HCONR2). Wait, formamide is HCONH2, but if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, then it would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is HCON(Ph-OEt). Let me see: the formamide is HCONR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the carbonyl is part of the formamide (which would have a carbonyl at ~1660 cm\u207b\u00b9?), but the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which would be an ester carbonyl. So maybe that's not the case. Also, the molecular formula for option B would be: the phenyl group (C6) with ethoxy (C2) on para, plus formamide (HCONH-). The formamide would add two more carbons? Wait, formamide is HCONH2, so the total formula would be C6 (phenyl) + C2 (ethoxy) + HCONH2 (which is C1, so total C9?), but let me count. The phenyl is C6, ethoxy is C2, and formamide's HCONH2 adds 1 more C (the formyl group). So total C6 +2+1=9. The N is present in the amide. The O: ethoxy has one O, the formamide's carbonyl has one O, so total O2. So the formula matches. But the IR's carbonyl at 1720 would be the formamide's carbonyl? Formamide's carbonyl is around 1660 cm\u207b\u00b9, so that's inconsistent. So B's carbonyl wouldn't match the IR's 1720. So B is probably out.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with an amine on 4 and a propionyl group (CH2COO-) perhaps? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-Ph. Wait, the structure would be benzene with a -COOCH2CH2CH3 group (if it's propionate). Let me see the molecular formula. The benzene (6C) plus the propionate (C3 for the COOCH2CH3? Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons (COO is two, plus three from propyl?), so total carbons would be 6 +4 = 10, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's phenyl propionate where the propionate is attached to the benzene, but perhaps the aminophenyl part. Let me check the formula again. The formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be: the benzene (C6) with an NH2 (so one N), and a propionate group (COOCH2CH2CH3). That would be 6 + 4 (COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons: COO is two, plus the propyl (three? Wait, the propionate ester would be -OOCR where R is propyl (C3H7). So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) + 2 (from the COO?) Wait, COO is two oxygens but the carbons in the propionate group are the propyl (3C) plus the two from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is part of the ester, so the propionate group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be butanoate. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think: propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH3CH2COO-Ph. So the ester group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? No, the propionate ester is -OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), so the total for the ester group is 3 carbons (the propyl) plus the two from the COO? Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons in the ester group (excluding the benzene) would be 3 (propyl) + 2 (COO)? No, the COO is part of the ester's carbonyl and oxygen, so the propionate ester would add 3 carbons (the propyl group) plus the two from the COO? No, the COO is part of the ester's structure. The propionate group is -OOCCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe ester group from propionic acid would be R-OOCR, where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. When esterified with an alcohol, say benzene, it would form CH3CH2COO-Ph. So the propionate group is CH2CH2COO-Ph. The total carbons in that group are 3 (from CH2CH2CH3?), wait, no: the propionic acid's part is CH3CH2COO-, so that's three carbons (the propyl chain is three carbons?), so the ester group would contribute 3 carbons. Adding to the benzene (6), that's 9. The oxygen count: the ester has two oxygens (the COO), plus any others? The benzene ring has no other O, and the amine has no O. So total O is two. The N is from the amine. So the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches. \n\nBut the NMR of option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would have an amine on the benzene and a propionate ester group. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate ester is -OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), so the ester would have an ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the propionate ester group would be -OOCCH2CH2CH3 (since propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH). The NMR for that would have the propyl group's signals. The propionate would have a CH2COO-Ph. Wait, the ester's carbonyl would be at around 1740 cm\u207b\u00b9 (so the IR's 1720 is close but maybe possible). The NMR would have the propionate's CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet (from the adjacent CH2?), but maybe different. Alternatively, the structure would have the ester's carbonyl, and the propyl chain. Let's see the NMR given has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which would be a CH2 next to an ethyl group. But in the propionate ester, the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet (since it's between the carbonyl and the CH2CH3). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate group has a CH2CH2CH3, so the middle CH2 would be a quartet if it's between a CH3 and another CH2. Wait, the propionate ester would have the structure: O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. The CH2 between the carbonyl and the second CH2 would be a triplet (from the two protons of the adjacent CH2?), and the second CH2 would be a quartet from the three protons of the methyl. But the NMR here shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) which would suggest that's a CH2 with a neighboring CH3. But in the propionate ester, the CH2CH2CH3 would have the first CH2 (adjacent to carbonyl) as triplet, the middle CH2 as quartet (from the methyl's three protons), but that's three carbons, so three CH groups? Wait, no, the propionate is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the propionate would be CH2CH2CH3 attached via the carbonyl. So the structure is: \n\nPh-OOC-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is between the O and the first CH2. The first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would be a triplet (from the next CH2's two H), the second CH2 would be a quartet (from the three H of the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet from the previous CH2's two H. \n\nBut in the given NMR data, there is a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) which would be the second CH2 (the one next to CH3). Its chemical shift would be around 1.7 or so, but the given data has it at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. That suggests maybe it's not a propionate group. Alternatively, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is from an ethoxy group (like in D), which would make sense because the ethoxy's CH2 is near oxygen, so higher chemical shift. \n\nIn option C's case, the propionate's CH2CH2CH3 would have lower chemical shifts (like 1-2 ppm), but the given data has the quartet at 4.5, which is more like an ethoxy's CH2. So perhaps option C is not the right one. \n\nBack to option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group is -COOCH2CH3. The ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The CH2 would have a chemical shift around 4.1-4.2 ppm typically, which matches the 4.5 given here (maybe slightly different). The CH3 would be around 1.2 ppm as a triplet, which matches. The amine's NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic signals at 8.0 and 7.0 ppm as doublets. \n\nAnother point: the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which would be the ester's carbonyl (around 1740 is typical, but maybe a bit lower here). The amide N-H is at 3420 and 3325, which are broad and strong, which matches the amine group (but wait, amine's N-H is around 3300-3500, so that's okay). \n\nSo putting it all together, the structure that fits all the data is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. \n\nWait, but let me check option A again: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The structure would be Ph-CO-NH2 with an ethoxy at position 3. The carbonyl would be around 1660-1680 (amide), but the IR shows a strong band at 1720, which would have to be an ester. Since benzamide doesn't have an ester, that's inconsistent. So option A is out because the IR's 1720 can't be an amide carbonyl. \n\nThus, the correct answer must be D.\n\n\nThe compound C9H11NO2 has an IR spectrum with N-H stretches (3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9) and a strong ester carbonyl band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. The 1H NMR shows an ethoxy group (quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.2 ppm), a broad singlet for an amine (4.0 ppm), and two aromatic doublets (8.0 and 7.0 ppm). These features align with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (D)**, which contains an ester (carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), an amine (broad N-H signals), and an ethoxy group. The aromatic signals arise from protons para to the substituents, consistent with the given doublets. Other options are inconsistent with the IR or NMR data (e.g., amide carbonyl mismatch for A, formamide's carbonyl for B, or propionate's chemical shifts for C). \n\nAnswer: D",
