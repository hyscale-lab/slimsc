The question gives the density matrix \u03c1 = (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). Hmm, I remember that in quantum computing, the state of a qubit can be represented on a Bloch sphere, which is a geometrical representation in three dimensions. The Bloch vector r = (x, y, z) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.\n\nThe density matrix for a qubit can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector as \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where I is the identity matrix and \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices (\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z).

The state |0\u27e9\u27e80| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which when multiplied by 1/2 gives (1/2) times the identity matrix. Wait, so \u03c1 here is (I)/2? Because (|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|) is the identity matrix. So then \u03c1 = (I + 0\u00b7\u03c3)/2, since the identity term comes from the 1/2*(I) part. That would mean that the Bloch vector r is zero because there are no terms with the Pauli matrices. \n\nBecause the standard form is \u03c1 = (1/2)(I + x \u03c3x + y \u03c3y + z \u03c3z). Comparing that to our case, since there's no terms with \u03c3x, \u03c3y, or \u03c3z, all the coefficients x, y, z must be zero. Therefore the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). So looking at the options, that would be option C. \n\nWait but let me think again. The Bloch sphere's points are parametrized by (x,y,z) where each component comes from the expectation values of the Pauli operators. The expectation value for \u03c3x would be Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x). Let me compute that to check. Since \u03c1 is (I)/2, then Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = Tr( (I/2) \u03c3x ) = (1/2) Tr(\u03c3x). But the trace of \u03c3x is zero because it's [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0+0=0. Similarly for \u03c3y and \u03c3z. So all three components x, y, z are zero.

Let me recall how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere representation. \n\nFirst, I remember that any qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere using the formula \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. The Bloch vector components (x, y, z) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \u03c3x, \u03c3y, and \u03c3z respectively. \n\nSo, to find the Bloch vector r, I need to calculate the expectation values of \u03c3x, \u03c3y, and \u03c3z for the given density matrix. Let me write down the given density matrix more explicitly. \n\nThe density matrix \u03c1 here is (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). Let me note that |0\u27e9\u27e80| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so multiplying by 1/2 gives \u03c1 = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Wait a second, that's actually the same as (I)/2, because the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 would be exactly that. \n\nSo \u03c1 = (I + 0\u00b7\u03c3_x + 0\u00b7\u03c3_y + 0\u00b7\u03c3_z)/2. Because if I plug into the Bloch sphere formula, the identity term is there, and the other terms are multiplied by the components of r. Since the given \u03c1 is just the identity matrix scaled by 1/2, that would mean that the coefficients for \u03c3x, \u03c3y, and \u03c3z are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by calculating the expectation values. The expectation value of an operator O in the density matrix \u03c1 is Tr(\u03c1O). Let's compute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x), Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3y), and Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3z).\n\nStarting with \u03c3z. \u03c3z is the Pauli-Z matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, \u03c1 \u03c3z would be (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|) multiplied by \u03c3z. Let me compute the trace:\n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3z) = Tr( (1/2)( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z ) )\n\nSince |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z is |0\u27e9\u27e80| multiplied by \u03c3z. Applying \u03c3z to |0\u27e9 gives |0\u27e9, so \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9 =1. Similarly, |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z |1\u27e9 is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. So the trace becomes (1/2)(1*(-1 term?) Wait, let me think again. Wait, actually, the trace of |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z would be \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9 which is 1. Similarly for |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z, the trace is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. But when we compute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3z), since \u03c1 is (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|), then the trace would be (1/2)(Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z) + Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z)). \n\nWait, Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z) is the same as \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9, which is 1. Similarly, Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z) is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. So adding those gives 1 + (-1) =0. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 0. So the expectation value of \u03c3z is 0. \n\nSimilarly, let's check \u03c3x. The Pauli-X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let's compute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x). \n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = Tr( (1/2)( |0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81| ) * \u03c3x )\n\nBreaking this into two terms:\n\n(1/2)[ Tr( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x ) + Tr( |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x ) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: Tr( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x ) is the trace of the operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x. Let me compute that. The operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x is the matrix:\n\n|0\u27e9\u27e80| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Multiplying by \u03c3x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]), gives:\n\n[ [1*0 +0*1, 1*1 +0*0],\n  [0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0] ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the matrix multiplication. Let me think again. The operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| multiplied by \u03c3x is:\n\nThe matrix for |0\u27e9\u27e80| is:\n\n[1 0\n\n0 0]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x matrix:\n\n[0 1\n\n1 0]\n\nSo the product is:\n\nFirst row first column: (1*0 + 0*1) =0, first row second column (1*1 +0*0)=1\n\nSecond row first column (0*0 +0*1)=0, second row second column (0*1 +0*0)=0. So the matrix is:\n\n[0 1\n\n0 0]\n\nThe trace of this is 0 +0=0.\n\nSecond term: Tr( |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x )\n\nSimilarly, |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Multiply by \u03c3x gives:\n\n[0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0\n\n1*0 +1*1, 1*1 +1*0 ]\n\nWait, let me compute step by step. The |1\u27e9\u27e81| matrix is:\n\n[0 0\n\n0 1]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x:\n\nFirst row first column: 0*0 +0*1 =0\n\nFirst row second column: 0*1 +0*0 =0\n\nSecond row first column: 1*0 +0*1=0 (Wait, no. Let me do the multiplication properly. Let me denote matrix multiplication as A*B where A is |1\u27e9\u27e81| and B is \u03c3x.\n\nWait, actually, the operator is |1\u27e9\u27e81| multiplied by \u03c3x. So the matrix is:\n\n|1\u27e9\u27e81| is the matrix:\n\n[0 0\n\n0 1]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]), so the product is:\n\nFirst row:\n\n[0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0] \u2192 [0,0]\n\nSecond row:\n\n0*0 +1*1 =1 (first element?), second row second element: 0*1 +1*0 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each element:\n\nThe product matrix element (i,j) is the sum over k of (A_ik)(B_kj).\n\nSo for the second row first column element of |1\u27e9\u27e81| * \u03c3x:\n\nA's second row is [0,1], and B's first column is [0,1]^T (since \u03c3x's first column is [0;1]).\n\nSo 0*0 +1*1 =1. \n\nThe second row second column element is 0*1 +1*0 =0.\n\nSo the resulting matrix is:\n\n[0 0\n\n1 0]\n\nThe trace of this is 0 (from first diagonal) +0 (second diagonal) \u2192 trace is 1 +0? Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. The matrix is:\n\nFirst row [0,0], second row [1,0]. So the diagonal elements are 0 (first) and 0 (second). So the trace is 0. \n\nTherefore, Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x) is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire trace for Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) is (1/2)(0 +0)=0. \n\nSimilarly for \u03c3y. Let me check \u03c3y quickly. The Pauli-Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. \n\nCalculating Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3y) would be similar steps. \n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3y) = (1/2)[ Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3y) + Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3y) ]\n\nFirst term Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3y): the matrix product would be |0\u27e9\u27e80| * \u03c3y. The matrix of |0\u27e9\u27e80| times \u03c3y's matrix:\n\n[1 0; 0 0] * [0 -i; i 0] = [0 -i; 0 0]. The trace is 0 (first element) +0 (second) \u2192 0. \n\nSecond term Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3y): the product matrix is [[0,0],[0,1]] multiplied by \u03c3y. Let me compute:\n\nThe first row of |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [0 0], so first row of product is 0. Second row is [0 1] multiplied by \u03c3y's columns. \n\nThe product matrix would be:\n\n[0 0; \n\n0*0 +1*i , 0*(-i) +1*0 ]\n\nWait, maybe better to compute:\n\nThe product matrix element (2,1) is 0*0 +1*i (from \u03c3y's first column?), perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the trace is the sum of diagonal elements. The second element of the diagonal would be 1 (from |1\u27e9\u27e81|) times the (2,2) element of \u03c3y, which is 0. So the trace is 0 again. So the total trace for \u03c3y would also be 0. \n\nTherefore, all three expectation values \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 are zero. \n\nThe Bloch vector r is (\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9), so that's (0,0,0). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the maximally mixed state is at the origin, right? Because the pure states are on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state (which this is, since it's 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1| )) is at the center, so coordinates (0,0,0). \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nThe options are A) (1,1,0), B) (0,0,1), C) (0,0,0), D) (1,1,1). \n\nYes, so the correct answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe given density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1|)$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}I$, the maximally mixed state.

Let me compute the trace:\n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3z) = Tr( (1/2)( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z + |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z ) )\n\nSince |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z is |0\u27e9\u27e80| multiplied by \u03c3z. Applying \u03c3z to |0\u27e9 gives |0\u27e9, so \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9 =1. Similarly, |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z |1\u27e9 is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. So the trace becomes (1/2)(1*(-1 term?) Wait, let me think again. Wait, actually, the trace of |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z would be \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9 which is 1. Similarly for |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z, the trace is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. But when we compute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3z), since \u03c1 is (1/2)(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|), then the trace would be (1/2)(Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z) + Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z)). \n\nWait, Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3z) is the same as \u27e80|\u03c3z|0\u27e9, which is 1. Similarly, Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3z) is \u27e81|\u03c3z|1\u27e9 = -1. So adding those gives 1 + (-1) =0. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 0. So the expectation value of \u03c3z is 0. \n\nSimilarly, let's check \u03c3x. The Pauli-X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let's compute Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x). \n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) = Tr( (1/2)( |0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81| ) * \u03c3x )\n\nBreaking this into two terms:\n\n(1/2)[ Tr( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x ) + Tr( |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x ) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: Tr( |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x ) is the trace of the operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x. Let me compute that. The operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3x is the matrix:\n\n|0\u27e9\u27e80| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Multiplying by \u03c3x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]), gives:\n\n[ [1*0 +0*1, 1*1 +0*0],\n  [0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0] ] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the matrix multiplication. Let me think again. The operator |0\u27e9\u27e80| multiplied by \u03c3x is:\n\nThe matrix for |0\u27e9\u27e80| is:\n\n[1 0\n\n0 0]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x matrix:\n\n[0 1\n\n1 0]\n\nSo the product is:\n\nFirst row first column: (1*0 + 0*1) =0, first row second column (1*1 +0*0)=1\n\nSecond row first column (0*0 +0*1)=0, second row second column (0*1 +0*0)=0. So the matrix is:\n\n[0 1\n\n0 0]\n\nThe trace of this is 0 +0=0.\n\nSecond term: Tr( |1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x )\n\nSimilarly, |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Multiply by \u03c3x gives:\n\n[0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0\n\n1*0 +1*1, 1*1 +1*0 ]\n\nWait, let me compute step by step. The |1\u27e9\u27e81| matrix is:\n\n[0 0\n\n0 1]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x:\n\nFirst row first column: 0*0 +0*1 =0\n\nFirst row second column: 0*1 +0*0 =0\n\nSecond row first column: 1*0 +0*1=0 (Wait, no. Let me do the multiplication properly. Let me denote matrix multiplication as A*B where A is |1\u27e9\u27e81| and B is \u03c3x.\n\nWait, actually, the operator is |1\u27e9\u27e81| multiplied by \u03c3x. So the matrix is:\n\n|1\u27e9\u27e81| is the matrix:\n\n[0 0\n\n0 1]\n\nMultiply by \u03c3x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]), so the product is:\n\nFirst row:\n\n[0*0 +0*1, 0*1 +0*0] \u2192 [0,0]\n\nSecond row:\n\n0*0 +1*1 =1 (first element?), second row second element: 0*1 +1*0 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each element:\n\nThe product matrix element (i,j) is the sum over k of (A_ik)(B_kj).\n\nSo for the second row first column element of |1\u27e9\u27e81| * \u03c3x:\n\nA's second row is [0,1], and B's first column is [0,1]^T (since \u03c3x's first column is [0;1]).\n\nSo 0*0 +1*1 =1. \n\nThe second row second column element is 0*1 +1*0 =0.\n\nSo the resulting matrix is:\n\n[0 0\n\n1 0]\n\nThe trace of this is 0 (from first diagonal) +0 (second diagonal) \u2192 trace is 1 +0? Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. The matrix is:\n\nFirst row [0,0], second row [1,0]. So the diagonal elements are 0 (first) and 0 (second). So the trace is 0. \n\nTherefore, Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3x) is 0. \n\nTherefore, the entire trace for Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3x) is (1/2)(0 +0)=0. \n\nSimilarly for \u03c3y. Let me check \u03c3y quickly. The Pauli-Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. \n\nCalculating Tr(\u03c1 \u03c3y) would be similar steps. \n\nTr(\u03c1 \u03c3y) = (1/2)[ Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3y) + Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3y) ]\n\nFirst term Tr(|0\u27e9\u27e80| \u03c3y): the matrix product would be |0\u27e9\u27e80| * \u03c3y. The matrix of |0\u27e9\u27e80| times \u03c3y's matrix:\n\n[1 0; 0 0] * [0 -i; i 0] = [0 -i; 0 0]. The trace is 0 (first element) +0 (second) \u2192 0. \n\nSecond term Tr(|1\u27e9\u27e81| \u03c3y): the product matrix is [[0,0],[0,1]] multiplied by \u03c3y. Let me compute:\n\nThe first row of |1\u27e9\u27e81| is [0 0], so first row of product is 0. Second row is [0 1] multiplied by \u03c3y's columns. \n\nThe product matrix would be:\n\n[0 0; \n\n0*0 +1*i , 0*(-i) +1*0 ]\n\nWait, maybe better to compute:\n\nThe product matrix element (2,1) is 0*0 +1*i (from \u03c3y's first column?), perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the trace is the sum of diagonal elements. The second element of the diagonal would be 1 (from |1\u27e9\u27e81|) times the (2,2) element of \u03c3y, which is 0. So the trace is 0 again. So the total trace for \u03c3y would also be 0. \n\nTherefore, all three expectation values \u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9 are zero. \n\nThe Bloch vector r is (\u27e8\u03c3x\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3y\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c3z\u27e9), so that's (0,0,0). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the maximally mixed state is at the origin, right? Because the pure states are on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state (which this is, since it's 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1| )) is at the center, so coordinates (0,0,0). \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nThe options are A) (1,1,0), B) (0,0,1), C) (0,0,0), D) (1,1,1). \n\nYes, so the correct answer is C.\n\n\nThe given density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(|0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1|)$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}I$, the maximally mixed state. The Bloch vector $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$ is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$. \n\nCalculating the expectation values:\n- $\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Tr}(|0\\rangle\\langle0|\\sigma_z) + \\text{Tr}(|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\sigma_z)) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + (-1)) = 0$.\n- Similarly, $\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = 0$ and $\\langle \\sigma_y \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = 0$ due to the symmetric nature of the state and the Pauli matrices.\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)$, corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. \n\nAnswer: C",
