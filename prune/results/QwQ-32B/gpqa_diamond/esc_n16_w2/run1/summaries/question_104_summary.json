      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of two exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets are similar to Neptune. The key here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines, which relates to the Doppler effect. \n\nFirst, I remember that the RV method measures the star's motion due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity of the star (as seen from Earth) causes the Doppler shift in the spectral lines. The amplitude of this velocity shift (which relates to the shift in wavelength) depends on several factors, including the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both are in circular orbits, maybe that simplifies things.\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = ( (G(M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^{2/3} (1 + q)^{1/3} ) ) * (1 / (P)^{1/3} ) ) * sqrt( (1 + e^2) / 2 ), but since the orbit is circular, e=0, so that part becomes 1/sqrt(2). Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the formula I might need is K = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^{-1/3} ), but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the masses of the planets are similar, and the stars have the same mass. Also, since both are Neptune-like, their masses are similar, so maybe M_p is the same. Also, the inclination angle i is assumed to be the same (since we don't have info on that, maybe we can treat them as face-on or same inclination, so sin i is the same). \n\nAlternatively, maybe a simpler approach. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is proportional to the velocity of the star's motion (v). The velocity v is related to the orbital parameters. The maximum velocity of the star (which is what the RV method detects) is given by v = (2\u03c0 a sin i) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, P is the period, and sin i is the inclination factor. \n\nBut Kepler's third law comes into play here. For a circular orbit, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. The formula is P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G(M_s + M_p)) * a\u00b3. Since the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star (like Neptune compared to the Sun), M_s + M_p \u2248 M_s. \n\nSo rearranging, a\u00b3 = (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). \n\nNow, the velocity v of the star due to the planet's gravity can be found from the center of mass. The star's orbital speed v is equal to ( (G M_p)/( (M_s + M_p) a ) )^(1/2) * sin i. But again, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me see if I can find a relation between the velocity semi-amplitude (K, which is v here) and the period. \n\nAlternatively, combining the equations. Let's try to express K in terms of P. \n\nFirst, K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^{2/3} (M_s)^{1/3} ) ) * (1/P)^{1/3} ) * something? Wait, perhaps I need to use Kepler's law here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the star's velocity is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity v is given by v = ( (G (M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p) a ) ) )^{1/2} * sin i. Since M_p << M_s, we can approximate M_s + M_p \u2248 M_s, so v \u2248 sqrt( G M_p / (M_s a) ) * sin i. \n\nThen from Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G(M_s + M_p)) \u2248 (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_s). So a\u00b3 \u2248 (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2). So a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nSo substituting a into the expression for v:\n\nv \u2248 sqrt( G M_p / ( M_s * a ) ) * sin i \n\nReplace a with (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3):\n\nLet me compute the denominator inside the sqrt: M_s * a = M_s * [ (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) ]\n\nSo the expression becomes sqrt( G M_p / [ M_s * ( (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) ) ] )\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to combine these equations to get K in terms of P. Let's see:\n\nLet me square both sides of the v expression to make it easier. \n\nv\u00b2 = (G M_p / (M_s a )) * sin\u00b2 i \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, a\u00b3 = (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = ( (G M_s P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) )^(1/3 )\n\nSubstitute that into the v\u00b2 equation:\n\nv\u00b2 = (G M_p / ( M_s * ( (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) )) ) * sin\u00b2 i \n\nLet me rearrange terms. Let's compute the denominator term:\n\nM_s * (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) \n\n= ( G^{1/3} M_s^{1 + (1/3 + 2/3)} ) ... Wait, maybe better to write exponents step by step. Let me write all terms as exponents:\n\nThe denominator term is:\n\nM_s * [ (G)^{1/3} (M_s)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ) ]\n\nSo that's G^{1/3} M_s^{1 + (1/3 + 2/3)}? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the term inside the brackets is (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) = G^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nMultiply by M_s:\n\nM_s * [ G^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ) ]\n\n= G^{1/3} M_s^{1 + 1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nSo that's G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nPutting back into v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 = [ G M_p / ( G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ) ) ] * sin\u00b2 i \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe numerator is G M_p \n\nDenominator terms:\n\nG^{1/3} \u2192 so G^(1 - 1/3) = G^(2/3) remains in numerator?\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nThe fraction is (G M_p) divided by [ G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ]\n\nSo:\n\n= ( G^{1 - 1/3} ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} )\n\n= G^{2/3} M_p / ( M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} )\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too algebra-heavy. Let me see if there's a way to combine these terms to get v in terms of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates K (the velocity semi-amplitude) directly with the period. Let me recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nAssuming that M_p << M_s, then (M_s + M_p) \u2248 M_s, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSo rearranged, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since both stars have the same mass (M_s), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p is the same for both?), then the term (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) would be the same for both planets. \n\nTherefore, K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3) \n\nSo K\u2081 / K\u2082 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nBecause K\u2081 is proportional to 1/P\u2081^(1/3), and K\u2082 is proportional to 1/P\u2082^(1/3). Therefore, K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to find P\u2082/P\u2081. Let me see.\n\nGiven that the problem states the periodic shifts (which correspond to K) are 5 m\u00c5 and 7 m\u00c5. So K\u2081 = 5 m\u00c5, K\u2082 = 7 m\u00c5.\n\nWait, but the actual velocity is related to the wavelength shift via the Doppler shift formula. The shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is approximately equal to v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So if the shifts are given in miliangstroms, but the ratio would be the same as the ratio of velocities, since the wavelength \u03bb cancels out when taking the ratio (assuming the spectral lines are at the same wavelength for both stars, which the question states \"the same spectral line at a given wavelength\" so yes).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (v\u2081 and v\u2082) is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts (\u0394\u03bb\u2081/\u0394\u03bb\u2082). So K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo from earlier, K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, solving for (P\u2082/P\u2081) = (5/7)^3 ?\n\nWait, no, let me check again. \n\nWait, the equation was K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). So rearranged, (P\u2082/P\u2081) = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3. \n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nK\u2081 / K\u2082 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nSo cross-multiplying:\n\n(P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3) = K\u2081/K\u2082 \u2192 \n\n(P\u2082/P\u2081) = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3 \n\nWait, no, if K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3), then raising both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(K\u2081/K\u2082)^3 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)\n\nThus, P\u2082/P\u2081 = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3. \n\nWait, that would mean if K\u2081 is smaller than K\u2082 (since 5 <7), then P\u2082/P\u2081 is (5/7)^3, which is less than 1, so the period of 2 is shorter than 1? But that contradicts my intuition? Wait, let's think. \n\nWait, let me think in terms of the physics. A larger velocity shift (K) would mean the star is moving faster due to the planet. If the star is moving faster, then the orbital period might be shorter. Because if the star's speed is higher, for a given orbit, the period would be shorter. Alternatively, perhaps the planet's orbit is closer, leading to a shorter period. \n\nAlternatively, let's see with the formula. Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then a larger K (like 7 vs 5) would mean that 1/P^(1/3) is larger, so P^(1/3) is smaller, so P is smaller. So planet 2 has a shorter period. But the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. If P2 is smaller, then the ratio P2/P1 would be less than 1, so the answer would be something like 0. something. \n\nLooking at the options, A is ~0.36, D is ~0.85. Let me compute (5/7)^3. 5/7 is approximately 0.714. Cubed: 0.714^3. Let's calculate:\n\n0.714 * 0.714 = 0.509, then *0.714 \u2248 0.509 *0.7 \u2248 0.356, so around 0.357. So that would be option A, ~0.36. But the question is phrased as \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u22480.357. So planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I get the ratio right? \n\nThe key steps are:\n\nK \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, if K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nWait, K1 is 5, K2 is7. \n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore the answer is A. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose planet 2 has a larger K (7 vs 5). So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means lower P. So planet 2 has a shorter period. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer would be A, which is ~0.36. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 0.36. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe formula I used was K \u221d (M_p sin i)/( M_s^{2/3} ) * (1/P^{1/3})\n\nSo K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}\n\nThus, if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1, so P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I inverted something. Let me see:\n\nSuppose K1 = 5, K2 =7. \n\nSo K2 is bigger. So P2 must be smaller. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 \u22480.357. \n\nSo the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B) ~1.40 and D) ~0.85. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula's direction. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose planet A has a longer period. Then K would be smaller (since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3)). \n\nSuppose if P2 is longer than P1, then K2 would be smaller than K1. But in this problem, K2 is larger (7 vs5), so P2 must be shorter. \n\nThus, the ratio P2/P1 is indeed (5/7)^3 \u22480.357, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1\". So it's P2/P1. Since P2 is smaller, it's 0.36 times, so the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me see. Let me think of K \u221d 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo solving for P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3. \n\nYes, exactly. So 5/7 cubed is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. So the answer is A. \n\nSo the options are A ~0.36, so that's correct. So I think the answer is A.\n",

Wait, no:\n\nWait, the term inside the brackets is (G M_s P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) = G^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nMultiply by M_s:\n\nM_s * [ G^{1/3} M_s^{1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ) ]\n\n= G^{1/3} M_s^{1 + 1/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nSo that's G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3}\n\nPutting back into v\u00b2:\n\nv\u00b2 = [ G M_p / ( G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ) ) ] * sin\u00b2 i \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe numerator is G M_p \n\nDenominator terms:\n\nG^{1/3} \u2192 so G^(1 - 1/3) = G^(2/3) remains in numerator?\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nThe fraction is (G M_p) divided by [ G^{1/3} M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} ]\n\nSo:\n\n= ( G^{1 - 1/3} ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} )\n\n= G^{2/3} M_p / ( M_s^{4/3} P^{2/3} (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{-1/3} )\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too algebra-heavy. Let me see if there's a way to combine these terms to get v in terms of P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates K (the velocity semi-amplitude) directly with the period. Let me recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nAssuming that M_p << M_s, then (M_s + M_p) \u2248 M_s, so:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nSo rearranged, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_s^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )\n\nBut since both stars have the same mass (M_s), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p is the same for both?), then the term (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) would be the same for both planets. \n\nTherefore, K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3) \n\nSo K\u2081 / K\u2082 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nBecause K\u2081 is proportional to 1/P\u2081^(1/3), and K\u2082 is proportional to 1/P\u2082^(1/3). Therefore, K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3)\n\nWe need to find P\u2082/P\u2081. Let me see.\n\nGiven that the problem states the periodic shifts (which correspond to K) are 5 m\u00c5 and 7 m\u00c5. So K\u2081 = 5 m\u00c5, K\u2082 = 7 m\u00c5.\n\nWait, but the actual velocity is related to the wavelength shift via the Doppler shift formula. The shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is approximately equal to v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So if the shifts are given in miliangstroms, but the ratio would be the same as the ratio of velocities, since the wavelength \u03bb cancels out when taking the ratio (assuming the spectral lines are at the same wavelength for both stars, which the question states \"the same spectral line at a given wavelength\" so yes).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (v\u2081 and v\u2082) is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts (\u0394\u03bb\u2081/\u0394\u03bb\u2082). So K\u2081/K\u2082 = 5/7.\n\nSo from earlier, K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, solving for (P\u2082/P\u2081) = (5/7)^3 ?\n\nWait, no, let me check again. \n\nWait, the equation was K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3). So rearranged, (P\u2082/P\u2081) = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3. \n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nK\u2081 / K\u2082 = (P\u2082 / P\u2081 )^(1/3)\n\nSo cross-multiplying:\n\n(P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3) = K\u2081/K\u2082 \u2192 \n\n(P\u2082/P\u2081) = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3 \n\nWait, no, if K\u2081/K\u2082 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)^(1/3), then raising both sides to the power of 3:\n\n(K\u2081/K\u2082)^3 = (P\u2082/P\u2081)\n\nThus, P\u2082/P\u2081 = (K\u2081/K\u2082)^3. \n\nWait, that would mean if K\u2081 is smaller than K\u2082 (since 5 <7), then P\u2082/P\u2081 is (5/7)^3, which is less than 1, so the period of 2 is shorter than 1? But that contradicts my intuition? Wait, let's think. \n\nWait, let me think in terms of the physics. A larger velocity shift (K) would mean the star is moving faster due to the planet. If the star is moving faster, then the orbital period might be shorter. Because if the star's speed is higher, for a given orbit, the period would be shorter. Alternatively, perhaps the planet's orbit is closer, leading to a shorter period. \n\nAlternatively, let's see with the formula. Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then a larger K (like 7 vs 5) would mean that 1/P^(1/3) is larger, so P^(1/3) is smaller, so P is smaller. So planet 2 has a shorter period. But the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. If P2 is smaller, then the ratio P2/P1 would be less than 1, so the answer would be something like 0. something. \n\nLooking at the options, A is ~0.36, D is ~0.85. Let me compute (5/7)^3. 5/7 is approximately 0.714. Cubed: 0.714^3. Let's calculate:\n\n0.714 * 0.714 = 0.509, then *0.714 \u2248 0.509 *0.7 \u2248 0.356, so around 0.357. So that would be option A, ~0.36. But the question is phrased as \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u22480.357. So planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I get the ratio right? \n\nThe key steps are:\n\nK \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, if K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nWait, K1 is 5, K2 is7. \n\nSo 5/7 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore the answer is A. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose planet 2 has a larger K (7 vs 5). So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means lower P. So planet 2 has a shorter period. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer would be A, which is ~0.36. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 0.36. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe formula I used was K \u221d (M_p sin i)/( M_s^{2/3} ) * (1/P^{1/3})\n\nSo K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}\n\nThus, if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1, so P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I inverted something. Let me see:\n\nSuppose K1 = 5, K2 =7. \n\nSo K2 is bigger. So P2 must be smaller. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 \u22480.357. \n\nSo the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options have B) ~1.40 and D) ~0.85. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula's direction. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose planet A has a longer period. Then K would be smaller (since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3)). \n\nSuppose if P2 is longer than P1, then K2 would be smaller than K1. But in this problem, K2 is larger (7 vs5), so P2 must be shorter. \n\nThus, the ratio P2/P1 is indeed (5/7)^3 \u22480.357, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1\". So it's P2/P1. Since P2 is smaller, it's 0.36 times, so the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me see. Let me think of K \u221d 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)\n\nSo solving for P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3. \n\nYes, exactly. So 5/7 cubed is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. So the answer is A. \n\nSo the options are A ~0.36, so that's correct. So I think the answer is A.\n\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects a planet's presence by measuring the star's motion. The velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) of the star is inversely proportional to the orbital period \\( P \\) raised to the 1/3 power, assuming similar planetary masses and stellar masses. Given the wavelength shifts (proportional to \\( K \\)), we have \\( K_1/K_2 = (P_2/P_1)^{1/3} \\).

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a Neptune-mass planet. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the wavelength shifts observed. The shifts are 5 miliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 miliangstrom for planet 2. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to #1. \n\nHmm, first, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us. The amplitude of this velocity (the star's speed) depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets have similar masses and the stars are the same mass, maybe the main variables here are the orbital periods and the velocity shifts?\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = ( (G(M_p) sin i) / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term becomes 1. Also, since the planet masses are similar and the star masses are the same, maybe some terms cancel out?\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is proportional to the velocity of the star (v). The velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull is given by v = K, the semi-amplitude. \n\nThe relation between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Let me recall the formula. \n\nThe formula for K (the star's velocity) is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 + e)^2 )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to use the formula that relates K and P. Let me think again. \n\nThe orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G(M_* + M_p)). Since M_p is much smaller than M_* (like Neptune compared to the Sun), we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*.\n\nThe velocity of the star, K, comes from the fact that the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's orbital speed is v = (2\u03c0 a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's semi-major axis. The planet's semi-major axis a_p is related to the star's a_* by (a_p / a_*) = (M_* / M_p). But since M_p << M_*, a_* is much smaller than a_p, so the star's orbit is small compared to the planet's. \n\nAlternatively, the relation between K and the planet's parameters can be derived. Let me try to combine the equations.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law for the planet's orbit (approximating M_* as the central mass):\n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*)\n\nSo a\u00b3 = (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2)\n\nThe star's velocity K is equal to the orbital speed of the star around the CM. Since the star's orbital radius a_* is given by a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * a_p. But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) * a_p. However, the star's velocity K is (2\u03c0 a_*) / P. \n\nPutting that together:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 a_*) / P \u2248 (2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * a_p ) / P\n\nBut a_p is the planet's semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, a_p\u00b3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) \u2248 (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). Therefore, a_p = [ (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) ) / P \n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step. Let's factor out constants:\n\nInside the brackets: (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) raised to 1/3. Let's write that as (G M_* )^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3).\n\nSo, substituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 [ 2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ] / P \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's see if we can find a relation between K and P. Let me recall that the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G)^{1/3} (M_p \\sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} )^{1/3} ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^{1/2} )) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. \n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} (a)^{1} ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) ) \n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G)^{1/3} (M_p \\sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} )^{1/3} ) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )\n\nWait, perhaps better to write it as:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^{2/3} ) )^{1/3} * (1 / ( (a) )^{1/3} ) ) ??? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the relationship between K and P. Since both K and P are related to the orbital parameters, perhaps the key is to find the relation between K and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), and assuming M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*.\n\nThen, Kepler's third law gives:\n\nP\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo, a\u00b3 = ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nThe star's velocity K is equal to its orbital speed around the center of mass. Since the star and planet orbit around their CM, the distance from the star to the CM is a_* = ( M_p / (M_* + M_p) ) * a. Since M_p is much smaller, a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) a. \n\nThe star's speed is v = (2 \u03c0 a_*) / P. \n\nSo substituting a_*:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) a ) / P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a is expressed in terms of P. Let's substitute a from above:\n\na = [ ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3}\n\nPlugging that into the expression for v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) / P ) * [ ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3}\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write all terms:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) / P ] * [ (G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute the exponents. Let's expand the terms inside the brackets.\n\nThe term inside the brackets is (G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) = (G M_*)^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 (M_p)/(M_*) * 1/P ] * [ (G M_*)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nLet me handle the constants and variables step by step.\n\nFirst, constants:\n\n2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3). Let me compute 4 \u03c0\u00b2 to the 1/3 exponent. Hmm, perhaps better to factor all terms:\n\nLet me collect all the constants, M terms, and P terms:\n\nConstants:\n\n2 \u03c0 * (G)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nM terms:\n\n(M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^(1/3) \n\nP terms:\n\n(1/P) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nLet me handle each part:\n\nConstants:\n\n2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nLet me write 4 as 2\u00b2, so (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} \u03c0^{2/3}\n\nSo the constants become:\n\n2 \u03c0 / (2^{2/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) \n\n= 2^{1 - 2/3} \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} \n\n= 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nHmm, that's 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) \n\nM terms:\n\n(M_p / M_*) * M_*^{1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-1 + 1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-2/3}\n\nP terms:\n\n(1/P) * P^{2/3} = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}\n\nPutting all together:\n\nv = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}] * [ (G)^{1/3} ] * [ M_p * M_*^{-2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]\n\nWait, actually, the G term was part of the constants? Wait, no. Wait, the G term comes from (G M_*)^{1/3}, so G^{1/3} M_*^{1/3}, but then multiplied by the M terms. Let me see again.\n\nWait, the M terms:\n\nThe M_* terms were (M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^{1/3} \n\nSo that is M_p * M_*^{-1} * M_*^{1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-2/3}\n\nThe G term is part of the constants, so G^{1/3}\n\nWait, so all together, the expression for v (K) is:\n\nK = v = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} G^{1/3} M_p M_*^{-2/3} P^{-1/3} ] * [ \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ? Wait, maybe I messed up the constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write all the constants together:\n\nThe constants from the initial terms:\n\n2 \u03c0 multiplied by (G)^{1/3} divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nSo:\n\n2 \u03c0 * G^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nWhich is same as (2 \u03c0) * G^{1/3} / [ (4)^{1/3} (\u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) * G^{1/3}\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator for \u03c0 terms: \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) = \u03c0^(1/3). \n\nSo numerator's \u03c0 is \u03c0^(1/3). The 2 / 4^{1/3} is 2 / (2^{2/3}) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^{1/3}\n\nThus the constants become (2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}) * G^{1/3}\n\nSo putting all together, K is:\n\nK = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} G^{1/3}] * [ M_p / M_*^{2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]\n\nSo K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) ) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSince both planets have the same mass (M_p similar), and the stars have the same M_* (same as the Sun), the ratio of K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^{-1/3}\n\nWait, let me write equations for K1 and K2.\n\nLet me denote variables for planet 1 and 2.\n\nK1 = C * (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nK2 = C * (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P2^{-1/3}\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both, the constants and those terms cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nThus, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{-1/3} \n\nSo rearranged:\n\n(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^{-3}\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nLet me write K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) ) \n\nSo K1/K2 = (P1 / P2)^{1/3}\n\nThus, (K1/K2)^3 = P1 / P2 \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 ?\n\nWait, let me see again:\n\nLet me take the equation K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) )\n\nWhich is (P1^{1/3}/P2^{1/3}) )\n\nThus, K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^3 = (P1/P2) \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nAh right. So the ratio of periods is (K2/K1)^3. \n\nWait, so if K2 is larger than K1, then the period P2 is longer? Let me see: If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K implies shorter period. \n\nYes, because if K increases, then P must decrease to keep the product K * P^{1/3} constant. \n\nSo in this problem, the question is: the shift (which is proportional to K) for planet 2 is 7 miliangstrom, and planet 1 is 5 miliangstrom. \n\nAssuming that the shifts are proportional to the K values, then K2/K1 = 7/5. \n\nThus, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (7/5)^3 ?\n\nWait, no, wait, according to the previous equation, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 ?\n\nWait, let me re-derive:\n\nStarting from K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nThen, cubing both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P1/P2 \u2192 P2 = P1*(K2/K1)^3 \n\nSo P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nWait, but K2 is bigger than K1 (7 vs 5), so the period ratio would be (7/5)^3? \n\nBut that would make P2 longer than P1? Wait, but K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P must decrease. So higher K means shorter period. \n\nWait, let's think with numbers. Suppose K1 is 5, K2 is 7. \n\nThen, since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so if K2 is higher, then P2 is smaller. \n\nWait, but according to the formula above, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 7/5 cubed is about (1.4)^3 = ~2.744, but that would mean P2 is longer, which contradicts. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me see again. Let me start over.\n\nThe formula we had was K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSo K \u221d P^{-1/3}\n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nSo, solving for P2/P1: \n\n(K1/K2) = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = (P2 / P1) \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me do algebra again.\n\nIf K \u221d P^{-1/3}, then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nWait, no, let me write:\n\nK1 = C * P1^{-1/3}\n\nK2 = C * P2^{-1/3}\n\nDivide K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) ) \u2192 (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, cross-multiplying:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = (P1/P2)\n\n\u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nAh okay, so that's correct. So the ratio of periods is (K2/K1)^3. \n\nSo in this case, K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So the ratio is (7/5)^3. Let me compute that. \n\n7 divided by 5 is 1.4, so 1.4 cubed. \n\n1.4^3 = 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96; 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744. \n\nWait but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.4, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85. \n\nHmm, but according to this calculation, the ratio P2/P1 would be (7/5)^3 \u2248 2.744, which is not among the options. \n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I messed up the relation. \n\nWait, the question says the shift is 5 miliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity, so the K values are proportional to the shifts. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\" So the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb) is proportional to the velocity (since \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb \u2248 v / c). So the shifts (\u0394\u03bb) are proportional to K. \n\nTherefore, K2/K1 = 7/5. \n\nBut according to the previous formula, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (7/5)^3 \u2248 2.744. But that's not an option. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula derivation. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is K \u221d sqrt( (M_p) / (M_* P) ) ) or something else. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let's use the formula for K:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) a )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nThe standard formula for K (semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (a)^(1) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) )\n\nWait, perhaps better to look up the formula. \n\nThe correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(a) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) )\n\nBut a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. \n\nAlternatively, combining with Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G(M_* + M_p))) * a\u00b3 \n\nTherefore, a\u00b3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, substitute this into the expression for K:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) M_p sin i / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / a )^(1/3) ) * ... \n\nWait, let me see. Let me try substituting a into K's formula. \n\nLet me write K as:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) a )^(1/3) ) \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of P. Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression for a, \n\na = [ (G(M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, substituting into K's formula:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * [ (G(M_* + M_p) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, so M_p and M_* are the same for both. \n\nThus, the only variables are K and P. \n\nThe formula for K can be written as:\n\nK \u221d (M_p / (M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )) \n\nBecause if you consider M_p << M_*, then M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so the terms simplify. \n\nTherefore, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, then K \u221d 1/P^{1/3}\n\nSo K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, rearranged, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nWait, no, let me see again. \n\nIf K1 \u221d 1/P1^{1/3}, and K2 \u221d 1/P2^{1/3}, then:\n\nK1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1) \n\nWait, that can't be. Let me write:\n\nK1 = C / P1^{1/3}\n\nK2 = C / P2^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1 \u2192 so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nWait, now this is conflicting with the previous conclusion. \n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nSuppose K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nSo K1 = k / P1^{1/3}\n\nK2 = k / P2^{1/3}\n\nThen K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2 = P1*(K1/K2)^3 \n\nWait, so if K2 is larger than K1, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. \n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion. \n\nHmm, so where is the confusion here. Let's see:\n\nThe problem is in the proportionality. Let me think of K proportional to 1/P^(1/3). \n\nSo if K increases, then P must decrease. \n\nSo for instance, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. \n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nWait, let's plug in numbers. \n\nSuppose K2 is 7, K1 is 5. Then K1/K2 = 5/7 \u2248 0.714. \n\nSo (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo P2/P1 \u2248 0.357. \n\nWhich would be answer A (~0.36). \n\nAh! So that's the key. \n\nEarlier I must have messed up the algebra. \n\nSo the correct formula is K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, if K2/K1 = 7/5, then P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 \u2248 (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. \n\nSo the answer is option A. \n\nWait, but the options are: \n\nA) ~ 0.36 \n\nB) ~1.40 \n\nC) ~1.96 \n\nD) ~0.85 \n\nSo that would be answer A. \n\nWait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I derived the formula, I think I might have inverted the relation. \n\nLet me re-derive the relationship carefully again. \n\nThe key point: \n\nK is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )) \n\nAssuming M_p and M_* are the same, then K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} \u2192 solving for P2/P1:\n\n(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nSo since K2 is larger, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is option A. \n\nAh, so I had a mistake in the algebra earlier when I thought it was (K2/K1)^3. \n\nThe correct formula is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nSo the problem is solved by recognizing that the velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Thus, a larger K (7 vs 5) implies a shorter period, so the period ratio is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. \n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to an orbiting planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (P).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a Neptune-mass planet. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the wavelength shifts observed. The shifts are 5 miliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 miliangstrom for planet 2. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to #1. \n\nHmm, first, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us. The amplitude of this velocity (the star's speed) depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets have similar masses and the stars are the same mass, maybe the main variables here are the orbital periods and the velocity shifts?\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = ( (G(M_p) sin i) / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term becomes 1. Also, since the planet masses are similar and the star masses are the same, maybe some terms cancel out?\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach. The Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is proportional to the velocity of the star (v). The velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull is given by v = K, the semi-amplitude. \n\nThe relation between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Let me recall the formula. \n\nThe formula for K (the star's velocity) is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 + e)^2 )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to use the formula that relates K and P. Let me think again. \n\nThe orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G(M_* + M_p)). Since M_p is much smaller than M_* (like Neptune compared to the Sun), we can approximate M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*.\n\nThe velocity of the star, K, comes from the fact that the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's orbital speed is v = (2\u03c0 a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's semi-major axis. The planet's semi-major axis a_p is related to the star's a_* by (a_p / a_*) = (M_* / M_p). But since M_p << M_*, a_* is much smaller than a_p, so the star's orbit is small compared to the planet's. \n\nAlternatively, the relation between K and the planet's parameters can be derived. Let me try to combine the equations.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law for the planet's orbit (approximating M_* as the central mass):\n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*)\n\nSo a\u00b3 = (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2)\n\nThe star's velocity K is equal to the orbital speed of the star around the CM. Since the star's orbital radius a_* is given by a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * a_p. But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) * a_p. However, the star's velocity K is (2\u03c0 a_*) / P. \n\nPutting that together:\n\nK = (2\u03c0 a_*) / P \u2248 (2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * a_p ) / P\n\nBut a_p is the planet's semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, a_p\u00b3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) \u2248 (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). Therefore, a_p = [ (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 (2\u03c0 (M_p / M_*) * [ (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3) ) / P \n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step. Let's factor out constants:\n\nInside the brackets: (G M_* P\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) raised to 1/3. Let's write that as (G M_* )^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3).\n\nSo, substituting back into K:\n\nK \u2248 [ 2\u03c0 * (M_p / M_*) * (G M_* )^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4\u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ] / P \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's see if we can find a relation between K and P. Let me recall that the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G)^{1/3} (M_p \\sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} )^{1/3} ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^{1/2} )) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. \n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} (a)^{1} ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) ) \n\nWait, no. Let me get this right. The correct formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G)^{1/3} (M_p \\sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} )^{1/3} ) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )\n\nWait, perhaps better to write it as:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^{2/3} ) )^{1/3} * (1 / ( (a) )^{1/3} ) ) ??? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the relationship between K and P. Since both K and P are related to the orbital parameters, perhaps the key is to find the relation between K and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), and assuming M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*.\n\nThen, Kepler's third law gives:\n\nP\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / ( G M_* )\n\nSo, a\u00b3 = ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nThe star's velocity K is equal to its orbital speed around the center of mass. Since the star and planet orbit around their CM, the distance from the star to the CM is a_* = ( M_p / (M_* + M_p) ) * a. Since M_p is much smaller, a_* \u2248 (M_p / M_*) a. \n\nThe star's speed is v = (2 \u03c0 a_*) / P. \n\nSo substituting a_*:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) a ) / P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a is expressed in terms of P. Let's substitute a from above:\n\na = [ ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3}\n\nPlugging that into the expression for v:\n\nv = (2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) / P ) * [ ( G M_* P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3}\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write all terms:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 (M_p / M_*) / P ] * [ (G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute the exponents. Let's expand the terms inside the brackets.\n\nThe term inside the brackets is (G M_* P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) = (G M_*)^(1/3) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nv = [2 \u03c0 (M_p)/(M_*) * 1/P ] * [ (G M_*)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nLet me handle the constants and variables step by step.\n\nFirst, constants:\n\n2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3). Let me compute 4 \u03c0\u00b2 to the 1/3 exponent. Hmm, perhaps better to factor all terms:\n\nLet me collect all the constants, M terms, and P terms:\n\nConstants:\n\n2 \u03c0 * (G)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nM terms:\n\n(M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^(1/3) \n\nP terms:\n\n(1/P) * (P\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nLet me handle each part:\n\nConstants:\n\n2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nLet me write 4 as 2\u00b2, so (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3} \u03c0^{2/3}\n\nSo the constants become:\n\n2 \u03c0 / (2^{2/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) \n\n= 2^{1 - 2/3} \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} \n\n= 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nHmm, that's 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) \n\nM terms:\n\n(M_p / M_*) * M_*^{1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-1 + 1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-2/3}\n\nP terms:\n\n(1/P) * P^{2/3} = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}\n\nPutting all together:\n\nv = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}] * [ (G)^{1/3} ] * [ M_p * M_*^{-2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]\n\nWait, actually, the G term was part of the constants? Wait, no. Wait, the G term comes from (G M_*)^{1/3}, so G^{1/3} M_*^{1/3}, but then multiplied by the M terms. Let me see again.\n\nWait, the M terms:\n\nThe M_* terms were (M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^{1/3} \n\nSo that is M_p * M_*^{-1} * M_*^{1/3} = M_p * M_*^{-2/3}\n\nThe G term is part of the constants, so G^{1/3}\n\nWait, so all together, the expression for v (K) is:\n\nK = v = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} G^{1/3} M_p M_*^{-2/3} P^{-1/3} ] * [ \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ? Wait, maybe I messed up the constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write all the constants together:\n\nThe constants from the initial terms:\n\n2 \u03c0 multiplied by (G)^{1/3} divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nSo:\n\n2 \u03c0 * G^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nWhich is same as (2 \u03c0) * G^{1/3} / [ (4)^{1/3} (\u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ) ]\n\n= (2 \u03c0) / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) * G^{1/3}\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator for \u03c0 terms: \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) = \u03c0^(1/3). \n\nSo numerator's \u03c0 is \u03c0^(1/3). The 2 / 4^{1/3} is 2 / (2^{2/3}) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^{1/3}\n\nThus the constants become (2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3}) * G^{1/3}\n\nSo putting all together, K is:\n\nK = [2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} G^{1/3}] * [ M_p / M_*^{2/3} ] * [ P^{-1/3} ]\n\nSo K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) ) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSince both planets have the same mass (M_p similar), and the stars have the same M_* (same as the Sun), the ratio of K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^{-1/3}\n\nWait, let me write equations for K1 and K2.\n\nLet me denote variables for planet 1 and 2.\n\nK1 = C * (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nK2 = C * (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P2^{-1/3}\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both, the constants and those terms cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nThus, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{-1/3} \n\nSo rearranged:\n\n(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^{-3}\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nLet me write K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) ) \n\nSo K1/K2 = (P1 / P2)^{1/3}\n\nThus, (K1/K2)^3 = P1 / P2 \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 ?\n\nWait, let me see again:\n\nLet me take the equation K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) )\n\nWhich is (P1^{1/3}/P2^{1/3}) )\n\nThus, K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, (K1/K2)^3 = (P1/P2) \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nAh right. So the ratio of periods is (K2/K1)^3. \n\nWait, so if K2 is larger than K1, then the period P2 is longer? Let me see: If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K implies shorter period. \n\nYes, because if K increases, then P must decrease to keep the product K * P^{1/3} constant. \n\nSo in this problem, the question is: the shift (which is proportional to K) for planet 2 is 7 miliangstrom, and planet 1 is 5 miliangstrom. \n\nAssuming that the shifts are proportional to the K values, then K2/K1 = 7/5. \n\nThus, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (7/5)^3 ?\n\nWait, no, wait, according to the previous equation, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 ?\n\nWait, let me re-derive:\n\nStarting from K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nThen, cubing both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P1/P2 \u2192 P2 = P1*(K2/K1)^3 \n\nSo P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nWait, but K2 is bigger than K1 (7 vs 5), so the period ratio would be (7/5)^3? \n\nBut that would make P2 longer than P1? Wait, but K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P must decrease. So higher K means shorter period. \n\nWait, let's think with numbers. Suppose K1 is 5, K2 is 7. \n\nThen, since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so if K2 is higher, then P2 is smaller. \n\nWait, but according to the formula above, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 7/5 cubed is about (1.4)^3 = ~2.744, but that would mean P2 is longer, which contradicts. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me see again. Let me start over.\n\nThe formula we had was K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSo K \u221d P^{-1/3}\n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nSo, solving for P2/P1: \n\n(K1/K2) = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = (P2 / P1) \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me do algebra again.\n\nIf K \u221d P^{-1/3}, then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nWait, no, let me write:\n\nK1 = C * P1^{-1/3}\n\nK2 = C * P2^{-1/3}\n\nDivide K1/K2 = (P2^{-1/3}) / (P1^{-1/3}) ) \u2192 (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, cross-multiplying:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = (P1/P2)\n\n\u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nAh okay, so that's correct. So the ratio of periods is (K2/K1)^3. \n\nSo in this case, K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So the ratio is (7/5)^3. Let me compute that. \n\n7 divided by 5 is 1.4, so 1.4 cubed. \n\n1.4^3 = 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96; 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744. \n\nWait but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.4, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85. \n\nHmm, but according to this calculation, the ratio P2/P1 would be (7/5)^3 \u2248 2.744, which is not among the options. \n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I messed up the relation. \n\nWait, the question says the shift is 5 miliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity, so the K values are proportional to the shifts. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\" So the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb) is proportional to the velocity (since \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb \u2248 v / c). So the shifts (\u0394\u03bb) are proportional to K. \n\nTherefore, K2/K1 = 7/5. \n\nBut according to the previous formula, P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (7/5)^3 \u2248 2.744. But that's not an option. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula derivation. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is K \u221d sqrt( (M_p) / (M_* P) ) ) or something else. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let's use the formula for K:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) a )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nThe standard formula for K (semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (a)^(1) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2) )\n\nWait, perhaps better to look up the formula. \n\nThe correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(a) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2) )\n\nBut a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. \n\nAlternatively, combining with Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G(M_* + M_p))) * a\u00b3 \n\nTherefore, a\u00b3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ (G (M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, substitute this into the expression for K:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) M_p sin i / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / a )^(1/3) ) * ... \n\nWait, let me see. Let me try substituting a into K's formula. \n\nLet me write K as:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) a )^(1/3) ) \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of P. Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression for a, \n\na = [ (G(M_* + M_p) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nThen, substituting into K's formula:\n\nK = ( G^(1/3) M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * [ (G(M_* + M_p) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem states that the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, so M_p and M_* are the same for both. \n\nThus, the only variables are K and P. \n\nThe formula for K can be written as:\n\nK \u221d (M_p / (M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )) \n\nBecause if you consider M_p << M_*, then M_* + M_p \u2248 M_*, so the terms simplify. \n\nTherefore, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )\n\nSince M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, then K \u221d 1/P^{1/3}\n\nSo K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, rearranged, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2/P1 = (K2/K1)^3 \n\nWait, no, let me see again. \n\nIf K1 \u221d 1/P1^{1/3}, and K2 \u221d 1/P2^{1/3}, then:\n\nK1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1) \n\nWait, that can't be. Let me write:\n\nK1 = C / P1^{1/3}\n\nK2 = C / P2^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1 \u2192 so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nWait, now this is conflicting with the previous conclusion. \n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nSuppose K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nSo K1 = k / P1^{1/3}\n\nK2 = k / P2^{1/3}\n\nThen K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3}/P1^{1/3}) \u2192 (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1 \u2192 P2 = P1*(K1/K2)^3 \n\nWait, so if K2 is larger than K1, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. \n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion. \n\nHmm, so where is the confusion here. Let's see:\n\nThe problem is in the proportionality. Let me think of K proportional to 1/P^(1/3). \n\nSo if K increases, then P must decrease. \n\nSo for instance, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. \n\nSo the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nWait, let's plug in numbers. \n\nSuppose K2 is 7, K1 is 5. Then K1/K2 = 5/7 \u2248 0.714. \n\nSo (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo P2/P1 \u2248 0.357. \n\nWhich would be answer A (~0.36). \n\nAh! So that's the key. \n\nEarlier I must have messed up the algebra. \n\nSo the correct formula is K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, if K2/K1 = 7/5, then P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 \u2248 (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. \n\nSo the answer is option A. \n\nWait, but the options are: \n\nA) ~ 0.36 \n\nB) ~1.40 \n\nC) ~1.96 \n\nD) ~0.85 \n\nSo that would be answer A. \n\nWait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I derived the formula, I think I might have inverted the relation. \n\nLet me re-derive the relationship carefully again. \n\nThe key point: \n\nK is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )) \n\nAssuming M_p and M_* are the same, then K is proportional to 1/P^{1/3}\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} \u2192 solving for P2/P1:\n\n(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nSo since K2 is larger, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is option A. \n\nAh, so I had a mistake in the algebra earlier when I thought it was (K2/K1)^3. \n\nThe correct formula is (K1/K2)^3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nSo the problem is solved by recognizing that the velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Thus, a larger K (7 vs 5) implies a shorter period, so the period ratio is (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. \n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to an orbiting planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period (P). Since both planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass, the ratio of their orbital periods can be derived from their K values. \n\nGiven K\u2081 = 5 miliangstrom and K\u2082 = 7 miliangstrom, the relationship is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 \\approx 0.357 \\approx 0.36\n\\]\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nAnswer: A",
