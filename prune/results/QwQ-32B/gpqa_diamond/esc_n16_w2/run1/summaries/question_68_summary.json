      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin 1/2 particle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment when the magnetic field direction changes. Let me recall what I know about spin and magnetic fields.\n\nAlright, the particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz. Oh wait, right, the magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is proportional to the spin component. The spin operators are in terms of the Pauli matrices, I think. The original magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle is aligned with it. That means its spin is in the +z eigenstate, right? So initially, it's in the state |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nThen suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So the magnetic field now is in the Y direction. The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment starting to oscillate. We need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is \u03b3*S, then H would be proportional to Sy? Wait, let me think again. The magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the interaction energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is in the Y direction, that becomes H = -\u03b3 B Sy. But wait, the sign might matter here. Let me see. Let me write it as H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. \u03bc is \u03b3 Sz, but actually, wait, no, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the total vector, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but the problem states that the initial magnetic field was in the +Z direction. The particle was aligned, so it was in the +z eigenstate. But when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H proportional to Sy. \n\nNow, the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian. The initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Since the Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B Sy (I need to confirm the sign again, but maybe the exact sign won't affect the frequency, just the phase). The key is to find the time evolution of the system and then compute the expectation value of Sz over time, since the question is about the z-component of the magnetic moment. The average of Sz will oscillate, and we need the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I can write the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is H = \u03c9 Sy (with \u03c9 being some constant), then the time evolution operator is given by U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since we're dealing with spin-1/2, the operators can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me set \u0127 = 1 for simplicity here (since in the equations, the gamma might already account for it, but I should be careful).\n\nFirst, let me write the Hamiltonian properly. Let's see:\n\nThe original magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the interaction energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, S\u00b7B would be S_y * B. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y. The Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Let me write H = - \u03b3 B Sy. Let's note that Sy is the spin y operator. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2, but again, perhaps in units where \u0127 is included in gamma? Wait, the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. Wait, the standard form for the magnetic moment of a particle with spin is \u03bc = -\u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So perhaps H is given by H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Wait, maybe I had the sign wrong earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. If \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H = - \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So yes, that's correct. So when B is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B Sy. So that's the Hamiltonian. The time evolution will depend on this.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Since we have a Hamiltonian proportional to Sy, the state will evolve under Sy. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is proportional to an operator like Sy, which is off-diagonal in the Sz basis, the state will oscillate between the eigenstates of Sz. So the time evolution can be found by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nLet me write the Hamiltonian matrix in the Sz basis. The Sz eigenstates are |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9. The Sy operator in this basis is represented by the Pauli matrix \u03c3_y multiplied by \u0127/2. But maybe in the problem's units, they have already accounted for the factors, so perhaps the Sy matrix is just:\n\nSy has matrix elements in the Sz basis:\n\n[0, -i]\n[i, 0] multiplied by \u0127/2. Wait, but I need to confirm the exact form. Let me think in terms of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo Sy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Therefore, H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Wait, but the problem's expression for \u03bc is given as \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Hmm, perhaps the problem is using units where \u0127 is set to 1, so that \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, where Sz is in units of \u0127/2. Or maybe the gamma already includes the factors. This might complicate things, but perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy with a coefficient that will lead to the correct frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work in natural units where \u0127=1 and the spin operators are in units where S has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose that S is in units where S_z has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Then Sy has matrix elements [[0, -i/2],[i/2, 0]], but perhaps the exact matrix form isn't necessary here. Let me consider the time evolution of the state.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution is given by the unitary operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). But if we set \u0127 =1, then U(t) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B Sy) t ) = exp( i \u03b3 B Sy t ). \n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|\u2191z\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B Sy t ) |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nTo compute the expectation value of Sz(t), we need \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the equations of motion. Let me think in terms of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nThe state can be written as a combination of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a(t) |\u2191z\u27e9 + b(t) |\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in matrix form (in the Sz basis) is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. Let's write Sy in the Sz basis. The Sy operator in the Sz basis has components:\n\nSy |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2) |\u2193z\u27e9 i\nSy |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2) |\u2191z\u27e9 i\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, using the Pauli matrices. Let me recall that in the standard basis, Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3y. So if we write in terms of operators:\n\nH = - \u03b3 B Sy = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. But perhaps the problem's units have \u03b3 already including the factors so that H = - \u03b3 B Sy, where Sy's eigenvalues are \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127 is included). Maybe I should just proceed with the algebra.\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is i\u0127 d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. Let me set \u0127=1 for simplicity, so:\n\ni d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me write H in the Sz basis. The matrix for Sy (assuming units where \u0127=1 and S has eigenvalues \u00b11/2) would be:\n\nSy = (1/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nTherefore, H = - \u03b3 B Sy = - \u03b3 B * (1/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\nSo the matrix elements of H are:\n\nH11 = 0, H12 = (\u03b3 B / 2) * i,\n\nH21 = - (\u03b3 B / 2)*i, H22 =0.\n\nWait, because multiplying the matrix:\n\nH = -\u03b3 B/2 * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo H12 = -\u03b3 B/2 * (-i) = (\u03b3 B/2)i ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-calculate:\n\nOriginal Sy matrix is (1/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]], so H = - \u03b3 B * Sy = - \u03b3 B (1/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]].\n\nSo H's components are:\n\nH_{11} = 0,\n\nH_{12} = - \u03b3 B (1/2)*(-i) = (i \u03b3 B)/2,\n\nH_{21} = - \u03b3 B (1/2)*(i) = - (i \u03b3 B)/2,\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step.\n\nThe matrix for Sy is (1/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo when multiplied by -\u03b3 B, H is:\n\nH = - \u03b3 B * (Sy) = - \u03b3 B*(1/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nThus, each element:\n\nH11 = 0,\n\nH12 = - \u03b3 B*(1/2)*(-i) = (\u03b3 B i)/2,\n\nH21 = - \u03b3 B*(1/2)*(i) = - (\u03b3 B i)/2,\n\nH22 =0.\n\nSo H matrix is:\n\n[ 0 , (\u03b3 B i)/2 ]\n\n[ - (\u03b3 B i)/2 , 0 ]\n\nWait, no, actually the second element H21 would be -\u03b3 B/2 multiplied by the (2,1) element of Sy, which is i. So H21 = -\u03b3 B/2 * i.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just write H as:\n\nH = (\u03b3 B / 2i ) * [[0,1],[-1,0]] ?\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too bogged down. Let me proceed with the equations of motion.\n\nThe equations for a(t) and b(t) are:\n\ni da/dt = H_{11} a + H_{12} b = (H12) b,\n\nSimilarly, i db/dt = H_{21} a + H_{22} b = H_{21} a.\n\nFrom above, H_{12} is (\u03b3 B i)/2, and H_{21} is - (\u03b3 B i)/2.\n\nWait, but substituting the H matrix into the equations:\n\nWait, the equations are:\n\ni da/dt = H_{11} a + H_{12} b \u2192 i da/dt = (\u03b3 B i / 2 ) b,\n\nSimilarly, i db/dt = H_{21} a + H_{22} b \u2192 i db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B i / 2 ) a,\n\nSo let's write them out:\n\nEquation 1: i da/dt = ( \u03b3 B i / 2 ) b \u2192 da/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\nEquation 2: i db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B i / 2 ) a \u2192 db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nSo we have a system of differential equations:\n\nda/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\ndb/dt = - ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nThis is similar to the equations for a two-level system under a transverse field. \n\nLet me try to find the solution. Let me note that these equations can be written as second-order equations. Differentiating the first equation again:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) db/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) ( - \u03b3 B / 2 a ) = - ( \u03b3 B )\u00b2 /4 a.\n\nSo the equation for a(t) is:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 + ( (\u03b3 B)^2 /4 ) a = 0.\n\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2. \n\nTherefore, the solutions will be oscillatory with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment. Since the z-component of the moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Since Sz in the Sz basis is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2 (assuming units where \u0127=1 and S is in those units), the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 would be (1/2) |a(t)|\u00b2 - (1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, since the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9, so a(0)=1 and b(0)=0. Let's see the time evolution. Let me find a(t) and b(t).\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nLet me denote \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2.\n\nThen the equations become:\n\nda/dt = \u03c9 b,\n\ndb/dt = - \u03c9 a.\n\nWith initial conditions a(0)=1, b(0)=0.\n\nLet me solve this. Let's differentiate the first equation again to get the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = \u03c9 db/dt = \u03c9 (-\u03c9 a ) = - \u03c9\u00b2 a.\n\nWhich is the SHO equation as before. The solution is a(t) = cos(\u03c9 t), because when the second derivative is -\u03c9\u00b2 a, the solution is cosine (since a(0)=1, and da/dt at t=0 is \u03c9 b(0)=0, so the sine term is zero). \n\nThen, from da/dt = \u03c9 b,\n\nda/dt = -\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t) = \u03c9 b \u2192 b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nWait, because da/dt = \u03c9 b \u2192 -\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t) = \u03c9 b \u2192 b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nSo then, the expectation value of Sz is:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 - (1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2 + (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 - ... Wait, actually, in the basis where Sz is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2, the expectation value is (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 + (-1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)(a* a + b* b) ? Wait no, let me compute it properly. \n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nSince Sz in the basis is diagonal with entries 1/2 and -1/2, the expectation value is:\n\n(1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 + (-1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2.\n\nSince |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = 1 (probability conservation), this simplifies to:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)( |a|\u00b2 - |b|\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in a(t) and b(t):\n\na(t) = cos(\u03c9 t),\n\nb(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t),\n\nso |a|\u00b2 = cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t),\n\n|b|\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(\u03c9 t),\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)( cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t ) = (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t )\n\nBecause cos\u00b2 x - sin\u00b2 x = cos(2x).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz is oscillating with amplitude 1/2 and angular frequency 2\u03c9.\n\nWait, that's important. The frequency here is 2\u03c9, but \u03c9 was defined as \u03b3 B / 2. Therefore, the angular frequency of \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is 2*(\u03b3 B /2 ) = \u03b3 B. \n\nBut the question asks for the oscillation frequency. Angular frequency is usually \u03c9, but sometimes frequency is given as f = \u03c9/(2\u03c0). However, in physics problems like this, when they ask for frequency, they might mean angular frequency. Let me check the options. The options include gamma*B, which would be the angular frequency here. Let me recap:\n\nWe found that \u27e8Sz\u27e9 oscillates as (1/2) cos(2\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2. So the angular frequency of the oscillation is 2\u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The angular frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. The expectation value is (1/2) cos(2*(\u03b3 B / 2)*t) \u2192 cos( (\u03b3 B) t ). So the argument is \u03b3 B t, so angular frequency \u03c9_osc = \u03b3 B. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the oscillation frequency (angular) is \u03b3 B. The options have B) as gamma*B. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations. Let me check again the steps:\n\nThe equations were:\n\nda/dt = (\u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\ndb/dt = - (\u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nWe found a(t) = cos(\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2,\n\nthen b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nThen the expectation of Sz is (1/2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (1/2)(cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t) = (1/2) cos(2\u03c9 t).\n\nSo the oscillation is cos(2\u03c9 t), so the angular frequency is 2\u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the signs somewhere? Let's see. The Hamiltonian was H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The equations of motion came out as leading to a frequency of \u03b3 B. The options include that as B. So I think that's correct.\n\nHmm, another way to think about this is using the Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency for a spin-1/2 in a rotating field is given by the magnitude of the Hamiltonian's off-diagonal terms. The Rabi frequency is typically Omega = (H_xy)/\u0127, where H_xy is the strength of the transverse field. In this case, since the Hamiltonian has off-diagonal terms proportional to \u03b3 B / 2 (if we include the spin matrix factors), so the Rabi frequency would be Omega = (\u03b3 B / 2 * sqrt( (H12)^2 + (H21)^2 )) ? Wait, maybe not exactly, but in this case, the frequency of oscillation between the states is given by the magnitude of the off-diagonal terms.\n\nWait, the off-diagonal terms in H (H12 and H21) are (\u03b3 B i)/2 and - (\u03b3 B i)/2. The magnitude of those terms is (\u03b3 B)/2. So the Rabi frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B /2 )? Hmm, perhaps the Rabi frequency is Omega = sqrt( (Re(H12))^2 + (Im(H12))^2 ), but since H12 is purely imaginary, its magnitude is (\u03b3 B)/2. Then the Rabi frequency Omega is 2*(gamma B)/ (2) ? Wait, maybe I need to recall that for a two-level system with off-diagonal coupling H12, the Rabi frequency is Omega = 2*|H12| / \u0127. Since in our case, H12 has magnitude (gamma B)/2 (if we're using units where \u0127 is 1). Then Omega would be 2*(gamma B /2) = gamma B. So that matches the previous result. So yes, the Rabi frequency here is gamma B, which is the angular frequency of the oscillations. Hence the answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe spin-1/2 particle initially aligned with the +Z magnetic field is in the |\u2191z\u27e9 state.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin 1/2 particle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment when the magnetic field direction changes. Let me recall what I know about spin and magnetic fields.\n\nAlright, the particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz. Oh wait, right, the magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is proportional to the spin component. The spin operators are in terms of the Pauli matrices, I think. The original magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle is aligned with it. That means its spin is in the +z eigenstate, right? So initially, it's in the state |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nThen suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So the magnetic field now is in the Y direction. The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment starting to oscillate. We need to find the oscillation frequency.\n\nHmm, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is \u03b3*S, then H would be proportional to Sy? Wait, let me think again. The magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the interaction energy is -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is in the Y direction, that becomes H = -\u03b3 B Sy. But wait, the sign might matter here. Let me see. Let me write it as H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. \u03bc is \u03b3 Sz, but actually, wait, no, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S. So the total vector, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but the problem states that the initial magnetic field was in the +Z direction. The particle was aligned, so it was in the +z eigenstate. But when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H proportional to Sy. \n\nNow, the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian. The initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Since the Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B Sy (I need to confirm the sign again, but maybe the exact sign won't affect the frequency, just the phase). The key is to find the time evolution of the system and then compute the expectation value of Sz over time, since the question is about the z-component of the magnetic moment. The average of Sz will oscillate, and we need the frequency of that oscillation.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps I can write the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is H = \u03c9 Sy (with \u03c9 being some constant), then the time evolution operator is given by U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since we're dealing with spin-1/2, the operators can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me set \u0127 = 1 for simplicity here (since in the equations, the gamma might already account for it, but I should be careful).\n\nFirst, let me write the Hamiltonian properly. Let's see:\n\nThe original magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the interaction energy is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, S\u00b7B would be S_y * B. So H = - \u03b3 B S_y. The Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Let me write H = - \u03b3 B Sy. Let's note that Sy is the spin y operator. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b1 \u0127/2, but again, perhaps in units where \u0127 is included in gamma? Wait, the problem says mu = gamma * Sz. Wait, the standard form for the magnetic moment of a particle with spin is \u03bc = -\u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So perhaps H is given by H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Wait, maybe I had the sign wrong earlier. Let me check again.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. If \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H = - \u03b3 S \u00b7 B. So yes, that's correct. So when B is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B Sy. So that's the Hamiltonian. The time evolution will depend on this.\n\nNow, the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Since we have a Hamiltonian proportional to Sy, the state will evolve under Sy. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is proportional to an operator like Sy, which is off-diagonal in the Sz basis, the state will oscillate between the eigenstates of Sz. So the time evolution can be found by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with H = -\u03b3 B Sy.\n\nLet me write the Hamiltonian matrix in the Sz basis. The Sz eigenstates are |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9. The Sy operator in this basis is represented by the Pauli matrix \u03c3_y multiplied by \u0127/2. But maybe in the problem's units, they have already accounted for the factors, so perhaps the Sy matrix is just:\n\nSy has matrix elements in the Sz basis:\n\n[0, -i]\n[i, 0] multiplied by \u0127/2. Wait, but I need to confirm the exact form. Let me think in terms of Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo Sy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Therefore, H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. Wait, but the problem's expression for \u03bc is given as \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Hmm, perhaps the problem is using units where \u0127 is set to 1, so that \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, where Sz is in units of \u0127/2. Or maybe the gamma already includes the factors. This might complicate things, but perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy with a coefficient that will lead to the correct frequency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work in natural units where \u0127=1 and the spin operators are in units where S has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose that S is in units where S_z has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Then Sy has matrix elements [[0, -i/2],[i/2, 0]], but perhaps the exact matrix form isn't necessary here. Let me consider the time evolution of the state.\n\nThe initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. The Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution is given by the unitary operator U(t) = exp( -i H t / \u0127 ). But if we set \u0127 =1, then U(t) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B Sy) t ) = exp( i \u03b3 B Sy t ). \n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|\u2191z\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B Sy t ) |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nTo compute the expectation value of Sz(t), we need \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the equations of motion. Let me think in terms of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nThe state can be written as a combination of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a(t) |\u2191z\u27e9 + b(t) |\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in matrix form (in the Sz basis) is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. Let's write Sy in the Sz basis. The Sy operator in the Sz basis has components:\n\nSy |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2) |\u2193z\u27e9 i\nSy |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2) |\u2191z\u27e9 i\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, using the Pauli matrices. Let me recall that in the standard basis, Sy is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3y. So if we write in terms of operators:\n\nH = - \u03b3 B Sy = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. But perhaps the problem's units have \u03b3 already including the factors so that H = - \u03b3 B Sy, where Sy's eigenvalues are \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127 is included). Maybe I should just proceed with the algebra.\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is i\u0127 d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. Let me set \u0127=1 for simplicity, so:\n\ni d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me write H in the Sz basis. The matrix for Sy (assuming units where \u0127=1 and S has eigenvalues \u00b11/2) would be:\n\nSy = (1/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nTherefore, H = - \u03b3 B Sy = - \u03b3 B * (1/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\nSo the matrix elements of H are:\n\nH11 = 0, H12 = (\u03b3 B / 2) * i,\n\nH21 = - (\u03b3 B / 2)*i, H22 =0.\n\nWait, because multiplying the matrix:\n\nH = -\u03b3 B/2 * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo H12 = -\u03b3 B/2 * (-i) = (\u03b3 B/2)i ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-calculate:\n\nOriginal Sy matrix is (1/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]], so H = - \u03b3 B * Sy = - \u03b3 B (1/2) * [[0, -i],[i,0]].\n\nSo H's components are:\n\nH_{11} = 0,\n\nH_{12} = - \u03b3 B (1/2)*(-i) = (i \u03b3 B)/2,\n\nH_{21} = - \u03b3 B (1/2)*(i) = - (i \u03b3 B)/2,\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step.\n\nThe matrix for Sy is (1/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo when multiplied by -\u03b3 B, H is:\n\nH = - \u03b3 B * (Sy) = - \u03b3 B*(1/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nThus, each element:\n\nH11 = 0,\n\nH12 = - \u03b3 B*(1/2)*(-i) = (\u03b3 B i)/2,\n\nH21 = - \u03b3 B*(1/2)*(i) = - (\u03b3 B i)/2,\n\nH22 =0.\n\nSo H matrix is:\n\n[ 0 , (\u03b3 B i)/2 ]\n\n[ - (\u03b3 B i)/2 , 0 ]\n\nWait, no, actually the second element H21 would be -\u03b3 B/2 multiplied by the (2,1) element of Sy, which is i. So H21 = -\u03b3 B/2 * i.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just write H as:\n\nH = (\u03b3 B / 2i ) * [[0,1],[-1,0]] ?\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too bogged down. Let me proceed with the equations of motion.\n\nThe equations for a(t) and b(t) are:\n\ni da/dt = H_{11} a + H_{12} b = (H12) b,\n\nSimilarly, i db/dt = H_{21} a + H_{22} b = H_{21} a.\n\nFrom above, H_{12} is (\u03b3 B i)/2, and H_{21} is - (\u03b3 B i)/2.\n\nWait, but substituting the H matrix into the equations:\n\nWait, the equations are:\n\ni da/dt = H_{11} a + H_{12} b \u2192 i da/dt = (\u03b3 B i / 2 ) b,\n\nSimilarly, i db/dt = H_{21} a + H_{22} b \u2192 i db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B i / 2 ) a,\n\nSo let's write them out:\n\nEquation 1: i da/dt = ( \u03b3 B i / 2 ) b \u2192 da/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\nEquation 2: i db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B i / 2 ) a \u2192 db/dt = ( - \u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nSo we have a system of differential equations:\n\nda/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\ndb/dt = - ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nThis is similar to the equations for a two-level system under a transverse field. \n\nLet me try to find the solution. Let me note that these equations can be written as second-order equations. Differentiating the first equation again:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) db/dt = ( \u03b3 B / 2 ) ( - \u03b3 B / 2 a ) = - ( \u03b3 B )\u00b2 /4 a.\n\nSo the equation for a(t) is:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 + ( (\u03b3 B)^2 /4 ) a = 0.\n\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2. \n\nTherefore, the solutions will be oscillatory with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment. Since the z-component of the moment is \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, the expectation value \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. Since Sz in the Sz basis is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2 (assuming units where \u0127=1 and S is in those units), the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 would be (1/2) |a(t)|\u00b2 - (1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, since the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9, so a(0)=1 and b(0)=0. Let's see the time evolution. Let me find a(t) and b(t).\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nLet me denote \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2.\n\nThen the equations become:\n\nda/dt = \u03c9 b,\n\ndb/dt = - \u03c9 a.\n\nWith initial conditions a(0)=1, b(0)=0.\n\nLet me solve this. Let's differentiate the first equation again to get the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2a/dt\u00b2 = \u03c9 db/dt = \u03c9 (-\u03c9 a ) = - \u03c9\u00b2 a.\n\nWhich is the SHO equation as before. The solution is a(t) = cos(\u03c9 t), because when the second derivative is -\u03c9\u00b2 a, the solution is cosine (since a(0)=1, and da/dt at t=0 is \u03c9 b(0)=0, so the sine term is zero). \n\nThen, from da/dt = \u03c9 b,\n\nda/dt = -\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t) = \u03c9 b \u2192 b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nWait, because da/dt = \u03c9 b \u2192 -\u03c9 sin(\u03c9 t) = \u03c9 b \u2192 b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nSo then, the expectation value of Sz is:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 - (1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2 + (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 - ... Wait, actually, in the basis where Sz is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2, the expectation value is (1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 + (-1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2.\n\nSo \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)(a* a + b* b) ? Wait no, let me compute it properly. \n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nSince Sz in the basis is diagonal with entries 1/2 and -1/2, the expectation value is:\n\n(1/2)|a(t)|\u00b2 + (-1/2)|b(t)|\u00b2.\n\nSince |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = 1 (probability conservation), this simplifies to:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)( |a|\u00b2 - |b|\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in a(t) and b(t):\n\na(t) = cos(\u03c9 t),\n\nb(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t),\n\nso |a|\u00b2 = cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t),\n\n|b|\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(\u03c9 t),\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)( cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t ) = (1/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t )\n\nBecause cos\u00b2 x - sin\u00b2 x = cos(2x).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz is oscillating with amplitude 1/2 and angular frequency 2\u03c9.\n\nWait, that's important. The frequency here is 2\u03c9, but \u03c9 was defined as \u03b3 B / 2. Therefore, the angular frequency of \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is 2*(\u03b3 B /2 ) = \u03b3 B. \n\nBut the question asks for the oscillation frequency. Angular frequency is usually \u03c9, but sometimes frequency is given as f = \u03c9/(2\u03c0). However, in physics problems like this, when they ask for frequency, they might mean angular frequency. Let me check the options. The options include gamma*B, which would be the angular frequency here. Let me recap:\n\nWe found that \u27e8Sz\u27e9 oscillates as (1/2) cos(2\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2. So the angular frequency of the oscillation is 2\u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The angular frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine. The expectation value is (1/2) cos(2*(\u03b3 B / 2)*t) \u2192 cos( (\u03b3 B) t ). So the argument is \u03b3 B t, so angular frequency \u03c9_osc = \u03b3 B. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the oscillation frequency (angular) is \u03b3 B. The options have B) as gamma*B. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations. Let me check again the steps:\n\nThe equations were:\n\nda/dt = (\u03b3 B / 2 ) b,\n\ndb/dt = - (\u03b3 B / 2 ) a.\n\nWe found a(t) = cos(\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2,\n\nthen b(t) = - sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nThen the expectation of Sz is (1/2)(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (1/2)(cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t) = (1/2) cos(2\u03c9 t).\n\nSo the oscillation is cos(2\u03c9 t), so the angular frequency is 2\u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the signs somewhere? Let's see. The Hamiltonian was H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The equations of motion came out as leading to a frequency of \u03b3 B. The options include that as B. So I think that's correct.\n\nHmm, another way to think about this is using the Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency for a spin-1/2 in a rotating field is given by the magnitude of the Hamiltonian's off-diagonal terms. The Rabi frequency is typically Omega = (H_xy)/\u0127, where H_xy is the strength of the transverse field. In this case, since the Hamiltonian has off-diagonal terms proportional to \u03b3 B / 2 (if we include the spin matrix factors), so the Rabi frequency would be Omega = (\u03b3 B / 2 * sqrt( (H12)^2 + (H21)^2 )) ? Wait, maybe not exactly, but in this case, the frequency of oscillation between the states is given by the magnitude of the off-diagonal terms.\n\nWait, the off-diagonal terms in H (H12 and H21) are (\u03b3 B i)/2 and - (\u03b3 B i)/2. The magnitude of those terms is (\u03b3 B)/2. So the Rabi frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B /2 )? Hmm, perhaps the Rabi frequency is Omega = sqrt( (Re(H12))^2 + (Im(H12))^2 ), but since H12 is purely imaginary, its magnitude is (\u03b3 B)/2. Then the Rabi frequency Omega is 2*(gamma B)/ (2) ? Wait, maybe I need to recall that for a two-level system with off-diagonal coupling H12, the Rabi frequency is Omega = 2*|H12| / \u0127. Since in our case, H12 has magnitude (gamma B)/2 (if we're using units where \u0127 is 1). Then Omega would be 2*(gamma B /2) = gamma B. So that matches the previous result. So yes, the Rabi frequency here is gamma B, which is the angular frequency of the oscillations. Hence the answer is B.\n\n\nThe spin-1/2 particle initially aligned with the +Z magnetic field is in the |\u2191z\u27e9 state. When the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\). The time evolution of the state is governed by the equations derived from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Solving these equations shows that the expectation value of \\( S_z \\) oscillates with an angular frequency of \\( \\gamma B \\), as determined by the Rabi frequency from the off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian. \n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to work through this step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field direction is changed. \n\nAlright, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. The particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc which is given by \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz. Oh wait, right, \u03b3 here is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin component Sz is along the z-axis here. The initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with that field. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and a new field is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment's average.\n\nHmm, okay. When the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the system is now in a different Hamiltonian. Since the magnetic field direction changed, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian change too. The initial state was an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along Z), but now the new Hamiltonian will depend on Sy or something else? Wait, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is usually H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is proportional to Sz here, but actually, wait, the magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin vector. But in the problem statement, they say \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Wait, that might be specific here. Wait, maybe they are defining \u03bc along the z-component? Hmm, maybe that's a simplification. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the standard Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is proportional to the spin vector S, so H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. So if the magnetic field is along the z-axis initially, then H_initial = -\u03b3 B Sz. The particle is in an eigenstate of Sz with +1/2, since it's aligned with the field. Then when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_new = -\u03b3 B Sy, because the field is now along Y. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the new field is along +Y with same magnitude B. So the new Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03b3 B Sy? Wait, the direction is Y, so the dot product S\u00b7B would involve Sy component. Let me confirm the direction: B is along Y, so H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nNow, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let's denote the initial state as |+z\u27e9. When the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian. The question is about the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of the moment). \n\nTo find the average of Sz, we can write the time evolution of the state under H_new, then compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time. Let's see. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since H is proportional to Sy, let me write it as H = \u03c9 Sy, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B (but with a negative sign? Wait, let's see. H is -\u03b3 B Sy. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy, so H = -\u03c9 Sy where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Hmm, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03c9 Sy. \n\nWait, the time evolution would involve that. The state will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, we need to express |+z\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. Because the time evolution under Sy would cause the state to oscillate between the eigenstates of Sy. \n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are different from those of Sz. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me recall that the spin operators for different axes are related via rotations. For example, the eigenstates of Sy can be written in terms of the Sz basis. \n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The |+y\u27e9 state in terms of Sz basis is (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |-y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 multiplied by some phase factor? Wait, actually, the standard expressions for spin along y are a bit different. Let me think. The eigenstates of Sy are given by:\n\nSy |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 |+y\u27e9,\n\nSy |-y\u27e9 = -\u0127/2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in the Sz basis, the |+y\u27e9 state is (|+z\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c0} |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2? Wait, maybe better to recall that the Pauli matrices for Sy has eigenvalues \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127 is 1/2). The Pauli matrix for Sy is:\n\n\u03c3y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u00b11. The eigenvectors for Sy are (1, i)/\u221a2 for +1 and (1, -i)/\u221a2 for -1. So in terms of the Sz basis, |+y\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2, where |\u2191\u27e9 is |+z\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 is |-z\u27e9. Similarly, |-y\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2. \n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me write that as a column vector [1; 0]. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[1; i]\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[1; -i]\n\nSo to express |\u2191\u27e9 in terms of the Sy eigenbasis, we can write:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me think of the coefficients. Let me see, solving for |\u2191\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coefficients as:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\na*(1/\u221a2 [1; i]) + b*(1/\u221a2 [1; -i]) = [1; 0]\n\nSo the first component: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1\n\nThe second component: (a*i - b*i)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 (a - b)i /\u221a2 =0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nFrom first equation, 2a/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 \u2192 a = 1/\u221a2, so b = same. Therefore,\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (since the new H is proportional to Sy). Therefore, when the Hamiltonian is changed to H = -\u03b3 B Sy (assuming the units here are such that \u0127 is incorporated?), the time evolution will be such that the state evolves as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ |+y\u27e9 e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} + |-y\u27e9 e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} ]\n\nWhere E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 states. \n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Since Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2 (assuming units where \u0127 is part of the spin), but let me check the actual units here. The energy eigenvalues would be H acting on |+y\u27e9 gives -\u03b3 B Sy |+y\u27e9. Since Sy |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly for |-y\u27e9, Sy |-y\u27e9 = -\u0127/2 |-y\u27e9, so H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9 = + \u03b3 B \u0127/2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). \n\nTherefore, the time-dependent phase factors are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) = exp(-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B / 2) t )\n\nFor |-y\u27e9: exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) = exp(-i ( \u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B / 2) t )\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ |+y\u27e9 e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} + |-y\u27e9 e^{-i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t. \n\nFirst, let's express Sz in terms of the basis. Since Sz in the Sz basis is diagonal, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But perhaps we can compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 more directly by expanding the state in the Sz basis.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the state expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, maybe it's easier to express Sz in terms of those.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the expectation value by projecting onto the Sz basis.\n\nFirst, let me note that:\n\nSz |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9,\n\nSz |\u2193\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, we can write:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nSince |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, let me first write the state in terms of the Sz basis. Alternatively, let me use the expressions of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWe already have |+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 e^{-i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} ]\n\nFactor out the 1/\u221a2:\n\n= (1/2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t}\n\nSecond term: (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t}\n\nAdding them:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) + i |\u2193\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t})\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n(1/2)[ |\u2191\u27e9 ( 2 cos(\u03c9 t) ) + i |\u2193\u27e9 ( 2i sin(\u03c9 t) ) ]\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe first part for |\u2191\u27e9: e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2 cos(\u03c9 t).\n\nThe second part for |\u2193\u27e9: i [ e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] = i * 2i sin(\u03c9 t) = 2i^2 sin(\u03c9 t) = -2 sin(\u03c9 t). Because e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8, so multiplied by i gives i*(2i sin\u03b8) = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the state simplifies to:\n\n(1/2)[ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n= cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 \n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2.\n\nWait, let me check the math again. Let me re-calculate the coefficients.\n\nLet me re-express the terms step by step:\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\n(1/2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i|\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i|\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= (1/2)[ |\u2191\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + i |\u2193\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + |\u2191\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} - i |\u2193\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nNow, group terms:\n\nFor |\u2191\u27e9: [e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}] = 2 cos(\u03c9 t)\n\nFor |\u2193\u27e9: i e^{i \u03c9 t} - i e^{-i \u03c9 t} = i [ e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] = i ( 2i sin(\u03c9 t) ) = 2i^2 sin(\u03c9 t) = -2 sin(\u03c9 t)\n\nSo putting together:\n\n(1/2)[ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nWhich simplifies to cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nOkay, so that's the state. Now, to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, we can note that Sz acts on |\u2191\u27e9 as (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9, and on |\u2193\u27e9 as (-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, let's write \u27e8\u03c8(t)| as the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. \n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is:\n\ncos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\nSo the conjugate transpose (bra) is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2193| \n\nBut since the basis is orthonormal, \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1, \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9=1, etc. \n\nSo, \n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = [cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2193| ] Sz [ cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me compute this term by term. Let me denote Sz |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9, and Sz |\u2193\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nSo, expanding the product:\n\nFirst term: cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| Sz cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t) \u27e8\u2191| (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t) *1 \n\nSecond term: cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| Sz [ - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 ] \n\n= - cos(\u03c9 t) sin(\u03c9 t) \u27e8\u2191| ( - \u0127/2 |\u2193\u27e9 ) \n\nWait, no. Let me do each term properly.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nThe first part is Sz acting on the state:\n\nSz applied to |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is Sz [cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9] \n\n= cos(\u03c9t) Sz |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t) Sz |\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= cos(\u03c9t)(\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)(-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2)[ cos(\u03c9t) |\u2191\u27e9 + sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nThen, the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| multiplied by that:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| ] * [ (\u0127/2)( cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 + sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 ) ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t)\n\nSecond term: cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| * (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t) sin(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0, since \u2191 and \u2193 are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t) cos(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = 0 again.\n\nFourth term: - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)\n\nSo adding all terms together:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) \n\n= (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t )\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03c9t) using the double-angle identity cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03c9t). \n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of this average. The cosine function has an argument of 2\u03c9t, so the angular frequency is 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was defined as \u03b3 B / 2 (since \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2), substituting:\n\nAngular frequency = 2*(\u03b3 B / 2) = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because angular frequency is \u03c9_angular = 2\u03c9. Wait, in my calculation, I had \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2, so 2\u03c9 would be \u03b3 B, which is the angular frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency. Since frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0), but the options are given in terms of \u03b3 B, so they must be using angular frequency. The options include gamma*B as option B. The problem says \"oscillation frequency\", but in physics, when they ask for frequency in such contexts (like Larmor frequency), it's often the angular frequency. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.\n\nWait but let me make sure. Let me retrace steps. \n\nWait, the angular frequency of cos(2\u03c9t) is 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was (\u03b3 B)/2, so 2*(\u03b3 B/2) = \u03b3 B. So yes, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. The initial B is along +Z, so H_initial = - \u03b3 Sz B_z. Since Sz is along Z, that's correct. Then, when B is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_new = - \u03b3 Sz * B_y? Wait no, wait the B is along Y now. Wait, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is now along Y, S\u00b7B is Sy B (since B is along Y). So H_new = - \u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSo when I calculated the eigenvalues, that's correct. The eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Then, the phases in the time evolution are proportional to (E t)/\u0127. So for |+y\u27e9, the energy is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the phase is -i (E t)/\u0127 = -i (- \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t)/\u0127 = +i (\u03b3 B / 2) t. Similarly for the other term. So that's correct. \n\nThus, the angular frequency comes out to be \u03b3 B. So the answer is B. \n\nAnother way: perhaps using the time evolution operator. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The energy eigenvalues are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2). The difference between the eigenvalues is \u03b3 B \u0127. The oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference by \u03c9 = (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. Wait, the difference between the two eigenvalues is E_+ - E_- = [ -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ] - [ \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ] = - \u03b3 B \u0127. The absolute difference is \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency (angular) is (\u0394E)/\u0127 = (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. Which matches the previous result. So that's another way to see it. The frequency is the energy splitting divided by \u0127. So yes, the answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to work through this step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field direction is changed. \n\nAlright, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. The particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc which is given by \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz. Oh wait, right, \u03b3 here is the gyromagnetic ratio. The spin component Sz is along the z-axis here. The initial magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with that field. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and a new field is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment's average.\n\nHmm, okay. When the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the system is now in a different Hamiltonian. Since the magnetic field direction changed, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian change too. The initial state was an eigenstate of Sz (since the field was along Z), but now the new Hamiltonian will depend on Sy or something else? Wait, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is usually H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is proportional to Sz here, but actually, wait, the magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin vector. But in the problem statement, they say \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Wait, that might be specific here. Wait, maybe they are defining \u03bc along the z-component? Hmm, maybe that's a simplification. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the standard Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is proportional to the spin vector S, so H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. So if the magnetic field is along the z-axis initially, then H_initial = -\u03b3 B Sz. The particle is in an eigenstate of Sz with +1/2, since it's aligned with the field. Then when the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_new = -\u03b3 B Sy, because the field is now along Y. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says the new field is along +Y with same magnitude B. So the new Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03b3 B Sy? Wait, the direction is Y, so the dot product S\u00b7B would involve Sy component. Let me confirm the direction: B is along Y, so H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nNow, the initial state was an eigenstate of Sz. Let's denote the initial state as |+z\u27e9. When the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian. The question is about the time dependence of the expectation value of Sz (the z-component of the moment). \n\nTo find the average of Sz, we can write the time evolution of the state under H_new, then compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time. Let's see. Let me recall that when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). But since H is proportional to Sy, let me write it as H = \u03c9 Sy, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B (but with a negative sign? Wait, let's see. H is -\u03b3 B Sy. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy, so H = -\u03c9 Sy where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Hmm, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03c9 Sy. \n\nWait, the time evolution would involve that. The state will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, we need to express |+z\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. Because the time evolution under Sy would cause the state to oscillate between the eigenstates of Sy. \n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are different from those of Sz. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me recall that the spin operators for different axes are related via rotations. For example, the eigenstates of Sy can be written in terms of the Sz basis. \n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The |+y\u27e9 state in terms of Sz basis is (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, and |-y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 multiplied by some phase factor? Wait, actually, the standard expressions for spin along y are a bit different. Let me think. The eigenstates of Sy are given by:\n\nSy |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 |+y\u27e9,\n\nSy |-y\u27e9 = -\u0127/2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in the Sz basis, the |+y\u27e9 state is (|+z\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c0} |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2? Wait, maybe better to recall that the Pauli matrices for Sy has eigenvalues \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127 is 1/2). The Pauli matrix for Sy is:\n\n\u03c3y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u00b11. The eigenvectors for Sy are (1, i)/\u221a2 for +1 and (1, -i)/\u221a2 for -1. So in terms of the Sz basis, |+y\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2, where |\u2191\u27e9 is |+z\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 is |-z\u27e9. Similarly, |-y\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2. \n\nSo the initial state is |\u2191\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9. Let me write that as a column vector [1; 0]. The eigenstates of Sy are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[1; i]\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[1; -i]\n\nSo to express |\u2191\u27e9 in terms of the Sy eigenbasis, we can write:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me think of the coefficients. Let me see, solving for |\u2191\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the coefficients as:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\na*(1/\u221a2 [1; i]) + b*(1/\u221a2 [1; -i]) = [1; 0]\n\nSo the first component: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1\n\nThe second component: (a*i - b*i)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 (a - b)i /\u221a2 =0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nFrom first equation, 2a/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 \u2192 a = 1/\u221a2, so b = same. Therefore,\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the initial state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (since the new H is proportional to Sy). Therefore, when the Hamiltonian is changed to H = -\u03b3 B Sy (assuming the units here are such that \u0127 is incorporated?), the time evolution will be such that the state evolves as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ |+y\u27e9 e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} + |-y\u27e9 e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} ]\n\nWhere E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H for the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 states. \n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. Since Sy has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2 (assuming units where \u0127 is part of the spin), but let me check the actual units here. The energy eigenvalues would be H acting on |+y\u27e9 gives -\u03b3 B Sy |+y\u27e9. Since Sy |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) |+y\u27e9. Similarly for |-y\u27e9, Sy |-y\u27e9 = -\u0127/2 |-y\u27e9, so H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) |-y\u27e9 = + \u03b3 B \u0127/2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, so the eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). \n\nTherefore, the time-dependent phase factors are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127) = exp(-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i (\u03b3 B / 2) t )\n\nFor |-y\u27e9: exp(-i E_- t / \u0127) = exp(-i ( \u03b3 B \u0127/2 ) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B / 2) t )\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ |+y\u27e9 e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} + |-y\u27e9 e^{-i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t. \n\nFirst, let's express Sz in terms of the basis. Since Sz in the Sz basis is diagonal, with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But perhaps we can compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 more directly by expanding the state in the Sz basis.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the state expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, maybe it's easier to express Sz in terms of those.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the expectation value by projecting onto the Sz basis.\n\nFirst, let me note that:\n\nSz |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9,\n\nSz |\u2193\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nBut to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, we can write:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nSince |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, let me first write the state in terms of the Sz basis. Alternatively, let me use the expressions of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nWe already have |+y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 e^{i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9)/\u221a2 e^{-i (\u03b3 B / 2) t} ]\n\nFactor out the 1/\u221a2:\n\n= (1/2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (|\u2191\u27e9 + i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t}\n\nSecond term: (|\u2191\u27e9 - i |\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t}\n\nAdding them:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) + i |\u2193\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t})\n\nSo the state becomes:\n\n(1/2)[ |\u2191\u27e9 ( 2 cos(\u03c9 t) ) + i |\u2193\u27e9 ( 2i sin(\u03c9 t) ) ]\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe first part for |\u2191\u27e9: e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2 cos(\u03c9 t).\n\nThe second part for |\u2193\u27e9: i [ e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] = i * 2i sin(\u03c9 t) = 2i^2 sin(\u03c9 t) = -2 sin(\u03c9 t). Because e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8, so multiplied by i gives i*(2i sin\u03b8) = -2 sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the state simplifies to:\n\n(1/2)[ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n= cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 \n\nSo the state at time t is |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2.\n\nWait, let me check the math again. Let me re-calculate the coefficients.\n\nLet me re-express the terms step by step:\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\n(1/2)[ (|\u2191\u27e9 + i|\u2193\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191\u27e9 - i|\u2193\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= (1/2)[ |\u2191\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + i |\u2193\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + |\u2191\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} - i |\u2193\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nNow, group terms:\n\nFor |\u2191\u27e9: [e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}] = 2 cos(\u03c9 t)\n\nFor |\u2193\u27e9: i e^{i \u03c9 t} - i e^{-i \u03c9 t} = i [ e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] = i ( 2i sin(\u03c9 t) ) = 2i^2 sin(\u03c9 t) = -2 sin(\u03c9 t)\n\nSo putting together:\n\n(1/2)[ 2 cos(\u03c9 t) |\u2191\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03c9 t) |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nWhich simplifies to cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nOkay, so that's the state. Now, to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, we can note that Sz acts on |\u2191\u27e9 as (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9, and on |\u2193\u27e9 as (-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, let's write \u27e8\u03c8(t)| as the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. \n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is:\n\ncos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\nSo the conjugate transpose (bra) is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2193| \n\nBut since the basis is orthonormal, \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 =1, \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9=1, etc. \n\nSo, \n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = [cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2193| ] Sz [ cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me compute this term by term. Let me denote Sz |\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9, and Sz |\u2193\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\nSo, expanding the product:\n\nFirst term: cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| Sz cos(\u03c9 t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t) \u27e8\u2191| (\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9 t) *1 \n\nSecond term: cos(\u03c9 t)\u27e8\u2191| Sz [ - sin(\u03c9 t)|\u2193\u27e9 ] \n\n= - cos(\u03c9 t) sin(\u03c9 t) \u27e8\u2191| ( - \u0127/2 |\u2193\u27e9 ) \n\nWait, no. Let me do each term properly.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nThe first part is Sz acting on the state:\n\nSz applied to |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is Sz [cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9] \n\n= cos(\u03c9t) Sz |\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t) Sz |\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= cos(\u03c9t)(\u0127/2)|\u2191\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)(-\u0127/2)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2)[ cos(\u03c9t) |\u2191\u27e9 + sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nThen, the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| multiplied by that:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| ] * [ (\u0127/2)( cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 + sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 ) ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t)\n\nSecond term: cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191| * (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t) sin(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0, since \u2191 and \u2193 are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t) cos(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = 0 again.\n\nFourth term: - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193| * (\u0127/2) sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)\n\nSo adding all terms together:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - (\u0127/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) \n\n= (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2 \u03c9t - sin\u00b2 \u03c9t )\n\nWhich simplifies to (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03c9t) using the double-angle identity cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(2\u03c9t). \n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of this average. The cosine function has an argument of 2\u03c9t, so the angular frequency is 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was defined as \u03b3 B / 2 (since \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2), substituting:\n\nAngular frequency = 2*(\u03b3 B / 2) = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because angular frequency is \u03c9_angular = 2\u03c9. Wait, in my calculation, I had \u03c9 = \u03b3 B / 2, so 2\u03c9 would be \u03b3 B, which is the angular frequency. The question asks for the oscillation frequency. Since frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0), but the options are given in terms of \u03b3 B, so they must be using angular frequency. The options include gamma*B as option B. The problem says \"oscillation frequency\", but in physics, when they ask for frequency in such contexts (like Larmor frequency), it's often the angular frequency. So the answer would be B) gamma*B.\n\nWait but let me make sure. Let me retrace steps. \n\nWait, the angular frequency of cos(2\u03c9t) is 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was (\u03b3 B)/2, so 2*(\u03b3 B/2) = \u03b3 B. So yes, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3 Sz. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. The initial B is along +Z, so H_initial = - \u03b3 Sz B_z. Since Sz is along Z, that's correct. Then, when B is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_new = - \u03b3 Sz * B_y? Wait no, wait the B is along Y now. Wait, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is now along Y, S\u00b7B is Sy B (since B is along Y). So H_new = - \u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSo when I calculated the eigenvalues, that's correct. The eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Then, the phases in the time evolution are proportional to (E t)/\u0127. So for |+y\u27e9, the energy is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the phase is -i (E t)/\u0127 = -i (- \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t)/\u0127 = +i (\u03b3 B / 2) t. Similarly for the other term. So that's correct. \n\nThus, the angular frequency comes out to be \u03b3 B. So the answer is B. \n\nAnother way: perhaps using the time evolution operator. The Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The energy eigenvalues are \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2). The difference between the eigenvalues is \u03b3 B \u0127. The oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference by \u03c9 = (E_2 - E_1)/\u0127. Wait, the difference between the two eigenvalues is E_+ - E_- = [ -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 ] - [ \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 ] = - \u03b3 B \u0127. The absolute difference is \u03b3 B \u0127. So the frequency (angular) is (\u0394E)/\u0127 = (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. Which matches the previous result. So that's another way to see it. The frequency is the energy splitting divided by \u0127. So yes, the answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\). The initial state \\( |+z\\rangle \\) is expressed in the eigenbasis of \\( S_y \\), leading to time evolution governed by the new Hamiltonian. The expectation value of \\( S_z \\) oscillates due to the superposition of eigenstates of \\( S_y \\). \n\nThe eigenvalues of \\( H \\) are \\( \\pm \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2} \\), resulting in an energy difference \\( \\Delta E = \\gamma B \\hbar \\). The oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is given by \\( \\omega = \\Delta E / \\hbar = \\gamma B \\). This matches option B.\n\nAnswer: B",
