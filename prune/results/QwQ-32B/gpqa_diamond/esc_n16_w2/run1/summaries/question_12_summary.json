      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 for the pion and 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2 for the muon. Hmm, right, since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nI remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum conservation apply. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c\u00b2. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since neutrinos are massless (or at least very light, so we can approximate their mass as zero?), their energy is just pc, where p is their momentum. \n\nWait, but the muon does have rest mass. So the energy of the muon will be gamma * m_mu * c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But how do I set this up?\n\nLet me write down the conservation laws. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's momentum as p', but since they must be opposite, p' = -p (so their magnitudes are equal). \n\nTotal momentum after decay must be zero. So the vector sum of the muon's momentum and the neutrino's momentum must cancel out. Since they are in opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal. Therefore, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.\n\nNow, for energy conservation: The total energy of the pion (which is at rest) is m_pi c\u00b2. This must equal the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The energy of the muon is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p_nu c (since its mass is negligible). Since p_mu and p_nu have the same magnitude, let's call that p. So the equation becomes:\n\nm_pi c\u00b2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) + p c\n\nHmm, that's the key equation here. Let's denote variables in terms of MeV since the masses are given in MeV/c\u00b2. Let me drop the c's for simplicity (since they are constants and can be factored out, but maybe I need to be careful with units here. Alternatively, using natural units where c=1, but maybe I can proceed with algebra).\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\nm_pi = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + p \n\nBecause if I divide both sides by c\u00b2, then m_pi is the rest mass energy divided by c\u00b2, but maybe I need to think in terms of energy. Wait, perhaps better to use energy units. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, let me think in terms of units where c=1. Then, energy is in MeV, mass is in MeV/c\u00b2, so when c=1, mass is MeV. So the pion's energy is m_pi = 139.6 MeV. The muon's energy is sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p (since E=pc for massless particles). So the equation is:\n\n139.6 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p\n\nI need to solve for p here. Let's call the muon mass m_mu = 105.7, pion mass m_pi = 139.6.\n\nLet me set up the equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi\n\nLet me denote m_mu as m and m_pi as M for shorthand.\n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) + p = M\n\nLet me isolate the sqrt term:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = M - p\n\nNow square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m\u00b2 = (M - p)^2 = M\u00b2 - 2Mp + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2Mp\n\nThen rearrange:\n\n2Mp = M\u00b2 - m\u00b2\n\nSo p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2M)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM = 139.6, m =105.7\n\nCalculate numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nHmm, that's a difference of squares, so (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n139.6 -105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 +105.7 = 245.3\n\nMultiply those: 33.9 *245.3. Let me compute that.\n\n33 * 245 = 33*200=6600, 33*45=1485 \u2192 total 8085. Then 0.9*245.3 = 220.77. So total 8085 + 220.77 = 8305.77?\n\nWait, but wait, 33.9 * 245.3:\n\nAlternatively, 33.9 *245.3 = (34 -0.1)*(245 +0.3) = 34*245 +34*0.3 -0.1*245 -0.1*0.3\n\n34*245: 30*245=7350, 4*245=980 \u2192 total 8330. 34*0.3=10.2, 0.1*245=24.5, 0.03. So:\n\n34*245.3 = 34*245 +34*0.3 = 8330 +10.2 = 8340.2\n\nSubtract (0.1)*(245.3) \u2192 24.53 and add the last term? Wait, no, maybe my approach is complicating.\n\nAlternatively, 33.9 * 245.3:\n\nLet me compute 33 *245.3 = 33*(200 +45.3) = 33*200=6600, 33*45.3 = 1494.9 \u2192 total 6600 +1494.9= 8094.9\n\nThen 0.9 *245.3 = 220.77. So total 8094.9 +220.77 = 8315.67\n\nSo numerator is approximately 8315.67 (MeV^2?)\n\nDenominator is 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo p = 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let's compute this division.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, approximate:\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 - (8376 -8315.67)/279.2 per unit.\n\nWait, 279.2 *29.7 \u2248 ?\n\nAlternatively, 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let's see:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8\n\nHmm, 29 gives 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67.\n\nThe difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.\n\nSo 279.2 * x = 218.87 \u2192 x \u2248 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 ~0.784\n\nSo total p \u224829 +0.784 \u224829.784?\n\nWait, that can't be right because 279.2 *29.784 \u2248 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should do this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, 8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nLet me write it as 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 (8315.67 /279.2) \u2248 let's approximate 279.2 * 30 =8376, which is 60 more than 8315.67. So 30 - (60/279.2) \u2248 30 - 0.215 \u224829.785. So p \u224829.785 MeV/c ?\n\nWait, but the units here. Since in our units (c=1), the momentum p is in MeV/c. Wait, but when we set c=1, the units are a bit different, but since the mass terms are in MeV/c\u00b2, but with c=1, mass is in MeV. Hmm, maybe the momentum here is in MeV/c units? Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, when using natural units where c=1, energy and mass are in the same units (MeV). Momentum would be in MeV/c, but since c=1, it's MeV. Wait, maybe that's getting confusing. Let me just proceed with the numbers as given.\n\nSo p \u224829.785 MeV/c? Let's see.\n\nWait, but the neutrino's energy is p*c (since E=pc for massless), so in our units where c=1, that's just p. So the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\nWait, let's compute the muon's energy first. The muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2). Let me plug in p \u224829.785.\n\nCompute p squared: (29.785)^2 \u2248 (30 -0.215)^2 \u2248900 - 2*30*0.215 +0.215\u00b2 \u2248900 -12.9 +0.046 \u2248887.15. Hmm, so p\u00b2 \u2248 29.785\u00b2 \u2248 let me compute more accurately.\n\n29.785 squared:\n\n29 squared is 841, 0.785 squared is ~0.616, and cross term 2*29*0.785 =45.77. So total (29 +0.785)^2 = 29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.785 +0.785\u00b2 = 841 +45.77 +0.616 \u2248887.386.\n\nThen adding m_mu squared: (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, cross term 2*100*5.7 =1140. So total (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo p squared + m_mu squared is 887.386 +11172.49 \u224812059.876.\n\nTaking the square root of that gives sqrt(12059.876). Let's see, sqrt(12059) \u2248 110 (since 110\u00b2=12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8 or so). Let's compute 109.8 squared: (110 -0.2)^2 =12100 -44 +0.04 = 12056.04. That's close. 109.8^2=12056.04, which is 3.83 less than 12059.876. So sqrt(12059.876) \u2248109.8 + (3.83)/(2*109.8) \u2248 ~109.8 +0.0175 \u2248109.82.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.82 MeV. Then the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.785 MeV. \n\nAdding those together: 109.82 +29.785 \u2248139.6, which matches the pion's rest mass. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy. The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.82 -105.7 \u22484.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino has no rest mass, so its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, which is p \u224829.785 MeV. Wait, but the options given have the neutrino's KE as the second number? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu\". The options list pairs, like A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV. So first number is muon's KE, second is neutrino's KE? Yes, probably.\n\nSo according to this calculation, the muon's KE is ~4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is ~29.8 MeV. Looking at the options, that's option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the neutrino's energy. The neutrino's energy is p (since E=pc with c=1), which we found as approximately 29.785, so 29.8 MeV. That matches. So the answer is D.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I made any calculation errors. Let me recalculate p again. The formula was p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2M). Plugging in numbers:\n\nM =139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM squared: 139.6^2. Let's compute that:\n\n140^2 is 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and cross term?\n\nWait, (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16. So 139.6^2 = 19488.16.\n\nm squared: 105.7^2. Let's compute that again. 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, cross term 2*105*0.7 =147. So (105 +0.7)^2 =11025 +147 +0.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo M\u00b2 -m\u00b2 =19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67. \n\nDivide by 2M which is 2*139.6=279.2.\n\n8315.67 /279.2: Let me do this division more accurately.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.7 = 279.2*(30-0.3) = 279.2\u00d730=8376 minus 279.2\u00d70.3=83.76 \u2192 8376-83.76=8292.24. \n\nThe numerator is 8315.67. The difference between 8315.67 and 8292.24 is 23.43. \n\nSo 279.2 \u00d70.084 \u224823.43 (since 279.2 *0.08=22.336, 279.2*0.004=1.1168 \u2192 total 23.4528). \n\nSo total p is 29.7 +0.084 \u224829.784. So p\u224829.784. So the neutrino's KE is ~29.784, which rounds to 29.8. \n\nMuon's KE is 109.82 -105.7 =4.12, exactly as before. So that's D. \n\nSo the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. Option D is 4.12 and 29.8. Yep, that matches. \n\nI think that's correct.\n",

So 30 - (60/279.2) \u2248 30 - 0.215 \u224829.785. So p \u224829.785 MeV/c ?\n\nWait, but the units here. Since in our units (c=1), the momentum p is in MeV/c. Wait, but when we set c=1, the units are a bit different, but since the mass terms are in MeV/c\u00b2, but with c=1, mass is in MeV. Hmm, maybe the momentum here is in MeV/c units? Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, when using natural units where c=1, energy and mass are in the same units (MeV). Momentum would be in MeV/c, but since c=1, it's MeV. Wait, maybe that's getting confusing. Let me just proceed with the numbers as given.\n\nSo p \u224829.785 MeV/c? Let's see.\n\nWait, but the neutrino's energy is p*c (since E=pc for massless), so in our units where c=1, that's just p. So the neutrino's energy is p, and the muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2).\n\nWait, let's compute the muon's energy first. The muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2). Let me plug in p \u224829.785.\n\nCompute p squared: (29.785)^2 \u2248 (30 -0.215)^2 \u2248900 - 2*30*0.215 +0.215\u00b2 \u2248900 -12.9 +0.046 \u2248887.15. Hmm, so p\u00b2 \u2248 29.785\u00b2 \u2248 let me compute more accurately.\n\n29.785 squared:\n\n29 squared is 841, 0.785 squared is ~0.616, and cross term 2*29*0.785 =45.77. So total (29 +0.785)^2 = 29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.785 +0.785\u00b2 = 841 +45.77 +0.616 \u2248887.386.\n\nThen adding m_mu squared: (105.7)^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, cross term 2*100*5.7 =1140. So total (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo p squared + m_mu squared is 887.386 +11172.49 \u224812059.876.\n\nTaking the square root of that gives sqrt(12059.876). Let's see, sqrt(12059) \u2248 110 (since 110\u00b2=12100, so sqrt(12059) is a bit less, like 109.8 or so). Let's compute 109.8 squared: (110 -0.2)^2 =12100 -44 +0.04 = 12056.04. That's close. 109.8^2=12056.04, which is 3.83 less than 12059.876. So sqrt(12059.876) \u2248109.8 + (3.83)/(2*109.8) \u2248 ~109.8 +0.0175 \u2248109.82.\n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.82 MeV. Then the neutrino's energy is p \u224829.785 MeV. \n\nAdding those together: 109.82 +29.785 \u2248139.6, which matches the pion's rest mass. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy. The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.82 -105.7 \u22484.12 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino has no rest mass, so its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, which is p \u224829.785 MeV. Wait, but the options given have the neutrino's KE as the second number? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu\". The options list pairs, like A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV. So first number is muon's KE, second is neutrino's KE? Yes, probably.\n\nSo according to this calculation, the muon's KE is ~4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's is ~29.8 MeV. Looking at the options, that's option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the neutrino's energy. The neutrino's energy is p (since E=pc with c=1), which we found as approximately 29.785, so 29.8 MeV. That matches. So the answer is D.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I made any calculation errors. Let me recalculate p again. The formula was p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2M). Plugging in numbers:\n\nM =139.6, m=105.7.\n\nM squared: 139.6^2. Let's compute that:\n\n140^2 is 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and cross term?\n\nWait, (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16. So 139.6^2 = 19488.16.\n\nm squared: 105.7^2. Let's compute that again. 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, cross term 2*105*0.7 =147. So (105 +0.7)^2 =11025 +147 +0.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo M\u00b2 -m\u00b2 =19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67. \n\nDivide by 2M which is 2*139.6=279.2.\n\n8315.67 /279.2: Let me do this division more accurately.\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29.7 = 279.2*(30-0.3) = 279.2\u00d730=8376 minus 279.2\u00d70.3=83.76 \u2192 8376-83.76=8292.24. \n\nThe numerator is 8315.67. The difference between 8315.67 and 8292.24 is 23.43. \n\nSo 279.2 \u00d70.084 \u224823.43 (since 279.2 *0.08=22.336, 279.2*0.004=1.1168 \u2192 total 23.4528). \n\nSo total p is 29.7 +0.084 \u224829.784. So p\u224829.784. So the neutrino's KE is ~29.784, which rounds to 29.8. \n\nMuon's KE is 109.82 -105.7 =4.12, exactly as before. So that's D. \n\nSo the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. Option D is 4.12 and 29.8. Yep, that matches. \n\nI think that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion (\\(\\Pi^+\\) \u2192 \\(\\mu^+\\) + \\(\\nu\\)), we use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero, implying the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. Let \\(m_\\Pi = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2\\) and \\(m_\\mu = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2\\). \n\nThe total energy conservation equation is:\n\\[\nm_\\Pi c^2 = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_\\mu c^2)^2} + p c\n\\]\nUsing natural units (\\(c = 1\\)), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n139.6 = \\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p\n\\]\nIsolating the square root and squaring both sides:\n\\[\n(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n139.6^2 - 2 \\cdot 139.6 \\cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2\n\\]\n\\[\n139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 \\cdot 139.6 \\cdot p\n\\]\nSolving for \\(p\\):\n\\[\np = \\frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \\cdot 139.6} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}/c\n\\]\nThe muon's kinetic energy (KE) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n\\[\n\\text{KE}_\\mu = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_\\mu^2} - m_\\mu \\approx 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy equals its total energy (\\(E_\\nu = p\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{KE}_\\nu \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 29.8 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\nThus, the correct answer is **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, and I know their rest masses. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nThe rest mass of the pion (Pi+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, and the muon (mu+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? Because neutrinos have very small masses, so maybe we can treat it as massless here. Wait, but even if it's massless, its energy and momentum still have to be considered. Hmm.\n\nThe decay equation is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy of the system is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c\u00b2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (since the masses are given in MeV, which is energy units), the total energy is just 139.6 MeV. \n\nThe total energy must be conserved. So the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should equal 139.6 MeV. Also, their momenta must cancel each other out. Since the neutrino is massless (or very light), its energy is just pc (but again, using units where c=1, so E = p for the neutrino). \n\nLet me denote variables. Let\u2019s let the momentum of the muon be p. Since momentum must cancel, the neutrino's momentum must be -p (opposite direction), but since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal. The energy of the muon will be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ), but again with c=1 units, that's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). The neutrino's energy is p (since E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c^4, and m is zero, so E = pc). \n\nSo total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi (since the pion's rest energy is the total). \n\nWait, but m_pi here is 139.6 MeV. Let me write the equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nI need to solve for p here. Let's denote m_mu = 105.7 and m_pi = 139.6. \n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me call the muon's energy E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), and the neutrino's energy E_nu = p. So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.\n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi.\n\nHmm, how do I solve this equation for p? Maybe I can isolate the square root term first. Let's subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p\n\nNow square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2\n\nExpand the right side: (m_pi)^2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nThe p\u00b2 terms cancel out. Subtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2\n\nSo p = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Alternatively, factor it as (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). That might be easier.\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nMultiply them: 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 30 * 245.3 = 7359\n\nThen 3.9 * 245.3 = let's see 3*245.3 = 735.9, plus 0.9*245.3=220.77, total 735.9 + 220.77 = 956.67\n\nSo total numerator is 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first part was 30*245.3=7359? Wait 30 *245 is 7350, plus 30*0.3 is 9, so yes 7359. But 3.9 is 3 +0.9, so 3.9 *245.3 is indeed 3*245.3 plus 0.9*245.3. \n\nWait, but 33.9 *245.3 = (30 +3.9)*245.3 = 30*245.3 + 3.9*245.3. So yes, that gives 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nAlternatively, 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute 33 *245.3 = 33*(200+45.3) = 33*200=6600 + 33*45.3. \n\n33*45 = 1485, 33*0.3=9.9 \u2192 total 1485+9.9=1494.9 \u2192 total 6600+1494.9=8094.9. Then 0.9 *245.3 = 220.77, so total is 8094.9 +220.77= 8315.67. \n\nYes, so numerator is 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nDenominator is 2 * m_pi = 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 100 first to make it easier: 83156.7 / 2792 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, 2792 * 30 = 83,760. But 83,156.7 is less than that. \n\nWait, 2792 * 29.75 \u2248 ?\n\n2792 * 30 = 83,760. Subtract 2792 *0.25 (which is 698) \u2192 83,760 - 698 = 83,062. That's close to 83,156.7. So approximately 29.75?\n\nWait, but this is in terms of (MeV squared) divided by (MeV), so the units would be MeV, which is correct for momentum (since energy is MeV, and momentum in natural units is MeV/c, but since we're using units where c=1, it's just MeV). \n\nWait, but let me recast the calculation:\n\nWait, numerator is 8315.67 (MeV^2) divided by 279.2 (MeV) gives p \u2248 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let me do this division.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8,376\n\nBut the numerator is 8,315.67. So 30 would give 8,376 which is a bit higher. The difference is 8,376 -8,315.67 = 60.33. So subtract 60.33 /279.2 \u2248 0.216. So 30 -0.216 \u2248 29.784 MeV. \n\nSo p \u2248 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait, but let me check with calculator steps:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 10: 831.567 / 27.92. Let's see 27.92*30 = 837.6, which is again a bit over. \n\nAlternatively, 27.92 *29.7 = 27.92*(30-0.3) = 27.92*30 = 837.6 minus 27.92*0.3 = 8.376 \u2192 837.6 -8.376 = 829.224. \n\nThe numerator is 831.567, so 829.224 is 831.567 -829.224 = 2.343 less. So 29.7 + (2.343 /27.92). \n\n2.343/27.92 \u2248 0.084. So total is approx 29.784. So p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nSo the momentum of the muon is approximately 29.78 MeV/c (but since units are in natural units, just 29.78 MeV). \n\nNow, let's find the energy of the muon. The energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let's compute that.\n\np\u00b2 = (29.78)^2 \u2248 29.78 *29.78. Let's compute 30\u00b2 is 900, subtract 0.22*30*2 + (0.22)^2. Wait, maybe easier to compute 29.78 squared:\n\n29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 30\u00b2 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 \u2248 900-13.2 is 886.8 +0.0484\u2248886.8484.\n\nSo p squared is ~886.85 (MeV)^2.\n\nThe m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let me calculate that. 100\u00b2=10,000, plus 2*100*5.7=1140, plus 5.7\u00b2=32.49 \u2192 total 10,000 +1,140 =11,140 +32.49=11,172.49. So m_mu squared is ~11,172.49 (MeV)^2.\n\nAdding p squared and m_mu squared: 886.8484 + 11,172.49 \u2248 12,059.34 (MeV)^2. \n\nTaking the square root of that gives the muon's energy. sqrt(12059.34). Let's see sqrt(12000) is about 109.54 (since 109.5^2 = ~12,000). Let me compute 109.5 squared: 109^2=11881, 0.5^2=0.25, cross term 2*109*0.5=109 \u2192 total (109.5)^2 = 11881 +109 +0.25=120, so 109.5\u00b2 is 11970.25. Hmm, wait. Wait 109.5 squared:\n\nWait 109.5 *109.5:\n\n100*109.5 = 10,950,\n\n9.5*109.5 = let's see 10*109.5 =1095 minus 0.5*109.5=54.75 \u2192 1095-54.75=1040.25. \n\nTotal 10,950 + 1,040.25 = 12, (wait 10,950 + 1,040.25 is 12, 950+1040 is 11990? Wait 10,950 +1040.25 = 11,990.25. So 109.5 squared is 11,990.25. \n\nBut our value is 12,059.34. So the difference is 12,059.34 -11,990.25 =69.09. \n\nSo sqrt(12,059.34) \u2248 109.5 + (69.09)/(2*109.5) \u2248 using linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) at x=11,990.25 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) \u2192 1/(2*109.5). \n\nSo delta_x is 69.09. So delta_sqrt \u2248 (69.09)/(2*109.5) \u2248 69.09 /219 \u2248 ~0.316. \n\nSo total sqrt \u2248 109.5 +0.316 \u2248 109.816 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p =29.78 MeV. \n\nTotal energy should be 109.8 +29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's mass of 139.6. That checks out. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. The rest energy is m_mu*c\u00b2, which is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 \u22484.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy. But since the neutrino is massless (or mass is negligible), its rest energy is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, the first number is KE of muon, second is KE of neutrino. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2.84, 26.8\n\nB)7.2,32.8\n\nC)3.52,20.8\n\nD)4.12,29.8\n\nSo our calculation gives approximately 4.1 and 29.8, which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me re-calculate the numbers more precisely, maybe I approximated too much. \n\nFirst, let's re-calculate p. The exact value of (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi):\n\nm_pi\u00b2 = (139.6)^2. Let's compute that accurately. \n\n139.6 squared:\n\n140^2 =19600, subtract 0.4*2*140 + (0.4)^2 \u2192 (139.6 is 140 -0.4)\n\nWait, (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 -2ab +b\u00b2. So (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19600-112=19488 +0.16=19488.16. \n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that exactly:\n\n105 squared is 11025. 0.7 squared is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2=105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 =11025 +147 +0.49= 11172.49. \n\nSo m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 =19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67 (as before). \n\nDivided by 2*m_pi= 2*139.6=279.2. \n\nSo p=8315.67/279.2. Let me compute this division more precisely. \n\n8315.67 \u00f7 279.2. Let me write it as 8315.67 divided by 279.2. \n\nLet me see how many times 279.2 fits into 8315.67.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2=8096.8. \n\nWait 279.2 *29 =279.2*(30-1)= 8376-279.2=8096.8 \n\nThen 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87 remaining. \n\nNow, 279.2 goes into 218.87 less than once. 0.783 times? Because 279.2 *0.783\u2248 218. \n\nWait, 279.2 *0.7=195.44\n\n279.2 *0.08=22.336 \u2192 total 0.78 \u2192195.44+22.336=217.776. \n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776, which is close to 218.87. The difference is 218.87 -217.776=1.094. \n\nSo total p=29.78 + (1.094 /279.2). Wait, no. Wait, the initial was 29 (from the 29*279.2=8096.8), then the remainder 218.87 gives 0.78 more. So total p is 29.78. \n\nWait, actually, 29.78 is correct. \n\nSo p=29.78 MeV. \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is exactly p, so 29.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute p squared precisely:\n\np=29.78 \u2192 p\u00b2 = (29.78)^2. Let's compute:\n\n29.78^2:\n\nFirst, 29^2=841\n\n0.78^2=0.6084\n\nCross term 2*29*0.78=45.24 \n\nWait, no, wait. Wait 29.78 is 29 +0.78. So (a +b)^2 = a\u00b2 +2ab +b\u00b2 where a=29, b=0.78.\n\nThus:\n\n29\u00b2 =841\n\n2ab = 2*29*0.78 =58*0.78 =45.24\n\nb\u00b2=0.78^2=0.6084\n\nTotal: 841 +45.24=886.24 +0.6084=886.8484. \n\nSo p squared is 886.8484. \n\nAdding m_mu squared (105.7)^2=11172.49 \u2192 total under the sqrt: 886.8484 +11172.49 = 12059.3384. \n\nSquare root of that. Let me see sqrt(12059.3384). \n\nLet me see 109.8 squared is (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 +174.4 +0.64=11881+174.4=12055.4 +0.64=12056.04. \n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. \n\nBut our target is 12059.34. The difference is 12059.34-12056.04=3.3. \n\nSo to find the exact sqrt, let's see between 109.8 and 109.9:\n\n109.9 squared is (109.8 +0.1)^2 =109.8\u00b2 +2*109.8*0.1 +0.01 =12056.04 +21.96 +0.01=12078.01. Wait, that's way higher. Wait no, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait 109.8^2 is 12056.04. Adding 0.1 to get to 109.9:\n\nThe next term: (x + dx)^2 \u2248 x\u00b2 + 2x dx. Here x=109.8, dx=0.1. \n\nSo delta is 2*109.8*0.1 =21.96, so 12056.04 +21.96=12078.0. So that's 109.9 squared is 12078.0, which is way higher than needed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my previous approach is better. \n\nWait, since 109.8\u00b2 is 12056.04, and we need 12059.34, the difference is 3.3. \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=12056.04 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(2*109.8) \u22481/219.6 \u22480.00455 per MeV. \n\nSo to get an increase of 3.3 in x, the sqrt increases by approx 3.3 *0.00455 \u22480.015. So the sqrt would be 109.8 +0.015\u2248109.815 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.815 MeV. \n\nThus, the KE for muon is 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's KE is its energy, which is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8. \n\nSo that's option D: 4.12 and 29.8. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, and I know their rest masses. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nThe rest mass of the pion (Pi+) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, and the muon (mu+) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? Because neutrinos have very small masses, so maybe we can treat it as massless here. Wait, but even if it's massless, its energy and momentum still have to be considered. Hmm.\n\nThe decay equation is Pi+ \u2192 mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy of the system is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c\u00b2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (since the masses are given in MeV, which is energy units), the total energy is just 139.6 MeV. \n\nThe total energy must be conserved. So the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino should equal 139.6 MeV. Also, their momenta must cancel each other out. Since the neutrino is massless (or very light), its energy is just pc (but again, using units where c=1, so E = p for the neutrino). \n\nLet me denote variables. Let\u2019s let the momentum of the muon be p. Since momentum must cancel, the neutrino's momentum must be -p (opposite direction), but since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal. The energy of the muon will be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ), but again with c=1 units, that's sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). The neutrino's energy is p (since E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c^4, and m is zero, so E = pc). \n\nSo total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi (since the pion's rest energy is the total). \n\nWait, but m_pi here is 139.6 MeV. Let me write the equation again:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nI need to solve for p here. Let's denote m_mu = 105.7 and m_pi = 139.6. \n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me call the muon's energy E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), and the neutrino's energy E_nu = p. So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.\n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi.\n\nHmm, how do I solve this equation for p? Maybe I can isolate the square root term first. Let's subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p\n\nNow square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2\n\nExpand the right side: (m_pi)^2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nThe p\u00b2 terms cancel out. Subtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2\n\nSo p = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Alternatively, factor it as (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). That might be easier.\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nMultiply them: 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 30 * 245.3 = 7359\n\nThen 3.9 * 245.3 = let's see 3*245.3 = 735.9, plus 0.9*245.3=220.77, total 735.9 + 220.77 = 956.67\n\nSo total numerator is 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first part was 30*245.3=7359? Wait 30 *245 is 7350, plus 30*0.3 is 9, so yes 7359. But 3.9 is 3 +0.9, so 3.9 *245.3 is indeed 3*245.3 plus 0.9*245.3. \n\nWait, but 33.9 *245.3 = (30 +3.9)*245.3 = 30*245.3 + 3.9*245.3. So yes, that gives 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nAlternatively, 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute 33 *245.3 = 33*(200+45.3) = 33*200=6600 + 33*45.3. \n\n33*45 = 1485, 33*0.3=9.9 \u2192 total 1485+9.9=1494.9 \u2192 total 6600+1494.9=8094.9. Then 0.9 *245.3 = 220.77, so total is 8094.9 +220.77= 8315.67. \n\nYes, so numerator is 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nDenominator is 2 * m_pi = 2 *139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 100 first to make it easier: 83156.7 / 2792 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, 2792 * 30 = 83,760. But 83,156.7 is less than that. \n\nWait, 2792 * 29.75 \u2248 ?\n\n2792 * 30 = 83,760. Subtract 2792 *0.25 (which is 698) \u2192 83,760 - 698 = 83,062. That's close to 83,156.7. So approximately 29.75?\n\nWait, but this is in terms of (MeV squared) divided by (MeV), so the units would be MeV, which is correct for momentum (since energy is MeV, and momentum in natural units is MeV/c, but since we're using units where c=1, it's just MeV). \n\nWait, but let me recast the calculation:\n\nWait, numerator is 8315.67 (MeV^2) divided by 279.2 (MeV) gives p \u2248 8315.67 /279.2 \u2248 let me do this division.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8,376\n\nBut the numerator is 8,315.67. So 30 would give 8,376 which is a bit higher. The difference is 8,376 -8,315.67 = 60.33. So subtract 60.33 /279.2 \u2248 0.216. So 30 -0.216 \u2248 29.784 MeV. \n\nSo p \u2248 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait, but let me check with calculator steps:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 10: 831.567 / 27.92. Let's see 27.92*30 = 837.6, which is again a bit over. \n\nAlternatively, 27.92 *29.7 = 27.92*(30-0.3) = 27.92*30 = 837.6 minus 27.92*0.3 = 8.376 \u2192 837.6 -8.376 = 829.224. \n\nThe numerator is 831.567, so 829.224 is 831.567 -829.224 = 2.343 less. So 29.7 + (2.343 /27.92). \n\n2.343/27.92 \u2248 0.084. So total is approx 29.784. So p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nSo the momentum of the muon is approximately 29.78 MeV/c (but since units are in natural units, just 29.78 MeV). \n\nNow, let's find the energy of the muon. The energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let's compute that.\n\np\u00b2 = (29.78)^2 \u2248 29.78 *29.78. Let's compute 30\u00b2 is 900, subtract 0.22*30*2 + (0.22)^2. Wait, maybe easier to compute 29.78 squared:\n\n29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 30\u00b2 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 \u2248 900-13.2 is 886.8 +0.0484\u2248886.8484.\n\nSo p squared is ~886.85 (MeV)^2.\n\nThe m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let me calculate that. 100\u00b2=10,000, plus 2*100*5.7=1140, plus 5.7\u00b2=32.49 \u2192 total 10,000 +1,140 =11,140 +32.49=11,172.49. So m_mu squared is ~11,172.49 (MeV)^2.\n\nAdding p squared and m_mu squared: 886.8484 + 11,172.49 \u2248 12,059.34 (MeV)^2. \n\nTaking the square root of that gives the muon's energy. sqrt(12059.34). Let's see sqrt(12000) is about 109.54 (since 109.5^2 = ~12,000). Let me compute 109.5 squared: 109^2=11881, 0.5^2=0.25, cross term 2*109*0.5=109 \u2192 total (109.5)^2 = 11881 +109 +0.25=120, so 109.5\u00b2 is 11970.25. Hmm, wait. Wait 109.5 squared:\n\nWait 109.5 *109.5:\n\n100*109.5 = 10,950,\n\n9.5*109.5 = let's see 10*109.5 =1095 minus 0.5*109.5=54.75 \u2192 1095-54.75=1040.25. \n\nTotal 10,950 + 1,040.25 = 12, (wait 10,950 + 1,040.25 is 12, 950+1040 is 11990? Wait 10,950 +1040.25 = 11,990.25. So 109.5 squared is 11,990.25. \n\nBut our value is 12,059.34. So the difference is 12,059.34 -11,990.25 =69.09. \n\nSo sqrt(12,059.34) \u2248 109.5 + (69.09)/(2*109.5) \u2248 using linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) at x=11,990.25 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) \u2192 1/(2*109.5). \n\nSo delta_x is 69.09. So delta_sqrt \u2248 (69.09)/(2*109.5) \u2248 69.09 /219 \u2248 ~0.316. \n\nSo total sqrt \u2248 109.5 +0.316 \u2248 109.816 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is p =29.78 MeV. \n\nTotal energy should be 109.8 +29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the pion's mass of 139.6. That checks out. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. The rest energy is m_mu*c\u00b2, which is 105.7 MeV. So KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 \u22484.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy. But since the neutrino is massless (or mass is negligible), its rest energy is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, the first number is KE of muon, second is KE of neutrino. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2.84, 26.8\n\nB)7.2,32.8\n\nC)3.52,20.8\n\nD)4.12,29.8\n\nSo our calculation gives approximately 4.1 and 29.8, which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me re-calculate the numbers more precisely, maybe I approximated too much. \n\nFirst, let's re-calculate p. The exact value of (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi):\n\nm_pi\u00b2 = (139.6)^2. Let's compute that accurately. \n\n139.6 squared:\n\n140^2 =19600, subtract 0.4*2*140 + (0.4)^2 \u2192 (139.6 is 140 -0.4)\n\nWait, (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 -2ab +b\u00b2. So (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19600-112=19488 +0.16=19488.16. \n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that exactly:\n\n105 squared is 11025. 0.7 squared is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2=105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 =11025 +147 +0.49= 11172.49. \n\nSo m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2 =19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67 (as before). \n\nDivided by 2*m_pi= 2*139.6=279.2. \n\nSo p=8315.67/279.2. Let me compute this division more precisely. \n\n8315.67 \u00f7 279.2. Let me write it as 8315.67 divided by 279.2. \n\nLet me see how many times 279.2 fits into 8315.67.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2=8096.8. \n\nWait 279.2 *29 =279.2*(30-1)= 8376-279.2=8096.8 \n\nThen 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87 remaining. \n\nNow, 279.2 goes into 218.87 less than once. 0.783 times? Because 279.2 *0.783\u2248 218. \n\nWait, 279.2 *0.7=195.44\n\n279.2 *0.08=22.336 \u2192 total 0.78 \u2192195.44+22.336=217.776. \n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776, which is close to 218.87. The difference is 218.87 -217.776=1.094. \n\nSo total p=29.78 + (1.094 /279.2). Wait, no. Wait, the initial was 29 (from the 29*279.2=8096.8), then the remainder 218.87 gives 0.78 more. So total p is 29.78. \n\nWait, actually, 29.78 is correct. \n\nSo p=29.78 MeV. \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is exactly p, so 29.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute p squared precisely:\n\np=29.78 \u2192 p\u00b2 = (29.78)^2. Let's compute:\n\n29.78^2:\n\nFirst, 29^2=841\n\n0.78^2=0.6084\n\nCross term 2*29*0.78=45.24 \n\nWait, no, wait. Wait 29.78 is 29 +0.78. So (a +b)^2 = a\u00b2 +2ab +b\u00b2 where a=29, b=0.78.\n\nThus:\n\n29\u00b2 =841\n\n2ab = 2*29*0.78 =58*0.78 =45.24\n\nb\u00b2=0.78^2=0.6084\n\nTotal: 841 +45.24=886.24 +0.6084=886.8484. \n\nSo p squared is 886.8484. \n\nAdding m_mu squared (105.7)^2=11172.49 \u2192 total under the sqrt: 886.8484 +11172.49 = 12059.3384. \n\nSquare root of that. Let me see sqrt(12059.3384). \n\nLet me see 109.8 squared is (109 +0.8)^2 = 109\u00b2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8\u00b2 = 11881 +174.4 +0.64=11881+174.4=12055.4 +0.64=12056.04. \n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. \n\nBut our target is 12059.34. The difference is 12059.34-12056.04=3.3. \n\nSo to find the exact sqrt, let's see between 109.8 and 109.9:\n\n109.9 squared is (109.8 +0.1)^2 =109.8\u00b2 +2*109.8*0.1 +0.01 =12056.04 +21.96 +0.01=12078.01. Wait, that's way higher. Wait no, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait 109.8^2 is 12056.04. Adding 0.1 to get to 109.9:\n\nThe next term: (x + dx)^2 \u2248 x\u00b2 + 2x dx. Here x=109.8, dx=0.1. \n\nSo delta is 2*109.8*0.1 =21.96, so 12056.04 +21.96=12078.0. So that's 109.9 squared is 12078.0, which is way higher than needed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my previous approach is better. \n\nWait, since 109.8\u00b2 is 12056.04, and we need 12059.34, the difference is 3.3. \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=12056.04 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(2*109.8) \u22481/219.6 \u22480.00455 per MeV. \n\nSo to get an increase of 3.3 in x, the sqrt increases by approx 3.3 *0.00455 \u22480.015. So the sqrt would be 109.8 +0.015\u2248109.815 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is about 109.815 MeV. \n\nThus, the KE for muon is 109.815 -105.7 =4.115 MeV, which is approximately 4.12 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's KE is its energy, which is 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8. \n\nSo that's option D: 4.12 and 29.8. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve for the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay \\(\\Pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu\\), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy, \\(139.6\\) MeV. The neutrino is treated as massless, so its energy equals its momentum (\\(E_\\nu = p\\)). The muon's energy is \\(\\sqrt{p^2 + m_\\mu^2}\\), where \\(m_\\mu = 105.7\\) MeV. Setting total energy equal to the pion's rest mass:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(p\\) yields:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}\n\\]\n\nThe muon's energy is \\(\\sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\approx 109.82\\) MeV. Subtracting its rest energy gives its kinetic energy:\n\n\\[\nKE_{\\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}\n\\]\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy equals its energy, \\(p \\approx 29.8\\) MeV. Matching the calculated values to the options, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
