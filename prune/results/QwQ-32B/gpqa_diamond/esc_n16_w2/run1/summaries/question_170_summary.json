      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron given its spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4). Hmm, so first, I need to remember how to compute expectation values for spin operators. \n\nThe spin operators for the Pauli matrices. The question mentions \u03c3_y, which is given in LaTeX. Let me recall the Pauli matrices. Oh right, \u03c3_y is the one with the -i and i entries. The matrix they provided is:\n\u03c3_y = [0 -i; i 0]. So that's correct.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8S_y\u27e9 is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying by \u03c3_y, then multiplying by the original state vector, and then dividing by 2 because the spin operator S_y is (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y. Wait, right. Because the spin angular momentum operators are (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So the actual S_y matrix would be (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y. Therefore, I need to compute the expectation using \u03c3_y first, then multiply by \u0127/2.\n\nFirst, let me write down the state vector. The problem states the spin state is (3i, 4). So in vector form, that would be a column vector:\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [3i; 4]. But since expectation value involves the conjugate transpose, I need to make sure about the complex conjugate. The conjugate transpose of this vector would be [ -3i  4 ] because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 stays 4.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8\u27e9. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03c3_y multiplied by |\u03c8\u27e9. \n\n\u03c3_y is:\n[ 0   -i ]\n[ i    0 ]\n\nMultiplying \u03c3_y with |\u03c8\u27e9 (which is [3i;4]):\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -i*4 = -4i\nSecond component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*3i = 3i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo \u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9 gives the vector [ -4i ; -3 ].\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9, which is [ -3i , 4 ].\n\nSo now take the inner product of \u27e8\u03c8| with the result of \u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8\u27e9 = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i) multiplied by (-4i) = 12 i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, that's 12*(-1) = -12.\n\nSecond term: 4 multiplied by (-3) = -12.\n\nAdding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.\n\nWait, so \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 is -24? Then the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2)*\u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are in terms of hbar over 25 or 2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nHold on, maybe I messed up the normalization. The state vector (3i,4) might not be normalized. Because expectation values depend on the state being normalized. Let me check the normalization first.\n\nThe norm squared of |\u03c8\u27e9 is (3i)*(3i)* (wait, actually, the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components). The first component is 3i, so its modulus squared is |3i|\u00b2 = (3)^2*(i)^2? Wait no, modulus squared is (3i)*(conjugate(3i)) = 3i*(-3i) = 9*(i*-i) = 9*1 =9. Wait, right. The modulus squared of each component is (3i)(-3i) for the first term? Let me compute it properly.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2. \n\n|3i|\u00b2 is (3)^2*(i)^2? Wait no, modulus squared of a complex number a+ib is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So 3i is 0 +3i, so modulus squared is 0\u00b2 +3\u00b2=9. The second component is 4, so modulus squared is 16. So total norm squared is 9+16=25. So the norm is 5, so the state isn't normalized. Oh right, so I need to normalize the state vector before calculating the expectation value. \n\nAh, that's an important step I missed. The expectation value is calculated using a normalized state. So I have to divide the state vector by its norm to make it a unit vector. \n\nSo the normalized state vector |\u03c8_normalized\u27e9 is (1/5)*[3i;4]. Therefore, the conjugate transpose \u27e8\u03c8_normalized| is (1/5)*[-3i, 4].\n\nNow let's redo the calculation with the normalized vector.\n\nFirst, compute \u03c3_y |\u03c8_normalized\u27e9.\n\nMultiply \u03c3_y by (1/5)*[3i;4]:\n\n\u03c3_y * (1/5)*[3i;4] = (1/5)*\u03c3_y*[3i;4] \n\nWhich is (1/5)*[ -4i ; -3 ] as before. So that's [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nNow compute \u27e8\u03c8_normalized|\u03c3_y|\u03c8_normalized\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8_normalized| is (1/5)*[-3i, 4], so the inner product is:\n\n(1/5)*[ -3i , 4 ] multiplied by (1/5)*[ -4i ; -3 ]\n\nWait, actually, the full calculation would be:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8\u27e9 where |\u03c8\u27e9 is normalized. \n\nSo the inner product is (1/5)(-3i) * ( -4i/5 ) + (1/5)(4) * (-3/5 )\n\nWait let me do step by step:\n\nFirst term: (conjugate of first component of \u03c8_normalized) times first component of \u03c3_y\u03c8_normalized.\n\nThe first component of \u03c8_normalized is (3i)/5, so its conjugate is (-3i)/5. The first component of \u03c3_y\u03c8_normalized is (-4i)/5. \n\nSo the first term is (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) \n\nSecond term: the second component of \u03c8_normalized is 4/5, so conjugate is 4/5. Multiply by the second component of \u03c3_y\u03c8_normalized, which is -3/5.\n\nSo second term is (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i)(-4i) / (25) \u2192 (12 i\u00b2)/25 \u2192 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) /25 \u2192 -12/25.\n\nAdding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 is -24/25. \n\nThen the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2) * \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is -12*hbar/25, so that would be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check again the calculation steps to make sure. \n\nWait when I computed the first term:\n\n(-3i/5) multiplied by (-4i/5) = (12 i^2 ) /25 \u2192 i squared is -1, so 12*(-1)/25 \u2192 -12/25. Correct.\n\nSecond term: (4/5) * (-3/5) \u2192 -12/25. So total is -24/25. Yes. \n\nSo S_y is (\u0127/2) multiplied by that. So ( -24/25 )*(\u0127/2) = -12\u0127/(25). So that's exactly option A. \n\nHmm, but let me confirm the Pauli matrices again. The \u03c3_y matrix is indeed [0 -i; i 0]. So the multiplication steps are correct. \n\nAnother way to think: The spin state is given as a column vector (3i, 4). But when not normalized, but when normalized, divided by 5. So the calculation steps are correct. \n\nYes, so the answer should be A.\n",

Wait, right. Because the spin angular momentum operators are (\u0127/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So the actual S_y matrix would be (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y.

Did I make a mistake here?\n\nHold on, maybe I messed up the normalization. The state vector (3i,4) might not be normalized. Because expectation values depend on the state being normalized. Let me check the normalization first.\n\nThe norm squared of |\u03c8\u27e9 is (3i)*(3i)* (wait, actually, the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components). The first component is 3i, so its modulus squared is |3i|\u00b2 = (3)^2*(i)^2? Wait no, modulus squared is (3i)*(conjugate(3i)) = 3i*(-3i) = 9*(i*-i) = 9*1 =9. Wait, right. The modulus squared of each component is (3i)(-3i) for the first term? Let me compute it properly.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2. \n\n|3i|\u00b2 is (3)^2*(i)^2? Wait no, modulus squared of a complex number a+ib is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So 3i is 0 +3i, so modulus squared is 0\u00b2 +3\u00b2=9. The second component is 4, so modulus squared is 16.

So I have to divide the state vector by its norm to make it a unit vector. \n\nSo the normalized state vector |\u03c8_normalized\u27e9 is (1/5)*[3i;4]. Therefore, the conjugate transpose \u27e8\u03c8_normalized| is (1/5)*[-3i, 4].\n\nNow let's redo the calculation with the normalized vector.\n\nFirst, compute \u03c3_y |\u03c8_normalized\u27e9.\n\nMultiply \u03c3_y by (1/5)*[3i;4]:\n\n\u03c3_y * (1/5)*[3i;4] = (1/5)*\u03c3_y*[3i;4] \n\nWhich is (1/5)*[ -4i ; -3 ] as before.

The first component of \u03c3_y\u03c8_normalized is (-4i)/5. \n\nSo the first term is (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) \n\nSecond term: the second component of \u03c8_normalized is 4/5, so conjugate is 4/5. Multiply by the second component of \u03c3_y\u03c8_normalized, which is -3/5.\n\nSo second term is (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i)(-4i) / (25) \u2192 (12 i\u00b2)/25 \u2192 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) /25 \u2192 -12/25.\n\nAdding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 is -24/25. \n\nThen the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2) * \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is -12*hbar/25, so that would be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check again the calculation steps to make sure. \n\nWait when I computed the first term:\n\n(-3i/5) multiplied by (-4i/5) = (12 i^2 ) /25 \u2192 i squared is -1, so 12*(-1)/25 \u2192 -12/25.

So that's exactly option A. \n\nHmm, but let me confirm the Pauli matrices again. The \u03c3_y matrix is indeed [0 -i; i 0]. So the multiplication steps are correct. \n\nAnother way to think: The spin state is given as a column vector (3i, 4). But when not normalized, but when normalized, divided by 5. So the calculation steps are correct. \n\nYes, so the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \\( \\langle S_y \\rangle \\), for the electron in the spin state \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we first normalize the state. The norm of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is \\( \\sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the given spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the bra vector multiplied by the operator and then multiplied by the ket vector. Since we're dealing with spin, the state is given as a two-component vector. The spin state here is (3i, 4). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as column vectors. So the electron's spin state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Let me note that down.\n\nThe operator for the y-component of spin is given by S_y = (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y. The Pauli matrix \u03c3_y provided is:\n[0  -i]\n[i   0]\n\nSo first, I need to compute the expectation value <S_y> which would be the conjugate transpose of the state vector (the bra) multiplied by \u03c3_y multiplied by the original ket vector, then multiply by \u0127/2. \n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8> = [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose, <\u03c8|, would be the row vector [ -3i  4* ] since the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 (a real number) is still 4. Wait, actually, the second component is 4, so its conjugate is 4. So the bra vector is [ -3i, 4 ].\n\nNow, I need to compute <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8>. Let me perform the matrix multiplication step by step. First, multiply \u03c3_y with |\u03c8>:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0  -i; i  0] * [3i; 4]\n\nCalculating the first component of the resulting vector:\n0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -i*4 = -4i\n\nSecond component:\ni*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo the result of \u03c3_y * |\u03c8> is the column vector [ -4i; -3 ].\n\nNow, multiply the bra vector <\u03c8| with this result:\n\n\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> = [ -3i   4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ]\n\nCompute the dot product here. Let's do each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i)*(-4i) = (12 i\u00b2) = 12*(-1) = -12\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) = -12\n\nAdding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.\n\nWait, that gives a total of -24. But then the expectation value <S_y> is (\u0127/2) multiplied by this result. So:\n\n<S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the calculations again because the options given don't have -12\u0127. The options have hbar over 25? Oh, right, because the state might not be normalized. Wait, the problem didn't mention normalization. Oh, right, the state vector (3i,4) might not be a unit vector. So I need to normalize it first?\n\nOh, that's a crucial point I missed. The expectation value requires that the state vector is normalized. The given state is (3i,4), so let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/5)*(3i,4). So I should have normalized the vector first.\n\nAh, so I need to take that into account. Let me redo the calculation with the normalized vector.\n\nThe normalized state vector |\u03c8> is (1/5)*(3i,4). So the components are (3i/5, 4/5).\n\nTherefore, the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose, so ( -3i/5, 4/5 ).\n\nNow, compute \u03c3_y |\u03c8> again with the normalized vector:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0  -i; i  0] * [3i/5; 4/5]\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -i*(4/5) = -4i/5\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i)/5 = 3i\u00b2/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5\n\nSo the result is [ -4i/5; -3/5 ]\n\nNow multiply <\u03c8| with this result:\n\n<\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> = [ -3i/5   4/5 ] * [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2)/(25) = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25\n\nSecond term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25\n\nAdding these together: -12/25 + (-12/25) = -24/25\n\nTherefore, <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> is -24/25.\n\nNow, the expectation value S_y is (\u0127/2) multiplied by this:\n\nS_y = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25.\n\nLooking at the options, that's option A) -12*hbar/25. But wait, let me double-check all steps again because I might have messed up signs.\n\nWait the first term calculation: (-3i/5) multiplied by (-4i/5). Let's re-calculate that:\n\nMultiply the terms: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, that gives 12*(-1) = -12. Then divided by (5*5)=25, so indeed -12/25. \n\nThe second term is 4/5 multiplied by -3/5, which is (4*-3)/(25) = -12/25. So total is -24/25. Multiply by \u0127/2 gives -12\u0127/25. \n\nYes, so that would be option A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) -12*hbar/25\n\nB) 12*hbar/25\n\nC) 25*hbar/2\n\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nYes, so that's A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign in the \u03c3_y matrix. Let me confirm the Pauli matrix \u03c3_y. The problem says \u03c3_y is [0 -i; i 0], which is correct. So the first row is 0 and -i, second row is i and 0. So when I multiplied \u03c3_y with the vector, the first component was -i times the second component of the vector. The second component was i times the first component of the vector. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A. But let me see if the problem says \"spin state (3i,4)\", which is a column vector with first entry 3i and second entry 4. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question didn't require normalization? If the state wasn't normalized, then the expectation value would be different. Let me see what happens if I didn't normalize.\n\nOriginal vector (3i,4) has norm squared 9 + 16 =25. So if I didn't normalize, then the expectation value would be (without dividing by 5 in the components):\n\nEarlier steps when I first did it without normalization gave <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> as -24, so then S_y would be (\u0127/2)(-24) = -12\u0127. But that's not one of the options. The options have denominators of 25. So that suggests that the question expects us to normalize the state. Because otherwise, the answer would not be in the options. So the correct approach is to normalize the vector first. Therefore, the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different convention where the spin operators are given as \u03c3_y instead of (\u0127/2)\u03c3_y? Wait, the standard formula is S_y = (\u0127/2)\u03c3_y, so the expectation value is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the matrix element. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, I think the steps are right, so the answer is A. So I'll go with that.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the given spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the bra vector multiplied by the operator and then multiplied by the ket vector. Since we're dealing with spin, the state is given as a two-component vector. The spin state here is (3i, 4). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as column vectors. So the electron's spin state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Let me note that down.\n\nThe operator for the y-component of spin is given by S_y = (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y. The Pauli matrix \u03c3_y provided is:\n[0  -i]\n[i   0]\n\nSo first, I need to compute the expectation value <S_y> which would be the conjugate transpose of the state vector (the bra) multiplied by \u03c3_y multiplied by the original ket vector, then multiply by \u0127/2. \n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8> = [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose, <\u03c8|, would be the row vector [ -3i  4* ] since the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 (a real number) is still 4. Wait, actually, the second component is 4, so its conjugate is 4. So the bra vector is [ -3i, 4 ].\n\nNow, I need to compute <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8>. Let me perform the matrix multiplication step by step. First, multiply \u03c3_y with |\u03c8>:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0  -i; i  0] * [3i; 4]\n\nCalculating the first component of the resulting vector:\n0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -i*4 = -4i\n\nSecond component:\ni*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo the result of \u03c3_y * |\u03c8> is the column vector [ -4i; -3 ].\n\nNow, multiply the bra vector <\u03c8| with this result:\n\n\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> = [ -3i   4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ]\n\nCompute the dot product here. Let's do each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i)*(-4i) = (12 i\u00b2) = 12*(-1) = -12\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) = -12\n\nAdding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.\n\nWait, that gives a total of -24. But then the expectation value <S_y> is (\u0127/2) multiplied by this result. So:\n\n<S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the calculations again because the options given don't have -12\u0127. The options have hbar over 25? Oh, right, because the state might not be normalized. Wait, the problem didn't mention normalization. Oh, right, the state vector (3i,4) might not be a unit vector. So I need to normalize it first?\n\nOh, that's a crucial point I missed. The expectation value requires that the state vector is normalized. The given state is (3i,4), so let's compute its norm.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (1/5)*(3i,4). So I should have normalized the vector first.\n\nAh, so I need to take that into account. Let me redo the calculation with the normalized vector.\n\nThe normalized state vector |\u03c8> is (1/5)*(3i,4). So the components are (3i/5, 4/5).\n\nTherefore, the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose, so ( -3i/5, 4/5 ).\n\nNow, compute \u03c3_y |\u03c8> again with the normalized vector:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0  -i; i  0] * [3i/5; 4/5]\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -i*(4/5) = -4i/5\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i)/5 = 3i\u00b2/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5\n\nSo the result is [ -4i/5; -3/5 ]\n\nNow multiply <\u03c8| with this result:\n\n<\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> = [ -3i/5   4/5 ] * [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2)/(25) = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25\n\nSecond term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25\n\nAdding these together: -12/25 + (-12/25) = -24/25\n\nTherefore, <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> is -24/25.\n\nNow, the expectation value S_y is (\u0127/2) multiplied by this:\n\nS_y = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25.\n\nLooking at the options, that's option A) -12*hbar/25. But wait, let me double-check all steps again because I might have messed up signs.\n\nWait the first term calculation: (-3i/5) multiplied by (-4i/5). Let's re-calculate that:\n\nMultiply the terms: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, that gives 12*(-1) = -12. Then divided by (5*5)=25, so indeed -12/25. \n\nThe second term is 4/5 multiplied by -3/5, which is (4*-3)/(25) = -12/25. So total is -24/25. Multiply by \u0127/2 gives -12\u0127/25. \n\nYes, so that would be option A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) -12*hbar/25\n\nB) 12*hbar/25\n\nC) 25*hbar/2\n\nD) -25*hbar/2\n\nYes, so that's A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign in the \u03c3_y matrix. Let me confirm the Pauli matrix \u03c3_y. The problem says \u03c3_y is [0 -i; i 0], which is correct. So the first row is 0 and -i, second row is i and 0. So when I multiplied \u03c3_y with the vector, the first component was -i times the second component of the vector. The second component was i times the first component of the vector. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A. But let me see if the problem says \"spin state (3i,4)\", which is a column vector with first entry 3i and second entry 4. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question didn't require normalization? If the state wasn't normalized, then the expectation value would be different. Let me see what happens if I didn't normalize.\n\nOriginal vector (3i,4) has norm squared 9 + 16 =25. So if I didn't normalize, then the expectation value would be (without dividing by 5 in the components):\n\nEarlier steps when I first did it without normalization gave <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> as -24, so then S_y would be (\u0127/2)(-24) = -12\u0127. But that's not one of the options. The options have denominators of 25. So that suggests that the question expects us to normalize the state. Because otherwise, the answer would not be in the options. So the correct approach is to normalize the vector first.
