      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Their orbital periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are fractions like 0.4, 0.6, etc. \n\nThe key here is probably using the relationship between the orbital period and the masses of the stars. I remember that for a binary system, Kepler's third law applies, which in the astronomical form might be something like (P^2) = (a^3)/(M_total), where P is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis, and M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars. But wait, I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nOh right, the formula is usually written as P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G)(a\u00b3)/(M1 + M2). But since we are comparing two systems, maybe we can set up a ratio to eliminate some variables. \n\nAlternatively, there's another approach using the radial velocity amplitudes. The radial velocity curves of the stars in a binary system depend on their masses and the orbital parameters. The formula for the radial velocity amplitude K of each star is given by K = (v) * (M_secondary)/(M_total) * sin(i), where v is some velocity term related to the orbit. But I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nWait, let's think again. The radial velocity amplitude K for each star in a spectroscopic binary is given by:\n\nK\u2081 = (2\u03c0 a\u2081 sin i) / (P * sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) \n\nBut since we're probably assuming circular orbits (since the problem doesn't mention eccentricity), the denominator simplifies to P. Also, a\u2081 is the semi-major axis of star 1's orbit. Similarly for K\u2082. \n\nBut since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, a\u2081/a\u2082 = M\u2082/M\u2081. Because the distances are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function, but maybe there's a simpler way here. Let me see. \n\nThe total mass of the system is M1 + M2. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to their respective masses. Let's denote K1 and K2 as the velocities for the two stars in each system. \n\nThe formula for the mass of each star can be written in terms of their K values. Let me think. \n\nThe ratio of the masses is M1/M2 = (K2/K1) * (a2/a1). But since a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the two stars), and a1/a2 = M2/M1. So a2 = (M1/M2) * a1. \n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, there's a formula that relates the mass of the system to the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for a binary system, the mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using:\n\nM_total = (K1^3 P) / (2.8646 * sin\u00b3i) \n\nWait, but that's assuming that the inclination angle i is 90 degrees (edge-on), which would make sin i = 1. But since the systems exhibit eclipses, that implies that they are edge-on, so i=90, so sin i =1. So maybe we can use that. \n\nThe formula I recall is that the total mass of the binary system (in solar masses) is equal to ( (K1^3 * P) / (2.8646) ) when in units of K in km/s, P in years, and masses in solar masses. Wait, but I might be mixing up some constants here. Let me check my memory. \n\nAlternatively, the formula derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity relation. \n\nLet me write down the equations properly. \n\nFor a binary system, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis (a) and the total mass (M_total) by Kepler's third law:\n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G)(a\u00b3)/(M_total)\n\nSo rearranged, M_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2)\n\nBut also, the radial velocity of each star is related to their orbital speed. The orbital speed of each star is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P, and similarly v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are these orbital speeds (assuming edge-on, so sin i =1). \n\nAlso, since the two stars orbit the center of mass, a1 / a2 = M2 / M1. Therefore, a1 + a2 = a (the total separation between the stars). So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.\n\nSo the velocities are v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) is (v1/v2) = (M2/M1). \n\nSo K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 \n\nSo the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = (K2/K1 +1) * M2 \n\nHmm, not sure if this helps yet. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the individual mass expressions. \n\nThe radial velocity of star 1 is K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nSince a1 + a2 = a (the semi-major axis between the two stars), but the center of mass is at a1*M1 = a2*M2. \n\nSo, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSimilarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 and K2:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nLet me divide these equations. \n\nK1/K2 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) / (M1/(M1 + M2)) ) \n\nThe denominators cancel, so K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nSo the mass ratio of the two stars in a system is inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes. \n\nNow, the total mass of the system is M_total = M1 + M2. Let me express this in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nFrom M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 \n\nSo substituting into M_total: \n\nM_total = M2 ( K2/K1 + 1 ) \n\n= M2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 ) \n\nHmm, but perhaps we can find another relation. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for an expression that relates K1, K2, P, and M_total. \n\nLet me recall that the formula for the total mass in a binary system (in solar masses) when the period is in years and the velocities are in km/s, and assuming edge-on (so sin i=1) is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 * P) + (K2^3 * P) ) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the mass of each star can be written as:\n\nM1 = (K1^3 * P) / (2.8646 * sin^3 i) \n\nWait, perhaps that's for the mass of a single star? Wait, no, maybe the formula is for the mass function. Let me think again. \n\nThe mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:\n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P) / (2\u03c0 G) \n\nBut this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since both systems are eclipsing binaries, which means that the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. \n\nTherefore, we can use the formula for the total mass in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nLet me consider that for each system, the total mass can be found using the relation between the velocities and the period. \n\nLet me denote for system 1: \n\nK1a = 10 km/s (star 1's RV), K1b =5 km/s (star 2's RV). \n\nSimilarly, system 2 has K2a=15, K2b=10. \n\nThe total mass of system1 is M1_total = M1a + M1b \n\nSimilarly, system2's M2_total = M2a + M2b. \n\nWe need to find M1_total / M2_total. \n\nLet me see if I can express M_total in terms of K1, K2 and P. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nFrom the equations above: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nAnd from the center of mass: a1*M1 = a2*M2 \n\nSo a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nLet me let a = a1 + a2 (the total separation between the two stars). \n\nTherefore, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\na2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nThen, substituting into K1 and K2: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nLet me divide K1 by K2: \n\nK1/K2 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) / (M1/(M1 + M2)) ) = M2 / M1 \n\nSo that gives M1 = (K2/K1)*M2 \n\nSo total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = (K2/K1 + 1)*M2 \n\nHmm. Not sure if that's helpful yet. \n\nAlternatively, let's express a in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nMultiply K1 and K2 equations: \n\nK1 * K2 = (2\u03c0/P)^2 * (a1 a2) / (M1 + M2)^2 ) * a^2 \n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a relation between the product K1*K2 and the masses. \n\nAlternatively, let me square both equations and add them? \n\nAlternatively, let's combine the equations. \n\nLet me note that (K1/K2) = (M2/M1). \n\nLet me denote the mass ratio q = M1/M2. Then, K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \n\nSo K1/K2 = 1/q \u2192 q = K2/K1 \n\nTherefore, the mass ratio is q = K2/K1. \n\nSo for system 1, q1 = K1b / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5 \n\nSo M1a / M1b = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTherefore, total mass for system1: M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, system2 has K2a=15, K2b=10 \u2192 q2 = K2b/K2a = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2248 0.666 \n\nThus, M2a / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTherefore, M2_total = M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, to find the total mass of each system, we need to relate this to the orbital period. \n\nLet me use Kepler's third law. \n\nFor each system, M_total = (a^3)/(P^2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) \n\nBut since the actual value of a (semi-major axis) is related to the radial velocities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps express M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me see. \n\nWe can write a in terms of K1 and the mass. \n\nFrom the equation K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nWait, because a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \u2192 since a1 + a2 = a. \n\nWait, so a1 = (M2/M_total) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/M_total)*a \n\nSo rearranged, a = (K1 * P * M_total)/(2\u03c0 * M2) \n\nSimilarly, from Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2) \n\nSubstitute a from above into this equation. \n\nSo substituting a into the equation for M_total gives: \n\nM_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2)) * [ (K1 P M_total)/(2\u03c0 M2) ) ]^3 \n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can solve for M_total. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider combining the two equations. \n\nLet me see if there's a way to eliminate variables. \n\nAlternatively, let me use the relation between K1 and K2. \n\nLet me recall that in terms of the masses and the velocity amplitudes, there's a relation. \n\nLet me think of the total mass as M = M1 + M2 \n\nAnd the mass ratio q = M1/M2 \n\nThen, the radial velocities are related as K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \n\nSo K1 = (M2/M1) K2 \n\nSo K1 = (1/q) K2 \n\nTherefore, K1 * q = K2 \n\nSo q = K2 / K1 \n\nWhich we already have. \n\nNow, the total mass can be expressed in terms of q and K. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula for the mass function, which for a binary system is: \n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nBut since we have eclipses, sin i = 1, so f(m) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 \n\nThe mass function f(m) can also be written in terms of the radial velocity of star 1 (K1) and the period P: \n\nf(m) = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nWait, but I might need to check the exact formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646) ) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should look for a formula that combines K1, K2, and P. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the two equations for K1 and K2. \n\nWe have K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nAnd from center of mass: a1 M1 = a2 M2 \n\n=> a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nLet me let a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThen, since a1 + a2 = a (the total separation), \n\n(M2/M1) a2 + a2 = a \n\na2 ( M2/M1 +1 ) = a \n\na2 = a / (1 + M2/M1 ) = a/( (M1 + M2)/M1 ) ) = (a M1)/(M_total) \n\nSimilarly, a1 = (a M2)/M_total \n\nNow, substituting into the K equations: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * a1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (a M2)/(M_total) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (a M1)/(M_total) \n\nMultiply K1 and K2: \n\nK1 K2 = (2\u03c0/(P))^2 * (a^2 M1 M2)/(M_total^2) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2) \n\nSo solving for a: \n\na\u00b3 = (G P\u00b2 M_total)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nThus, a = [ (G P\u00b2 M_total)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Let me see if I can find an expression for M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me square both K1 and K2 equations and add them? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nSo, K1^2 + K2^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / P\u00b2)(a1\u00b2 + a2\u00b2 )\n\nBut not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, let me take the product K1*K2:\n\nK1*K2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1 a2)/(P\u00b2) \n\nAnd from the center of mass relation, a1 a2 = (a1 a2) \n\nBut since a1 = (M2/M1) a2, then a1 a2 = (M2/M1) a2\u00b2 \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's express M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFrom K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nand a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 gives:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nSimilarly, from Kepler's third law, a\u00b3 = (G (M_total) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nTherefore, a = [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nSubstitute this a into the K1 equation:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (M2/M_total) * [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nLet me simplify this expression. \n\nLet me compute each part step by step. \n\nFirst, the term [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nLet me write it as (G M_total P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nSo, substituting into K1:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nSimplify exponents and terms:\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n= [2\u03c0 / P ] * [ (M2 / M_total) ] * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nLet me handle the constants first. \n\nThe constants are:\n\n2\u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nLet me write 4 \u03c0\u00b2 as (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2). So (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2)^1/3 = 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)\n\nSo 2\u03c0 divided by that is (2 \u03c0) / (2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)) ) \n\n= 2^(1 - 2/3) \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) \n\n= 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) \n\nSo that's the constant factor. \n\nNow, the remaining terms:\n\n(M2/M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2 )^(1/3) \n\nLet me write the exponents:\n\n(M2 / M_total) * [ G^(1/3) (M_total)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) ]\n\n= M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^( -1 + 1/3 ) (P)^(2/3) \n\n= M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) \n\nPutting all together:\n\nK1 = 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) * [ M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ] \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can cube both sides to eliminate the fractional exponents. \n\nLet me cube both sides of the equation for K1:\n\nK1^3 = [ 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) ]^3 * [ M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ]^3 \n\nCalculating the first term cubed: 2^(1) \u03c0^(1) \n\nThe second term cubed:\n\nM2^3 * G^(1) (M_total)^(-2) P^2 \n\nSo altogether: \n\nK1^3 = 2 \u03c0 * M2^3 G / ( M_total^2 ) * P^2 \n\nRearranged:\n\nK1^3 = (2 \u03c0 G P^2) * (M2^3)/(M_total^2) \n\nBut from the mass function, f(m) = M2^3/(M_total^2) \n\nSo substituting that in: \n\nK1^3 = 2 \u03c0 G P^2 f(m) \n\nTherefore, f(m) = K1^3 / (2 \u03c0 G P^2) \n\nBut the mass function f(m) is also equal to (M2^3 sin^3i)/(M_total^2). Since sin i =1, f(m)=M2^3/M_total^2. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is not leading me where I need to go. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each system, the total mass can be written as:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, I think I've heard a formula where if you have both K1 and K2, then the total mass can be calculated. Let me see. \n\nWait, I found a resource in my mind where if you have both radial velocity amplitudes, then the total mass can be found using:\n\nM_total = (K1^3 + K2^3) * P / (2.8646) \n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the total mass when you have both K1 and K2 is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1*K2)^3 * P ) / (2.8646 * (K1 + K2)^2 ) \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the mass ratio and use Kepler's third law. \n\nSince the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me denote q = K2/K1 \n\nThen, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + M2 = q M2 + M2 = M2 (q + 1) \n\nSo M2 = M_total/(q +1 ) \n\nNow, let me use Kepler's third law for the system. \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/( G P^2 ) \n\nBut also, from the radial velocity of one star, say star 1, \n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a \n\nSo substituting: \n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * ( M2/(M_total) ) * a \n\nRearranged, \n\na = ( K1 P M_total ) / ( 2 \u03c0 M2 ) \n\nPlug this into the equation for M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2)) * [ ( K1 P M_total / (2 \u03c0 M2 ) ) ]^3 \n\nLet me compute the cube term:\n\n[ (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) ) ]^3 = (K1^3 P^3 M_total^3)/( 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nSo substituting into M_total equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2)) * ( K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator terms to get:\n\nM_total = [4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ] / [ G P^2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/(8) = 1/2; \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0; P^3/P^2 = P \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = ( (1/2) * K1^3 P * M_total^3 ) / ( G \u03c0 M2^3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by G \u03c0 M2^3:\n\nM_total * G \u03c0 M2^3 = (1/2) K1^3 P M_total^3 \n\nRearranged:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 / ( (1/2) K1^3 P ) ) = M_total^2 \n\nHmm, this seems too complex. Maybe this path isn't the best. \n\nAlternatively, since both systems are eclipsing, so we can assume sin i=1. \n\nLet me try to compute the mass for each system using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, maybe that's the case. Wait, I think the formula for the mass of a binary when you have both radial velocities is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nBut I need to verify. Let me think of units. \n\nThe standard formula for mass from radial velocity and period is when you have one star's velocity, then the mass function is f(m)= (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), which is equal to (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nBut if you have both velocities, perhaps you can get the total mass directly. \n\nAlternatively, since the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses (K1/K2 = M2/M1), so K1 * M1 = K2 * M2 \n\nSo, K1 M1 = K2 M2 \n\n=> M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nTherefore, total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nBut how to relate to period? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the total mass as:\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nM_total = (a^3 P^-2) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2/G )\n\nBut to express a in terms of K and the masses. \n\nWait, since K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nand a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a \n\nSo K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) a \n\n=> a = ( K1 P M_total ) / (2 \u03c0 M2 ) \n\nSimilarly, substituting into the M_total equation: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2)) * ( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 \n\nLet me expand the cube term:\n\n( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 = (K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nNow, substituting into the equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 M2^3) )\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ) / ( G P\u00b2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3 / P^2 = P \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = (0.5 * K1^3 P M_total^3 ) / ( G \u03c0 M2^3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by G \u03c0 M2^3:\n\nM_total * G \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^3 \n\nDivide both sides by M_total:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nHmm, still complicated. Let me see if I can express M2 in terms of M_total and the mass ratio. \n\nWe know that M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nAnd M1 + M2 = M_total \n\nSo M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nWait, since M2 = (K1/K2) M1, then substituting into total mass: \n\nM1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M_total \n\nM1 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) = M_total \n\nSo M1 = M_total / ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = (K1/K2) * M_total / (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo substituting M2 into the equation:\n\nG \u03c0 [ (K1/K2 M1)^3 ] = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nWait, substituting M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nWait, perhaps substituting M2 in terms of M_total. \n\nAlternatively, let me substitute M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nBut M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ), so M2 = (K1/K2)*( M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) )\n\nLet me denote q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, M2 = q M1 \n\nWait, no, K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 so M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nWait, K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) M2 \n\nSo, perhaps using q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me define q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nThen, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M_total = q M2 + M2 = M2 (q +1 ) \u2192 M2 = M_total/(q +1 )\n\nSo substituting M2 = M_total/(q+1) into the equation:\n\nG \u03c0 [ M2^3 ] = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nWait, the equation earlier was:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nSo substituting M2 = M_total/(q +1):\n\nG \u03c0 ( M_total^3 / (q+1)^3 ) ) = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nMultiply both sides by (q+1)^3 / M_total^2 \n\nG \u03c0 M_total / (q+1)^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P \n\nThen, solving for M_total:\n\nM_total = [0.5 K1^3 P (q+1)^3 ] / ( G \u03c0 ) \n\nHmm, but I still have G and \u03c0 in there, but perhaps the constants can be incorporated into a formula. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total mass M_total in solar masses when given K1 in km/s, period P in years, and the mass ratio q is: \n\nM_total = ( K1^3 * P * (q +1)^3 ) / ( 2.8646 * (q)^2 ) \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach where I can find the ratio of the masses between the two systems. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio M1_total / M2_total. \n\nLet me denote system 1 and system 2. \n\nLet me compute the mass for each system separately using the same formula, then take the ratio. \n\nAssuming that the formula for total mass is:\n\nM_total = ( K1^3 * P ) / ( 2.8646 ) * something \n\nWait, perhaps I can find a formula that for a binary system with both K1 and K2, the total mass can be written as:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646 * (K1 + K2)/something ) \n\nAlternatively, I recall that when you have both velocities, the total mass can be expressed as:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / ( 2.8646 ) \n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of the case where K1 = K2, so the stars have the same mass. Then, the mass would be (2 K^3 P)/(2.8646). \n\nAlternatively, let me test with a simple case. Suppose both stars have the same mass, so M1 = M2. Then K1 = K2 (since they have the same orbital speed). Let me see. \n\nIf M1 = M2, then their velocities are equal (since they are orbiting each other at the same orbital radius). \n\nThen, the total mass is 2M. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/( G P^2 ) \n\nAlso, the velocity K = (2\u03c0 a)/(P) (since a1 = a/2 for each star). \n\nSo K = (2 \u03c0 a)/P \u2192 a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ) \n\nSubstitute into M_total equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2 )) * ( (K P/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P^2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3/P^2 = P \n\nThus:\n\nM_total = (0.5 / (G \u03c0 )) * K^3 P \n\nHmm, so M_total = (K^3 P )/( (2 G \u03c0 ) )\n\nBut to get this into units of solar masses, perhaps the formula includes a conversion factor. \n\nThe standard formula I remember is that the mass in solar masses is given by:\n\nM = (a^3)/(P^2) \n\nwhere a is in AU and P is in years. \n\nBut to combine with the velocity, perhaps need to express a in terms of K. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula I just derived for the case where K1=K2 (so equal masses):\n\nM_total = (K^3 P )/(2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut if I want to express this in solar masses, perhaps we can write it as:\n\nM_total = ( K^3 P ) / (2.8646 ) \n\nwhere K is in km/s and P is in years. \n\nWait, perhaps the constant 2.8646 comes from the units conversion. \n\nLet me check the units. \n\nG is 6.674\u00d710^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 \n\nBut if we want to convert to solar masses, perhaps the formula is already normalized. \n\nAlternatively, let me look up the formula for the total mass of a spectroscopic binary. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula when you have both radial velocities is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nThis is a possibility. Let me see. \n\nSuppose K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes in km/s, P in years, then M_total in solar masses. \n\nIf this is the case, then for system 1, the mass would be:\n\nM1 = (10^3 + 5^3)*2 / 2.8646 \n\nWait, 10^3 is 1000, 5^3 is 125 \u2192 total is 1125. Multiply by P=2 \u2192 1125*2 = 2250, divided by 2.8646 \u2192 2250 /2.8646 \u2248 785. \n\nFor system 2, K1=15 and K2=10. \n\n15\u00b3 = 3375, 10\u00b3=1000 \u2192 total is 4375. Multiply by P=1 \u2192 4375. Divide by 2.8646 \u2192 4375 /2.8646 \u2248 1527 \n\nThen the ratio M1/M2 would be 785 / 1527 \u2248 0.514, which is approximately 0.5, but the options are 0.4, 0.6, etc. Hmm. But the options don't have 0.5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Maybe it's (K1*K2*P)/something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is for each star's mass, not the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is proportional to (K^3 P), but with a different approach. \n\nWait, let's think of the formula for the mass function again. \n\nThe mass function f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nWhich equals (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nAssuming edge-on, sin i =1. \n\nSimilarly for the other star: \n\nf(m2) = (M1^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nSo, the two mass functions are f(m1) and f(m2) for each star. \n\nThe total mass M_total = M1 + M2 \n\nWe can write two equations:\n\nf(m1) = M2^3/(M_total^2) = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nf(m2) = M1^3/(M_total^2) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nLet me denote the right-hand side as C = (K^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nSo f(m1) = C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nf(m2) = C2 = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nThen, from f(m1) = M2^3/M_total\u00b2 = C1 \n\nand f(m2) = M1^3/M_total\u00b2 = C2 \n\nLet me take the ratio of f(m1)/f(m2) = (M2^3/M1^3) = (C1/C2) \n\nWhich gives (M2/M1)^3 = (C1/C2) \n\nSo (M2/M1)^3 = (K1^3 / K2^3) \n\nWhich implies that M2/M1 = K1/K2 \u2192 which matches earlier findings. \n\nSo M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo, M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = (K1/K2) M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nNow, substitute M2 into the first equation: \n\nf(m1) = (M2^3)/(M_total^2) = C1 \n\nSubstituting M2: \n\n[ ( (K1/K2 M1 )^3 ) ] / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nBut M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ), so substitute that in: \n\n[ ( (K1/K2)^3 (M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ))^3 ) ] / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nSimplify numerator: \n\n(K1/K2)^3 * M_total^3 / (1 + K1/K2)^3 \n\nDivide by M_total^2 gives:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 * M_total / (1 + K1/K2)^3 = C1 \n\nThen solving for M_total:\n\nM_total = C1 * (1 + K1/K2)^3 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\n= C1 * ( ( (K2 + K1)/K2 )^3 ) / ( (K1)^3 / K2^3 ) )\n\n= C1 * ( (K1 + K2)^3 / K2^3 ) * (K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nWait, perhaps simplifying step by step. \n\nLet me let q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, M_total = C1 * ( (1 + q )^3 ) / ( q^3 ) \n\nBut C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nSo substituting:\n\nM_total = [ (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) ] * ( (1 + q)^3 ) / q^3 \n\n= (K1^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G q^3 ) \n\nBut since q = K1/K2, so (1 + q) = (K2 + K1)/K2 \n\nWait, but perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nAlternatively, substitute q = K1/K2 \u2192 q^3 = K1^3 / K2^3 \n\nThus,\n\nM_total = [ (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) ] * ( (1 + K1/K2 )^3 ) / ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) \n\n= (K1^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G) * ( ( (K2 + K1)/K2 )^3 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe K1^3 cancels with denominator, K2^3 cancels with numerator's (K2)^-3 from the first term. \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G) ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 ) \n\nWait, really? Let me see:\n\nBreaking down the terms:\n\nThe first term is (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nMultiply by ( (K1 + K2)^3 / K2^3 ) \n\nMultiply by ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nSo the K1^3 cancels with the denominator's K1^3, and the K2^3 cancels with the denominator's K2^3. \n\nSo indeed, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\nM_total = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G) ) * ( K1 + K2 )^3 \n\nWait, this is a very neat result. \n\nSo the total mass of the binary system is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut this is in kg, but we need it in solar masses. \n\nHmm, so perhaps this is the key formula. \n\nSo if I can write the total mass in terms of (K1 + K2)^3 * P divided by some constant, then the ratio between the two systems can be computed. \n\nLet me write the formula as:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nNow, the question asks for the ratio M1/M2. \n\nLet me compute this ratio for system1 and system2. \n\nLet me denote for system1: \n\nK1a =10 km/s, K1b=5 km/s, P1=2 years \n\nTotal K_sum1 = 10 +5=15 km/s \n\nSimilarly, system2: \n\nK2a=15, K2b=10, P2=1 year \n\nK_sum2 =15+10=25 km/s \n\nThus,\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) / (2 \u03c0 G) ] / [ (25^3 *1 ) / (2 \u03c0 G) ) ] \n\nThe (2 \u03c0 G) terms cancel, so:\n\nM1/M2 = (15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) \n\nCompute this:\n\n15^3 = 3375 \n\n25^3 = 15625 \n\nSo,\n\n(3375 *2 ) /15625 = 6750 /15625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750 /25 = 270 \n\n15625 /25 = 625 \n\n270/625 = (270 \u00f7 5)/(625 \u00f75 ) = 54/125 \n\n54 divided by 125 is 0.432 \n\nApproximately 0.43. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.4, B is ~0.6. \n\nHmm, but the calculation gives ~0.43, which is closer to 0.4. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the formula. \n\nWait the formula I derived was M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nBut is this correct? \n\nWait, let me check the steps again. \n\nWe started with f(m) = M2^3/(M_total^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSimilarly for the other star. \n\nThen through substitution, we ended up with M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nHmm, but let me test with an example where K1 = K2. \n\nIf K1=K2=K, then M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut when K1=K2, the stars have equal mass, so each has mass M. \n\nTotal mass 2M. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P^2) \n\nThe orbital velocity K = (2 \u03c0 a)/P \u2192 a = K P/(2 \u03c0 ) \n\nSubstituting into M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 ))*( (K P/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2 )) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P ) / ( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula I derived, when K1 + K2 = 2K, \n\nM_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (8 K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (4 K^3 P)/( \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is different from the correct value ( K^3 P/(2 G \u03c0 ) ). \n\nSo that suggests my derivation has an error. \n\nHmm, so my mistake must be in the derivation steps. \n\nGoing back. \n\nEarlier, I had: \n\nStarting with f(m1) = M2^3/M_total\u00b2 = C1 \n\nAnd f(m2) = M1^3/M_total\u00b2 = C2 \n\nThen, by taking the ratio f(m1)/f(m2) = (M2/M1)^3 = C1/C2 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nThen, from there, M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nThen, substituting into M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThen, substituting into f(m1)= M2^3 / M_total\u00b2 \n\n\u2192 M2^3 / ( ( M1 (1 + K1/K2 ))^2 ) = C1 \n\nBut M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1/K2)^3 M1^3 ) / ( M1\u00b2 (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 ) ) = C1 \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: \n\nM1^3 cancels to M1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1/K2)^3 M1 ) / ( (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 ) = C1 \n\nThen, solving for M1:\n\nM1 = C1 * (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\n= C1 * ( (1 + q )\u00b2 / q^3 ), where q=K1/K2 \n\nBut C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSo substituting:\n\nM1 = (K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G )) * ( ( (1 + q )^2 ) / q^3 ) \n\n= ( K1^3 P (1 + q)^2 ) / (2 \u03c0 G q^3 ) \n\nBut since q = K1/K2, \n\n(1 + q ) = ( K2 + K1 )/K2 \n\nAnd q^3 = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nThus, \n\nM1 = ( K1^3 P / (2 \u03c0 G )) * ( ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) / ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) ) \n\nSimplify denominator terms:\n\nDividing by (K1^3/K2^3 ) is multiplying by (K2^3/K1^3 )\n\nSo:\n\n= ( K1^3 P / 2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nThe K1^3 cancels with denominator, K2^2 cancels with numerator's K2^3 leaving K2. \n\nThus:\n\nM1 = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G )) * (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 \n\nHmm, so M1 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K1 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nThus, the total mass is M_total = M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 P / (2 \u03c0 G )) * ( K2 + K1 ) \n\n= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, so that brings us back to the previous result. \n\nBut then in the example where K1 = K2 = K, then M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law when K1=K2=K, the total mass should be ( (2K)^3 P )/( 16 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, let me check with K1=K2=K. \n\nIn that case, each star has mass M. Total mass 2M. \n\nUsing the formula above: \n\nM_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law with a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/(G P^2) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 )) * ( (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\n= 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 )) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula derived earlier, it's ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (8 K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P/( \u03c0 G ), which is twice the correct value. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the formula I derived is incorrect. \n\nWhere is the mistake? \n\nWait in the example, the formula gives twice the correct value. \n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. \n\nLet me go back to the step where I substituted into the equation for f(m1). \n\nWe had: \n\nf(m1) = M2^3 / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nThen substituting M2 = (K1/K2) M1 and M_total = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ), \n\nthen:\n\nM2^3 / ( M_total^2 ) = ( (K1/K2)^3 M1^3 ) / ( M1^2 (1 + K1/K2 )^2 ) \n\n= ( (K1/K2)^3 M1 ) / ( (1 + K1/K2 )^2 ) \n\nSet equal to C1 \n\nThen solving for M1 gives:\n\nM1 = C1 * (1 + K1/K2 )^2 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\nBut C1 is (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), so substituting:\n\nM1 = [ K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ] * ( (1 + q)^2 ) / q^3 \n\nwhere q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, substituting q = K1/K2, so 1 + q = (K2 + K1)/K2 \n\nThus,\n\nM1 = K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) / ( (K1^3)/(K2^3 )) \n\n= K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 ) \n\nYes, so that's M1. \n\nThen total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * (K1 + K2)^2 K2 ) * ( (K2 + K1)/K2 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ) * (K1 + K2)^3 \n\nThus the formula for M_total is correct. \n\nBut in the case where K1 = K2 = K, this formula gives M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law with a = K P/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/(G P\u00b2 ) \n\n= 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula above, it's ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 8 K^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P/( \u03c0 G ), which is double the correct value. \n\nThis inconsistency means there's a mistake. \n\nAh, I see the problem now. \n\nThe formula for the mass function is f(m) = M2^3 sin^3 i / ( (M_total)^2 ), and that equals (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), but when I used the mass function in the derivation, I assumed that f(m) is M2^3/(M_total)^2, which is correct when sin i =1. \n\nBut in the example with K1=K2, the mass function f(m1) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 \n\nBut in that case, since M1 = M2 = M, then f(m1) = M^3/( (2M)^2 ) = M/4 \n\nBut according to the formula (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), with K1=K, \n\nf(m1) = (K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 ), and a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nso substituting a into M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ) )^3 \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\nSo M_total = ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nThus, f(m1) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 = M^3/( (K^3 P/(2 G \u03c0 ))^2 ) \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, let me plug numbers into both formulas. \n\nExample: \n\nLet K1 = K2 = 10 km/s, P = 1 year \n\nThen according to my derived formula, M_total = ( (20)^3 * 1 )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\n= 8000/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nAccording to Kepler's third law with a = (10 km/s * 1 year)/(2 \u03c0 ). \n\nWait, units are mixed here. Need to convert to consistent units. \n\nPerhaps this is where the mistake is. The formula requires all units to be in certain terms. \n\nThe formula I derived assumes that K is in km/s, P is in years, and M_total is in solar masses, but to make that work, the constants must be adjusted. \n\nThe standard formula for the mass function in solar masses is: \n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2940 ) \n\nwhere K is in km/s and P in years. \n\nThe constant 2940 comes from unit conversions. \n\nThus, the correct formula with the constants included might be:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2 )^3 * P ) / ( 2940 * something ) \n\nAlternatively, let me look up the exact formula. \n\nAccording to some references, the mass of a binary system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 * K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2940 * (K1 + K2)^2 ) \n\nWait, I found a reference here (in my mind) that for a binary system with both radial velocity amplitudes known, the total mass is given by:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * (K1 + K2) * P) / (2940) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I derived is correct but requires the constants to be included. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe formula is M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut to express M_total in solar masses, we need to convert the units. \n\nLet me compute the constants properly. \n\nLet me write the formula with all units in SI units: \n\nM_total is in kg \n\nK is in m/s \n\nP is in seconds \n\nG is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 \n\nThen, \n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nTo convert to solar masses, note that 1 solar mass = 1.989e30 kg. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the conversion factor. \n\nLet me compute the constants numerically. \n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator in the formula for M_total. \n\nLet me assume that the formula is correct, then the ratio between the two systems would be: \n\nM1/M2 = [ (15 km/s)^3 * 2 yr ] / [ (25 km/s)^3 *1 yr ] \n\n= (3375 * 2 ) / (15625 *1 ) \n\n= 6750 /15625 \u2248 0.432 \n\nWhich is approximately 0.4, option A. \n\nGiven that the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, the closest is A. \n\nBut why in the example with K1=K2, the formula gives double the correct value? Maybe the formula is correct when the units are properly considered. \n\nPerhaps the issue is that in the example, I didn't use the correct units. \n\nLet me try with K in km/s, P in years, and M_total in solar masses. \n\nSuppose K1 = K2 = 10 km/s, P = 1 year. \n\nUsing the formula M_total = ( (20)^3 *1 ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut to get solar masses, we need to express G in appropriate units. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula with constants is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2.8646 * 1e3 ) \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2.8646 * 1e3 ) \n\nWait, where 2.8646 comes from. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the mass function formula with constants. \n\nThe mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2940 ) \n\nWhich gives M2^3/(M_total)^2 = (K1^3 P)/2940 \n\nThus, M_total = M2*( (K1^3 P )/(2940 f(m) ))^(1/2) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, let me proceed with the ratio calculation using the derived formula, since the question is asking for the ratio between the two systems. \n\nThe ratio M1/M2 is ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) \u2248 0.432 \n\nWhich is closest to option A (0.4). \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Their orbital periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are fractions like 0.4, 0.6, etc. \n\nThe key here is probably using the relationship between the orbital period and the masses of the stars. I remember that for a binary system, Kepler's third law applies, which in the astronomical form might be something like (P^2) = (a^3)/(M_total), where P is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis, and M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars. But wait, I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nOh right, the formula is usually written as P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G)(a\u00b3)/(M1 + M2). But since we are comparing two systems, maybe we can set up a ratio to eliminate some variables. \n\nAlternatively, there's another approach using the radial velocity amplitudes. The radial velocity curves of the stars in a binary system depend on their masses and the orbital parameters. The formula for the radial velocity amplitude K of each star is given by K = (v) * (M_secondary)/(M_total) * sin(i), where v is some velocity term related to the orbit. But I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nWait, let's think again. The radial velocity amplitude K for each star in a spectroscopic binary is given by:\n\nK\u2081 = (2\u03c0 a\u2081 sin i) / (P * sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)) \n\nBut since we're probably assuming circular orbits (since the problem doesn't mention eccentricity), the denominator simplifies to P. Also, a\u2081 is the semi-major axis of star 1's orbit. Similarly for K\u2082. \n\nBut since the two stars orbit their common center of mass, a\u2081/a\u2082 = M\u2082/M\u2081. Because the distances are inversely proportional to their masses. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function, but maybe there's a simpler way here. Let me see. \n\nThe total mass of the system is M1 + M2. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to their respective masses. Let's denote K1 and K2 as the velocities for the two stars in each system. \n\nThe formula for the mass of each star can be written in terms of their K values. Let me think. \n\nThe ratio of the masses is M1/M2 = (K2/K1) * (a2/a1). But since a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the two stars), and a1/a2 = M2/M1. So a2 = (M1/M2) * a1. \n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, there's a formula that relates the mass of the system to the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for a binary system, the mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using:\n\nM_total = (K1^3 P) / (2.8646 * sin\u00b3i) \n\nWait, but that's assuming that the inclination angle i is 90 degrees (edge-on), which would make sin i = 1. But since the systems exhibit eclipses, that implies that they are edge-on, so i=90, so sin i =1. So maybe we can use that. \n\nThe formula I recall is that the total mass of the binary system (in solar masses) is equal to ( (K1^3 * P) / (2.8646) ) when in units of K in km/s, P in years, and masses in solar masses. Wait, but I might be mixing up some constants here. Let me check my memory. \n\nAlternatively, the formula derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity relation. \n\nLet me write down the equations properly. \n\nFor a binary system, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis (a) and the total mass (M_total) by Kepler's third law:\n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G)(a\u00b3)/(M_total)\n\nSo rearranged, M_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2)\n\nBut also, the radial velocity of each star is related to their orbital speed. The orbital speed of each star is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P, and similarly v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are these orbital speeds (assuming edge-on, so sin i =1). \n\nAlso, since the two stars orbit the center of mass, a1 / a2 = M2 / M1. Therefore, a1 + a2 = a (the total separation between the stars). So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a.\n\nSo the velocities are v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) is (v1/v2) = (M2/M1). \n\nSo K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 \n\nSo the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = (K2/K1 +1) * M2 \n\nHmm, not sure if this helps yet. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the individual mass expressions. \n\nThe radial velocity of star 1 is K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nSince a1 + a2 = a (the semi-major axis between the two stars), but the center of mass is at a1*M1 = a2*M2. \n\nSo, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSimilarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 and K2:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nLet me divide these equations. \n\nK1/K2 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) / (M1/(M1 + M2)) ) \n\nThe denominators cancel, so K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nSo the mass ratio of the two stars in a system is inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes. \n\nNow, the total mass of the system is M_total = M1 + M2. Let me express this in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nFrom M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 \n\nSo substituting into M_total: \n\nM_total = M2 ( K2/K1 + 1 ) \n\n= M2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 ) \n\nHmm, but perhaps we can find another relation. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for an expression that relates K1, K2, P, and M_total. \n\nLet me recall that the formula for the total mass in a binary system (in solar masses) when the period is in years and the velocities are in km/s, and assuming edge-on (so sin i=1) is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 * P) + (K2^3 * P) ) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the mass of each star can be written as:\n\nM1 = (K1^3 * P) / (2.8646 * sin^3 i) \n\nWait, perhaps that's for the mass of a single star? Wait, no, maybe the formula is for the mass function. Let me think again. \n\nThe mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:\n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P) / (2\u03c0 G) \n\nBut this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since both systems are eclipsing binaries, which means that the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. \n\nTherefore, we can use the formula for the total mass in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nLet me consider that for each system, the total mass can be found using the relation between the velocities and the period. \n\nLet me denote for system 1: \n\nK1a = 10 km/s (star 1's RV), K1b =5 km/s (star 2's RV). \n\nSimilarly, system 2 has K2a=15, K2b=10. \n\nThe total mass of system1 is M1_total = M1a + M1b \n\nSimilarly, system2's M2_total = M2a + M2b. \n\nWe need to find M1_total / M2_total. \n\nLet me see if I can express M_total in terms of K1, K2 and P. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nFrom the equations above: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nAnd from the center of mass: a1*M1 = a2*M2 \n\nSo a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nLet me let a = a1 + a2 (the total separation between the two stars). \n\nTherefore, a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\na2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nThen, substituting into K1 and K2: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 / P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nLet me divide K1 by K2: \n\nK1/K2 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) / (M1/(M1 + M2)) ) = M2 / M1 \n\nSo that gives M1 = (K2/K1)*M2 \n\nSo total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = (K2/K1 + 1)*M2 \n\nHmm. Not sure if that's helpful yet. \n\nAlternatively, let's express a in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nMultiply K1 and K2 equations: \n\nK1 * K2 = (2\u03c0/P)^2 * (a1 a2) / (M1 + M2)^2 ) * a^2 \n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a relation between the product K1*K2 and the masses. \n\nAlternatively, let me square both equations and add them? \n\nAlternatively, let's combine the equations. \n\nLet me note that (K1/K2) = (M2/M1). \n\nLet me denote the mass ratio q = M1/M2. Then, K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \n\nSo K1/K2 = 1/q \u2192 q = K2/K1 \n\nTherefore, the mass ratio is q = K2/K1. \n\nSo for system 1, q1 = K1b / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5 \n\nSo M1a / M1b = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTherefore, total mass for system1: M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, system2 has K2a=15, K2b=10 \u2192 q2 = K2b/K2a = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2248 0.666 \n\nThus, M2a / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTherefore, M2_total = M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, to find the total mass of each system, we need to relate this to the orbital period. \n\nLet me use Kepler's third law. \n\nFor each system, M_total = (a^3)/(P^2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) \n\nBut since the actual value of a (semi-major axis) is related to the radial velocities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps express M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me see. \n\nWe can write a in terms of K1 and the mass. \n\nFrom the equation K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nWait, because a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \u2192 since a1 + a2 = a. \n\nWait, so a1 = (M2/M_total) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/M_total)*a \n\nSo rearranged, a = (K1 * P * M_total)/(2\u03c0 * M2) \n\nSimilarly, from Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2) \n\nSubstitute a from above into this equation. \n\nSo substituting a into the equation for M_total gives: \n\nM_total = (4\u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2)) * [ (K1 P M_total)/(2\u03c0 M2) ) ]^3 \n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can solve for M_total. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider combining the two equations. \n\nLet me see if there's a way to eliminate variables. \n\nAlternatively, let me use the relation between K1 and K2. \n\nLet me recall that in terms of the masses and the velocity amplitudes, there's a relation. \n\nLet me think of the total mass as M = M1 + M2 \n\nAnd the mass ratio q = M1/M2 \n\nThen, the radial velocities are related as K1/K2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \n\nSo K1 = (M2/M1) K2 \n\nSo K1 = (1/q) K2 \n\nTherefore, K1 * q = K2 \n\nSo q = K2 / K1 \n\nWhich we already have. \n\nNow, the total mass can be expressed in terms of q and K. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula for the mass function, which for a binary system is: \n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nBut since we have eclipses, sin i = 1, so f(m) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 \n\nThe mass function f(m) can also be written in terms of the radial velocity of star 1 (K1) and the period P: \n\nf(m) = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nWait, but I might need to check the exact formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646) ) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should look for a formula that combines K1, K2, and P. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the two equations for K1 and K2. \n\nWe have K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nAnd from center of mass: a1 M1 = a2 M2 \n\n=> a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nLet me let a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThen, since a1 + a2 = a (the total separation), \n\n(M2/M1) a2 + a2 = a \n\na2 ( M2/M1 +1 ) = a \n\na2 = a / (1 + M2/M1 ) = a/( (M1 + M2)/M1 ) ) = (a M1)/(M_total) \n\nSimilarly, a1 = (a M2)/M_total \n\nNow, substituting into the K equations: \n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * a1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (a M2)/(M_total) \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (a M1)/(M_total) \n\nMultiply K1 and K2: \n\nK1 K2 = (2\u03c0/(P))^2 * (a^2 M1 M2)/(M_total^2) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2) \n\nSo solving for a: \n\na\u00b3 = (G P\u00b2 M_total)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nThus, a = [ (G P\u00b2 M_total)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Let me see if I can find an expression for M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me square both K1 and K2 equations and add them? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nK2 = (2\u03c0 a2)/(P) \n\nSo, K1^2 + K2^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / P\u00b2)(a1\u00b2 + a2\u00b2 )\n\nBut not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, let me take the product K1*K2:\n\nK1*K2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1 a2)/(P\u00b2) \n\nAnd from the center of mass relation, a1 a2 = (a1 a2) \n\nBut since a1 = (M2/M1) a2, then a1 a2 = (M2/M1) a2\u00b2 \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's express M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P. \n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFrom K1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/(P) \n\nand a1 = (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nSo substituting into K1 gives:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (M2/(M_total)) * a \n\nSimilarly, from Kepler's third law, a\u00b3 = (G (M_total) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nTherefore, a = [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nSubstitute this a into the K1 equation:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/(P)) * (M2/M_total) * [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nLet me simplify this expression. \n\nLet me compute each part step by step. \n\nFirst, the term [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3) \n\nLet me write it as (G M_total P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nSo, substituting into K1:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0/P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nSimplify exponents and terms:\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n= [2\u03c0 / P ] * [ (M2 / M_total) ] * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) ) ]\n\nLet me handle the constants first. \n\nThe constants are:\n\n2\u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) \n\nLet me write 4 \u03c0\u00b2 as (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2). So (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3) = (2\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2)^1/3 = 2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)\n\nSo 2\u03c0 divided by that is (2 \u03c0) / (2^(2/3) \u03c0^(2/3)) ) \n\n= 2^(1 - 2/3) \u03c0^(1 - 2/3) \n\n= 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) \n\nSo that's the constant factor. \n\nNow, the remaining terms:\n\n(M2/M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2 )^(1/3) \n\nLet me write the exponents:\n\n(M2 / M_total) * [ G^(1/3) (M_total)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) ]\n\n= M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^( -1 + 1/3 ) (P)^(2/3) \n\n= M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) \n\nPutting all together:\n\nK1 = 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) * [ M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ] \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can cube both sides to eliminate the fractional exponents. \n\nLet me cube both sides of the equation for K1:\n\nK1^3 = [ 2^(1/3) \u03c0^(1/3) ]^3 * [ M2 * G^(1/3) (M_total)^(-2/3) P^(2/3) ]^3 \n\nCalculating the first term cubed: 2^(1) \u03c0^(1) \n\nThe second term cubed:\n\nM2^3 * G^(1) (M_total)^(-2) P^2 \n\nSo altogether: \n\nK1^3 = 2 \u03c0 * M2^3 G / ( M_total^2 ) * P^2 \n\nRearranged:\n\nK1^3 = (2 \u03c0 G P^2) * (M2^3)/(M_total^2) \n\nBut from the mass function, f(m) = M2^3/(M_total^2) \n\nSo substituting that in: \n\nK1^3 = 2 \u03c0 G P^2 f(m) \n\nTherefore, f(m) = K1^3 / (2 \u03c0 G P^2) \n\nBut the mass function f(m) is also equal to (M2^3 sin^3i)/(M_total^2). Since sin i =1, f(m)=M2^3/M_total^2. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is not leading me where I need to go. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each system, the total mass can be written as:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, I think I've heard a formula where if you have both K1 and K2, then the total mass can be calculated. Let me see. \n\nWait, I found a resource in my mind where if you have both radial velocity amplitudes, then the total mass can be found using:\n\nM_total = (K1^3 + K2^3) * P / (2.8646) \n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the total mass when you have both K1 and K2 is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1*K2)^3 * P ) / (2.8646 * (K1 + K2)^2 ) \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the mass ratio and use Kepler's third law. \n\nSince the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me denote q = K2/K1 \n\nThen, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + M2 = q M2 + M2 = M2 (q + 1) \n\nSo M2 = M_total/(q +1 ) \n\nNow, let me use Kepler's third law for the system. \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/( G P^2 ) \n\nBut also, from the radial velocity of one star, say star 1, \n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a \n\nSo substituting: \n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * ( M2/(M_total) ) * a \n\nRearranged, \n\na = ( K1 P M_total ) / ( 2 \u03c0 M2 ) \n\nPlug this into the equation for M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2)) * [ ( K1 P M_total / (2 \u03c0 M2 ) ) ]^3 \n\nLet me compute the cube term:\n\n[ (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) ) ]^3 = (K1^3 P^3 M_total^3)/( 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nSo substituting into M_total equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2)) * ( K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator terms to get:\n\nM_total = [4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ] / [ G P^2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/(8) = 1/2; \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0; P^3/P^2 = P \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = ( (1/2) * K1^3 P * M_total^3 ) / ( G \u03c0 M2^3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by G \u03c0 M2^3:\n\nM_total * G \u03c0 M2^3 = (1/2) K1^3 P M_total^3 \n\nRearranged:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 / ( (1/2) K1^3 P ) ) = M_total^2 \n\nHmm, this seems too complex. Maybe this path isn't the best. \n\nAlternatively, since both systems are eclipsing, so we can assume sin i=1. \n\nLet me try to compute the mass for each system using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nWait, maybe that's the case. Wait, I think the formula for the mass of a binary when you have both radial velocities is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nBut I need to verify. Let me think of units. \n\nThe standard formula for mass from radial velocity and period is when you have one star's velocity, then the mass function is f(m)= (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), which is equal to (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nBut if you have both velocities, perhaps you can get the total mass directly. \n\nAlternatively, since the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses (K1/K2 = M2/M1), so K1 * M1 = K2 * M2 \n\nSo, K1 M1 = K2 M2 \n\n=> M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nTherefore, total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nBut how to relate to period? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the total mass as:\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nM_total = (a^3 P^-2) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2/G )\n\nBut to express a in terms of K and the masses. \n\nWait, since K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nand a1 = (M2/(M_total)) a \n\nSo K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) a \n\n=> a = ( K1 P M_total ) / (2 \u03c0 M2 ) \n\nSimilarly, substituting into the M_total equation: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2)) * ( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 \n\nLet me expand the cube term:\n\n( (K1 P M_total)/(2 \u03c0 M2) )^3 = (K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 ) )\n\nNow, substituting into the equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 M2^3) )\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K1^3 P^3 M_total^3 ) / ( G P\u00b2 * 8 \u03c0^3 M2^3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3 / P^2 = P \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = (0.5 * K1^3 P M_total^3 ) / ( G \u03c0 M2^3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by G \u03c0 M2^3:\n\nM_total * G \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^3 \n\nDivide both sides by M_total:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nHmm, still complicated. Let me see if I can express M2 in terms of M_total and the mass ratio. \n\nWe know that M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nAnd M1 + M2 = M_total \n\nSo M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nWait, since M2 = (K1/K2) M1, then substituting into total mass: \n\nM1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M_total \n\nM1 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) = M_total \n\nSo M1 = M_total / ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = (K1/K2) * M_total / (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo substituting M2 into the equation:\n\nG \u03c0 [ (K1/K2 M1)^3 ] = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nWait, substituting M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nWait, perhaps substituting M2 in terms of M_total. \n\nAlternatively, let me substitute M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nBut M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ), so M2 = (K1/K2)*( M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) )\n\nLet me denote q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, M2 = q M1 \n\nWait, no, K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 so M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nWait, K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) M2 \n\nSo, perhaps using q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me define q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nThen, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M_total = q M2 + M2 = M2 (q +1 ) \u2192 M2 = M_total/(q +1 )\n\nSo substituting M2 = M_total/(q+1) into the equation:\n\nG \u03c0 [ M2^3 ] = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nWait, the equation earlier was:\n\nG \u03c0 M2^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nSo substituting M2 = M_total/(q +1):\n\nG \u03c0 ( M_total^3 / (q+1)^3 ) ) = 0.5 K1^3 P M_total^2 \n\nMultiply both sides by (q+1)^3 / M_total^2 \n\nG \u03c0 M_total / (q+1)^3 = 0.5 K1^3 P \n\nThen, solving for M_total:\n\nM_total = [0.5 K1^3 P (q+1)^3 ] / ( G \u03c0 ) \n\nHmm, but I still have G and \u03c0 in there, but perhaps the constants can be incorporated into a formula. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total mass M_total in solar masses when given K1 in km/s, period P in years, and the mass ratio q is: \n\nM_total = ( K1^3 * P * (q +1)^3 ) / ( 2.8646 * (q)^2 ) \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach where I can find the ratio of the masses between the two systems. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio M1_total / M2_total. \n\nLet me denote system 1 and system 2. \n\nLet me compute the mass for each system separately using the same formula, then take the ratio. \n\nAssuming that the formula for total mass is:\n\nM_total = ( K1^3 * P ) / ( 2.8646 ) * something \n\nWait, perhaps I can find a formula that for a binary system with both K1 and K2, the total mass can be written as:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * P) / (2.8646 * (K1 + K2)/something ) \n\nAlternatively, I recall that when you have both velocities, the total mass can be expressed as:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / ( 2.8646 ) \n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of the case where K1 = K2, so the stars have the same mass. Then, the mass would be (2 K^3 P)/(2.8646). \n\nAlternatively, let me test with a simple case. Suppose both stars have the same mass, so M1 = M2. Then K1 = K2 (since they have the same orbital speed). Let me see. \n\nIf M1 = M2, then their velocities are equal (since they are orbiting each other at the same orbital radius). \n\nThen, the total mass is 2M. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/( G P^2 ) \n\nAlso, the velocity K = (2\u03c0 a)/(P) (since a1 = a/2 for each star). \n\nSo K = (2 \u03c0 a)/P \u2192 a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ) \n\nSubstitute into M_total equation:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2 )) * ( (K P/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P^2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3/P^2 = P \n\nThus:\n\nM_total = (0.5 / (G \u03c0 )) * K^3 P \n\nHmm, so M_total = (K^3 P )/( (2 G \u03c0 ) )\n\nBut to get this into units of solar masses, perhaps the formula includes a conversion factor. \n\nThe standard formula I remember is that the mass in solar masses is given by:\n\nM = (a^3)/(P^2) \n\nwhere a is in AU and P is in years. \n\nBut to combine with the velocity, perhaps need to express a in terms of K. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the formula I just derived for the case where K1=K2 (so equal masses):\n\nM_total = (K^3 P )/(2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut if I want to express this in solar masses, perhaps we can write it as:\n\nM_total = ( K^3 P ) / (2.8646 ) \n\nwhere K is in km/s and P is in years. \n\nWait, perhaps the constant 2.8646 comes from the units conversion. \n\nLet me check the units. \n\nG is 6.674\u00d710^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 \n\nBut if we want to convert to solar masses, perhaps the formula is already normalized. \n\nAlternatively, let me look up the formula for the total mass of a spectroscopic binary. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula when you have both radial velocities is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P ) / (2.8646) \n\nThis is a possibility. Let me see. \n\nSuppose K1 and K2 are the radial velocity amplitudes in km/s, P in years, then M_total in solar masses. \n\nIf this is the case, then for system 1, the mass would be:\n\nM1 = (10^3 + 5^3)*2 / 2.8646 \n\nWait, 10^3 is 1000, 5^3 is 125 \u2192 total is 1125. Multiply by P=2 \u2192 1125*2 = 2250, divided by 2.8646 \u2192 2250 /2.8646 \u2248 785. \n\nFor system 2, K1=15 and K2=10. \n\n15\u00b3 = 3375, 10\u00b3=1000 \u2192 total is 4375. Multiply by P=1 \u2192 4375. Divide by 2.8646 \u2192 4375 /2.8646 \u2248 1527 \n\nThen the ratio M1/M2 would be 785 / 1527 \u2248 0.514, which is approximately 0.5, but the options are 0.4, 0.6, etc. Hmm. But the options don't have 0.5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Maybe it's (K1*K2*P)/something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is for each star's mass, not the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass is proportional to (K^3 P), but with a different approach. \n\nWait, let's think of the formula for the mass function again. \n\nThe mass function f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nWhich equals (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nAssuming edge-on, sin i =1. \n\nSimilarly for the other star: \n\nf(m2) = (M1^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nSo, the two mass functions are f(m1) and f(m2) for each star. \n\nThe total mass M_total = M1 + M2 \n\nWe can write two equations:\n\nf(m1) = M2^3/(M_total^2) = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nf(m2) = M1^3/(M_total^2) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nLet me denote the right-hand side as C = (K^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nSo f(m1) = C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nf(m2) = C2 = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) \n\nThen, from f(m1) = M2^3/M_total\u00b2 = C1 \n\nand f(m2) = M1^3/M_total\u00b2 = C2 \n\nLet me take the ratio of f(m1)/f(m2) = (M2^3/M1^3) = (C1/C2) \n\nWhich gives (M2/M1)^3 = (C1/C2) \n\nSo (M2/M1)^3 = (K1^3 / K2^3) \n\nWhich implies that M2/M1 = K1/K2 \u2192 which matches earlier findings. \n\nSo M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo, M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = (K1/K2) M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nNow, substitute M2 into the first equation: \n\nf(m1) = (M2^3)/(M_total^2) = C1 \n\nSubstituting M2: \n\n[ ( (K1/K2 M1 )^3 ) ] / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nBut M1 = M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ), so substitute that in: \n\n[ ( (K1/K2)^3 (M_total/(1 + K1/K2 ))^3 ) ] / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nSimplify numerator: \n\n(K1/K2)^3 * M_total^3 / (1 + K1/K2)^3 \n\nDivide by M_total^2 gives:\n\n(K1/K2)^3 * M_total / (1 + K1/K2)^3 = C1 \n\nThen solving for M_total:\n\nM_total = C1 * (1 + K1/K2)^3 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\n= C1 * ( ( (K2 + K1)/K2 )^3 ) / ( (K1)^3 / K2^3 ) )\n\n= C1 * ( (K1 + K2)^3 / K2^3 ) * (K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nWait, perhaps simplifying step by step. \n\nLet me let q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, M_total = C1 * ( (1 + q )^3 ) / ( q^3 ) \n\nBut C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nSo substituting:\n\nM_total = [ (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) ] * ( (1 + q)^3 ) / q^3 \n\n= (K1^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G q^3 ) \n\nBut since q = K1/K2, so (1 + q) = (K2 + K1)/K2 \n\nWait, but perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of K1 and K2. \n\nAlternatively, substitute q = K1/K2 \u2192 q^3 = K1^3 / K2^3 \n\nThus,\n\nM_total = [ (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) ] * ( (1 + K1/K2 )^3 ) / ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) \n\n= (K1^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G) * ( ( (K2 + K1)/K2 )^3 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe K1^3 cancels with denominator, K2^3 cancels with numerator's (K2)^-3 from the first term. \n\nSo:\n\nM_total = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G) ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 ) \n\nWait, really? Let me see:\n\nBreaking down the terms:\n\nThe first term is (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nMultiply by ( (K1 + K2)^3 / K2^3 ) \n\nMultiply by ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nSo the K1^3 cancels with the denominator's K1^3, and the K2^3 cancels with the denominator's K2^3. \n\nSo indeed, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\nM_total = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G) ) * ( K1 + K2 )^3 \n\nWait, this is a very neat result. \n\nSo the total mass of the binary system is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut this is in kg, but we need it in solar masses. \n\nHmm, so perhaps this is the key formula. \n\nSo if I can write the total mass in terms of (K1 + K2)^3 * P divided by some constant, then the ratio between the two systems can be computed. \n\nLet me write the formula as:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nNow, the question asks for the ratio M1/M2. \n\nLet me compute this ratio for system1 and system2. \n\nLet me denote for system1: \n\nK1a =10 km/s, K1b=5 km/s, P1=2 years \n\nTotal K_sum1 = 10 +5=15 km/s \n\nSimilarly, system2: \n\nK2a=15, K2b=10, P2=1 year \n\nK_sum2 =15+10=25 km/s \n\nThus,\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) / (2 \u03c0 G) ] / [ (25^3 *1 ) / (2 \u03c0 G) ) ] \n\nThe (2 \u03c0 G) terms cancel, so:\n\nM1/M2 = (15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) \n\nCompute this:\n\n15^3 = 3375 \n\n25^3 = 15625 \n\nSo,\n\n(3375 *2 ) /15625 = 6750 /15625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750 /25 = 270 \n\n15625 /25 = 625 \n\n270/625 = (270 \u00f7 5)/(625 \u00f75 ) = 54/125 \n\n54 divided by 125 is 0.432 \n\nApproximately 0.43. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.4, B is ~0.6. \n\nHmm, but the calculation gives ~0.43, which is closer to 0.4. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the formula. \n\nWait the formula I derived was M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G) \n\nBut is this correct? \n\nWait, let me check the steps again. \n\nWe started with f(m) = M2^3/(M_total^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSimilarly for the other star. \n\nThen through substitution, we ended up with M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nHmm, but let me test with an example where K1 = K2. \n\nIf K1=K2=K, then M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut when K1=K2, the stars have equal mass, so each has mass M. \n\nTotal mass 2M. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P^2) \n\nThe orbital velocity K = (2 \u03c0 a)/P \u2192 a = K P/(2 \u03c0 ) \n\nSubstituting into M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 ))*( (K P/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P^2 )) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P ) / ( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula I derived, when K1 + K2 = 2K, \n\nM_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (8 K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (4 K^3 P)/( \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is different from the correct value ( K^3 P/(2 G \u03c0 ) ). \n\nSo that suggests my derivation has an error. \n\nHmm, so my mistake must be in the derivation steps. \n\nGoing back. \n\nEarlier, I had: \n\nStarting with f(m1) = M2^3/M_total\u00b2 = C1 \n\nAnd f(m2) = M1^3/M_total\u00b2 = C2 \n\nThen, by taking the ratio f(m1)/f(m2) = (M2/M1)^3 = C1/C2 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nThen, from there, M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nThen, substituting into M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThen, substituting into f(m1)= M2^3 / M_total\u00b2 \n\n\u2192 M2^3 / ( ( M1 (1 + K1/K2 ))^2 ) = C1 \n\nBut M2 = (K1/K2) M1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1/K2)^3 M1^3 ) / ( M1\u00b2 (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 ) ) = C1 \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: \n\nM1^3 cancels to M1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1/K2)^3 M1 ) / ( (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 ) = C1 \n\nThen, solving for M1:\n\nM1 = C1 * (1 + K1/K2 )\u00b2 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\n= C1 * ( (1 + q )\u00b2 / q^3 ), where q=K1/K2 \n\nBut C1 = (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSo substituting:\n\nM1 = (K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G )) * ( ( (1 + q )^2 ) / q^3 ) \n\n= ( K1^3 P (1 + q)^2 ) / (2 \u03c0 G q^3 ) \n\nBut since q = K1/K2, \n\n(1 + q ) = ( K2 + K1 )/K2 \n\nAnd q^3 = (K1/K2)^3 \n\nThus, \n\nM1 = ( K1^3 P / (2 \u03c0 G )) * ( ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) / ( K1^3 / K2^3 ) ) \n\nSimplify denominator terms:\n\nDividing by (K1^3/K2^3 ) is multiplying by (K2^3/K1^3 )\n\nSo:\n\n= ( K1^3 P / 2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\nThe K1^3 cancels with denominator, K2^2 cancels with numerator's K2^3 leaving K2. \n\nThus:\n\nM1 = ( P/(2 \u03c0 G )) * (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 \n\nHmm, so M1 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nSimilarly, M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K1 * P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nThus, the total mass is M_total = M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^2 P / (2 \u03c0 G )) * ( K2 + K1 ) \n\n= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, so that brings us back to the previous result. \n\nBut then in the example where K1 = K2 = K, then M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law when K1=K2=K, the total mass should be ( (2K)^3 P )/( 16 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, let me check with K1=K2=K. \n\nIn that case, each star has mass M. Total mass 2M. \n\nUsing the formula above: \n\nM_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law with a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/(G P^2) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 )) * ( (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\n= 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P^2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 )) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula derived earlier, it's ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = (8 K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P/( \u03c0 G ), which is twice the correct value. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the formula I derived is incorrect. \n\nWhere is the mistake? \n\nWait in the example, the formula gives twice the correct value. \n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation. \n\nLet me go back to the step where I substituted into the equation for f(m1). \n\nWe had: \n\nf(m1) = M2^3 / M_total^2 = C1 \n\nThen substituting M2 = (K1/K2) M1 and M_total = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ), \n\nthen:\n\nM2^3 / ( M_total^2 ) = ( (K1/K2)^3 M1^3 ) / ( M1^2 (1 + K1/K2 )^2 ) \n\n= ( (K1/K2)^3 M1 ) / ( (1 + K1/K2 )^2 ) \n\nSet equal to C1 \n\nThen solving for M1 gives:\n\nM1 = C1 * (1 + K1/K2 )^2 / ( (K1/K2)^3 ) \n\nBut C1 is (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), so substituting:\n\nM1 = [ K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ] * ( (1 + q)^2 ) / q^3 \n\nwhere q = K1/K2 \n\nThen, substituting q = K1/K2, so 1 + q = (K2 + K1)/K2 \n\nThus,\n\nM1 = K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) / ( (K1^3)/(K2^3 )) \n\n= K1^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 / K2^2 ) * ( K2^3 / K1^3 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ) * ( (K1 + K2)^2 * K2 ) \n\nYes, so that's M1. \n\nThen total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + (K1/K2) M1 = M1 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) * (K1 + K2)^2 K2 ) * ( (K2 + K1)/K2 ) \n\n= ( P/(2 \u03c0 G ) ) * (K1 + K2)^3 \n\nThus the formula for M_total is correct. \n\nBut in the case where K1 = K2 = K, this formula gives M_total = ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law with a = K P/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/(G P\u00b2 ) \n\n= 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/( 8 \u03c0^3 ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nBut according to the formula above, it's ( (2K)^3 P )/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 8 K^3 P/(2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P/( \u03c0 G ), which is double the correct value. \n\nThis inconsistency means there's a mistake. \n\nAh, I see the problem now. \n\nThe formula for the mass function is f(m) = M2^3 sin^3 i / ( (M_total)^2 ), and that equals (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), but when I used the mass function in the derivation, I assumed that f(m) is M2^3/(M_total)^2, which is correct when sin i =1. \n\nBut in the example with K1=K2, the mass function f(m1) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 \n\nBut in that case, since M1 = M2 = M, then f(m1) = M^3/( (2M)^2 ) = M/4 \n\nBut according to the formula (K1^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ), with K1=K, \n\nf(m1) = (K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut according to Kepler's third law: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 ), and a = (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ), \n\nso substituting a into M_total: \n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K P)/(2 \u03c0 ) )^3 \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * ( K^3 P^3 )/(8 \u03c0^3 ) \n\n= (4/(8)) * ( K^3 P )/( G \u03c0 ) \n\nSo M_total = ( K^3 P )/( 2 G \u03c0 ) \n\nThus, f(m1) = M2^3/(M_total)^2 = M^3/( (K^3 P/(2 G \u03c0 ))^2 ) \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, let me plug numbers into both formulas. \n\nExample: \n\nLet K1 = K2 = 10 km/s, P = 1 year \n\nThen according to my derived formula, M_total = ( (20)^3 * 1 )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\n= 8000/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nAccording to Kepler's third law with a = (10 km/s * 1 year)/(2 \u03c0 ). \n\nWait, units are mixed here. Need to convert to consistent units. \n\nPerhaps this is where the mistake is. The formula requires all units to be in certain terms. \n\nThe formula I derived assumes that K is in km/s, P is in years, and M_total is in solar masses, but to make that work, the constants must be adjusted. \n\nThe standard formula for the mass function in solar masses is: \n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P)/(2940 ) \n\nwhere K is in km/s and P in years. \n\nThe constant 2940 comes from unit conversions. \n\nThus, the correct formula with the constants included might be:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2 )^3 * P ) / ( 2940 * something ) \n\nAlternatively, let me look up the exact formula. \n\nAccording to some references, the mass of a binary system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 * K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2940 * (K1 + K2)^2 ) \n\nWait, I found a reference here (in my mind) that for a binary system with both radial velocity amplitudes known, the total mass is given by:\n\nM_total = (K1 * K2 * (K1 + K2) * P) / (2940) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I derived is correct but requires the constants to be included. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe formula is M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut to express M_total in solar masses, we need to convert the units. \n\nLet me compute the constants properly. \n\nLet me write the formula with all units in SI units: \n\nM_total is in kg \n\nK is in m/s \n\nP is in seconds \n\nG is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 \n\nThen, \n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nTo convert to solar masses, note that 1 solar mass = 1.989e30 kg. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the conversion factor. \n\nLet me compute the constants numerically. \n\nLet me compute the numerator and denominator in the formula for M_total. \n\nLet me assume that the formula is correct, then the ratio between the two systems would be: \n\nM1/M2 = [ (15 km/s)^3 * 2 yr ] / [ (25 km/s)^3 *1 yr ] \n\n= (3375 * 2 ) / (15625 *1 ) \n\n= 6750 /15625 \u2248 0.432 \n\nWhich is approximately 0.4, option A. \n\nGiven that the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, the closest is A. \n\nBut why in the example with K1=K2, the formula gives double the correct value? Maybe the formula is correct when the units are properly considered. \n\nPerhaps the issue is that in the example, I didn't use the correct units. \n\nLet me try with K in km/s, P in years, and M_total in solar masses. \n\nSuppose K1 = K2 = 10 km/s, P = 1 year. \n\nUsing the formula M_total = ( (20)^3 *1 ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut to get solar masses, we need to express G in appropriate units. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula with constants is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2.8646 * 1e3 ) \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2.8646 * 1e3 ) \n\nWait, where 2.8646 comes from. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the mass function formula with constants. \n\nThe mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2940 ) \n\nWhich gives M2^3/(M_total)^2 = (K1^3 P)/2940 \n\nThus, M_total = M2*( (K1^3 P )/(2940 f(m) ))^(1/2) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, let me proceed with the ratio calculation using the derived formula, since the question is asking for the ratio between the two systems. \n\nThe ratio M1/M2 is ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) \u2248 0.432 \n\nWhich is closest to option A (0.4). \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2, we use the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total mass. The total mass of a binary system can be derived from the formula involving the sum of the radial velocities and the orbital period. \n\nFor system_1:\n- Radial velocities: \\( K_1 = 10 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( K_2 = 5 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n- Total radial velocity sum: \\( K_{\\text{total1}} = 10 + 5 = 15 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n- Orbital period: \\( P_1 = 2 \\, \\text{years} \\)\n\nFor system_2:\n- Radial velocities: \\( K_1 = 15 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( K_2 = 10 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n- Total radial velocity sum: \\( K_{\\text{total2}} = 15 + 10 = 25 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n- Orbital period: \\( P_2 = 1 \\, \\text{year} \\)\n\nThe mass ratio \\( \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{(K_{\\text{total1}}^3 \\cdot P_1)}{(K_{\\text{total2}}^3 \\cdot P_2)} = \\frac{(15^3 \\cdot 2)}{(25^3 \\cdot 1)} = \\frac{3375 \\cdot 2}{15625} = \\frac{6750}{15625} \\approx 0.432\n\\]\n\nThis value is closest to **0.4**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me see. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given as A to D. Hmm.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that in binary systems, the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes can be used to find the masses. The key formula here is probably Kepler's third law, but adjusted for binary systems. Let me recall. The formula involving the masses and the period is something like (M1 + M2)^3 / (M1 * M2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) * a\u00b3 / P\u00b2, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, there's another approach where using the radial velocity amplitudes and the period gives the total mass.\n\nWait, right, the formula that relates the masses and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is important here. The radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are related to the masses of the stars. Since the stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because if star 1 has a velocity amplitude K1, then M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, so rearranged, that ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2. \n\nBut how does that tie into the total mass? Also, the orbital period comes into play here. The total mass of the system can be found using the formula derived from Kepler's third law, adjusted for binary systems. Let me think. The formula is (M1 + M2) = (K1^3 * P) / (2G\u03c0)^(2/3) ) or something like that? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact relation here.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula where the sum of the masses is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by some function of the period. Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering that for a binary system, the mass function can be used. The mass function is given by (v sin i)^3 / (K sin i)^3, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, perhaps the key is to use the fact that the product of the masses and their velocities equals the same for the other star, because they orbit the center of mass.\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote M1 and M2 as the masses of the two stars in a system. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1*M2 = M1^2*(K2/K1). Not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nThe total mass of the system is M_total = M1 + M2. \n\nNow, Kepler's third law for a binary system states that (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But here, we might need to relate the radial velocity amplitudes to the masses and the period.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula that relates the radial velocity amplitudes to the masses and the orbital period. Let me recall that the radial velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star, the orbital period, and the inclination. But since we don't know the inclination, perhaps we can assume that both systems are edge-on (so sin i = 1), which is necessary to observe eclipses. Since they do have eclipses, that means the orbital plane is edge-on, so inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. That's important because otherwise the formula would have a sin i term which we can't know. But since they are eclipsing binaries, we can assume sin i =1, so that term is 1, which simplifies things.\n\nSo, the formula for the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) * (M_other / (M1 + M2)) \n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the velocity of each star is related to the other star's mass and the total mass. Let me think. The orbital velocity of star 1 is v1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P, and similarly for star 2. The semi-major axes a1 and a2 are related by a1/a2 = M2/M1, since they orbit around the center of mass. The sum a1 + a2 = a_total (the distance between them), but perhaps that's getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, the formula that allows us to find the total mass is:\n\n(M1 + M2) = (K1^3 * P) / (2 G \u03c0) )^(something). Wait, perhaps the formula I need is:\n\n(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 * K2)^3 * P^2 ) / (2 G \u03c0^2 (K1 + K2)) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a better approach. Let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is related to the mass of the other star. Since they are orbiting each other, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. \n\nSo for system 1: K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s. So 10/5 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = 2*M1. Therefore, the total mass of system1 is M1 + 2M1 = 3M1.\n\nSimilarly for system2, K1 is 15 and K2 10, so 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = (3/2) M1. So total mass of system2 is M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.\n\nWait, but here I have two different M1 variables. Wait, no, the M1 and M2 are different for each system. Let me clarify variables.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses of the two stars in system1. Then K1a / K1b = M1b / M1a. Given K1a =10, K1b=5. So 10/5 = M1b/M1a \u2192 M1b = 2*M1a. So total mass of system1 is M1a + M1b = 3*M1a.\n\nSimilarly, for system2: let M2a and M2b be the masses. Their K values are 15 and 10. So K2a/K2b = M2b/M2a \u2192 15/10 = M2b/M2a \u2192 M2b = (15/10)*M2a = 1.5 M2a. So total mass of system2 is M2a + 1.5 M2a = 2.5 M2a.\n\nNow, to find the total mass of each system, I need another relation. The key is to use the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the total mass and the semi-major axis. But how to connect that with the radial velocity amplitudes?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use the formula that relates the radial velocity amplitude with the mass and period. Let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 a sin i) / (P) * (M_other / (M_total)) \n\nWait, but since sin i =1 (eclipsing system), this simplifies to K = (2 \u03c0 a / P) * (M_other / M_total )\n\nBut also, from Kepler's third law: (M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / G \n\nSo solving for a: a\u00b3 = (G (M_total) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ G (M_total) P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3)\n\nHmm, substituting back into K's equation:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a / (M_total) ) * M_other ]\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too tangled. Let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the mass function which allows us to compute the mass of one star in terms of the other. The mass function is:\n\nf(m) = (M sin\u00b3 i) / ( (1 + q)^2 ) ), where q = M2/M1, but maybe I need to look at this more carefully. \n\nAlternatively, since the stars are in a binary system, the orbital period P is related to the masses and the semi-major axes. Let me consider the two stars orbiting each other. The total mass M = M1 + M2. The distance between them is a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star around the center of mass.\n\nWe know that M1 a1 = M2 a2, so a1/a2 = M2/M1. Let me denote q = M2/M1. Then a1 = q a2. Since a1 + a2 = a (the total separation between the stars), then a2 (1 + q) = a \u2192 a2 = a/(1+q), a1 = q a/(1+q).\n\nThe orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law: \n\n( M ) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nSo rearranged, M = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nNow, the radial velocity of star 1 is v1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P. Similarly for star2, v2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P.\n\nBut the observed radial velocity amplitude K1 is equal to v1 (since sin i =1), so K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P. Similarly K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P.\n\nSo substituting a1 and a2 in terms of a and q:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( q a/(1+q) )\n\nK2 = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( a/(1+q) )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2 = q, which matches the earlier relation K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's try to express the total mass M in terms of K1, K2, and P.\n\nFrom the above expressions for K1 and K2:\n\nLet me solve for a from K1 and K2. Let's see.\n\nFrom K1 = (2 \u03c0 a q ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nBut q = M2/M1, and M1 + M2 = M. Let me see if we can express M in terms of K and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's express a in terms of K and P.\n\nFrom K2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nSo a = ( K2 P (1 + q) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nBut q = M2/M1. Since M = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + q ), so M1 = M/(1 + q )\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me try to find an expression for M in terms of K1, K2, and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the two expressions for K1 and K2.\n\nWe have K1 = (2 \u03c0 a q)/( P (1+q) )\n\nand K2 = (2 \u03c0 a )/( P (1+q) )\n\nMultiply K1 and K2:\n\nK1*K2 = (2 \u03c0 a q / ( P (1+q) )) * (2 \u03c0 a / ( P (1+q) )) ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b2 q ) / ( P\u00b2 (1+q)^2 )\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if I can express a in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nAlternatively, since K1/K2 = q, so q = K1/K2. Let me denote that q = K1/K2.\n\nThen, substituting into the expression for K2:\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nSo solving for a:\n\na = [ K2 P (1 + q) ] / ( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nNow, substitute this a into the expression for M:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging a into that:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * [ K2 P (1+q) / (2 \u03c0) ]^3 \n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, the a^3 term:\n\n[ K2 P (1+q)/(2\u03c0) ]^3 = (K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nThen, multiplying by 4 \u03c0\u00b2/( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nM = [4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2) ] * [ K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 / (8 \u03c0^3) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0\u00b3 = 1/\u03c0, P^3 / P^2 = P.\n\nSo:\n\nM = (0.5 / ( G \u03c0 )) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 )\n\nWait, let me recheck the exponents:\n\nWait, the 4\u03c0\u00b2 multiplied by the numerator (K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3) divided by denominator 8\u03c0^3 and multiplied by 1/(G P\u00b2):\n\nSo the entire expression is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3) / ( G P\u00b2 * 8 \u03c0^3) )\n\n= (4/(8 G)) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / \u03c0 \n\n= ( (1/2 G) ) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / \u03c0 \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the total mass of the system in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that since the mass of the system is M_total, then the velocity of each star is given by v = (2 \u03c0 a / P ), where a is their semi-major axis. The product of each star's velocity and its mass gives the same value (since M1 v1 = M2 v2 because of center of mass). \n\nWait, yes, because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. So:\n\nM1 / M2 = v2 / v1 \n\nSo that ratio is consistent with the K1/K2 ratio since their velocities are their radial velocity amplitudes (assuming edge-on, so v1 = K1, v2 = K2).\n\nTherefore, M1 / M2 = v2 / v1 = K2/K1 \u2192 M1 = M2 * (K2/K1 )\n\nSo the total mass is M1 + M2 = M2 ( 1 + K2/K1 )\n\nBut how do we get the actual mass? We need to relate the velocities to the period and the mass.\n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\n( M_total ) * P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) / G \n\nBut the distance a between the stars is a = a1 + a2, where a1 is semi-major axis of star1, a2 of star2.\n\nBut since a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nBut M2/M1 = (K1/K2) because M2/M1 = (v1/v2) = (K1/K2 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, since M1 v1 = M2 v2 \u2192 M1/M2 = v2/v1 \u2192 M2/M1 = v1/v2 = K1/K2 (since v1=K1, v2=K2)\n\nSo M2/M1 = K1/K2 \u2192 so a1 = (K1/K2) a2 \n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo a2 = a / (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThen, the velocity of star2 is v2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 ) / P \n\nSo K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nSubstituting a2:\n\nK2 = 2 \u03c0 / P * [ a / (1 + K1/K2 ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nK2 (1 + K1/K2 ) = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \u2192 \n\nK2 + K1 = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \n\nThus, a = ( (K1 + K2 ) P ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nOkay, so now we can substitute a into Kepler's law.\n\nThe total mass M_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in a:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the a^3 term:\n\n[ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) ) ]^3 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo M_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4 / 8 = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThus:\n\nM_total = (0.5 / ( G \u03c0 )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) \n\nWait, that gives:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm, but I need to check if that's correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me recast the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check the units to see if that makes sense. \n\nAssuming K is in km/s, P in years, but maybe the formula requires SI units. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's a standard formula for the total mass of an eclipsing binary in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nAlternatively, let me look for a different approach. \n\nLet me recall that the mass of the system can be found using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 * G * \u03c0 ) \n\nWait, but I need to check the derivation again. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the steps above. Let me try again.\n\nWait, in the previous steps:\n\nWe had a = ( (K1 + K2) P ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nThen, substituting into Kepler's formula:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )\n\nSo a^3 is [( (K1+K2) P / (2\u03c0) )]^3 \n\nSo that term is ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) / ( G P^2 )\n\nThe P^3 / P^2 is P, the \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0, and 4/8 is 0.5. \n\nSo that gives (4/(8 G \u03c0 )) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P \n\nWhich is ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm. So that's the formula for M_total?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here because I might have missed some constants. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other. Let me denote M1 and M2 as masses, and K1 and K2 as their radial velocities.\n\nWe have K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a2)/P \n\nAlso, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nTotal separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 ) \n\nSo a2 = a / (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nSubstituting back into K2:\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a / (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nSimilarly, K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a (M2/M1 ) / (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nSo, the ratio K1/K2 = (M2/M1 ) \u2192 which matches the earlier conclusion.\n\nNow, let's express a in terms of K1 and K2. Let me solve for a from K2's equation:\n\nFrom K2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nBut since M2/M1 = (K1/K2 ), from the ratio above.\n\nThus,\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + K1/K2 ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nK2 (1 + K1/K2 ) = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \n\nLeft side: K2 + K1 \n\nThus, a = ( (K1 + K2 ) P )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nSame as before. \n\nSo plugging back into Kepler's third law:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nNow, substituting a:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0 ) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute this again step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the a^3 term:\n\n[ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) ) ]^3 = (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2):\n\nSo,\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\n= (4 / (8 G )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / \u03c0 \n\nSimplify 4/8 to 0.5:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before. \n\nNow, this formula gives the total mass in terms of K1, K2, and P. But note that the formula has constants involving G and \u03c0. However, since we are comparing the masses of the two systems, the constants will cancel out when taking the ratio. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the masses of system_1 to system_2 will be:\n\n(M1_total / M2_total ) = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / ( constants ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / ( constants ) ]\n\nThe constants (like G and \u03c0) cancel out, so:\n\nM1/M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) ]\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, actually in the formula, M_total is proportional to (K_sum)^3 * P, so the ratio would be ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) / (K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nYes. So the ratio of the total masses is ( (K1_sum)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K2_sum)^3 * P2 )\n\nLet me compute this for the given systems.\n\nFirst, system_1 has K1 =10 and K2 =5, so K_sum =10 +5 =15 km/s. Its period P1 is 2 years.\n\nSystem_2 has K values 15 and10, so K_sum=25 km/s. Period P2=1 year.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) ) ]\n\nCompute that:\n\n15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625\n\nSo numerator: 3375 *2 = 6750\n\nDenominator: 15625 *1 =15625\n\nSo ratio = 6750 /15625 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25 = 270; 15625/25=625 \u2192 270/625\n\nAgain divide by 5: 270/5=54; 625/5=125 \u2192 54/125 \u2248 0.432.\n\nHmm, so approximately 0.432, which is close to option A (0.4) or B (0.6). The options are A ~0.4, B ~0.6. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the formula gives M1/M2 = ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 *1 )\n\n15 cubed is 3375, 25 cubed is 15625.\n\n3375 *2 =6750.\n\n6750 divided by 15625 is indeed 0.432. So approximately 0.43, which would be closest to option A (0.4). But let me check if I used the correct K_sum.\n\nWait, for system_1, the K values are 10 and 5, so sum is 15. Correct. System_2: 15 and10 sum to 25. Correct. Periods: 2 and 1. Correct.\n\nHmm. The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, so 0.43 is closest to A. But the question is asking \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1 is 0.43 times M2, meaning system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the ratio is 0.43, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which it's more massive would be less than 1. So the answer would be 0.43, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So the question is asking for M1/M2. If that ratio is 0.43, then the answer is ~0.4, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't reverse the ratio. The formula gives M1/M2 = ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) / ( K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nWait, in the formula, M1 is the mass of system1. So yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A, 0.4? But let me check if I have the formula correct. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula derivation.\n\nWait, let's see: the formula for M_total is proportional to (K_sum)^3 * P. So when taking the ratio, it's (K1_sum^3 * P1) / (K2_sum^3 * P2). \n\nWait, but maybe I missed a term. Wait in the formula for M_total, the formula was M_total = ( (K_sum)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 ), but since the ratio cancels out the constants, the ratio is indeed ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) ) / ( (K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) \u22480.432. So the closest is A) ~0.4.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. But let me think again. Did I mix up system1 and system2?\n\nWait, the question is asking \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if M1/M2 is ~0.43, then the answer is 0.43, so A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me try an alternative approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be M_total proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P? But I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the K_sum. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the formula, the key was that K1 + K2 is the sum of the velocities, but in the derivation, we had a = (K1 + K2)*P/(2 pi). So that step was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use individual K values instead of their sum? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the formula for the total mass, the derivation led to M_total = ( (K_sum)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 ), where K_sum is K1 + K2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check another way.\n\nSuppose we consider the mass of the system as M = M1 + M2. \n\nWe also know from the radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nSo M1 = (K2/K1) M2 \n\nSo M_total = M2 (1 + K2/K1 ) \n\nBut how to find M2?\n\nWe can use Kepler's third law. Let me consider the orbital period and the velocity.\n\nThe velocity of star2 is K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThe semi-major axis a2 = ( K2 P )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = (M2/M1)*a2 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nBut since M2/M1 = K1/K2, so:\n\na = a2 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThus, a = [ (K2 P)/(2 \u03c0 ) ] * (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo a = ( K2 P (1 + K1/K2 ) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = ( P ( K2 + K1 ) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nThen, Kepler's third law gives:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )\n\nSubstituting a gives the same expression as before, leading to M_total proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. \n\nSo the answer should be option A. But wait, the options given include 0.6 (B), which is close to the inverse of 0.43 (which would be ~2.3). Hmm, but why would the question have an option that's the inverse? Let me check if I mixed up the systems.\n\nWait, the question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2 = 0.43, so system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, it's less massive, so the factor would be 0.43, so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the K_sum? Let me check again.\n\nFor system_1: K1 and K2 are 10 and 5 \u2192 sum is 15. \n\nSystem_2: 15 and10 \u2192 sum 25. \n\nPeriods: 2 and 1. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer is A. But let me see if there's another approach where the answer could be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is M_total \u221d (K1 * K2)^3 / ( (K1 + K2)^2 ) * P ?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach with actual variables.\n\nLet me suppose that for each system, I can write expressions for the total mass.\n\nLet me denote for system1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses. \n\nWe have:\n\nM1a / M1b = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTotal mass M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, for system2:\n\nM2a / M2b = K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass M2_total = M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, we need to find M1_total / M2_total = (1.5 M1b) / ( (5/3) M2b ) \n\nBut this requires relating M1b and M2b. Hmm, but how?\n\nAh, here's where the period comes into play. \n\nWe need to relate the masses and periods. Let's use Kepler's third law for each system.\n\nFor system1:\n\n(M1_total) P1\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1^3)/G \n\nFor system2:\n\n(M2_total) P2\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a2^3)/G \n\nWe need to find a1 and a2 in terms of the velocities. \n\nThe velocity of each star is related to their semi-major axis. \n\nFor system1:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P1 \u2192 a1 = (K1 P1)/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 (total separation) for system1 would be a1 + a2a (where a2a is the semi-major axis of the second star). \n\nWait, no, let me clarify variables. Let me denote a1 as the semi-major axis of star1 in system1. Then the total separation between the two stars is a1 + a2 (where a2 is the semi-major axis of star2). \n\nBut since M1a * a1 = M1b * a2 \u2192 a2 = (M1a / M1b ) a1 \n\nGiven that M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 a2 = 0.5 a1 \n\nThus, total separation a_total = a1 + 0.5 a1 = 1.5 a1 \n\nSo a1 = a_total /1.5 \n\nThus, the velocity of star1 is K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P1 \u2192 substituting a1:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0 (a_total /1.5 ) / P1 \n\nThus, a_total = ( K1 * P1 * 1.5 ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, the total mass M1_total is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total^3 )/( G P1\u00b2 )\n\nSubstituting a_total:\n\nM1_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1\u00b2 )) * [ (1.5 K1 P1 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet's compute the terms inside:\n\n(1.5 K1 P1 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 = ( (3/2 K1 P1 ) / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 = ( 3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ) )^3 \n\nWait, 1.5 is 3/2, so 1.5/(2 \u03c0 ) is 3/(4 \u03c0 ). \n\nThus, the cube is (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\nSo:\n\nM1_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1\u00b2 )) * ( 27 K1^3 P1^3 ) / (64 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4 / 64 = 1/16, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P1^3 / P1^2 = P1 \n\nThus:\n\nM1_total = (27 K1^3 P1 ) / (16 G \u03c0 * 4 )? Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\nWait, 4 \u03c0\u00b2 * (27 K1^3 P1^3 ) / ( (4 \u03c0 )^3 * G P1\u00b2 ) )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1^2) multiplied by (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nThe cube term: (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 = 27 K1^3 P1^3 / (64 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P1\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * 27 K1^3 P1^3 / (64 \u03c0^3 G P1\u00b2 )\n\nThe \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0, P1^3 / P1\u00b2 is P1, so:\n\n4 * 27 / (64 G \u03c0 ) * K1^3 P1 \n\nWhich is (108 / (64 G \u03c0 )) K1^3 P1 \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can do the same for system2 and then take the ratio.\n\nLet me compute M1_total / M2_total \n\nFollowing the same steps for system2:\n\nM2_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P2^2 )) * [ (3/2 K2 P2 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 ]? Wait, no, let's redo the steps for system2.\n\nWait, for system2, similar steps:\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nM2a and M2b, with M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass M2_total = (5/3) M2b \n\nThe semi-major axis of star1 in system2 (M2a) is a2a, and the other star's semi-major axis a2b = (M2a / M2b ) * a2a \n\nSince M2a = (2/3) M2b \u2192 a2b = (2/3) a2a \n\nTotal separation a_total2 = a2a + (2/3 a2a ) = (5/3)a2a \n\nThus, a2a = (3/5) a_total2 \n\nThe velocity K2 (of star1, which has mass M2a) is K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2a / P2 \n\nThus, K2 = 2 \u03c0 (3/5 a_total2 ) / P2 \u2192 a_total2 = (5 K2 P2 )/( 6 \u03c0 )\n\nThen, substituting into M2_total:\n\nM2_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total2^3 )/( G P2\u00b2 )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P2\u00b2 )) * [ (5 K2 P2 / (6 \u03c0 ))^3 ]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n(5 K2 P2 /6 \u03c0 )^3 = 125 K2^3 P2^3 / ( 216 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P2\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * 125 K2^3 P2^3 / (216 \u03c0^3 G P2\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4/(216) = 1/54, \u03c0\u00b2/\u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P2^3 / P2\u00b2 = P2 \n\nThus:\n\nM2_total = (125 K2^3 P2 ) / (54 G \u03c0 )\n\nNow, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is:\n\n[ (108/(64 G \u03c0 )) K1^3 P1 ] / [ (125/(54 G \u03c0 )) K2^3 P2 ) ]\n\nThe G and \u03c0 terms cancel out:\n\n= (108/64) / (125/54) * ( K1^3 P1 / ( K2^3 P2 ) )\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n(108/64) * (54/125) = (108 *54) / (64 * 125 )\n\nCalculate numerator: 108 *54 = (100*54)+(8*54) =5400 + 432 =5832\n\nDenominator:64 *125 = 8000\n\nSo 5832 /8000 = 0.729 \n\nMultiply that by ( K1^3 P1 )/( K2^3 P2 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK1 =10, K2=15 for system2's K values? Wait, no, wait: Wait, for system1, K1 is 10 and K2 (the other star's velocity) is 5. But in the formula above for M2_total, K2 is the velocity amplitude of star1 in system2, which is 15 km/s (since in system2, the amplitudes are 15 and10). \n\nWait, in the variables for system2, the K2 in the formula refers to the velocity of the first star (M2a) which is 15 km/s. The other star has K=10. So yes, in the ratio, K2 refers to the 15 and10. \n\nThus, substituting the values:\n\nK1 (for system1's K1) is 10, K2 (system2's K1, which is the first star's velocity in system2) is 15. \n\nWait, but in the ratio, the K terms are K1 (system1) and K2 (system2's K). Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (K1^3 P1)/( K2^3 P2 ), where K1 is system1's K1 (10), and K2 is system2's K (15 and 10? Or which one?)\n\nWait, no, in the ratio M1/M2, the K terms are the K's from each system. Let me clarify:\n\nThe variables in the ratio are:\n\nFor M1_total's numerator: K1 (system1's K1) is 10 km/s, and the K2 (system2's K1) is 15 km/s? Or is it the sum?\n\nWait, no. The variables in the ratio are:\n\nThe formula for M1_total is proportional to K1^3 (where K1 is system1's K1?) or to the sum?\n\nWait, in this alternative approach, I derived M1_total as proportional to K1^3 (system1's K1) and similarly M2_total proportional to K2^3 (system2's K1? Or the K of its first star?)\n\nWait, in the system2's case, the K2 in the formula was the K of the first star (M2a's velocity, which is 15 km/s). So for M2_total, it's proportional to K2^3 (15)^3, and system1 is proportional to K1^3 (10)^3. \n\nWait, but in the ratio:\n\nThe constants factor was 0.729 multiplied by ( (10)^3 *2 ) / ( (15)^3 *1 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe ratio is:\n\n0.729 * ( (10^3 * P1 ) / (15^3 * P2 ) )\n\nWhere P1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n0.729 * ( (1000 *2 ) / (3375 *1 ) )\n\nCompute 10^3 is 1000, 15^3 is 3375.\n\nSo numerator: 1000 *2 =2000 \n\nDenominator:3375 *1 =3375 \n\n2000/3375 \u2248 0.5926 \n\nMultiply by 0.729:\n\n0.729 * 0.5926 \u2248 0.432 \n\nSame result as before. So the ratio is ~0.432, so answer A.\n\nHmm, so why is there an option B (0.6)? Maybe I made a mistake in the constants?\n\nWait, in the alternative approach, the constants were 0.729 from (108/64)/(125/54) = (108*54)/(64*125) = (5832)/(8000)=0.729. \n\nBut in the first approach, the ratio was (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625)=6750/15625=0.432. \n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I think the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is A, ~0.4.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves comparing the total masses of two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Let me see. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given as A to D. Hmm.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that in binary systems, the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes can be used to find the masses. The key formula here is probably Kepler's third law, but adjusted for binary systems. Let me recall. The formula involving the masses and the period is something like (M1 + M2)^3 / (M1 * M2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) * a\u00b3 / P\u00b2, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, there's another approach where using the radial velocity amplitudes and the period gives the total mass.\n\nWait, right, the formula that relates the masses and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is important here. The radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) are related to the masses of the stars. Since the stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because if star 1 has a velocity amplitude K1, then M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, so rearranged, that ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2. \n\nBut how does that tie into the total mass? Also, the orbital period comes into play here. The total mass of the system can be found using the formula derived from Kepler's third law, adjusted for binary systems. Let me think. The formula is (M1 + M2) = (K1^3 * P) / (2G\u03c0)^(2/3) ) or something like that? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact relation here.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula where the sum of the masses is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by some function of the period. Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering that for a binary system, the mass function can be used. The mass function is given by (v sin i)^3 / (K sin i)^3, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, perhaps the key is to use the fact that the product of the masses and their velocities equals the same for the other star, because they orbit the center of mass.\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote M1 and M2 as the masses of the two stars in a system. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1*M2 = M1^2*(K2/K1). Not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nThe total mass of the system is M_total = M1 + M2. \n\nNow, Kepler's third law for a binary system states that (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But here, we might need to relate the radial velocity amplitudes to the masses and the period.\n\nAlternatively, there's another formula that relates the radial velocity amplitudes to the masses and the orbital period. Let me recall that the radial velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star, the orbital period, and the inclination. But since we don't know the inclination, perhaps we can assume that both systems are edge-on (so sin i = 1), which is necessary to observe eclipses. Since they do have eclipses, that means the orbital plane is edge-on, so inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. That's important because otherwise the formula would have a sin i term which we can't know. But since they are eclipsing binaries, we can assume sin i =1, so that term is 1, which simplifies things.\n\nSo, the formula for the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) * (M_other / (M1 + M2)) \n\nWait, perhaps more precisely, the velocity of each star is related to the other star's mass and the total mass. Let me think. The orbital velocity of star 1 is v1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P, and similarly for star 2. The semi-major axes a1 and a2 are related by a1/a2 = M2/M1, since they orbit around the center of mass. The sum a1 + a2 = a_total (the distance between them), but perhaps that's getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, the formula that allows us to find the total mass is:\n\n(M1 + M2) = (K1^3 * P) / (2 G \u03c0) )^(something). Wait, perhaps the formula I need is:\n\n(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 * K2)^3 * P^2 ) / (2 G \u03c0^2 (K1 + K2)) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a better approach. Let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is related to the mass of the other star. Since they are orbiting each other, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. \n\nSo for system 1: K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s. So 10/5 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = 2*M1. Therefore, the total mass of system1 is M1 + 2M1 = 3M1.\n\nSimilarly for system2, K1 is 15 and K2 10, so 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = (3/2) M1. So total mass of system2 is M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.\n\nWait, but here I have two different M1 variables. Wait, no, the M1 and M2 are different for each system. Let me clarify variables.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses of the two stars in system1. Then K1a / K1b = M1b / M1a. Given K1a =10, K1b=5. So 10/5 = M1b/M1a \u2192 M1b = 2*M1a. So total mass of system1 is M1a + M1b = 3*M1a.\n\nSimilarly, for system2: let M2a and M2b be the masses. Their K values are 15 and 10. So K2a/K2b = M2b/M2a \u2192 15/10 = M2b/M2a \u2192 M2b = (15/10)*M2a = 1.5 M2a. So total mass of system2 is M2a + 1.5 M2a = 2.5 M2a.\n\nNow, to find the total mass of each system, I need another relation. The key is to use the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the total mass and the semi-major axis. But how to connect that with the radial velocity amplitudes?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use the formula that relates the radial velocity amplitude with the mass and period. Let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 a sin i) / (P) * (M_other / (M_total)) \n\nWait, but since sin i =1 (eclipsing system), this simplifies to K = (2 \u03c0 a / P) * (M_other / M_total )\n\nBut also, from Kepler's third law: (M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / G \n\nSo solving for a: a\u00b3 = (G (M_total) P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ G (M_total) P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3)\n\nHmm, substituting back into K's equation:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a / (M_total) ) * M_other ]\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too tangled. Let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the mass function which allows us to compute the mass of one star in terms of the other. The mass function is:\n\nf(m) = (M sin\u00b3 i) / ( (1 + q)^2 ) ), where q = M2/M1, but maybe I need to look at this more carefully. \n\nAlternatively, since the stars are in a binary system, the orbital period P is related to the masses and the semi-major axes. Let me consider the two stars orbiting each other. The total mass M = M1 + M2. The distance between them is a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of each star around the center of mass.\n\nWe know that M1 a1 = M2 a2, so a1/a2 = M2/M1. Let me denote q = M2/M1. Then a1 = q a2. Since a1 + a2 = a (the total separation between the stars), then a2 (1 + q) = a \u2192 a2 = a/(1+q), a1 = q a/(1+q).\n\nThe orbital period P is given by Kepler's third law: \n\n( M ) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nSo rearranged, M = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nNow, the radial velocity of star 1 is v1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P. Similarly for star2, v2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P.\n\nBut the observed radial velocity amplitude K1 is equal to v1 (since sin i =1), so K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P. Similarly K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P.\n\nSo substituting a1 and a2 in terms of a and q:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( q a/(1+q) )\n\nK2 = 2 \u03c0/(P) * ( a/(1+q) )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2 = q, which matches the earlier relation K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's try to express the total mass M in terms of K1, K2, and P.\n\nFrom the above expressions for K1 and K2:\n\nLet me solve for a from K1 and K2. Let's see.\n\nFrom K1 = (2 \u03c0 a q ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nBut q = M2/M1, and M1 + M2 = M. Let me see if we can express M in terms of K and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's express a in terms of K and P.\n\nFrom K2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nSo a = ( K2 P (1 + q) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nBut q = M2/M1. Since M = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + q ), so M1 = M/(1 + q )\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too involved. Let me try to find an expression for M in terms of K1, K2, and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the two expressions for K1 and K2.\n\nWe have K1 = (2 \u03c0 a q)/( P (1+q) )\n\nand K2 = (2 \u03c0 a )/( P (1+q) )\n\nMultiply K1 and K2:\n\nK1*K2 = (2 \u03c0 a q / ( P (1+q) )) * (2 \u03c0 a / ( P (1+q) )) ) \n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b2 q ) / ( P\u00b2 (1+q)^2 )\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if I can express a in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nAlternatively, since K1/K2 = q, so q = K1/K2. Let me denote that q = K1/K2.\n\nThen, substituting into the expression for K2:\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + q) ]\n\nSo solving for a:\n\na = [ K2 P (1 + q) ] / ( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nNow, substitute this a into the expression for M:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging a into that:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * [ K2 P (1+q) / (2 \u03c0) ]^3 \n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, the a^3 term:\n\n[ K2 P (1+q)/(2\u03c0) ]^3 = (K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nThen, multiplying by 4 \u03c0\u00b2/( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nM = [4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2) ] * [ K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3 / (8 \u03c0^3) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0\u00b3 = 1/\u03c0, P^3 / P^2 = P.\n\nSo:\n\nM = (0.5 / ( G \u03c0 )) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 )\n\nWait, let me recheck the exponents:\n\nWait, the 4\u03c0\u00b2 multiplied by the numerator (K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3) divided by denominator 8\u03c0^3 and multiplied by 1/(G P\u00b2):\n\nSo the entire expression is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 * K2^3 P^3 (1+q)^3) / ( G P\u00b2 * 8 \u03c0^3) )\n\n= (4/(8 G)) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / \u03c0 \n\n= ( (1/2 G) ) * ( K2^3 P (1 + q)^3 ) / \u03c0 \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the total mass of the system in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that since the mass of the system is M_total, then the velocity of each star is given by v = (2 \u03c0 a / P ), where a is their semi-major axis. The product of each star's velocity and its mass gives the same value (since M1 v1 = M2 v2 because of center of mass). \n\nWait, yes, because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. So:\n\nM1 / M2 = v2 / v1 \n\nSo that ratio is consistent with the K1/K2 ratio since their velocities are their radial velocity amplitudes (assuming edge-on, so v1 = K1, v2 = K2).\n\nTherefore, M1 / M2 = v2 / v1 = K2/K1 \u2192 M1 = M2 * (K2/K1 )\n\nSo the total mass is M1 + M2 = M2 ( 1 + K2/K1 )\n\nBut how do we get the actual mass? We need to relate the velocities to the period and the mass.\n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\n( M_total ) * P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 ) / G \n\nBut the distance a between the stars is a = a1 + a2, where a1 is semi-major axis of star1, a2 of star2.\n\nBut since a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nBut M2/M1 = (K1/K2) because M2/M1 = (v1/v2) = (K1/K2 )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, since M1 v1 = M2 v2 \u2192 M1/M2 = v2/v1 \u2192 M2/M1 = v1/v2 = K1/K2 (since v1=K1, v2=K2)\n\nSo M2/M1 = K1/K2 \u2192 so a1 = (K1/K2) a2 \n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo a2 = a / (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThen, the velocity of star2 is v2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 ) / P \n\nSo K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nSubstituting a2:\n\nK2 = 2 \u03c0 / P * [ a / (1 + K1/K2 ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nK2 (1 + K1/K2 ) = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \u2192 \n\nK2 + K1 = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \n\nThus, a = ( (K1 + K2 ) P ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nOkay, so now we can substitute a into Kepler's law.\n\nThe total mass M_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nPlugging in a:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the a^3 term:\n\n[ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) ) ]^3 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo M_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) ]\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4 / 8 = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThus:\n\nM_total = (0.5 / ( G \u03c0 )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) \n\nWait, that gives:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm, but I need to check if that's correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me recast the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check the units to see if that makes sense. \n\nAssuming K is in km/s, P in years, but maybe the formula requires SI units. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's a standard formula for the total mass of an eclipsing binary in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nAlternatively, let me look for a different approach. \n\nLet me recall that the mass of the system can be found using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 * G * \u03c0 ) \n\nWait, but I need to check the derivation again. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the steps above. Let me try again.\n\nWait, in the previous steps:\n\nWe had a = ( (K1 + K2) P ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nThen, substituting into Kepler's formula:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )\n\nSo a^3 is [( (K1+K2) P / (2\u03c0) )]^3 \n\nSo that term is ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) ) / ( G P^2 )\n\nThe P^3 / P^2 is P, the \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0, and 4/8 is 0.5. \n\nSo that gives (4/(8 G \u03c0 )) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P \n\nWhich is ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm. So that's the formula for M_total?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here because I might have missed some constants. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other. Let me denote M1 and M2 as masses, and K1 and K2 as their radial velocities.\n\nWe have K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1)/P \n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a2)/P \n\nAlso, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nTotal separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 ) \n\nSo a2 = a / (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nSubstituting back into K2:\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a / (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nSimilarly, K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * [ a (M2/M1 ) / (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nSo, the ratio K1/K2 = (M2/M1 ) \u2192 which matches the earlier conclusion.\n\nNow, let's express a in terms of K1 and K2. Let me solve for a from K2's equation:\n\nFrom K2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + M2/M1 ) ]\n\nBut since M2/M1 = (K1/K2 ), from the ratio above.\n\nThus,\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 a ) / [ P (1 + K1/K2 ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nK2 (1 + K1/K2 ) = (2 \u03c0 a)/ P \n\nLeft side: K2 + K1 \n\nThus, a = ( (K1 + K2 ) P )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nSame as before. \n\nSo plugging back into Kepler's third law:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nNow, substituting a:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0 ) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute this again step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the a^3 term:\n\n[ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 \u03c0) ) ]^3 = (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / (8 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2):\n\nSo,\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G P\u00b2 ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\n= (4 / (8 G )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / \u03c0 \n\nSimplify 4/8 to 0.5:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 )\n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before. \n\nNow, this formula gives the total mass in terms of K1, K2, and P. But note that the formula has constants involving G and \u03c0. However, since we are comparing the masses of the two systems, the constants will cancel out when taking the ratio. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the masses of system_1 to system_2 will be:\n\n(M1_total / M2_total ) = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / ( constants ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / ( constants ) ]\n\nThe constants (like G and \u03c0) cancel out, so:\n\nM1/M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) ]\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, actually in the formula, M_total is proportional to (K_sum)^3 * P, so the ratio would be ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) / (K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nYes. So the ratio of the total masses is ( (K1_sum)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K2_sum)^3 * P2 )\n\nLet me compute this for the given systems.\n\nFirst, system_1 has K1 =10 and K2 =5, so K_sum =10 +5 =15 km/s. Its period P1 is 2 years.\n\nSystem_2 has K values 15 and10, so K_sum=25 km/s. Period P2=1 year.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) ) ]\n\nCompute that:\n\n15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625\n\nSo numerator: 3375 *2 = 6750\n\nDenominator: 15625 *1 =15625\n\nSo ratio = 6750 /15625 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25 = 270; 15625/25=625 \u2192 270/625\n\nAgain divide by 5: 270/5=54; 625/5=125 \u2192 54/125 \u2248 0.432.\n\nHmm, so approximately 0.432, which is close to option A (0.4) or B (0.6). The options are A ~0.4, B ~0.6. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, the formula gives M1/M2 = ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 *1 )\n\n15 cubed is 3375, 25 cubed is 15625.\n\n3375 *2 =6750.\n\n6750 divided by 15625 is indeed 0.432. So approximately 0.43, which would be closest to option A (0.4). But let me check if I used the correct K_sum.\n\nWait, for system_1, the K values are 10 and 5, so sum is 15. Correct. System_2: 15 and10 sum to 25. Correct. Periods: 2 and 1. Correct.\n\nHmm. The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, so 0.43 is closest to A. But the question is asking \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1 is 0.43 times M2, meaning system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the ratio is 0.43, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which it's more massive would be less than 1. So the answer would be 0.43, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So the question is asking for M1/M2. If that ratio is 0.43, then the answer is ~0.4, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't reverse the ratio. The formula gives M1/M2 = ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) / ( K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nWait, in the formula, M1 is the mass of system1. So yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A, 0.4? But let me check if I have the formula correct. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula derivation.\n\nWait, let's see: the formula for M_total is proportional to (K_sum)^3 * P. So when taking the ratio, it's (K1_sum^3 * P1) / (K2_sum^3 * P2). \n\nWait, but maybe I missed a term. Wait in the formula for M_total, the formula was M_total = ( (K_sum)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 ), but since the ratio cancels out the constants, the ratio is indeed ( (K1_sum^3 * P1 ) ) / ( (K2_sum^3 * P2 ) )\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) \u22480.432. So the closest is A) ~0.4.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. But let me think again. Did I mix up system1 and system2?\n\nWait, the question is asking \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if M1/M2 is ~0.43, then the answer is 0.43, so A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me try an alternative approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be M_total proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P? But I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the K_sum. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the formula, the key was that K1 + K2 is the sum of the velocities, but in the derivation, we had a = (K1 + K2)*P/(2 pi). So that step was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use individual K values instead of their sum? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the formula for the total mass, the derivation led to M_total = ( (K_sum)^3 * P ) / ( 2 G \u03c0 ), where K_sum is K1 + K2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check another way.\n\nSuppose we consider the mass of the system as M = M1 + M2. \n\nWe also know from the radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nSo M1 = (K2/K1) M2 \n\nSo M_total = M2 (1 + K2/K1 ) \n\nBut how to find M2?\n\nWe can use Kepler's third law. Let me consider the orbital period and the velocity.\n\nThe velocity of star2 is K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThe semi-major axis a2 = ( K2 P )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = (M2/M1)*a2 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 )\n\nBut since M2/M1 = K1/K2, so:\n\na = a2 ( 1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nThus, a = [ (K2 P)/(2 \u03c0 ) ] * (1 + K1/K2 ) \n\nSo a = ( K2 P (1 + K1/K2 ) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = ( P ( K2 + K1 ) )/( 2 \u03c0 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nThen, Kepler's third law gives:\n\nM_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P^2 )\n\nSubstituting a gives the same expression as before, leading to M_total proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432, which is approximately 0.4. \n\nSo the answer should be option A. But wait, the options given include 0.6 (B), which is close to the inverse of 0.43 (which would be ~2.3). Hmm, but why would the question have an option that's the inverse? Let me check if I mixed up the systems.\n\nWait, the question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2 = 0.43, so system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, it's less massive, so the factor would be 0.43, so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the K_sum? Let me check again.\n\nFor system_1: K1 and K2 are 10 and 5 \u2192 sum is 15. \n\nSystem_2: 15 and10 \u2192 sum 25. \n\nPeriods: 2 and 1. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer is A. But let me see if there's another approach where the answer could be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is M_total \u221d (K1 * K2)^3 / ( (K1 + K2)^2 ) * P ?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach with actual variables.\n\nLet me suppose that for each system, I can write expressions for the total mass.\n\nLet me denote for system1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses. \n\nWe have:\n\nM1a / M1b = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTotal mass M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, for system2:\n\nM2a / M2b = K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass M2_total = M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, we need to find M1_total / M2_total = (1.5 M1b) / ( (5/3) M2b ) \n\nBut this requires relating M1b and M2b. Hmm, but how?\n\nAh, here's where the period comes into play. \n\nWe need to relate the masses and periods. Let's use Kepler's third law for each system.\n\nFor system1:\n\n(M1_total) P1\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1^3)/G \n\nFor system2:\n\n(M2_total) P2\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a2^3)/G \n\nWe need to find a1 and a2 in terms of the velocities. \n\nThe velocity of each star is related to their semi-major axis. \n\nFor system1:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P1 \u2192 a1 = (K1 P1)/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 (total separation) for system1 would be a1 + a2a (where a2a is the semi-major axis of the second star). \n\nWait, no, let me clarify variables. Let me denote a1 as the semi-major axis of star1 in system1. Then the total separation between the two stars is a1 + a2 (where a2 is the semi-major axis of star2). \n\nBut since M1a * a1 = M1b * a2 \u2192 a2 = (M1a / M1b ) a1 \n\nGiven that M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 a2 = 0.5 a1 \n\nThus, total separation a_total = a1 + 0.5 a1 = 1.5 a1 \n\nSo a1 = a_total /1.5 \n\nThus, the velocity of star1 is K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P1 \u2192 substituting a1:\n\nK1 = 2 \u03c0 (a_total /1.5 ) / P1 \n\nThus, a_total = ( K1 * P1 * 1.5 ) / (2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, the total mass M1_total is (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total^3 )/( G P1\u00b2 )\n\nSubstituting a_total:\n\nM1_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1\u00b2 )) * [ (1.5 K1 P1 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nLet's compute the terms inside:\n\n(1.5 K1 P1 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 = ( (3/2 K1 P1 ) / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 = ( 3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ) )^3 \n\nWait, 1.5 is 3/2, so 1.5/(2 \u03c0 ) is 3/(4 \u03c0 ). \n\nThus, the cube is (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\nSo:\n\nM1_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1\u00b2 )) * ( 27 K1^3 P1^3 ) / (64 \u03c0^3 ) )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4 / 64 = 1/16, \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P1^3 / P1^2 = P1 \n\nThus:\n\nM1_total = (27 K1^3 P1 ) / (16 G \u03c0 * 4 )? Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\nWait, 4 \u03c0\u00b2 * (27 K1^3 P1^3 ) / ( (4 \u03c0 )^3 * G P1\u00b2 ) )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P1^2) multiplied by (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nThe cube term: (3 K1 P1 / (4 \u03c0 ))^3 = 27 K1^3 P1^3 / (64 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P1\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * 27 K1^3 P1^3 / (64 \u03c0^3 G P1\u00b2 )\n\nThe \u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0, P1^3 / P1\u00b2 is P1, so:\n\n4 * 27 / (64 G \u03c0 ) * K1^3 P1 \n\nWhich is (108 / (64 G \u03c0 )) K1^3 P1 \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can do the same for system2 and then take the ratio.\n\nLet me compute M1_total / M2_total \n\nFollowing the same steps for system2:\n\nM2_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P2^2 )) * [ (3/2 K2 P2 / (2 \u03c0 ))^3 ]? Wait, no, let's redo the steps for system2.\n\nWait, for system2, similar steps:\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nM2a and M2b, with M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass M2_total = (5/3) M2b \n\nThe semi-major axis of star1 in system2 (M2a) is a2a, and the other star's semi-major axis a2b = (M2a / M2b ) * a2a \n\nSince M2a = (2/3) M2b \u2192 a2b = (2/3) a2a \n\nTotal separation a_total2 = a2a + (2/3 a2a ) = (5/3)a2a \n\nThus, a2a = (3/5) a_total2 \n\nThe velocity K2 (of star1, which has mass M2a) is K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2a / P2 \n\nThus, K2 = 2 \u03c0 (3/5 a_total2 ) / P2 \u2192 a_total2 = (5 K2 P2 )/( 6 \u03c0 )\n\nThen, substituting into M2_total:\n\nM2_total = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total2^3 )/( G P2\u00b2 )\n\n= (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P2\u00b2 )) * [ (5 K2 P2 / (6 \u03c0 ))^3 ]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n(5 K2 P2 /6 \u03c0 )^3 = 125 K2^3 P2^3 / ( 216 \u03c0^3 )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P2\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * 125 K2^3 P2^3 / (216 \u03c0^3 G P2\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4/(216) = 1/54, \u03c0\u00b2/\u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0, P2^3 / P2\u00b2 = P2 \n\nThus:\n\nM2_total = (125 K2^3 P2 ) / (54 G \u03c0 )\n\nNow, the ratio M1_total / M2_total is:\n\n[ (108/(64 G \u03c0 )) K1^3 P1 ] / [ (125/(54 G \u03c0 )) K2^3 P2 ) ]\n\nThe G and \u03c0 terms cancel out:\n\n= (108/64) / (125/54) * ( K1^3 P1 / ( K2^3 P2 ) )\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n(108/64) * (54/125) = (108 *54) / (64 * 125 )\n\nCalculate numerator: 108 *54 = (100*54)+(8*54) =5400 + 432 =5832\n\nDenominator:64 *125 = 8000\n\nSo 5832 /8000 = 0.729 \n\nMultiply that by ( K1^3 P1 )/( K2^3 P2 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nK1 =10, K2=15 for system2's K values? Wait, no, wait: Wait, for system1, K1 is 10 and K2 (the other star's velocity) is 5. But in the formula above for M2_total, K2 is the velocity amplitude of star1 in system2, which is 15 km/s (since in system2, the amplitudes are 15 and10). \n\nWait, in the variables for system2, the K2 in the formula refers to the velocity of the first star (M2a) which is 15 km/s. The other star has K=10. So yes, in the ratio, K2 refers to the 15 and10. \n\nThus, substituting the values:\n\nK1 (for system1's K1) is 10, K2 (system2's K1, which is the first star's velocity in system2) is 15. \n\nWait, but in the ratio, the K terms are K1 (system1) and K2 (system2's K). Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (K1^3 P1)/( K2^3 P2 ), where K1 is system1's K1 (10), and K2 is system2's K (15 and 10? Or which one?)\n\nWait, no, in the ratio M1/M2, the K terms are the K's from each system. Let me clarify:\n\nThe variables in the ratio are:\n\nFor M1_total's numerator: K1 (system1's K1) is 10 km/s, and the K2 (system2's K1) is 15 km/s? Or is it the sum?\n\nWait, no. The variables in the ratio are:\n\nThe formula for M1_total is proportional to K1^3 (where K1 is system1's K1?) or to the sum?\n\nWait, in this alternative approach, I derived M1_total as proportional to K1^3 (system1's K1) and similarly M2_total proportional to K2^3 (system2's K1? Or the K of its first star?)\n\nWait, in the system2's case, the K2 in the formula was the K of the first star (M2a's velocity, which is 15 km/s). So for M2_total, it's proportional to K2^3 (15)^3, and system1 is proportional to K1^3 (10)^3. \n\nWait, but in the ratio:\n\nThe constants factor was 0.729 multiplied by ( (10)^3 *2 ) / ( (15)^3 *1 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe ratio is:\n\n0.729 * ( (10^3 * P1 ) / (15^3 * P2 ) )\n\nWhere P1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n0.729 * ( (1000 *2 ) / (3375 *1 ) )\n\nCompute 10^3 is 1000, 15^3 is 3375.\n\nSo numerator: 1000 *2 =2000 \n\nDenominator:3375 *1 =3375 \n\n2000/3375 \u2248 0.5926 \n\nMultiply by 0.729:\n\n0.729 * 0.5926 \u2248 0.432 \n\nSame result as before. So the ratio is ~0.432, so answer A.\n\nHmm, so why is there an option B (0.6)? Maybe I made a mistake in the constants?\n\nWait, in the alternative approach, the constants were 0.729 from (108/64)/(125/54) = (108*54)/(64*125) = (5832)/(8000)=0.729. \n\nBut in the first approach, the ratio was (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625)=6750/15625=0.432. \n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I think the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is A, ~0.4.\n\n\nThe problem involves comparing the total masses of two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Radial Velocity Ratio and Mass Relationship**: For each system, the ratio of radial velocity amplitudes \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) gives the inverse ratio of the masses of the stars. For system_1, \\( K_1/K_2 = 10/5 = 2 \\), so \\( M_{1b}/M_{1a} = 2 \\). Thus, \\( M_{\\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 3M_{1a} \\). For system_2, \\( K_1/K_2 = 15/10 = 1.5 \\), so \\( M_{2b}/M_{2a} = 1.5 \\), leading to \\( M_{\\text{total,2}} = 2.5M_{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Mass-Period Relationship**: Using Kepler's third law and the derived formula for the total mass \\( M_{\\text{total}} \\propto (K_1 + K_2)^3 \\cdot P \\), the ratio of the masses of the systems is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{M_{\\text{total,1}}}{M_{\\text{total,2}}} = \\frac{(K_{1,\\text{sum}}^3 \\cdot P_1)}{(K_{2,\\text{sum}}^3 \\cdot P_2)}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   - \\( K_{1,\\text{sum}} = 10 + 5 = 15 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( P_1 = 2 \\, \\text{years} \\)\n   - \\( K_{2,\\text{sum}} = 15 + 10 = 25 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( P_2 = 1 \\, \\text{year} \\)\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{M_{\\text{total,1}}}{M_{\\text{total,2}}} = \\frac{(15^3 \\cdot 2)}{(25^3 \\cdot 1)} = \\frac{6750}{15625} \\approx 0.432\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio \\( \\approx 0.432 \\) is closest to option A (\\( \\sim 0.4 \\)).\n\nAnswer: A",
