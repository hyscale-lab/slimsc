      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, the field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that when the magnetic field direction changes, the spin state of the particle might precess around the new field direction. Since the initial state was aligned along +Z, when the field is turned to Y, the system will evolve in the new field's Hamiltonian. \n\nThe magnetic moment is given by \u03bc = \u03b3\u00b7Sz, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So when the field is in the Z direction, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>. But when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B_y, where B is along Y. Wait, actually, the direction of B is now Y, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y, which would involve the spin operator in the Y direction, right?\n\nThe key here is to find how the expectation value of Sz oscillates over time when the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to the Y direction. \n\nLet me think. The initial state is |+z>, since the particle's moment was aligned with the original B in Z. Now, when the field is turned off and turned on in Y, the system is now governed by the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state will depend on this new H. \n\nSo the new Hamiltonian H' = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B_y. Let me write that in terms of operators. Since B is along Y, H' = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but actually, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S (since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin vector). Wait, the problem says \"mu = gamma*Sz\". Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz? That's a bit confusing because usually the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector, so \u03bc = \u03b3 S. But here, maybe they are defining mu as specifically along the z-component? Wait, that might be a mistake in the problem's wording, but perhaps the magnetic moment is aligned along Sz when the field is in Z. Hmm, maybe the problem is simplifying, so that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz. Because the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin, so \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz. But the total magnetic moment would be a vector. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the z-component of the moment, and since the particle is in the +z state, then \u03bc_z is positive. \n\nAnyway, moving forward. Let's consider the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with +1/2 (since it's spin-1/2). So the initial state is |+z>. Now, when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y. Since the magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin, so H would be proportional to -S\u00b7B_y. Wait, let's clarify. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSo the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Since the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz satisfy the commutation relations, and the system will evolve under H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nThe question is about the expectation value of Sz as a function of time. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of Sy, the expectation value of Sz will oscillate as the system evolves. \n\nTo find the time dependence, we can use the time evolution under the Hamiltonian. Let me recall that the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Since H here is proportional to Sy, let's denote H = \u03c9 Sy, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B (since H = -\u03b3 B Sy, so \u03c9 would be \u03b3 B, but with a sign, but the magnitude is \u03b3 B). \n\nWait, let's be precise. Let me set \u0127 =1 for simplicity here, since in the equations it's often set to 1. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy for a spin-1/2 particle are \u00b1\u0127/2, but if we set \u0127=1, then \u00b11/2. So the eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b11/2. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t). Since H is proportional to Sy, this is exp(i \u03b3 B Sy t). \n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t, we can write:\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8+z | U\u2020(t) Sz U(t) | +z \u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since the operators will rotate, but maybe it's easier to work in the basis of Sy's eigenstates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian and find the time evolution. Let me think of the basis states. Let me consider the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of these eigenstates. \n\nThe states |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of the Sz basis. The standard relation is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * i, or something like that. Wait, let me recall that the eigenstates of Sy are:\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for Sy is Sy |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nExpressed in the Sz basis (with \u0127=1), Sy has the matrix representation:\n\nSy = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo, if we write Sy as (1/2)[0 -i; i 0], then the eigenvalues are \u00b11/2. \n\nTo find the eigenvectors, solving (Sy - \u03bb I) v =0. For \u03bb = +1/2:\n\n[ -1/2  -i    ] [a]   = 0\n[  i    -1/2 ] [b]\n\nSo, - (1/2) a -i b =0 \u2192 a = -2i b. Let me pick b=1, then a = -2i, but normalized. Wait, perhaps better to use standard expressions. \n\nAlternatively, the eigenstates of Sy can be written as:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me suppose that:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the state is a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9. Applying Sy to this:\n\nSy (a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9) = (1/2)( -i a |-z\u27e9 + i b |+z\u27e9 )\n\nWe want this equal to \u03bb (a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9).\n\nSo:\n\n( i b /2 ) |+z\u27e9 - (i a / 2)|-z\u27e9 = \u03bb a |+z\u27e9 + \u03bb b |-z\u27e9\n\nSo equating coefficients:\n\ni b /2 = \u03bb a,\n\n- i a / 2 = \u03bb b.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \u03bb = +1/2:\n\nThen,\n\ni b/2 = (1/2) a \u2192 a = i b,\n\n- i a /2 = (1/2) b \u2192 substituting a =i b,\n\n- i (i b)/2 = (1/2) b \u2192 ( -i^2 b ) /2 = (1/2) b \u2192 (b)/2 = (1/2) b \u2192 holds.\n\nThus, a =i b. Let\u2019s set b=1, then a =i. The state is (i|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/sqrt(|i|\u00b2 +1) \u2192 since |i|\u00b2 =1, so sqrt(2). So,\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly for the other eigenstate with \u03bb = -1/2, we can find:\n\n- i b/2 = - (1/2)a \u2192 a = -i b,\n\nand so on, leading to |-y\u27e9 = ( -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 or something. Wait, maybe I need to check again, but let's just proceed.\n\nSo, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] * something + ... \n\nWait, let me express |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me suppose:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u03b1 |+y\u27e9 + \u03b2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u03b1 [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + \u03b2 [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-derive the coefficients properly. Let me see:\n\nSuppose |+y\u27e9 is (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, then:\n\nIf I take the coefficients such that:\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLet me write |+y\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9,\n\nthen Sy |+y\u27e9 = (1/2)( -i A |-z\u27e9 + i B |+z\u27e9 ) = (1/2)( i B |+z\u27e9 -i A |-z\u27e9 )\n\nThis must equal (1/2)|+y\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\ni B |+z\u27e9 -i A |-z\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9,\n\nwhich gives equations:\n\ni B = A,\n\n- i A = B.\n\nFrom the first equation: A = i B,\n\nSubstitute into second equation: -i (i B) = B \u2192 (-i^2) B = B \u2192 B = B. So that works. Let's choose B =1, so A =i. Then normalize: the coefficients squared are |i|^2 + 1 = 1 +1 = 2, so divide by sqrt(2). So yes, that gives |+y\u27e9 as (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9, if we set Sy |-y\u27e9 = - (1/2)|-y\u27e9,\n\nthen following similar steps, we get |-y\u27e9 = (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo now, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me write |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nGrouping terms:\n\nThe coefficient for |+z\u27e9 is (a i /\u221a2) + (b (-i)/\u221a2),\n\nand the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is (a /\u221a2) + (b /\u221a2).\n\nWe need this to equal |+z\u27e9, so the coefficient for |+z\u27e9 must be 1, and for |-z\u27e9 must be 0.\n\nSo:\n\nFor |+z\u27e9:\n\n[ (a i - b i)/\u221a2 ] = 1,\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, the coefficient of |+z\u27e9 is (a i)/\u221a2 (from first term) plus (-i b)/\u221a2 (from the second term's coefficient of |+z\u27e9). So:\n\n(a i - b i)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nand the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is (a + b)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(a - b)i = \u221a2,\n\nand (a + b) =0.\n\nFrom the second equation, a = -b.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n( -b - b ) i = \u221a2 \u2192 -2b i = \u221a2 \u2192 b = -\u221a2/(2i) = i\u221a2/2 (since 1/i = -i).\n\nThus, b = i\u221a2/2,\n\nand a = -b = -i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = ( -i\u221a2/2 ) |+y\u27e9 + (i\u221a2/2) |-y\u27e9 )\n\nFactor out (i\u221a2/2):\n\n= (i\u221a2/2)( - |+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 )\n\nWait, but let's check the math again. Wait, a is -i\u221a2/2, so:\n\na |+y\u27e9 = (-i\u221a2/2) * [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nSimilarly for the b term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically. Let's see:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\na + b =0,\n\nso b = -a,\n\nthen substituting into the first equation:\n\n(a - b)i /\u221a2 =1,\n\nsince (a - b) = a - (-a) = 2a,\n\nso (2a i)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/(2i) = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nso then a = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nand b = i\u221a2/2,\n\nso substituting into the expression for |+z\u27e9,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (-i\u221a2/2)|+y\u27e9 + (i\u221a2/2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, moving on. The initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. \n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127=1). Therefore, the energy eigenvalues for H would be:\n\nH |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (1/2)|+y\u27e9,\n\nand H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-1/2)|-y\u27e9 = (\u03b3 B /2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B/2 and E_- = \u03b3 B/2.\n\nThe time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a exp(-i E_+ t) |+y\u27e9 + b exp(-i E_- t) |-y\u27e9.\n\nGiven that a and b were the coefficients from before:\n\na = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nb = i\u221a2/2,\n\nso substituting,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ -i\u221a2/2 exp(-i (-\u03b3 B /2 ) t ) ] |+y\u27e9 + [ i\u221a2/2 exp( -i ( \u03b3 B /2 ) t ) ] |-y\u27e9,\n\nWait, because E_+ is the energy for |+y\u27e9, so E_+ = -\u03b3 B /2, so exp(-i E_+ t) = exp( i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSimilarly, E_- is \u03b3 B /2, so exp(-i E_- t) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nFirst term:\n\n- i\u221a2/2 * exp( i \u03b3 B t /2 ) |+y\u27e9,\n\nSecond term:\n\ni\u221a2/2 * exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 ) |-y\u27e9,\n\nNow, we need to compute \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since Sz is diagonal in the Sz basis, maybe it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, then compute the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since Sz and Sy do not commute, their expectation values will precess.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between the eigenstates. \n\nThe energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_+ - E_- = (-\u03b3 B/2) - (\u03b3 B/2) ) = - \u03b3 B. The absolute difference is \u03b3 B. The oscillation frequency is related to this energy difference by \u03c9 = (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127. Since \u0127 is 1 here, the frequency is (\u0394E)/\u0127 = ( - \u03b3 B ) /1 \u2192 but the absolute value is \u03b3 B. Wait, but the frequency of oscillation is the absolute value of the difference in energy divided by h-bar. Since the energy difference is \u0394E = (\u03b3 B/2 - (-\u03b3 B/2))? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the two energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B/2 and E_- = +\u03b3 B/2. The difference between them is E_- - E_+ = (\u03b3 B/2 - (-\u03b3 B/2 )) = \u03b3 B. So the energy difference is \u03b3 B. \n\nThe oscillation frequency is (\u0394E)/(\u0127) = \u03b3 B / \u0127. But if we set \u0127=1, then it's \u03b3 B. But the problem states to find the frequency. Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component. \n\nAlternatively, the frequency of oscillation is determined by the Rabi frequency, which for a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field along a direction perpendicular to the initial spin is given by the magnitude of the magnetic field times gamma. \n\nWait, let me think again. The time evolution leads to the expectation value of Sz oscillating. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nLet me express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nWe have the initial |+z\u27e9 written as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, and each of those are expressed in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. Let me substitute those expressions into the time-evolved state.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the time-evolved state:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ -i\u221a2/2 exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) ] * [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] \n\n+ [ i\u221a2/2 exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) ] * [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n- i\u221a2/2 * exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) multiplied by (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\nThe constants are (-i\u221a2/2) * (1/\u221a2) ) = (-i)/2,\n\nand the exponential is exp(i \u03b3 B t /2).\n\nSo the first term is:\n\n(-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 )\n\nSimilarly for the second term:\n\ni\u221a2/2 * exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2 ) multiplied by (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nConstants: (i\u221a2/2)(1/\u221a2) )= i/2,\n\nso the second term is:\n\n(i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ( -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 )\n\nNow expand both terms:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t/2) [i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (-i/2)(i exp(...) |+z\u27e9 + exp(...) |-z\u27e9 )\n\n= (-i/2 * i exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9 + (-i/2 exp(...) ) |-z\u27e9 )\n\nThe first part: -i * i = 1, so (1/2 exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9,\n\nthe second part: (-i/2 exp(...)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2)[ -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (i/2)( -i exp(...) |+z\u27e9 + exp(...) |-z\u27e9 )\n\n= (i/2 * (-i) exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9 + (i/2 exp(...) ) |-z\u27e9 )\n\ni*(-i) = 1, so first term (1/2 exp(...)) |+z\u27e9,\n\nsecond term (i/2 exp(...)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, adding the terms together:\n\nFor the |+z\u27e9 components:\n\nFirst term's |+z\u27e9 part: (1/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) \n\nSecond term's |+z\u27e9 part: (1/2) exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nTotal |+z\u27e9 coefficient: 1/2 [ exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ] = cos( \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSimilarly for the |-z\u27e9 components:\n\nFirst term's |-z\u27e9 part: (-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSecond term's |-z\u27e9 part: (i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nAdding these:\n\n[ -i/2 exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + i/2 exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ]\n\nFactor out i/2:\n\ni/2 [ - exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ]\n\nThe expression inside the brackets is - [ exp(i \u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) ] = -2i sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n- exp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = - [ exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) ] = -2i sin\u03b8,\n\nso the whole thing is:\n\ni/2 * (-2i sin\u03b8) = i/2 * (-2i) sin\u03b8 = (i * -2i)/2 * sin\u03b8 = ( (2) ) sin\u03b8,\n\nsince i*(-2i)= -2i\u00b2 = 2.\n\nThus the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t /2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b3 B t /2 ) ] |+z\u27e9 + [ sin(\u03b3 B t /2 ) ] |-z\u27e9,\n\nWait, but let me check the coefficients again.

Assuming \u0127=1, then:\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 = +1/2 |+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 = -1/2 |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8 * \u27e8+z| + sin\u03b8 * \u27e8-z| ] Sz [ cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nCompute this:\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * \u27e8+z| Sz |+z\u27e9 + cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 \u27e8+z| Sz |-z\u27e9 \n\n+ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 \u27e8-z| Sz |+z\u27e9 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03b8 \u27e8-z| Sz |-z\u27e9 \n\nBut since Sz off-diagonal terms are zero (Sz is diagonal in Sz basis), the cross terms (\u27e8+z| Sz |-z\u27e9 and \u27e8-z| Sz |+z\u27e9 ) are zero.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (1/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 (-1/2 )\n\n= (1/2)( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (1/2) cos(2\u03b8)\n\nBecause cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(2\u03b8) \n\nwhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2,\n\nso 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = (1/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz oscillates with cosine function, with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency. The angular frequency here is \u03b3 B, so the frequency in Hz (cycles per second) would be (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0). But the options are given in terms of \u03b3*B. Since the question says \"oscillation frequency\", which usually refers to the angular frequency (in radians per second) unless specified otherwise, but the options have gamma*B etc. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo in the expression, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B, so the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the expression I found was \u27e8Sz\u27e9 proportional to cos(\u03b3 B t). The argument of the cosine is (\u03b3 B) t. The angular frequency \u03c9 is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, so yes, \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Therefore the oscillation frequency is \u03c9 = \u03b3 B, so the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but I thought the energy difference was \u03b3 B, so the frequency would be (\u0394E)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B / \u0127. Since if \u0127 is set to 1, then that's the angular frequency. Since in the problem, the units are not specified, but the options have gamma*B as an option, so that must be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again:\n\nThe time dependence of the state led to \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(\u03b3 B t). So the cosine term has a frequency of \u03b3 B. So the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B.\n\nHmm. But let me think again. Let's see another approach.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution operator is exp( -i H t ). The expectation value of Sz(t) is \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8+z| exp(i H t) Sz exp(-i H t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of motion for \u27e8Sz\u27e9 can be found using the Heisenberg equation:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sz] \u27e9.\n\nSince H = -\u03b3 B Sy,\n\n[H, Sz] = -\u03b3 B [Sy, Sz] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127/2 Sx )\n\nWait, because [Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx? Let me recall the commutators.\n\nThe commutators for angular momentum are [Sx, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz,\n\n[Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx,\n\n[Sz, Sx] = i\u0127 Sy.\n\nSo [Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx,\n\ntherefore,\n\n[H, Sz] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127 Sx )\n\nThus,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sz] \u27e9 = (i/\u0127)( -i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sx\u27e9 ) \n\n= \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, the next derivative:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sx] \u27e9,\n\n[H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B [ Sy, Sx ] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz ) \n\nsince [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz) = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\ntherefore,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127)( i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sz\u27e9 ) = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\nThus, we have the coupled equations:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9,\n\nLet me denote A = \u27e8Sz\u27e9, B = \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nthen:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = \u03b3 B * A,\n\nThis is a system of differential equations. Let's differentiate A again:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B ( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWait, no, because:\n\nWait, the second derivative of A is d/dt (dA/dt) = d/dt (\u03b3 B B ) = \u03b3 B ( dB/dt ) = \u03b3 B ( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWait, but that would lead to exponential growth, which can't be right. Wait, but in the equations above, the equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = \u03b3 B * A,\n\nSo substituting dB/dt into the second derivative of A:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B*( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo the equation is d\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nBut the solution to this equation would be A(t) = A0 e^{\u03b3 B t} + ... which is not oscillatory, but that contradicts the previous result where we had oscillations.\n\nHmm, this suggests I might have messed up a sign. Let me check the commutator again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the commutator [Sy, Sx].\n\nThe commutator [Sy, Sx] = Sy Sx - Sx Sy.\n\nUsing the angular momentum commutators,\n\n[Sx, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\ntherefore,\n\n[H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B [Sy, Sx] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz) = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\nso that part was correct.\n\nThen dB/dt = (i/\u0127)(i \u03b3 B \u0127 A) \u2192 (i^2 \u03b3 B \u0127 A)/\u0127 = - \u03b3 B A,\n\nWait, wait, no, let me redo that step.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation for Sx:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sx] \u27e9 \n\n[H, Sx] = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\nso,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127)(i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sz\u27e9 ) = (i^2 \u03b3 B ) \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\ni squared is -1,\n\nso,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = - \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\nAh! I missed a negative sign here. So the correct equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\ndB/dt = - \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9,\n\nwhere A = \u27e8Sz\u27e9, B = \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nSo now the equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = - \u03b3 B * A,\n\nNow, let's compute the second derivative of A:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B ( - \u03b3 B A ) = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWhich is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B,\n\nso the solution is A(t) = A(0) cos(\u03c9 t) + (1/\u03c9)(dA/dt at t=0) sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nAt t=0,\n\nA(0) = \u27e8Sz\u27e9 at t=0 is +1/2 (since the initial state is |+z\u27e9),\n\ndA/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B * \u27e8Sx\u27e9(0).\n\nBut \u27e8Sx\u27e9 at t=0: the initial state is |+z\u27e9, so \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = \u27e8+z| Sx |+z\u27e9 =0,\n\nsince Sx is off-diagonal in the Sz basis. So,\n\ndA/dt at t=0 is zero.\n\nThus,\n\nA(t) = (1/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ),\n\nwhich matches the previous result. Therefore the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, so the answer is B.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, when I computed the expectation value, I also found \u27e8Sz\u27e9 proportional to cos(\u03b3 B t), so the frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer must be B.\n\nHmm, so I think the answer is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, the field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that when the magnetic field direction changes, the spin state of the particle might precess around the new field direction. Since the initial state was aligned along +Z, when the field is turned to Y, the system will evolve in the new field's Hamiltonian. \n\nThe magnetic moment is given by \u03bc = \u03b3\u00b7Sz, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So when the field is in the Z direction, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>. But when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B_y, where B is along Y. Wait, actually, the direction of B is now Y, so the Hamiltonian would be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y, which would involve the spin operator in the Y direction, right?\n\nThe key here is to find how the expectation value of Sz oscillates over time when the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to the Y direction. \n\nLet me think. The initial state is |+z>, since the particle's moment was aligned with the original B in Z. Now, when the field is turned off and turned on in Y, the system is now governed by the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state will depend on this new H. \n\nSo the new Hamiltonian H' = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B_y. Let me write that in terms of operators. Since B is along Y, H' = -\u03b3 B Sy. Wait, but actually, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S (since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin vector). Wait, the problem says \"mu = gamma*Sz\". Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz? That's a bit confusing because usually the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector, so \u03bc = \u03b3 S. But here, maybe they are defining mu as specifically along the z-component? Wait, that might be a mistake in the problem's wording, but perhaps the magnetic moment is aligned along Sz when the field is in Z. Hmm, maybe the problem is simplifying, so that the magnetic moment's z-component is gamma Sz. Because the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin, so \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz. But the total magnetic moment would be a vector. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the z-component of the moment, and since the particle is in the +z state, then \u03bc_z is positive. \n\nAnyway, moving forward. Let's consider the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with +1/2 (since it's spin-1/2). So the initial state is |+z>. Now, when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B_y. Since the magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin, so H would be proportional to -S\u00b7B_y. Wait, let's clarify. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H = -\u03b3 S\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nSo the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. Since the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz satisfy the commutation relations, and the system will evolve under H = -\u03b3 B Sy. \n\nThe question is about the expectation value of Sz as a function of time. Since the initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of Sy, the expectation value of Sz will oscillate as the system evolves. \n\nTo find the time dependence, we can use the time evolution under the Hamiltonian. Let me recall that the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). Since H here is proportional to Sy, let's denote H = \u03c9 Sy, where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B (since H = -\u03b3 B Sy, so \u03c9 would be \u03b3 B, but with a sign, but the magnitude is \u03b3 B). \n\nWait, let's be precise. Let me set \u0127 =1 for simplicity here, since in the equations it's often set to 1. So H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy for a spin-1/2 particle are \u00b1\u0127/2, but if we set \u0127=1, then \u00b11/2. So the eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b11/2. \n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t). Since H is proportional to Sy, this is exp(i \u03b3 B Sy t). \n\nNow, to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t, we can write:\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8+z | U\u2020(t) Sz U(t) | +z \u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since the operators will rotate, but maybe it's easier to work in the basis of Sy's eigenstates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize the Hamiltonian and find the time evolution. Let me think of the basis states. Let me consider the eigenstates of Sy. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of these eigenstates. \n\nThe states |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of the Sz basis. The standard relation is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * i, or something like that. Wait, let me recall that the eigenstates of Sy are:\n\nThe eigenvalue equation for Sy is Sy |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u00b1 (\u0127/2) |\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nExpressed in the Sz basis (with \u0127=1), Sy has the matrix representation:\n\nSy = (\u0127/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nSo, if we write Sy as (1/2)[0 -i; i 0], then the eigenvalues are \u00b11/2. \n\nTo find the eigenvectors, solving (Sy - \u03bb I) v =0. For \u03bb = +1/2:\n\n[ -1/2  -i    ] [a]   = 0\n[  i    -1/2 ] [b]\n\nSo, - (1/2) a -i b =0 \u2192 a = -2i b. Let me pick b=1, then a = -2i, but normalized. Wait, perhaps better to use standard expressions. \n\nAlternatively, the eigenstates of Sy can be written as:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me suppose that:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the state is a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9. Applying Sy to this:\n\nSy (a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9) = (1/2)( -i a |-z\u27e9 + i b |+z\u27e9 )\n\nWe want this equal to \u03bb (a|+z\u27e9 + b|-z\u27e9).\n\nSo:\n\n( i b /2 ) |+z\u27e9 - (i a / 2)|-z\u27e9 = \u03bb a |+z\u27e9 + \u03bb b |-z\u27e9\n\nSo equating coefficients:\n\ni b /2 = \u03bb a,\n\n- i a / 2 = \u03bb b.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \u03bb = +1/2:\n\nThen,\n\ni b/2 = (1/2) a \u2192 a = i b,\n\n- i a /2 = (1/2) b \u2192 substituting a =i b,\n\n- i (i b)/2 = (1/2) b \u2192 ( -i^2 b ) /2 = (1/2) b \u2192 (b)/2 = (1/2) b \u2192 holds.\n\nThus, a =i b. Let\u2019s set b=1, then a =i. The state is (i|+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/sqrt(|i|\u00b2 +1) \u2192 since |i|\u00b2 =1, so sqrt(2). So,\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly for the other eigenstate with \u03bb = -1/2, we can find:\n\n- i b/2 = - (1/2)a \u2192 a = -i b,\n\nand so on, leading to |-y\u27e9 = ( -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 or something. Wait, maybe I need to check again, but let's just proceed.\n\nSo, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] * something + ... \n\nWait, let me express |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me suppose:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u03b1 |+y\u27e9 + \u03b2 |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u03b1 [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + \u03b2 [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-derive the coefficients properly. Let me see:\n\nSuppose |+y\u27e9 is (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, then:\n\nIf I take the coefficients such that:\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLet me write |+y\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9,\n\nthen Sy |+y\u27e9 = (1/2)( -i A |-z\u27e9 + i B |+z\u27e9 ) = (1/2)( i B |+z\u27e9 -i A |-z\u27e9 )\n\nThis must equal (1/2)|+y\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\ni B |+z\u27e9 -i A |-z\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9,\n\nwhich gives equations:\n\ni B = A,\n\n- i A = B.\n\nFrom the first equation: A = i B,\n\nSubstitute into second equation: -i (i B) = B \u2192 (-i^2) B = B \u2192 B = B. So that works. Let's choose B =1, so A =i. Then normalize: the coefficients squared are |i|^2 + 1 = 1 +1 = 2, so divide by sqrt(2). So yes, that gives |+y\u27e9 as (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9, if we set Sy |-y\u27e9 = - (1/2)|-y\u27e9,\n\nthen following similar steps, we get |-y\u27e9 = (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo now, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me write |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nGrouping terms:\n\nThe coefficient for |+z\u27e9 is (a i /\u221a2) + (b (-i)/\u221a2),\n\nand the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is (a /\u221a2) + (b /\u221a2).\n\nWe need this to equal |+z\u27e9, so the coefficient for |+z\u27e9 must be 1, and for |-z\u27e9 must be 0.\n\nSo:\n\nFor |+z\u27e9:\n\n[ (a i - b i)/\u221a2 ] = 1,\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, the coefficient of |+z\u27e9 is (a i)/\u221a2 (from first term) plus (-i b)/\u221a2 (from the second term's coefficient of |+z\u27e9). So:\n\n(a i - b i)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nand the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is (a + b)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(a - b)i = \u221a2,\n\nand (a + b) =0.\n\nFrom the second equation, a = -b.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n( -b - b ) i = \u221a2 \u2192 -2b i = \u221a2 \u2192 b = -\u221a2/(2i) = i\u221a2/2 (since 1/i = -i).\n\nThus, b = i\u221a2/2,\n\nand a = -b = -i\u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = ( -i\u221a2/2 ) |+y\u27e9 + (i\u221a2/2) |-y\u27e9 )\n\nFactor out (i\u221a2/2):\n\n= (i\u221a2/2)( - |+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 )\n\nWait, but let's check the math again. Wait, a is -i\u221a2/2, so:\n\na |+y\u27e9 = (-i\u221a2/2) * [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nSimilarly for the b term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically. Let's see:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\na + b =0,\n\nso b = -a,\n\nthen substituting into the first equation:\n\n(a - b)i /\u221a2 =1,\n\nsince (a - b) = a - (-a) = 2a,\n\nso (2a i)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/(2i) = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nso then a = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nand b = i\u221a2/2,\n\nso substituting into the expression for |+z\u27e9,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (-i\u221a2/2)|+y\u27e9 + (i\u221a2/2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, moving on. The initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is expressed in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. \n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are \u00b11/2 (in units where \u0127=1). Therefore, the energy eigenvalues for H would be:\n\nH |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (1/2)|+y\u27e9,\n\nand H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-1/2)|-y\u27e9 = (\u03b3 B /2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nSo the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B/2 and E_- = \u03b3 B/2.\n\nThe time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a exp(-i E_+ t) |+y\u27e9 + b exp(-i E_- t) |-y\u27e9.\n\nGiven that a and b were the coefficients from before:\n\na = -i\u221a2/2,\n\nb = i\u221a2/2,\n\nso substituting,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ -i\u221a2/2 exp(-i (-\u03b3 B /2 ) t ) ] |+y\u27e9 + [ i\u221a2/2 exp( -i ( \u03b3 B /2 ) t ) ] |-y\u27e9,\n\nWait, because E_+ is the energy for |+y\u27e9, so E_+ = -\u03b3 B /2, so exp(-i E_+ t) = exp( i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSimilarly, E_- is \u03b3 B /2, so exp(-i E_- t) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nFirst term:\n\n- i\u221a2/2 * exp( i \u03b3 B t /2 ) |+y\u27e9,\n\nSecond term:\n\ni\u221a2/2 * exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 ) |-y\u27e9,\n\nNow, we need to compute \u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since Sz is diagonal in the Sz basis, maybe it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, then compute the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since Sz and Sy do not commute, their expectation values will precess.\n\nThe expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between the eigenstates. \n\nThe energy difference between the two eigenstates is E_+ - E_- = (-\u03b3 B/2) - (\u03b3 B/2) ) = - \u03b3 B. The absolute difference is \u03b3 B. The oscillation frequency is related to this energy difference by \u03c9 = (E_+ - E_-)/\u0127. Since \u0127 is 1 here, the frequency is (\u0394E)/\u0127 = ( - \u03b3 B ) /1 \u2192 but the absolute value is \u03b3 B. Wait, but the frequency of oscillation is the absolute value of the difference in energy divided by h-bar. Since the energy difference is \u0394E = (\u03b3 B/2 - (-\u03b3 B/2))? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the two energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B/2 and E_- = +\u03b3 B/2. The difference between them is E_- - E_+ = (\u03b3 B/2 - (-\u03b3 B/2 )) = \u03b3 B. So the energy difference is \u03b3 B. \n\nThe oscillation frequency is (\u0394E)/(\u0127) = \u03b3 B / \u0127. But if we set \u0127=1, then it's \u03b3 B. But the problem states to find the frequency. Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component. \n\nAlternatively, the frequency of oscillation is determined by the Rabi frequency, which for a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field along a direction perpendicular to the initial spin is given by the magnitude of the magnetic field times gamma. \n\nWait, let me think again. The time evolution leads to the expectation value of Sz oscillating. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nLet me express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\nWe have the initial |+z\u27e9 written as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, and each of those are expressed in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. Let me substitute those expressions into the time-evolved state.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the time-evolved state:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ -i\u221a2/2 exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) ] * [ (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] \n\n+ [ i\u221a2/2 exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 ) ] * [ (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n- i\u221a2/2 * exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) multiplied by (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\nThe constants are (-i\u221a2/2) * (1/\u221a2) ) = (-i)/2,\n\nand the exponential is exp(i \u03b3 B t /2).\n\nSo the first term is:\n\n(-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) (i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 )\n\nSimilarly for the second term:\n\ni\u221a2/2 * exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2 ) multiplied by (-i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nConstants: (i\u221a2/2)(1/\u221a2) )= i/2,\n\nso the second term is:\n\n(i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2 ) ( -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 )\n\nNow expand both terms:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t/2) [i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (-i/2)(i exp(...) |+z\u27e9 + exp(...) |-z\u27e9 )\n\n= (-i/2 * i exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9 + (-i/2 exp(...) ) |-z\u27e9 )\n\nThe first part: -i * i = 1, so (1/2 exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9,\n\nthe second part: (-i/2 exp(...)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t/2)[ -i |+z\u27e9 + |-z\u27e9 ]\n\n= (i/2)( -i exp(...) |+z\u27e9 + exp(...) |-z\u27e9 )\n\n= (i/2 * (-i) exp(...) ) |+z\u27e9 + (i/2 exp(...) ) |-z\u27e9 )\n\ni*(-i) = 1, so first term (1/2 exp(...)) |+z\u27e9,\n\nsecond term (i/2 exp(...)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, adding the terms together:\n\nFor the |+z\u27e9 components:\n\nFirst term's |+z\u27e9 part: (1/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) \n\nSecond term's |+z\u27e9 part: (1/2) exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nTotal |+z\u27e9 coefficient: 1/2 [ exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + exp( -i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ] = cos( \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSimilarly for the |-z\u27e9 components:\n\nFirst term's |-z\u27e9 part: (-i/2) exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nSecond term's |-z\u27e9 part: (i/2) exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 )\n\nAdding these:\n\n[ -i/2 exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + i/2 exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ]\n\nFactor out i/2:\n\ni/2 [ - exp(i \u03b3 B t /2 ) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t /2 ) ]\n\nThe expression inside the brackets is - [ exp(i \u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) ] = -2i sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t/2.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n- exp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) = - [ exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) ] = -2i sin\u03b8,\n\nso the whole thing is:\n\ni/2 * (-2i sin\u03b8) = i/2 * (-2i) sin\u03b8 = (i * -2i)/2 * sin\u03b8 = ( (2) ) sin\u03b8,\n\nsince i*(-2i)= -2i\u00b2 = 2.\n\nThus the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t /2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b3 B t /2 ) ] |+z\u27e9 + [ sin(\u03b3 B t /2 ) ] |-z\u27e9,\n\nWait, but let me check the coefficients again. Let me re-express:\n\nThe |-z> term had:\n\n[ -i/2 exp(i\u03b8) + i/2 exp(-i\u03b8) ] \n\nwhere \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t /2,\n\nso let's compute:\n\n- i/2 [ e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} ] ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nThe two terms are:\n\nTerm1: (-i/2) e^{i\u03b8}\n\nTerm2: (i/2) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nAdding them:\n\n[ -i e^{i\u03b8} + i e^{-i\u03b8} ] / 2 \n\nFactor out i:\n\ni [ -e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} ] / 2 \n\nThe bracket is - (e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8}) = -2i sin\u03b8,\n\nWait, e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8} = 2i sin\u03b8,\n\nso - (e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8}) = -2i sin\u03b8,\n\nso the whole thing is:\n\ni * (-2i sin\u03b8) /2 \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is i multiplied by [ - (e^{i\u03b8} - e^{-i\u03b8}) ] divided by 2,\n\nso:\n\ni * [ -2i sin\u03b8 ] / 2 \n\n= [ -2i^2 sin\u03b8 ] / 2 \n\nsince i*(-2i) = -2i\u00b2 = 2,\n\nso that's (2 sin\u03b8)/2 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo yes, the coefficient for |-z\u27e9 is sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b3 B t /2.\n\nSo the state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8)|+z\u27e9 + sin(\u03b8)|-z\u27e9,\n\nwith \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2.\n\nNow, the expectation value of Sz is:\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nSince Sz |+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9, and Sz |-z\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9. Assuming \u0127=1, then:\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 = +1/2 |+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 = -1/2 |-z\u27e9.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = [ cos\u03b8 * \u27e8+z| + sin\u03b8 * \u27e8-z| ] Sz [ cos\u03b8 |+z\u27e9 + sin\u03b8 |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nCompute this:\n\n= cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * \u27e8+z| Sz |+z\u27e9 + cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 \u27e8+z| Sz |-z\u27e9 \n\n+ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 \u27e8-z| Sz |+z\u27e9 + sin\u03b8 sin\u03b8 \u27e8-z| Sz |-z\u27e9 \n\nBut since Sz off-diagonal terms are zero (Sz is diagonal in Sz basis), the cross terms (\u27e8+z| Sz |-z\u27e9 and \u27e8-z| Sz |+z\u27e9 ) are zero.\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 (1/2) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 (-1/2 )\n\n= (1/2)( cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= (1/2) cos(2\u03b8)\n\nBecause cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(2\u03b8) \n\nwhere \u03b8 = (\u03b3 B t)/2,\n\nso 2\u03b8 = \u03b3 B t.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8Sz(t)\u27e9 = (1/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nSo the expectation value of Sz oscillates with cosine function, with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency. The angular frequency here is \u03b3 B, so the frequency in Hz (cycles per second) would be (\u03b3 B)/(2\u03c0). But the options are given in terms of \u03b3*B. Since the question says \"oscillation frequency\", which usually refers to the angular frequency (in radians per second) unless specified otherwise, but the options have gamma*B etc. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo in the expression, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B, so the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, the expression I found was \u27e8Sz\u27e9 proportional to cos(\u03b3 B t). The argument of the cosine is (\u03b3 B) t. The angular frequency \u03c9 is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, so yes, \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Therefore the oscillation frequency is \u03c9 = \u03b3 B, so the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but I thought the energy difference was \u03b3 B, so the frequency would be (\u0394E)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B / \u0127. Since if \u0127 is set to 1, then that's the angular frequency. Since in the problem, the units are not specified, but the options have gamma*B as an option, so that must be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again:\n\nThe time dependence of the state led to \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(\u03b3 B t). So the cosine term has a frequency of \u03b3 B. So the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B.\n\nHmm. But let me think again. Let's see another approach.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B Sy. The time evolution operator is exp( -i H t ). The expectation value of Sz(t) is \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8+z| exp(i H t) Sz exp(-i H t) |+z\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of motion for \u27e8Sz\u27e9 can be found using the Heisenberg equation:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sz] \u27e9.\n\nSince H = -\u03b3 B Sy,\n\n[H, Sz] = -\u03b3 B [Sy, Sz] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127/2 Sx )\n\nWait, because [Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx? Let me recall the commutators.\n\nThe commutators for angular momentum are [Sx, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz,\n\n[Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx,\n\n[Sz, Sx] = i\u0127 Sy.\n\nSo [Sy, Sz] = i\u0127 Sx,\n\ntherefore,\n\n[H, Sz] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127 Sx )\n\nThus,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sz] \u27e9 = (i/\u0127)( -i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sx\u27e9 ) \n\n= \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9 \n\nSimilarly, the next derivative:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sx] \u27e9,\n\n[H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B [ Sy, Sx ] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz ) \n\nsince [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz) = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\ntherefore,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127)( i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sz\u27e9 ) = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\nThus, we have the coupled equations:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9,\n\nLet me denote A = \u27e8Sz\u27e9, B = \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nthen:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = \u03b3 B * A,\n\nThis is a system of differential equations. Let's differentiate A again:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B ( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWait, no, because:\n\nWait, the second derivative of A is d/dt (dA/dt) = d/dt (\u03b3 B B ) = \u03b3 B ( dB/dt ) = \u03b3 B ( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWait, but that would lead to exponential growth, which can't be right. Wait, but in the equations above, the equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = \u03b3 B * A,\n\nSo substituting dB/dt into the second derivative of A:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B*( \u03b3 B A ) = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo the equation is d\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nBut the solution to this equation would be A(t) = A0 e^{\u03b3 B t} + ... which is not oscillatory, but that contradicts the previous result where we had oscillations.\n\nHmm, this suggests I might have messed up a sign. Let me check the commutator again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the commutator [Sy, Sx].\n\nThe commutator [Sy, Sx] = Sy Sx - Sx Sy.\n\nUsing the angular momentum commutators,\n\n[Sx, Sy] = i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\nso [Sy, Sx] = -i\u0127 Sz,\n\ntherefore,\n\n[H, Sx] = -\u03b3 B [Sy, Sx] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 Sz) = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\nso that part was correct.\n\nThen dB/dt = (i/\u0127)(i \u03b3 B \u0127 A) \u2192 (i^2 \u03b3 B \u0127 A)/\u0127 = - \u03b3 B A,\n\nWait, wait, no, let me redo that step.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation for Sx:\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127) \u27e8 [H, Sx] \u27e9 \n\n[H, Sx] = i \u03b3 B \u0127 Sz,\n\nso,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = (i/\u0127)(i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u27e8Sz\u27e9 ) = (i^2 \u03b3 B ) \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\ni squared is -1,\n\nso,\n\nd/dt \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = - \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9 \n\nAh! I missed a negative sign here. So the correct equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\ndB/dt = - \u03b3 B \u27e8Sz\u27e9,\n\nwhere A = \u27e8Sz\u27e9, B = \u27e8Sx\u27e9,\n\nSo now the equations are:\n\ndA/dt = \u03b3 B * B,\n\ndB/dt = - \u03b3 B * A,\n\nNow, let's compute the second derivative of A:\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * dB/dt = \u03b3 B ( - \u03b3 B A ) = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2A/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 A,\n\nWhich is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B,\n\nso the solution is A(t) = A(0) cos(\u03c9 t) + (1/\u03c9)(dA/dt at t=0) sin(\u03c9 t).\n\nAt t=0,\n\nA(0) = \u27e8Sz\u27e9 at t=0 is +1/2 (since the initial state is |+z\u27e9),\n\ndA/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B * \u27e8Sx\u27e9(0).\n\nBut \u27e8Sx\u27e9 at t=0: the initial state is |+z\u27e9, so \u27e8Sx\u27e9 = \u27e8+z| Sx |+z\u27e9 =0,\n\nsince Sx is off-diagonal in the Sz basis. So,\n\ndA/dt at t=0 is zero.\n\nThus,\n\nA(t) = (1/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ),\n\nwhich matches the previous result. Therefore the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, so the answer is B.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, when I computed the expectation value, I also found \u27e8Sz\u27e9 proportional to cos(\u03b3 B t), so the frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer must be B.\n\nHmm, so I think the answer is B.\n\n\nThe spin-1/2 particle initially aligned with the +Z magnetic field is in the state |+z\u27e9. When the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\). The time evolution of the state \\( |\\psi(t)\\rangle \\) is governed by this Hamiltonian. Expressing the initial state in the eigenbasis of \\( S_y \\), we find that the expectation value of \\( S_z \\) oscillates as \\( \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t) \\). The angular frequency of this oscillation is \\( \\gamma B \\), corresponding to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B.\n\nFirst, I remember that the magnetic moment \u03bc of a spin-1/2 particle is related to the spin angular momentum. The problem states that \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and Sz is the z-component of the spin. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction, so that means the spin is in the +z eigenstate. Let's denote that state as |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nNow, when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along the +Y direction, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, substituting \u03bc gives H = -\u03b3 Sz \u00b7 B. Wait, actually, since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B, because the direction of B has changed from Z to Y. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3*Sz, so substituting into H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where B is along Y. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin operator. The standard form is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so in this problem, they specify \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Wait, that might be a simplification? Wait, actually, maybe the problem is using a simplified version where the magnetic moment is only along the z-component, but that might not be right. Hmm, maybe I need to check the question again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)\". Oh, okay, so they explicitly define \u03bc as gamma times Sz. So that would mean that the magnetic moment's z-component is \u03b3 Sz. But in reality, the magnetic moment is a vector, so in general \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so each component would depend on the spin components. But here, the problem is defining \u03bc as only the z-component part? That might be a bit odd, but perhaps in the context of the problem, they are considering the component along the original field direction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to proceed with the given information.\n\nInitially, the particle is in the state where Sz is maximum (since it's aligned with B_z). So that's the spin-up state in the z-direction. Now, when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, but since B is now in the Y direction, and \u03bc is given as gamma Sz, then H would be -gamma Sz * B_y? Wait, but B is along Y, so the dot product between \u03bc (which is along z?) and B (along Y) would be zero. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*Sz. Hmm, so that's the z-component of the spin multiplied by gamma. But in reality, the magnetic moment should be a vector, so perhaps the question is oversimplifying. Alternatively, maybe they are considering that the magnetic field is along Z initially, so the magnetic moment is aligned along Z. When the field is turned to Y, the magnetic moment can have components in other directions? But according to the problem's definition, mu is only gamma*Sz. That might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different notation where mu is the full vector, so mu = gamma S, and then when the field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu \u22c5 B = -gamma S \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, that becomes H = -gamma S_y B. Wait, that would make more sense. Maybe the problem's notation is that mu equals gamma times the spin operator, so the full vector. But the question says \"mu = gamma*Sz\". Hmm, maybe I need to take their wording at face value. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction.\" So, mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Wait, so that would mean that the magnetic moment is only along the z-component? But then if the magnetic field is turned to the Y direction, the interaction energy would depend on the Y component of the magnetic moment. But according to their definition, mu is only gamma*Sz. That would mean that the Hamiltonian when the field is in Y direction would be H = -mu \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, the dot product would be mu_y * B, but according to their definition, mu is gamma Sz, so the Y component of mu would be zero? That can't be right. Maybe there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's notation is that mu is the vector, and Sz is the z-component of the spin. Then, mu = gamma S, so the z-component is gamma Sz. So when they write mu = gamma Sz, maybe they are just specifying the component? That might be a confusing way to write it, but perhaps that's the case. So the full magnetic moment vector is gamma times the spin vector. So the Hamiltonian would then be H = -mu \u22c5 B = -gamma S \u22c5 B. So when the field is along Z, it's H = -gamma S_z B, and when it's along Y, it becomes H = -gamma S_y B. That seems more consistent. Maybe the problem's wording was just specifying the relation between mu and Sz in the initial state. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the initial state is the eigenstate of S_z with +1/2 (since it's aligned with B in Z direction). Now, when we suddenly switch the magnetic field to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The system will then evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9, so we need to find the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and find its oscillation frequency.\n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, we can express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (since the time evolution will be governed by S_y). The eigenstates of S_y are |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. The initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as a combination of these. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_z and S_y are related by rotations. Specifically, the eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the S_z basis.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 - |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1\u0127/2 (for spin 1/2), but the actual states depend on the convention. Let me think of the Pauli matrices. The S_y matrix (in units where \u0127=1) is (i/2)[\u03c3_y], but the eigenstates for S_y=+1/2 would be (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 and similarly for the negative. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact form.\n\nThe eigenstates of the Pauli Y matrix (\u03c3_y) are:\n\nFor eigenvalue +1: (1, i)^T normalized, so in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSimilarly, the eigenstate for -1 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 - i |\u2193y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf |\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen solving for |\u2191z\u27e9:\n\nMultiply both sides by \u221a2: \u221a2 |\u2191y\u27e9 = |\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSimilarly, for |\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso \u221a2 |\u2193y\u27e9 = |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nAdding the equations for |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\n\u221a2 (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9) = 2 |\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nso |\u2191z\u27e9 = (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I need to do this more carefully.\n\nLet me denote |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 as the eigenstates of S_y with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 (in units where \u0127=1, but since we are dealing with frequencies, the actual \u0127 might cancel out). Let me just work with the Pauli matrices. The \u03c3_y matrix is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i],\n         [i, 0]]\n\nThe eigenvalues are \u00b11. The eigenvectors for +1 are found by solving (\u03c3_y - I)v =0:\n\n[ -1  -i      ] [a]   = 0\n[  i   -1     ] [b]\n\nSo, -a -i b =0 \u2192 a = -i b,\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as ( -i, 1 )^T, normalized. So dividing by sqrt( (-i)^2 +1^2 )? Wait, the norm squared is | -i |^2 + |1|^2 = 1 +1 =2. So the normalized eigenvector is ( -i /\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ). Wait, but maybe written as (1, i) normalized? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, another approach. Suppose the eigenvector is (a, b). Then,\n\n\u03c3_y * [a; b] = \u03bb [a; b]\n\nSo:\n\n- i b = \u03bb a,\n\ni a = \u03bb b.\n\nAssuming \u03bb=1,\n\nThen from first equation: -i b = a,\n\nSecond equation: i a = b \u2192 substituting a from first equation: i*(-i b) = b \u2192 (i*(-i))=1 \u2192 1*b = b \u2192 yes. So a = -i b.\n\nLet me choose b =1, then a = -i. So the vector is (-i, 1). To normalize, divide by sqrt( |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1 +1 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -i/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ). So the eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9 is ( -i/\u221a2 |\u2191z\u27e9 + 1/\u221a2 |\u2193z\u27e9 )? Wait, the first component corresponds to |\u2191z\u27e9 and the second to |\u2193z\u27e9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps written as ( |\u2191z\u27e9 + i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2? Let me see:\n\nWait, if I have ( |\u2191z\u27e9 + i |\u2193z\u27e9 ), then the components would be (1, i). The norm squared is 1 +1 =2, so normalized gives (1/\u221a2)(1, i). But when multiplied by \u03c3_y, let's check:\n\n\u03c3_y * (1/\u221a2)(1, i)^T = (1/\u221a2)[ -i*(i), i*(1) ]^T = (1/\u221a2)[1, i]^T ?\n\nWait, \u03c3_y applied to (1,i):\n\nFirst component: -i*(i) = -i\u00b2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: i*(1) = i,\n\nSo the result is (1, i)^T, which is the same as the original vector. So that works. So the eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9 is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. The other eigenstate is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 for the eigenvalue -1.\n\nTherefore, the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be expressed as:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 -i |\u2193y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me express |\u2191z\u27e9 as a combination of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. Let me denote:\n\nLet |\u2191y\u27e9 = (1, i)/\u221a2,\n\nand |\u2193y\u27e9 = (1, -i)/\u221a2 (since the other eigenstate would have eigenvalue -1, so similar but with minus sign in the second component?)\n\nWait, actually the other eigenstate for -1 would be (1, -i)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let's recalculate for \u03bb=-1:\n\n\u03c3_y * v = -v,\n\nso equations:\n\n- i b = -a \u2192 -i b = -a \u2192 a = i b,\n\nand i a = -b,\n\nSubstituting a =i b into the second equation: i*(i b) = -b \u2192 i\u00b2 b = -b \u2192 -b = -b \u2192 holds. So choosing b=1 gives a= i*1 =i. So the vector is (i, 1), normalized to (i,1)/\u221a2. So the eigenstate is (i |\u2191z\u27e9 + |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. Hmm, so perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second eigenstate is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2? Let me see:\n\nTake |\u2193y\u27e9 as ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. Let me plug that into \u03c3_y:\n\n\u03c3_y * ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 = ?\n\nExpressed as a vector: (1, -i)/\u221a2. Applying \u03c3_y:\n\nFirst component: -i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: i*(1) = i,\n\nSo the result is (1, i)/\u221a2, which is the original |\u2191y\u27e9. Wait, that's not right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me instead write the components properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenstates are written as:\n\nFor |\u2191y\u27e9: (1, i)/\u221a2,\n\nfor |\u2193y\u27e9: (1, -i)/\u221a2,\n\nthen:\n\nExpressing |\u2191z\u27e9 as a combination:\n\nLet me write |\u2191z\u27e9 = a |\u2191y\u27e9 + b |\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in components,\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 is (1,0). So,\n\na*(1/\u221a2, i/\u221a2 ) + b*(1/\u221a2, -i/\u221a2 ) = ( (a + b)/\u221a2, (a i - b i)/\u221a2 )\n\nSet equal to (1,0). Therefore,\n\nFirst component: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: (i(a - b))/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 (a - b)=0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nFrom second equation, a = b,\n\nThen first equation: (a +a)/\u221a2 = 1 \u2192 2a/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 =1/\u221a2,\n\nThus, a = b =1/\u221a2,\n\nTherefore, |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nAh, so that's the correct expansion. So the initial state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (since H is proportional to S_y, which has |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 as eigenstates).\n\nSo the time evolution will be governed by these eigenstates. The Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1(\u0127/2), but let's see:\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y in terms of the Hamiltonian: since H is proportional to S_y, so the energy eigenvalues would be E_\u2191 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), and E_\u2193 = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Wait, actually, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 (assuming \u0127 is the spin quantum number?), but in natural units, perhaps the spin operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b11/2 (in units of \u0127). Let me confirm the units. The spin operator S in units of \u0127 is such that S\u00b2 = (s(s+1))\u0127\u00b2, so for s=1/2, S\u00b2 = (3/4)\u0127\u00b2, so the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be:\n\nE_\u2191 = -\u03b3 B (S_y eigenvalue) \u2192 Wait, H is -\u03b3 B S_y, so for eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9, which has S_y = +\u0127/2, the energy is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Similarly, |\u2193y\u27e9 has S_y = -\u0127/2, so energy is -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nTherefore, the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 and E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2. \n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u2191z\u27e9, which is ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2, will be:\n\nAt time t, the state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} ) /\u221a2 \n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 \u2192 e^{-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 }\n\nE_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 \u2192 e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } = e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 }\n\nTherefore,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } ] / \u221a2 \n\nNow, we need to compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 at time t. To find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, we can express S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9, |\u2193y\u27e9 basis.\n\nThe S_z operator in the S_y basis can be represented as a matrix. Since S_z and S_y do not commute, their matrices are not diagonal in each other's bases. Let me recall that in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal with entries +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But we need to express S_z in terms of the S_y basis states.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the state expressed in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, perhaps it's easier to compute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's note that S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 basis can be found by expressing S_z in terms of the S_y basis. Alternatively, let's just compute the expectation value.\n\nLet me write the expectation value:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, let's write the bra vector:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = [ \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } ) / \u221a2.\n\nNow, multiply this with S_z and then with |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute this step by step. Let me proceed:\n\nFirst, expand the expectation value:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)( \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} ) * S_z * (1/\u221a2)( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } )\n\nMultiply the constants: (1/2) times the rest.\n\nNow, expanding the product:\n\nThe terms will be:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{0} =1. So that term is \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nSecond term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{-i \u03b3 B t}.\n\nThird term:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{i \u03b3 B t}.\n\nFourth term:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{0}=1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t} \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t} \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute these matrix elements.\n\nFirst, let's find \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, and \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nTo compute these, we can express S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 basis. Let's recall that S_z and S_y are Pauli matrices. Let me recall that in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal, and S_y is off-diagonal. But here, we need S_z expressed in the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the matrix elements using the known basis states.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nThe state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, let's compute \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\nFirst, S_z in the S_z basis has eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. Let's work in units where \u0127=1 for simplicity (since it will cancel out in the frequency, which is an angular frequency).\n\nSo S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nS_z |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nNow, compute \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 )) / \u221a2\n\nCompute S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nS_z |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] ) / \u221a2\n\nNow, express \u27e8\u2191y| in terms of the S_z basis:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| = \u27e8\u2191z| (1/\u221a2) (1, -i) )? Wait, let me see. The state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2, so the dual vector \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z|, \u27e8\u2193z| ) times the conjugate transpose. The conjugate of |\u2191y\u27e9 is (1, -i)/\u221a2, so \u27e8\u2191y| = (\u27e8\u2191z|, \u27e8\u2193z| )*(1/\u221a2, -i/\u221a2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the inner products directly:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191z| ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (1 +0)/\u221a2 = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193z| ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (0 + i)/\u221a2 = i/\u221a2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (1/\u221a2)( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (i/\u221a2)( (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] dotted with \u27e8\u2191y|?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the scalar product. Wait, let me rephrase the previous step.\n\nWait, let me compute the expression again:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, sorry, let me redo this step carefully.\n\nOriginal expression after substituting S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 and S_z |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nWait, no, actually, the previous step was:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 ) +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nWait, no, sorry, the term inside the brackets after applying S_z was (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9, right? Because S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 is (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9, and S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9. So the i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 comes from the second term.\n\nSo the total inside the brackets is (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSo then:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nNow, \u27e8\u2191y| is the dual of |\u2191y\u27e9, so:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| = (\u27e8\u2191z| + i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 (since the dual is the conjugate transpose. Wait, actually, the conjugate of the coefficient of |\u2193z\u27e9 in |\u2191y\u27e9 is -i, but when taking the dual, the coefficients are conjugated. Wait, perhaps better to compute the inner product:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(\u27e8\u2191z|\u2191z\u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2191z|\u2193z\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)(1 +0) = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)(0 +i*1) = i/\u221a2,\n\nSo substituting back into \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\n= [ (\u27e8\u2191y| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) - (\u27e8\u2191y| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / \u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nPlugging the inner products:\n\n= ( (1/2)(1/\u221a2) - (i/2)(i/\u221a2) ) / \u221a2 \n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/(2\u221a2)) \n\nSecond term: - (i^2)/(2\u221a2) \u2192 since i^2 =-1 \u2192 becomes + (1)/(2\u221a2)\n\nSo adding them:\n\n(1/(2\u221a2) + 1/(2\u221a2)) / \u221a2 = ( (2/(2\u221a2)) ) / \u221a2 = (1/\u221a2)/\u221a2 = 1/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = 1/2 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate step by step:\n\nFirst, the first term inside the brackets is (1/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/(2\u221a2)\n\nSecond term: - (i/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = - (i/2)(i/\u221a2) = - (i^2)/(2\u221a2) = - (-1)/(2\u221a2) = +1/(2\u221a2)\n\nSo total inside the brackets: 1/(2\u221a2) + 1/(2\u221a2) = 1/\u221a2\n\nThen divide by \u221a2 (from the denominator in the original expression):\n\nSo total \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) / \u221a2 = 1/2 ?\n\nHmm, but S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 basis: since |\u2191y\u27e9 is an eigenstate of S_y, which is different from S_z, so \u27e8S_z\u27e9 for |\u2191y\u27e9 shouldn't be 1/2. Wait, but according to this calculation, it is 1/2. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2. The expectation value of S_z in the state |\u2191y\u27e9 would be \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9. Let's compute this:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 in the S_z basis is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nThe expectation value is \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i (1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2\n\nMultiply them out:\n\n= [ (\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (\u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / (2)\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(1) \n\nSecond term: (-i/2)(0) \u2192 0\n\nThird term: (i/2)(0) \u21920\n\nFourth term: (i*(-i)/2)(1) \u2192 since \u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9=1,\n\ni*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 (1/2)(1) \n\nSo total:\n\n[ (1/2) + (1/2) ] / 2 = (1) / 2 \u2192 1/2.\n\nHmm, so indeed the expectation value is 1/2? That's strange because |\u2191y\u27e9 is not an eigenstate of S_z, so I would expect some interference terms. Wait, but according to this, the expectation value is 1/2. Wait, but maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, but if I take |\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen the average S_z is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nWait, no, actually S_z applied to |\u2191y\u27e9 gives (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nso the expectation value is the inner product of |\u2191y\u27e9 with this result.\n\nWait, the inner product is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps I need to track the denominators correctly. Let me recast:\n\nS_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nWait, but \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo multiplying:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / (2)\n\nNow compute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)(1)\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (-i/2)(0)\n\n3. i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (i/2)(0)\n\n4. i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i*(-i)/2)(1) = (1/2)(1) because i*(-i)=1.\n\nSo total terms: (1/2 + 0 +0 +1/2 ) = 1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2. So yes, \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = 1/2. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so that's the expectation value. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 can be computed similarly. Let's see:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9. Since |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nFollowing similar steps:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 all over \u221a2.\n\nThen \u27e8\u2193y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nExpanding:\n\n\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n- i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\nall over 2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u2192 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n3. -i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n4. -i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 -i\u00b2 (1/2)*1 \u2192 (1/2)(1) since -i\u00b2=1.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0 +0 +1/2 =1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 =1/2 as well?\n\nWait, that's interesting. So both eigenstates of S_y have the same expectation value of S_z? That can't be right. Wait, but according to the math, yes. Wait, but then the expectation value of S_z for both |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 is 1/2? That would mean that regardless of the state, the expectation value of S_z is 1/2. That can't be correct.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the state definitions. Wait, let me think again. If |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9, so -i*S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nso adding (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nthen \u27e8\u2193y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso when multiplied by the state (1/2|\u2191z\u27e9 +i/2 |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck the fourth term in the calculation for \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nThe fourth term was -i multiplied by (i/2)*\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nWhich is -i*(i/2) = - (i\u00b2)/2 = - (-1)/2 = 1/2,\n\nso that term is positive 1/2. So total terms 1/2 +1/2 =1, divided by 2 gives 1/2. \n\nHmm, so both \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 equal 1/2? That would mean that both states have an expectation value of S_z equal to 1/2? That seems odd because when you have a superposition, but actually, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the definition of the states. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in units. Maybe the spin operators are in units where \u0127=1, so S_z has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Then, the expectation value here is 1/2, but in reality, that would mean that both states have the same expectation value for S_z, which might be correct because they are symmetric in some way. Wait, but if you have a particle in |\u2191y\u27e9, intuitively, since it's a superposition of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9, the average of Sz should be the average of +1/2 and -1/2 with coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nThe state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2. The expectation value of S_z is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by S_z acting on (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWhich is exactly what we did before. Let me compute it numerically:\n\nThe expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nWait, sorry, let me recalculate S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 again. \n\nS_z applied to |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 multiplied by S_z:\n\nS_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nTherefore, the expectation value is \u27e8\u2191y| times this:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 + i\u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i\u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nWait, let me see each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)*1,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = 0,\n\n3. i\u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (i/2)*0,\n\n4. i\u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i*(-i)/2)*1 \u2192 ( (i^2*(-i))? Wait, no, i*(-i/2) = -i\u00b2 /2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, term4: i multiplied by (-i/2)*\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 i*(-i/2)*1 = ( -i\u00b2 ) /2 \u2192 ( -(-1) )/2 \u2192 1/2.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0+0+1/2 =1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2. So indeed, \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 =1/2. Similarly for |\u2193y\u27e9. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so both eigenstates of S_y have the same expectation value of S_z? That's because they are symmetric with respect to the z-component? Interesting.\n\nTherefore, in the expression for \u27e8S_z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + ... ] \n\nThe first two terms are each 1/2, so their sum is 1, multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/2. \n\nThe other terms are the cross terms involving the off-diagonal matrix elements.\n\nNow, compute the cross terms:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nFirst, \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nAgain, using the expressions for the states:\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, no, more precisely:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*( -1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product:\n\n[ (\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / (2)\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = [\u27e8\u2191y| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191y| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, let me track the denominators:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = [ \u27e8\u2191y| (S_z |\u2193y\u27e9) ] \n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191y| ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nWait, S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nso \u27e8\u2191y| times that vector:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso multiply:\n\n(\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThis gives:\n\n[ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n+ i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u2192 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n3. i*(1/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n4. i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 (i\u00b2)/2 \u2192 (-1)/2.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0 +0 -1/2 =0 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 0.\n\nWait, so \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe fourth term is i multiplied by (i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 i*(i/2)*1 = (i\u00b2)/2 = -1/2,\n\nso total terms:\n\n1/2 (from first term) + (-1/2) (from fourth term) \u2192 0,\n\nso yes, the total is 0.

That contradicts this result.

But the question says the average starts oscillating. Clearly, I made a mistake here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the initial setup of the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Initially, when B is in the Z direction, H_initial = -gamma Sz * B_z. But after switching B to the Y direction, the new H is -gamma Sz * B_y? Wait, but B is along Y, so the dot product would be between mu and B. If mu is only in the Z direction (as per the problem's definition mu = gamma Sz), then the Hamiltonian when B is along Y would be H = -gamma Sz * B_y (since B is in Y, so only the Y component of B is non-zero, but the dot product of mu (which is along Z) with B (along Y) would be zero? Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, now I see the problem. The question defines mu as gamma Sz, which is the z-component of the spin multiplied by gamma. So mu is a vector with only a Z component. Therefore, when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma Sz) * B_y (since B has only a Y component). But Sz and B_y are perpendicular, so the dot product would involve Sz * B_y? Wait, no, the dot product is the sum of components. If mu has only a Z component, then mu \u00b7 B = (mu_z)(B_y) + ... no, wait, mu is a vector. If mu is along Z, then mu has components (0,0, gamma Sz). The magnetic field B is along Y, so components (0,B,0). Then the dot product is 0*0 + 0*B + (gamma Sz)*0 =0. Wait, that would mean H=0? That can't be right. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the problem states that mu = gamma Sz, then the magnetic moment is only along the Z axis. Then, when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy would be H = - mu \u22c5 B = - (gamma Sz)(B_y), since the Y component of mu is zero. But Sz and B_y are vectors? Wait, Sz is an operator, B is a vector. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's notation is that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. Then the z-component of mu is gamma Sz, which matches their notation. So the problem's wording might have been slightly ambiguous, but that must be the correct interpretation. So in that case, the Hamiltonian when B is along Y is H = - mu \u22c5 B = - gamma S \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = - gamma S_y B.\n\nAh! That must be the case. So my initial assumption was correct, and the confusion arose from the problem's wording. So proceeding with H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of H are as previously calculated, leading to the time evolution.\n\nBut then why did the expectation value of S_z come out as constant?\n\nHmm. Let me re-calculate \u27e8S_z\u27e9 using this corrected Hamiltonian and the previous steps. Wait, no, I think the error was in the calculation of the expectation value. Let me try again.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the calculation of \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9. Earlier, I found that \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0, but maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait let me re-calculate \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nUsing the states:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 \n\nFirst, compute S_z |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen, \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * (1/2 |\u2191z\u27e9 + i/2 |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n+ i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 =0,\n\n3. i*(1/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 =0,\n\n4. i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i\u00b2)/2 *1 = (-1)/2.\n\nTotal terms: 1/2 -1/2 =0,\n\nso \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0,\n\nand \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 =0 as well.\n\nHmm, so the cross terms are zero. So then \u27e8S_z\u27e9 is always 1/2?\n\nBut the question states that the average starts oscillating, so this suggests an error in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the time dependence of the state.\n\nWait, let me re-express the state again. The initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nWait no, earlier I found that:\n\nWait when I expressed |\u2191z\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, I had:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nWait wait, earlier calculation showed that:\n\nYes, in the earlier steps, I had:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nTherefore, when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y,\n\nThe eigenstates are |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 with energies:\n\nE_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B (S_y eigenvalue for |\u2191y\u27e9) \u2192 S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 1/2 (in units of \u0127), so:\n\nE_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B * (1/2),\n\nE_\u2193 = - \u03b3 B * (-1/2) = + \u03b3 B /2.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i E_\u2191 t / \u0127} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i E_\u2193 t / \u0127} ) /\u221a2,\n\nBut substituting E_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B /2 (assuming \u0127=1 for simplicity),\n\nthen,\n\ne^{-i E_\u2191 t} = e^{-i (- \u03b3 B /2) t } = e^{i \u03b3 B t /2},\n\nSimilarly, E_\u2193 = \u03b3 B /2,\n\nso e^{-i E_\u2193 t} = e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2},\n\nSo the state is indeed:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ) /\u221a2,\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nThen, when calculating \u27e8S_z\u27e9, the expectation value was found to be 1/2, but that contradicts the problem's premise. So there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I considered the magnetic moment as gamma Sz, but in reality, the spin operator S is a vector, and the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So S_z is just one component of the spin operator. However, when we compute the expectation value of S_z, it might not be the same as the z-component of the magnetic moment. Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma Sz, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma times the z-component of spin, but the full magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma S.\n\nWait, the problem says \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)\", which might mean that mu is the full vector, so the z-component of mu is gamma Sz, but the y-component would be gamma Sy. So when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u22c5 B = - (gamma Sy) B, since B is along Y. So H = - gamma B Sy. Wait, this is different from my previous assumption where I thought H was proportional to Sy. Wait, no, Sy is part of the spin operator. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B would be gamma S \u22c5 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma S \u22c5 B = -gamma S_y B. So that part was correct.\n\nBut then why does the expectation value of S_z not oscillate?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the basis. Let me try to compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 again, but using another approach. Let's express the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in the S_z basis and compute S_z.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is expressed in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, which are:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] /\u221a2,\n\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2.\n\nMultiply out terms:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)[ (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] /\u221a2,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 1/2 [ |\u2191z\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) + i |\u2193z\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t}) ]\n\nSimplify using Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2 cos(\u03c9t),\n\ne^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2i sin(\u03c9t),\n\nThus,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/2)[ 2 |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) + i*(2i) |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) ]\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe second term: i*(2i) = 2i\u00b2 = -2,\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/2)[ 2 |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - 2 |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) ]\n\n= |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t)\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t).\n\nNow, compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9:\n\nS_z in the S_z basis has eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2,\n\nso,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, write the state as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nthen the dual is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| = cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z|.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| ] S_z [ cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) \n\n- cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) \n\n- sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) \n\n+ sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z|S_z|\u2191z\u27e9 = 1/2,\n\nso first term: cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) * 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z|S_z|\u2193z\u27e9 =0,\n\nso second term:0,\n\n3. \u27e8\u2193z|S_z|\u2191z\u27e9 =0,\n\nthird term:0,\n\n4. \u27e8\u2193z|S_z|\u2193z\u27e9 =-1/2,\n\nso fourth term: sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)* (-1/2),\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - (1/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t),\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= (1/2)[ cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) ]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity: cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(2\u03c9t)\n\nAh! There we go. So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was \u03b3 B /2,\n\nthe frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B /2) = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, which is option B.\n\nSo where did I go wrong earlier? I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation when I tried to compute the expectation value in the S_y basis. Probably messed up the cross terms or missed the interference terms. By expressing the state in the S_z basis, it became straightforward.\n\nThe key was to recognize that after expanding the state in the S_z basis, the expectation value of S_z becomes (1/2)cos(2\u03c9t), which oscillates with frequency 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2, the angular frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B/2) = \u03b3 B. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency here (since it's given in terms of B and gamma, which are in units that would give angular frequency). Therefore, the answer is B) gamma*B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z direction to the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B.\n\nFirst, I remember that the magnetic moment \u03bc of a spin-1/2 particle is related to the spin angular momentum. The problem states that \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and Sz is the z-component of the spin. Initially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction, so that means the spin is in the +z eigenstate. Let's denote that state as |\u2191z\u27e9.\n\nNow, when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along the +Y direction, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, substituting \u03bc gives H = -\u03b3 Sz \u00b7 B. Wait, actually, since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 S_y B, because the direction of B has changed from Z to Y. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given as \u03b3*Sz, so substituting into H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where B is along Y. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin operator. The standard form is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so in this problem, they specify \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz. Wait, that might be a simplification? Wait, actually, maybe the problem is using a simplified version where the magnetic moment is only along the z-component, but that might not be right. Hmm, maybe I need to check the question again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)\". Oh, okay, so they explicitly define \u03bc as gamma times Sz. So that would mean that the magnetic moment's z-component is \u03b3 Sz. But in reality, the magnetic moment is a vector, so in general \u03bc = \u03b3 S, so each component would depend on the spin components. But here, the problem is defining \u03bc as only the z-component part? That might be a bit odd, but perhaps in the context of the problem, they are considering the component along the original field direction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to proceed with the given information.\n\nInitially, the particle is in the state where Sz is maximum (since it's aligned with B_z). So that's the spin-up state in the z-direction. Now, when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, but since B is now in the Y direction, and \u03bc is given as gamma Sz, then H would be -gamma Sz * B_y? Wait, but B is along Y, so the dot product between \u03bc (which is along z?) and B (along Y) would be zero. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*Sz. Hmm, so that's the z-component of the spin multiplied by gamma. But in reality, the magnetic moment should be a vector, so perhaps the question is oversimplifying. Alternatively, maybe they are considering that the magnetic field is along Z initially, so the magnetic moment is aligned along Z. When the field is turned to Y, the magnetic moment can have components in other directions? But according to the problem's definition, mu is only gamma*Sz. That might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different notation where mu is the full vector, so mu = gamma S, and then when the field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu \u22c5 B = -gamma S \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, that becomes H = -gamma S_y B. Wait, that would make more sense. Maybe the problem's notation is that mu equals gamma times the spin operator, so the full vector. But the question says \"mu = gamma*Sz\". Hmm, maybe I need to take their wording at face value. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction.\" So, mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Wait, so that would mean that the magnetic moment is only along the z-component? But then if the magnetic field is turned to the Y direction, the interaction energy would depend on the Y component of the magnetic moment. But according to their definition, mu is only gamma*Sz. That would mean that the Hamiltonian when the field is in Y direction would be H = -mu \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, the dot product would be mu_y * B, but according to their definition, mu is gamma Sz, so the Y component of mu would be zero? That can't be right. Maybe there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's notation is that mu is the vector, and Sz is the z-component of the spin. Then, mu = gamma S, so the z-component is gamma Sz. So when they write mu = gamma Sz, maybe they are just specifying the component? That might be a confusing way to write it, but perhaps that's the case. So the full magnetic moment vector is gamma times the spin vector. So the Hamiltonian would then be H = -mu \u22c5 B = -gamma S \u22c5 B. So when the field is along Z, it's H = -gamma S_z B, and when it's along Y, it becomes H = -gamma S_y B. That seems more consistent. Maybe the problem's wording was just specifying the relation between mu and Sz in the initial state. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the initial state is the eigenstate of S_z with +1/2 (since it's aligned with B in Z direction). Now, when we suddenly switch the magnetic field to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The system will then evolve under this new Hamiltonian. The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9, so we need to find the time dependence of \u27e8S_z\u27e9 and find its oscillation frequency.\n\nTo find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, we can express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian (since the time evolution will be governed by S_y). The eigenstates of S_y are |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. The initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as a combination of these. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_z and S_y are related by rotations. Specifically, the eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the S_z basis.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y are:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 - |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1\u0127/2 (for spin 1/2), but the actual states depend on the convention. Let me think of the Pauli matrices. The S_y matrix (in units where \u0127=1) is (i/2)[\u03c3_y], but the eigenstates for S_y=+1/2 would be (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 and similarly for the negative. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact form.\n\nThe eigenstates of the Pauli Y matrix (\u03c3_y) are:\n\nFor eigenvalue +1: (1, i)^T normalized, so in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nSimilarly, the eigenstate for -1 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 - i |\u2193y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf |\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen solving for |\u2191z\u27e9:\n\nMultiply both sides by \u221a2: \u221a2 |\u2191y\u27e9 = |\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSimilarly, for |\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso \u221a2 |\u2193y\u27e9 = |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nAdding the equations for |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\n\u221a2 (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9) = 2 |\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nso |\u2191z\u27e9 = (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I need to do this more carefully.\n\nLet me denote |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 as the eigenstates of S_y with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 (in units where \u0127=1, but since we are dealing with frequencies, the actual \u0127 might cancel out). Let me just work with the Pauli matrices. The \u03c3_y matrix is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i],\n         [i, 0]]\n\nThe eigenvalues are \u00b11. The eigenvectors for +1 are found by solving (\u03c3_y - I)v =0:\n\n[ -1  -i      ] [a]   = 0\n[  i   -1     ] [b]\n\nSo, -a -i b =0 \u2192 a = -i b,\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as ( -i, 1 )^T, normalized. So dividing by sqrt( (-i)^2 +1^2 )? Wait, the norm squared is | -i |^2 + |1|^2 = 1 +1 =2. So the normalized eigenvector is ( -i /\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ). Wait, but maybe written as (1, i) normalized? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, another approach. Suppose the eigenvector is (a, b). Then,\n\n\u03c3_y * [a; b] = \u03bb [a; b]\n\nSo:\n\n- i b = \u03bb a,\n\ni a = \u03bb b.\n\nAssuming \u03bb=1,\n\nThen from first equation: -i b = a,\n\nSecond equation: i a = b \u2192 substituting a from first equation: i*(-i b) = b \u2192 (i*(-i))=1 \u2192 1*b = b \u2192 yes. So a = -i b.\n\nLet me choose b =1, then a = -i. So the vector is (-i, 1). To normalize, divide by sqrt( |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 ) = sqrt(1 +1 )=sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -i/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ). So the eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9 is ( -i/\u221a2 |\u2191z\u27e9 + 1/\u221a2 |\u2193z\u27e9 )? Wait, the first component corresponds to |\u2191z\u27e9 and the second to |\u2193z\u27e9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps written as ( |\u2191z\u27e9 + i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2? Let me see:\n\nWait, if I have ( |\u2191z\u27e9 + i |\u2193z\u27e9 ), then the components would be (1, i). The norm squared is 1 +1 =2, so normalized gives (1/\u221a2)(1, i). But when multiplied by \u03c3_y, let's check:\n\n\u03c3_y * (1/\u221a2)(1, i)^T = (1/\u221a2)[ -i*(i), i*(1) ]^T = (1/\u221a2)[1, i]^T ?\n\nWait, \u03c3_y applied to (1,i):\n\nFirst component: -i*(i) = -i\u00b2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: i*(1) = i,\n\nSo the result is (1, i)^T, which is the same as the original vector. So that works. So the eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9 is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. The other eigenstate is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 for the eigenvalue -1.\n\nTherefore, the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be expressed as:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 -i |\u2193y\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me express |\u2191z\u27e9 as a combination of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. Let me denote:\n\nLet |\u2191y\u27e9 = (1, i)/\u221a2,\n\nand |\u2193y\u27e9 = (1, -i)/\u221a2 (since the other eigenstate would have eigenvalue -1, so similar but with minus sign in the second component?)\n\nWait, actually the other eigenstate for -1 would be (1, -i)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, let's recalculate for \u03bb=-1:\n\n\u03c3_y * v = -v,\n\nso equations:\n\n- i b = -a \u2192 -i b = -a \u2192 a = i b,\n\nand i a = -b,\n\nSubstituting a =i b into the second equation: i*(i b) = -b \u2192 i\u00b2 b = -b \u2192 -b = -b \u2192 holds. So choosing b=1 gives a= i*1 =i. So the vector is (i, 1), normalized to (i,1)/\u221a2. So the eigenstate is (i |\u2191z\u27e9 + |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. Hmm, so perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second eigenstate is ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2? Let me see:\n\nTake |\u2193y\u27e9 as ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2. Let me plug that into \u03c3_y:\n\n\u03c3_y * ( |\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 = ?\n\nExpressed as a vector: (1, -i)/\u221a2. Applying \u03c3_y:\n\nFirst component: -i*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: i*(1) = i,\n\nSo the result is (1, i)/\u221a2, which is the original |\u2191y\u27e9. Wait, that's not right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me instead write the components properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenstates are written as:\n\nFor |\u2191y\u27e9: (1, i)/\u221a2,\n\nfor |\u2193y\u27e9: (1, -i)/\u221a2,\n\nthen:\n\nExpressing |\u2191z\u27e9 as a combination:\n\nLet me write |\u2191z\u27e9 = a |\u2191y\u27e9 + b |\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in components,\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 is (1,0). So,\n\na*(1/\u221a2, i/\u221a2 ) + b*(1/\u221a2, -i/\u221a2 ) = ( (a + b)/\u221a2, (a i - b i)/\u221a2 )\n\nSet equal to (1,0). Therefore,\n\nFirst component: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nSecond component: (i(a - b))/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 (a - b)=0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nFrom second equation, a = b,\n\nThen first equation: (a +a)/\u221a2 = 1 \u2192 2a/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 =1/\u221a2,\n\nThus, a = b =1/\u221a2,\n\nTherefore, |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nAh, so that's the correct expansion. So the initial state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (since H is proportional to S_y, which has |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 as eigenstates).\n\nSo the time evolution will be governed by these eigenstates. The Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1(\u0127/2), but let's see:\n\nThe eigenvalues of S_y in terms of the Hamiltonian: since H is proportional to S_y, so the energy eigenvalues would be E_\u2191 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), and E_\u2193 = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Wait, actually, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 \u0127/2 (assuming \u0127 is the spin quantum number?), but in natural units, perhaps the spin operator S_y has eigenvalues \u00b11/2 (in units of \u0127). Let me confirm the units. The spin operator S in units of \u0127 is such that S\u00b2 = (s(s+1))\u0127\u00b2, so for s=1/2, S\u00b2 = (3/4)\u0127\u00b2, so the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1 \u0127/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be:\n\nE_\u2191 = -\u03b3 B (S_y eigenvalue) \u2192 Wait, H is -\u03b3 B S_y, so for eigenstate |\u2191y\u27e9, which has S_y = +\u0127/2, the energy is -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Similarly, |\u2193y\u27e9 has S_y = -\u0127/2, so energy is -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nTherefore, the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 and E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2. \n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u2191z\u27e9, which is ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2, will be:\n\nAt time t, the state is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} ) /\u221a2 \n\nSubstituting E_+ and E_-:\n\nE_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 \u2192 e^{-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 }\n\nE_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 \u2192 e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2 ) t / \u0127 } = e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 }\n\nTherefore,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } ] / \u221a2 \n\nNow, we need to compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 at time t. To find \u27e8S_z\u27e9, we can express S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9, |\u2193y\u27e9 basis.\n\nThe S_z operator in the S_y basis can be represented as a matrix. Since S_z and S_y do not commute, their matrices are not diagonal in each other's bases. Let me recall that in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal with entries +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. But we need to express S_z in terms of the S_y basis states.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the state expressed in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, perhaps it's easier to compute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nFirst, let's note that S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 basis can be found by expressing S_z in terms of the S_y basis. Alternatively, let's just compute the expectation value.\n\nLet me write the expectation value:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, let's write the bra vector:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = [ \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is ( \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } ) / \u221a2.\n\nNow, multiply this with S_z and then with |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute this step by step. Let me proceed:\n\nFirst, expand the expectation value:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)( \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} ) * S_z * (1/\u221a2)( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t /2 } + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2 } )\n\nMultiply the constants: (1/2) times the rest.\n\nNow, expanding the product:\n\nThe terms will be:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} \n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nplus \n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2}\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{0} =1. So that term is \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nSecond term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{-i \u03b3 B t}.\n\nThird term:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{i \u03b3 B t}.\n\nFourth term:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 multiplied by e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} * e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} = e^{0}=1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t} \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + e^{i \u03b3 B t} \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute these matrix elements.\n\nFirst, let's find \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, and \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nTo compute these, we can express S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 basis. Let's recall that S_z and S_y are Pauli matrices. Let me recall that in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal, and S_y is off-diagonal. But here, we need S_z expressed in the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the matrix elements using the known basis states.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nThe state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, let's compute \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\nFirst, S_z in the S_z basis has eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. Let's work in units where \u0127=1 for simplicity (since it will cancel out in the frequency, which is an angular frequency).\n\nSo S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nS_z |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nNow, compute \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 )) / \u221a2\n\nCompute S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9,\n\nS_z |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] ) / \u221a2\n\nNow, express \u27e8\u2191y| in terms of the S_z basis:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| = \u27e8\u2191z| (1/\u221a2) (1, -i) )? Wait, let me see. The state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2, so the dual vector \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z|, \u27e8\u2193z| ) times the conjugate transpose. The conjugate of |\u2191y\u27e9 is (1, -i)/\u221a2, so \u27e8\u2191y| = (\u27e8\u2191z|, \u27e8\u2193z| )*(1/\u221a2, -i/\u221a2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the inner products directly:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191z| ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (1 +0)/\u221a2 = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193z| ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (0 + i)/\u221a2 = i/\u221a2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (1/\u221a2)( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (i/\u221a2)( (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] dotted with \u27e8\u2191y|?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the scalar product. Wait, let me rephrase the previous step.\n\nWait, let me compute the expression again:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]) / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, sorry, let me redo this step carefully.\n\nOriginal expression after substituting S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 and S_z |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nWait, no, actually, the previous step was:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 ) +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2\n\nWait, no, sorry, the term inside the brackets after applying S_z was (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9, right? Because S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 is (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9, and S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9. So the i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 comes from the second term.\n\nSo the total inside the brackets is (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nSo then:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nNow, \u27e8\u2191y| is the dual of |\u2191y\u27e9, so:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| = (\u27e8\u2191z| + i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 (since the dual is the conjugate transpose. Wait, actually, the conjugate of the coefficient of |\u2193z\u27e9 in |\u2191y\u27e9 is -i, but when taking the dual, the coefficients are conjugated. Wait, perhaps better to compute the inner product:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(\u27e8\u2191z|\u2191z\u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2191z|\u2193z\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)(1 +0) = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 + i \u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)(0 +i*1) = i/\u221a2,\n\nSo substituting back into \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9:\n\n= [ (\u27e8\u2191y| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) - (\u27e8\u2191y| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / \u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nPlugging the inner products:\n\n= ( (1/2)(1/\u221a2) - (i/2)(i/\u221a2) ) / \u221a2 \n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/(2\u221a2)) \n\nSecond term: - (i^2)/(2\u221a2) \u2192 since i^2 =-1 \u2192 becomes + (1)/(2\u221a2)\n\nSo adding them:\n\n(1/(2\u221a2) + 1/(2\u221a2)) / \u221a2 = ( (2/(2\u221a2)) ) / \u221a2 = (1/\u221a2)/\u221a2 = 1/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = 1/2 ?\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate step by step:\n\nFirst, the first term inside the brackets is (1/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/(2\u221a2)\n\nSecond term: - (i/2)\u27e8\u2191y|\u2193z\u27e9 = - (i/2)(i/\u221a2) = - (i^2)/(2\u221a2) = - (-1)/(2\u221a2) = +1/(2\u221a2)\n\nSo total inside the brackets: 1/(2\u221a2) + 1/(2\u221a2) = 1/\u221a2\n\nThen divide by \u221a2 (from the denominator in the original expression):\n\nSo total \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) / \u221a2 = 1/2 ?\n\nHmm, but S_z in the |\u2191y\u27e9 basis: since |\u2191y\u27e9 is an eigenstate of S_y, which is different from S_z, so \u27e8S_z\u27e9 for |\u2191y\u27e9 shouldn't be 1/2. Wait, but according to this calculation, it is 1/2. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose in the S_z basis, S_z is diagonal with entries +1/2 and -1/2. The expectation value of S_z in the state |\u2191y\u27e9 would be \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9. Let's compute this:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 in the S_z basis is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nThe expectation value is \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i (1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2\n\nMultiply them out:\n\n= [ (\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (\u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / (2)\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(1) \n\nSecond term: (-i/2)(0) \u2192 0\n\nThird term: (i/2)(0) \u21920\n\nFourth term: (i*(-i)/2)(1) \u2192 since \u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9=1,\n\ni*(-i) = -i\u00b2 = 1 \u2192 (1/2)(1) \n\nSo total:\n\n[ (1/2) + (1/2) ] / 2 = (1) / 2 \u2192 1/2.\n\nHmm, so indeed the expectation value is 1/2? That's strange because |\u2191y\u27e9 is not an eigenstate of S_z, so I would expect some interference terms. Wait, but according to this, the expectation value is 1/2. Wait, but maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, but if I take |\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen the average S_z is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nWait, no, actually S_z applied to |\u2191y\u27e9 gives (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nso the expectation value is the inner product of |\u2191y\u27e9 with this result.\n\nWait, the inner product is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps I need to track the denominators correctly. Let me recast:\n\nS_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nWait, but \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo multiplying:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / (2)\n\nNow compute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)(1)\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (-i/2)(0)\n\n3. i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (i/2)(0)\n\n4. i \u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i*(-i)/2)(1) = (1/2)(1) because i*(-i)=1.\n\nSo total terms: (1/2 + 0 +0 +1/2 ) = 1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2. So yes, \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = 1/2. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so that's the expectation value. Similarly, \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 can be computed similarly. Let's see:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9. Since |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nFollowing similar steps:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 all over \u221a2.\n\nThen \u27e8\u2193y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nExpanding:\n\n\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n- i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\nall over 2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u2192 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n3. -i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n4. -i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 -i\u00b2 (1/2)*1 \u2192 (1/2)(1) since -i\u00b2=1.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0 +0 +1/2 =1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2.\n\nSo \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 =1/2 as well?\n\nWait, that's interesting. So both eigenstates of S_y have the same expectation value of S_z? That can't be right. Wait, but according to the math, yes. Wait, but then the expectation value of S_z for both |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 is 1/2? That would mean that regardless of the state, the expectation value of S_z is 1/2. That can't be correct.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the state definitions. Wait, let me think again. If |\u2193y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is (-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9, so -i*S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 is -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nso adding (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nthen \u27e8\u2193y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| -i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso when multiplied by the state (1/2|\u2191z\u27e9 +i/2 |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck the fourth term in the calculation for \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nThe fourth term was -i multiplied by (i/2)*\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nWhich is -i*(i/2) = - (i\u00b2)/2 = - (-1)/2 = 1/2,\n\nso that term is positive 1/2. So total terms 1/2 +1/2 =1, divided by 2 gives 1/2. \n\nHmm, so both \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 equal 1/2? That would mean that both states have an expectation value of S_z equal to 1/2? That seems odd because when you have a superposition, but actually, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the definition of the states. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in units. Maybe the spin operators are in units where \u0127=1, so S_z has eigenvalues \u00b11/2. Then, the expectation value here is 1/2, but in reality, that would mean that both states have the same expectation value for S_z, which might be correct because they are symmetric in some way. Wait, but if you have a particle in |\u2191y\u27e9, intuitively, since it's a superposition of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9, the average of Sz should be the average of +1/2 and -1/2 with coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nThe state |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2. The expectation value of S_z is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by S_z acting on (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nWhich is exactly what we did before. Let me compute it numerically:\n\nThe expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\nWait, sorry, let me recalculate S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 again. \n\nS_z applied to |\u2191y\u27e9 is (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 multiplied by S_z:\n\nS_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 +i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nTherefore, the expectation value is \u27e8\u2191y| times this:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 = [\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 + i\u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i\u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nWait, let me see each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (1/2)*1,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = 0,\n\n3. i\u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = (i/2)*0,\n\n4. i\u27e8\u2193z| (-i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i*(-i)/2)*1 \u2192 ( (i^2*(-i))? Wait, no, i*(-i/2) = -i\u00b2 /2 = 1/2.\n\nWait, term4: i multiplied by (-i/2)*\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 i*(-i/2)*1 = ( -i\u00b2 ) /2 \u2192 ( -(-1) )/2 \u2192 1/2.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0+0+1/2 =1 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1/2. So indeed, \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 =1/2. Similarly for |\u2193y\u27e9. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so both eigenstates of S_y have the same expectation value of S_z? That's because they are symmetric with respect to the z-component? Interesting.\n\nTherefore, in the expression for \u27e8S_z\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 + ... ] \n\nThe first two terms are each 1/2, so their sum is 1, multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/2. \n\nThe other terms are the cross terms involving the off-diagonal matrix elements.\n\nNow, compute the cross terms:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9.\n\nFirst, \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nAgain, using the expressions for the states:\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z ( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (\u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nWait, no, more precisely:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*( -1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] /\u221a2 \n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product:\n\n[ (\u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) + (i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) ] / (2)\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = [\u27e8\u2191y| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191y| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, let me track the denominators:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = [ \u27e8\u2191y| (S_z |\u2193y\u27e9) ] \n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191y| ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nWait, S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 is ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nso \u27e8\u2191y| times that vector:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nso multiply:\n\n(\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * [ (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThis gives:\n\n[ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n+ i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 \u2192 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n3. i*(1/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 \u21920,\n\n4. i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 (i\u00b2)/2 \u2192 (-1)/2.\n\nSo total terms: 1/2 +0 +0 -1/2 =0 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 0.\n\nWait, so \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nThe fourth term is i multiplied by (i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 \u2192 i*(i/2)*1 = (i\u00b2)/2 = -1/2,\n\nso total terms:\n\n1/2 (from first term) + (-1/2) (from fourth term) \u2192 0,\n\nso yes, the total is 0. Therefore \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 is the conjugate of \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, which is 0* conjugate is still 0. So that term is also zero.\n\nWait, but \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 would be the conjugate transpose of \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9. Since the first was zero, so it's also zero.\n\nWait, actually, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 = [\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9]^\\dagger?\n\nWait, actually, \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 is the complex conjugate of \u27e8\u2191y|S_z^\u2020|\u2193y\u27e9, but since S_z is Hermitian, S_z^\u2020 = S_z. So \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9^*.\n\nSince the first term was zero, it's also zero.\n\nSo putting all back into the expectation value expression:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2)[ (1/2 + 1/2) + 0 + 0 ] \u2192 Wait, no, let me re-express the entire expression.\n\nWait, the first two terms were \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9, each 1/2, so their sum is 1. Then multiplied by 1/2 (the factor from the constants):\n\n(1/2)*1 = 1/2,\n\nThen the cross terms are e^{-i \u03b3 B t} * 0 + e^{i \u03b3 B t} *0 \u2192 0. So \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = 1/2?\n\nWait, that can't be right. The expectation value of S_z is constant? But the question says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating. That contradicts this result. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait a second, let me re-express the entire calculation again.\n\nThe expansion of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 was:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2 } + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2 } ] / \u221a2 \n\nSo the state is a superposition of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 with time-dependent phases.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8S_z\u27e9 is computed as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nLet me try this again, perhaps I messed up earlier steps.\n\nLet me write the state as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} ) / \u221a2 where \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2,\n\nsince the exponentials were e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} and e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2}.\n\nSo substituting \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2,\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| = ( \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03c9 t} + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03c9 t} ) /\u221a2 \n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y| e^{-i \u03c9 t} + \u27e8\u2193y| e^{i \u03c9 t} ) S_z ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} ) ]\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n= (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} \n\n+ \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} \n\n+ \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} \n\n+ \u27e8\u2193y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nFirst term exponent: e^{0} \u2192 1,\n\nSecond term exponent: e^{-2i \u03c9 t},\n\nThird term exponent: e^{2i \u03c9 t},\n\nFourth term exponent: e^{0} \u21921,\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2)[ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 \n\n+ \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-2i \u03c9 t} \n\n+ \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 e^{2i \u03c9 t} ]\n\nAs before, \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = 1/2,\n\nso the first two terms give (1/2)(1/2 +1/2) = (1/2)(1) =1/2,\n\nThe cross terms are \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 which we found to be zero. \n\nWait, but then \u27e8S_z\u27e9 is always 1/2, which doesn't oscillate. But the question says the average starts oscillating. Clearly, I made a mistake here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the initial setup of the Hamiltonian. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu \u00b7 B. Initially, when B is in the Z direction, H_initial = -gamma Sz * B_z. But after switching B to the Y direction, the new H is -gamma Sz * B_y? Wait, but B is along Y, so the dot product would be between mu and B. If mu is only in the Z direction (as per the problem's definition mu = gamma Sz), then the Hamiltonian when B is along Y would be H = -gamma Sz * B_y (since B is in Y, so only the Y component of B is non-zero, but the dot product of mu (which is along Z) with B (along Y) would be zero? Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, now I see the problem. The question defines mu as gamma Sz, which is the z-component of the spin multiplied by gamma. So mu is a vector with only a Z component. Therefore, when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the interaction energy is H = -mu \u00b7 B = - (gamma Sz) * B_y (since B has only a Y component). But Sz and B_y are perpendicular, so the dot product would involve Sz * B_y? Wait, no, the dot product is the sum of components. If mu has only a Z component, then mu \u00b7 B = (mu_z)(B_y) + ... no, wait, mu is a vector. If mu is along Z, then mu has components (0,0, gamma Sz). The magnetic field B is along Y, so components (0,B,0). Then the dot product is 0*0 + 0*B + (gamma Sz)*0 =0. Wait, that would mean H=0? That can't be right. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the problem states that mu = gamma Sz, then the magnetic moment is only along the Z axis. Then, when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy would be H = - mu \u22c5 B = - (gamma Sz)(B_y), since the Y component of mu is zero. But Sz and B_y are vectors? Wait, Sz is an operator, B is a vector. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's notation is that mu is the vector, so mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. Then the z-component of mu is gamma Sz, which matches their notation. So the problem's wording might have been slightly ambiguous, but that must be the correct interpretation. So in that case, the Hamiltonian when B is along Y is H = - mu \u22c5 B = - gamma S \u22c5 B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = - gamma S_y B.\n\nAh! That must be the case. So my initial assumption was correct, and the confusion arose from the problem's wording. So proceeding with H = -gamma S_y B.\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of H are as previously calculated, leading to the time evolution.\n\nBut then why did the expectation value of S_z come out as constant?\n\nHmm. Let me re-calculate \u27e8S_z\u27e9 using this corrected Hamiltonian and the previous steps. Wait, no, I think the error was in the calculation of the expectation value. Let me try again.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the calculation of \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9. Earlier, I found that \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0, but maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait let me re-calculate \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nUsing the states:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2191y| S_z |\u2193y\u27e9 \n\nFirst, compute S_z |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\nS_z |\u2193y\u27e9 = S_z*( (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 )\n\n= (S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 -i S_z |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 -i*(-1/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen, \u27e8\u2191y| is (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2,\n\nSo the inner product:\n\n\u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 = (\u27e8\u2191z| +i \u27e8\u2193z|)/\u221a2 * (1/2 |\u2191z\u27e9 + i/2 |\u2193z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nMultiply the terms:\n\n= [ \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n+ i \u27e8\u2193z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 +i \u27e8\u2193z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z| (1/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 = 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z| (i/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 =0,\n\n3. i*(1/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 =0,\n\n4. i*(i/2)\u27e8\u2193z|\u2193z\u27e9 = (i\u00b2)/2 *1 = (-1)/2.\n\nTotal terms: 1/2 -1/2 =0,\n\nso \u27e8\u2191y|S_z|\u2193y\u27e9 =0,\n\nand \u27e8\u2193y|S_z|\u2191y\u27e9 =0 as well.\n\nHmm, so the cross terms are zero. So then \u27e8S_z\u27e9 is always 1/2?\n\nBut the question states that the average starts oscillating, so this suggests an error in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the time dependence of the state.\n\nWait, let me re-express the state again. The initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nWait no, earlier I found that:\n\nWait when I expressed |\u2191z\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, I had:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nWait wait, earlier calculation showed that:\n\nYes, in the earlier steps, I had:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2,\n\nTherefore, when the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y,\n\nThe eigenstates are |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 with energies:\n\nE_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B (S_y eigenvalue for |\u2191y\u27e9) \u2192 S_y has eigenvalues \u00b1 1/2 (in units of \u0127), so:\n\nE_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B * (1/2),\n\nE_\u2193 = - \u03b3 B * (-1/2) = + \u03b3 B /2.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{-i E_\u2191 t / \u0127} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i E_\u2193 t / \u0127} ) /\u221a2,\n\nBut substituting E_\u2191 = - \u03b3 B /2 (assuming \u0127=1 for simplicity),\n\nthen,\n\ne^{-i E_\u2191 t} = e^{-i (- \u03b3 B /2) t } = e^{i \u03b3 B t /2},\n\nSimilarly, E_\u2193 = \u03b3 B /2,\n\nso e^{-i E_\u2193 t} = e^{-i \u03b3 B t /2},\n\nSo the state is indeed:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = ( |\u2191y\u27e9 e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} + |\u2193y\u27e9 e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ) /\u221a2,\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nThen, when calculating \u27e8S_z\u27e9, the expectation value was found to be 1/2, but that contradicts the problem's premise. So there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I considered the magnetic moment as gamma Sz, but in reality, the spin operator S is a vector, and the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So S_z is just one component of the spin operator. However, when we compute the expectation value of S_z, it might not be the same as the z-component of the magnetic moment. Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma Sz, so the z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma times the z-component of spin, but the full magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma S.\n\nWait, the problem says \"magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz)\", which might mean that mu is the full vector, so the z-component of mu is gamma Sz, but the y-component would be gamma Sy. So when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu \u22c5 B = - (gamma Sy) B, since B is along Y. So H = - gamma B Sy. Wait, this is different from my previous assumption where I thought H was proportional to Sy. Wait, no, Sy is part of the spin operator. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu \u00b7 B would be gamma S \u22c5 B. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma S \u22c5 B = -gamma S_y B. So that part was correct.\n\nBut then why does the expectation value of S_z not oscillate?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the basis. Let me try to compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9 again, but using another approach. Let's express the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in the S_z basis and compute S_z.\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is expressed in terms of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, which are:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo substituting into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [ (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] /\u221a2,\n\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2.\n\nMultiply out terms:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)[ (|\u2191z\u27e9 +i |\u2193z\u27e9) e^{i \u03c9 t} + (|\u2191z\u27e9 -i |\u2193z\u27e9) e^{-i \u03c9 t} ] /\u221a2,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 1/2 [ |\u2191z\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t}) + i |\u2193z\u27e9 (e^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t}) ]\n\nSimplify using Euler's formula:\n\ne^{i \u03c9 t} + e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2 cos(\u03c9t),\n\ne^{i \u03c9 t} - e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 2i sin(\u03c9t),\n\nThus,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/2)[ 2 |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) + i*(2i) |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) ]\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe second term: i*(2i) = 2i\u00b2 = -2,\n\nThus,\n\n= (1/2)[ 2 |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - 2 |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) ]\n\n= |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t)\n\nTherefore, the state at time t is |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) - |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t).\n\nNow, compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9:\n\nS_z in the S_z basis has eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2,\n\nso,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nFirst, write the state as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nthen the dual is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| = cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z|.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| ] S_z [ cos(\u03c9t)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03c9t)|\u2193z\u27e9 ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) \n\n- cos(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2191z| S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t) \n\n- sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| S_z |\u2191z\u27e9 cos(\u03c9t) \n\n+ sin(\u03c9t)\u27e8\u2193z| S_z |\u2193z\u27e9 sin(\u03c9t)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \u27e8\u2191z|S_z|\u2191z\u27e9 = 1/2,\n\nso first term: cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) * 1/2,\n\n2. \u27e8\u2191z|S_z|\u2193z\u27e9 =0,\n\nso second term:0,\n\n3. \u27e8\u2193z|S_z|\u2191z\u27e9 =0,\n\nthird term:0,\n\n4. \u27e8\u2193z|S_z|\u2193z\u27e9 =-1/2,\n\nso fourth term: sin\u00b2(\u03c9t)* (-1/2),\n\nThus,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2) cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - (1/2) sin\u00b2(\u03c9t),\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= (1/2)[ cos\u00b2(\u03c9t) - sin\u00b2(\u03c9t) ]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity: cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (1/2) cos(2\u03c9t)\n\nAh! There we go. So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with angular frequency 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 was \u03b3 B /2,\n\nthe frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B /2) = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, which is option B.\n\nSo where did I go wrong earlier? I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation when I tried to compute the expectation value in the S_y basis. Probably messed up the cross terms or missed the interference terms. By expressing the state in the S_z basis, it became straightforward.\n\nThe key was to recognize that after expanding the state in the S_z basis, the expectation value of S_z becomes (1/2)cos(2\u03c9t), which oscillates with frequency 2\u03c9. Since \u03c9 = \u03b3 B /2, the angular frequency is 2*(\u03b3 B/2) = \u03b3 B. The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency here (since it's given in terms of B and gamma, which are in units that would give angular frequency). Therefore, the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the spin-1/2 particle's initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9, aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\). The eigenstates of \\( S_y \\) are \\( |\\uparrow_y\\rangle \\) and \\( |\\downarrow_y\\rangle \\), expressed in the \\( S_z \\) basis as:\n\n\\[\n|\\uparrow_y\\rangle = \\frac{|\u2191z\\rangle + i|\u2193z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad |\\downarrow_y\\rangle = \\frac{|\u2191z\\rangle - i|\u2193z\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial state \\( |\u2191z\\rangle \\) can be written as a combination of these eigenstates:\n\n\\[\n|\u2191z\\rangle = \\frac{|\\uparrow_y\\rangle + |\\downarrow_y\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nUnder the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |\\uparrow_y\\rangle e^{i \\omega t} + |\\downarrow_y\\rangle e^{-i \\omega t} \\right),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\omega = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2} \\). Expressing \\( |\\psi(t)\\rangle \\) in the \\( S_z \\) basis:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\omega t)|\u2191z\\rangle - \\sin(\\omega t)|\u2193z\\rangle.\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value of \\( S_z \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\cos^2(\\omega t) - \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2\\omega t).\n\\]\n\nThe oscillation frequency of \\( \\langle S_z \\rangle \\) is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is \\( 2\\omega = \\gamma B \\).\n\nAnswer: B",
