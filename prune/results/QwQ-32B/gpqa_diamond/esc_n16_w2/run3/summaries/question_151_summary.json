      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system in the given state will yield 0. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of a measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector, but wait, actually, maybe I should recall the exact method here. \n\nThe problem gives the system's state as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by the matrix P. The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0. \n\nWait, first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P, because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues. So, if 0 is an eigenvalue of P, then the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace. \n\nSo step one: Find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write down the matrix P again to be clear.\n\nThe matrix P has first row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). Let me represent that as a 3x3 matrix:\n\nP = [ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n    [1/\u221a2     0        1/\u221a2 ]\n    [ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ]\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see if 0 is an eigenvalue here. To check that, the determinant of P should be zero if 0 is an eigenvalue. Let me compute the determinant of P. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute that. The matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2       0      ]\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        1/\u221a2   ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, maybe expanding the determinant step by step. Let me do it properly.\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)*[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, third row third element's minor would be multiplied by 0, so maybe better to expand along the first row.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb times the determinant of the minor matrix for the first element (which is the 2x2 matrix from rows 2-3 and columns 2-3):\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, actually, the minor for the element at (1,1) (which is -\u03bb) would be the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:\n\nThe submatrix is:\n\nRow2: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant of that is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nSecond term is the element at (1,2) which is 1/\u221a2, multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times its minor. The minor here is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column2:\n\nThe submatrix is rows 2-3 and columns 1 and 3:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, the columns would be columns 1 and 3 (since column 2 is removed). Wait row 2 has elements (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2) but removing column 2, so first element of row2 (1/\u221a2) is column1, then column3 (1/\u221a2). Wait actually, row2 in the original P - \u03bbI is [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]. So when column 2 is removed, the remaining elements in row2 are column1 (1/\u221a2) and column3 (1/\u221a2). Similarly row3, which is [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb], removing column2 gives [0, -\u03bb].\n\nSo the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[ 0, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nThe second term's sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nThird term is the element at (1,3) which is 0, so the third term is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\nWait, let me check again. The first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (1/\u221a2)* (-1)^(1+2) * minor, which was -\u03bb/(\u221a2)^2 ?\n\nWait maybe I messed up in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the minor for the second term. Let me think again.\n\nThe minor for the (1,2) element (which is 1/\u221a2) is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow2: columns 1, 3 \u2192 elements (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2)\n\nRow3: columns 1, 3 \u2192 elements (0, -\u03bb)\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nSo the minor determinant is -\u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nThen, the coefficient for the (1,2) term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) (which is -1) multiplied by the minor determinant (-\u03bb/\u221a2):\n\nSo the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nTherefore, the total determinant is:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: + \u03bb/2\n\nThird term: 0.\n\nSo overall:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, first term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) \n\nThen the second term is + (\u03bb/2). So adding those:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1-\u03bb)(1+\u03bb)=0\n\nTherefore, eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = -1. \n\nAh, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. Therefore, the possible measurement outcomes include 0. So now, to find the probability of getting 0, we need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is in a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9, the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the sum over all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of |\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2, where v is an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace.\n\nSo first, we need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo solving (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nThe matrix P is as given above. So, set up the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo from the equations, v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) for any v1. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, wait, let me see. Wait, the equations are v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are vectors like (a, 0, -a) where a is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Wait, because there are two free variables? Wait, no. Let's see: variables are v1, v2, v3. The equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0.\n\nSo v2 is fixed to 0, and v3 = -v1. So the vector is (v1, 0, -v1). So there's one free variable (v1), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Because the solution space is one-dimensional. So the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let me pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the vector (1,0,-1). If I plug into P:\n\nP*(1,0,-1)^T should be 0?\n\nLet me compute P multiplied by the vector [1; 0; -1].\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) =0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is indeed one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy P*v =0. Let me try another vector. Suppose v1 = a, so v3 = -a. So vector is (a,0,-a). So when multiplied by P, the first component is (1/\u221a2)*v2 =0, which is okay. The second component is (1/\u221a2)*a + (1/\u221a2)*(-a) =0, yes. Third component same as first. So yes, that works. So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So to find the probability, we need to project the given state vector onto this eigenvector, then square the norm.\n\nThe given state vector is the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the eigenvector. Since the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto this eigenvector is the inner product \u27e8eigenvec | \u03c8\u27e9. \n\nCalculating that inner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute value squared of this is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. Wait, but wait, the inner product is -\u221a2, so squared is (\u221a2)^2 = 2? Wait, but that can't be right because the probability can't exceed 1. Wait, hold on. There must be a mistake here because the state vector's norm must be 1 for probabilities to sum to 1. Wait, the problem didn't specify that the state vector is normalized. Oh! That's an important point. \n\nWait, the given state is a column matrix (-1,2,1). Let me check its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Therefore, I need to first normalize the state vector before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized to 1. \n\nHmm, so maybe the question assumes that the given state is already normalized? Wait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", so perhaps in the problem's context, the vector is not necessarily normalized. But in that case, the probability would be the square of the inner product divided by the norm squared? Wait, no. Wait, the standard approach is that the state vector is normalized. So perhaps the problem expects us to first normalize the given vector?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different convention? Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nThe probability is calculated as the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace, divided by the squared norm of the state vector. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if the state is not normalized, the probability is (\u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 ) / (\u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 ), where P_0 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that even if the vector isn't normalized, the probability is computed by taking the inner product with the eigenvector (without normalizing the state?), but I think the standard approach requires the state to be normalized. Since the problem didn't mention normalization, perhaps I should assume that the given vector is already normalized? But its norm squared is 6, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The question might have intended the state vector to be normalized. Let me see. Let me re-read the question. \n\n\"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1).\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects us to proceed with the given vector, even if it's not normalized. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must sum to 1, so perhaps the given vector is supposed to be normalized. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation? Let me check the norm again. The elements are -1, 2, 1. Squared terms are 1, 4, 1. Sum is 6. So norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the vector is not normalized. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the question expects us to normalize the state vector first. So first step: normalize the given state vector. Let me proceed under that assumption. \n\nSo the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T. \n\nNow, the projection onto the eigenstate (1,0,-1), which we need to also normalize. The eigenvector (1,0,-1) has norm sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). \n\nThe inner product between the normalized state and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(6)) * 2 * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 * (-1/sqrt(2))\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) \n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: (1 * -1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) \u2192 -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))\n\nAdding them together: [ -1/(sqrt(12)) -1/(sqrt(12)) ] = -2/(sqrt(12)) \n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3). The negative sign is squared away, so absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that step again. Let me recalculate the inner product step by step. \n\nThe normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). The normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n[ (-1)/sqrt(6) ] * [1/sqrt(2) ] + [ 2/sqrt(6) ] * 0 + [1/sqrt(6) ] * [ -1/sqrt(2) ]\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]\n\nTotal: (-2)/(sqrt(12)) \n\nsqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3. The absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the probability is 1/3, so option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to compute this. Let me think again. Another approach: The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. \n\nThe projection operator P_0 is the outer product of the eigenvector with itself, normalized. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, P_0 = |v><v| where |v> is the unit eigenvector. \n\nSo, |v> is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The projection operator is:\n\n|v><v| = (1/2) [1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1] \n\nWait, let me compute the outer product:\n\nFirst component of |v> is (1/\u221a2), so the first row of the outer product is (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) in the (1,1) entry, (1/\u221a2)*0 in (1,2), (1/\u221a2)*(-1/\u221a2) in (1,3). Similarly for other rows. \n\nWait, actually, the outer product is:\n\nEach element (i,j) is (v_i)(v_j)*.\n\nSince v is real here, it's just v_i v_j.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst row:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2 at (1,1),\n\n(1/\u221a2)(0) =0 at (1,2),\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2)= -1/2 at (1,3).\n\nSecond row:\n\n0*(1/\u221a2) =0,\n\n0*0=0,\n\n0*(-1/\u221a2)=0.\n\nThird row:\n\n(-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)= -1/2,\n\n(-1/\u221a2)*0=0,\n\n(-1/\u221a2)*(-1/\u221a2)=1/2.\n\nSo the projection operator P0 is:\n\n[1/2  0   -1/2]\n\n[0    0    0  ]\n\n[-1/2 0   1/2 ]\n\nThen the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8 | P0 | \u03c8\u27e9 is the probability. \n\nWait, but the state vector \u03c8 is not normalized. Let me see. \n\nThe given \u03c8 is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the inner product \u03c8\u2020 P0 \u03c8. \n\nFirst, let me write the vector as a row vector for multiplication: [-1, 2, 1] multiplied by P0, then multiplied by the column vector [-1; 2; 1].\n\nFirst, compute P0 times the column vector:\n\nFirst element of P0 * \u03c8:\n\n(1/2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/2)(1) = (-1/2 -1/2) = -1.\n\nSecond element: 0*(-1) +0*2 +0*1 =0.\n\nThird element: (-1/2)(-1) +0*2 + (1/2)(1) = (1/2 + 1/2) =1.\n\nSo P0 * \u03c8 = [-1; 0; 1].\n\nThen, the inner product of \u03c8 with this result is:\n\n(-1)*(-1) + 2*0 +1*1 = 1 +0 +1 =2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8\u03c8 | P0 | \u03c8\u27e9 =2. \n\nThe norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =6. \n\nTherefore, the probability is (2)/6 = 1/3. \n\nSame result as before. So this confirms that the probability is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Because if the eigenspace was higher-dimensional, maybe there are other vectors contributing, but in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so only that projection. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvectors? Let me think again. Suppose someone might think that there's another eigenvector. Let me see. The equations for eigenvalue 0 were v2=0, v1 + v3=0. So only one free variable (v1), so indeed only one eigenvector. So the projection is indeed only onto that vector, so the calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system in the given state will yield 0. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of a measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector, but wait, actually, maybe I should recall the exact method here. \n\nThe problem gives the system's state as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by the matrix P. The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0. \n\nWait, first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P, because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues. So, if 0 is an eigenvalue of P, then the probability is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenspace. \n\nSo step one: Find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write down the matrix P again to be clear.\n\nThe matrix P has first row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). Let me represent that as a 3x3 matrix:\n\nP = [ 0        1/\u221a2      0     ]\n    [1/\u221a2     0        1/\u221a2 ]\n    [ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ]\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see if 0 is an eigenvalue here. To check that, the determinant of P should be zero if 0 is an eigenvalue. Let me compute the determinant of P. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute that. The matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2       0      ]\n[1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        1/\u221a2   ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, maybe expanding the determinant step by step. Let me do it properly.\n\nThe determinant is calculated as:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)*[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, third row third element's minor would be multiplied by 0, so maybe better to expand along the first row.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb times the determinant of the minor matrix for the first element (which is the 2x2 matrix from rows 2-3 and columns 2-3):\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, actually, the minor for the element at (1,1) (which is -\u03bb) would be the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:\n\nThe submatrix is:\n\nRow2: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo determinant of that is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen the first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nSecond term is the element at (1,2) which is 1/\u221a2, multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) times its minor. The minor here is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column2:\n\nThe submatrix is rows 2-3 and columns 1 and 3:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, the columns would be columns 1 and 3 (since column 2 is removed). Wait row 2 has elements (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2) but removing column 2, so first element of row2 (1/\u221a2) is column1, then column3 (1/\u221a2). Wait actually, row2 in the original P - \u03bbI is [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2]. So when column 2 is removed, the remaining elements in row2 are column1 (1/\u221a2) and column3 (1/\u221a2). Similarly row3, which is [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb], removing column2 gives [0, -\u03bb].\n\nSo the minor for the (1,2) element is the determinant of:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[ 0, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nThe second term's sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nThird term is the element at (1,3) which is 0, so the third term is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\nWait, let me check again. The first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2), the second term is (1/\u221a2)* (-1)^(1+2) * minor, which was -\u03bb/(\u221a2)^2 ?\n\nWait maybe I messed up in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the minor for the second term. Let me think again.\n\nThe minor for the (1,2) element (which is 1/\u221a2) is the determinant of the submatrix when we remove row 1 and column 2. So the submatrix is:\n\nRow2: columns 1, 3 \u2192 elements (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2)\n\nRow3: columns 1, 3 \u2192 elements (0, -\u03bb)\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nSo the minor determinant is -\u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nThen, the coefficient for the (1,2) term is (1/\u221a2) multiplied by (-1)^(1+2) (which is -1) multiplied by the minor determinant (-\u03bb/\u221a2):\n\nSo the term is (1/\u221a2) * (-1) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nTherefore, the total determinant is:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 )\n\nSecond term: + \u03bb/2\n\nThird term: 0.\n\nSo overall:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again:\n\nWait, first term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) \n\nThen the second term is + (\u03bb/2). So adding those:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb.\n\nSo the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1-\u03bb)(1+\u03bb)=0\n\nTherefore, eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = -1. \n\nAh, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. Therefore, the possible measurement outcomes include 0. So now, to find the probability of getting 0, we need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is in a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9, the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the sum over all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of |\u27e8\u03c8 | v\u27e9|\u00b2, where v is an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace.\n\nSo first, we need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let's find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nSo solving (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nThe matrix P is as given above. So, set up the equations:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = 0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo from the equations, v2 must be zero, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) for any v1. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, wait, let me see. Wait, the equations are v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the eigenvectors are vectors like (a, 0, -a) where a is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional? Wait, because there are two free variables? Wait, no. Let's see: variables are v1, v2, v3. The equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0.\n\nSo v2 is fixed to 0, and v3 = -v1. So the vector is (v1, 0, -v1). So there's one free variable (v1), so the eigenspace is one-dimensional. Because the solution space is one-dimensional. So the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let me pick v1 =1, then v3 = -1. So the vector (1,0,-1). If I plug into P:\n\nP*(1,0,-1)^T should be 0?\n\nLet me compute P multiplied by the vector [1; 0; -1].\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) =0.\n\nThird component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is indeed one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 must satisfy P*v =0. Let me try another vector. Suppose v1 = a, so v3 = -a. So vector is (a,0,-a). So when multiplied by P, the first component is (1/\u221a2)*v2 =0, which is okay. The second component is (1/\u221a2)*a + (1/\u221a2)*(-a) =0, yes. Third component same as first. So yes, that works. So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So to find the probability, we need to project the given state vector onto this eigenvector, then square the norm.\n\nThe given state vector is the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the eigenvector. Since the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto this eigenvector is the inner product \u27e8eigenvec | \u03c8\u27e9. \n\nCalculating that inner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute value squared of this is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. Wait, but wait, the inner product is -\u221a2, so squared is (\u221a2)^2 = 2? Wait, but that can't be right because the probability can't exceed 1. Wait, hold on. There must be a mistake here because the state vector's norm must be 1 for probabilities to sum to 1. Wait, the problem didn't specify that the state vector is normalized. Oh! That's an important point. \n\nWait, the given state is a column matrix (-1,2,1). Let me check its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Therefore, I need to first normalize the state vector before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized to 1. \n\nHmm, so maybe the question assumes that the given state is already normalized? Wait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...\", so perhaps in the problem's context, the vector is not necessarily normalized. But in that case, the probability would be the square of the inner product divided by the norm squared? Wait, no. Wait, the standard approach is that the state vector is normalized. So perhaps the problem expects us to first normalize the given vector?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different convention? Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nThe probability is calculated as the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace, divided by the squared norm of the state vector. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if the state is not normalized, the probability is (\u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9 ) / (\u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 ), where P_0 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that even if the vector isn't normalized, the probability is computed by taking the inner product with the eigenvector (without normalizing the state?), but I think the standard approach requires the state to be normalized. Since the problem didn't mention normalization, perhaps I should assume that the given vector is already normalized? But its norm squared is 6, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The question might have intended the state vector to be normalized. Let me see. Let me re-read the question. \n\n\"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1).\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects us to proceed with the given vector, even if it's not normalized. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must sum to 1, so perhaps the given vector is supposed to be normalized. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation? Let me check the norm again. The elements are -1, 2, 1. Squared terms are 1, 4, 1. Sum is 6. So norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the vector is not normalized. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the question expects us to normalize the state vector first. So first step: normalize the given state vector. Let me proceed under that assumption. \n\nSo the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T. \n\nNow, the projection onto the eigenstate (1,0,-1), which we need to also normalize. The eigenvector (1,0,-1) has norm sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). \n\nThe inner product between the normalized state and the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n(1/sqrt(6)) * (-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(6)) * 2 * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * 1 * (-1/sqrt(2))\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) \n\nSecond term: 0\n\nThird term: (1 * -1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) \u2192 -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))\n\nAdding them together: [ -1/(sqrt(12)) -1/(sqrt(12)) ] = -2/(sqrt(12)) \n\nSimplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3). The negative sign is squared away, so absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that step again. Let me recalculate the inner product step by step. \n\nThe normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). The normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n[ (-1)/sqrt(6) ] * [1/sqrt(2) ] + [ 2/sqrt(6) ] * 0 + [1/sqrt(6) ] * [ -1/sqrt(2) ]\n\n= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]\n\nTotal: (-2)/(sqrt(12)) \n\nsqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3. The absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the probability is 1/3, so option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to compute this. Let me think again. Another approach: The probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0. \n\nThe projection operator P_0 is the outer product of the eigenvector with itself, normalized. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, P_0 = |v><v| where |v> is the unit eigenvector. \n\nSo, |v> is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The projection operator is:\n\n|v><v| = (1/2) [1, 0, -1; 0, 0, 0; -1, 0, 1] \n\nWait, let me compute the outer product:\n\nFirst component of |v> is (1/\u221a2), so the first row of the outer product is (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) in the (1,1) entry, (1/\u221a2)*0 in (1,2), (1/\u221a2)*(-1/\u221a2) in (1,3). Similarly for other rows. \n\nWait, actually, the outer product is:\n\nEach element (i,j) is (v_i)(v_j)*.\n\nSince v is real here, it's just v_i v_j.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst row:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = 1/2 at (1,1),\n\n(1/\u221a2)(0) =0 at (1,2),\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2)= -1/2 at (1,3).\n\nSecond row:\n\n0*(1/\u221a2) =0,\n\n0*0=0,\n\n0*(-1/\u221a2)=0.\n\nThird row:\n\n(-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)= -1/2,\n\n(-1/\u221a2)*0=0,\n\n(-1/\u221a2)*(-1/\u221a2)=1/2.\n\nSo the projection operator P0 is:\n\n[1/2  0   -1/2]\n\n[0    0    0  ]\n\n[-1/2 0   1/2 ]\n\nThen the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8 | P0 | \u03c8\u27e9 is the probability. \n\nWait, but the state vector \u03c8 is not normalized. Let me see. \n\nThe given \u03c8 is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the inner product \u03c8\u2020 P0 \u03c8. \n\nFirst, let me write the vector as a row vector for multiplication: [-1, 2, 1] multiplied by P0, then multiplied by the column vector [-1; 2; 1].\n\nFirst, compute P0 times the column vector:\n\nFirst element of P0 * \u03c8:\n\n(1/2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/2)(1) = (-1/2 -1/2) = -1.\n\nSecond element: 0*(-1) +0*2 +0*1 =0.\n\nThird element: (-1/2)(-1) +0*2 + (1/2)(1) = (1/2 + 1/2) =1.\n\nSo P0 * \u03c8 = [-1; 0; 1].\n\nThen, the inner product of \u03c8 with this result is:\n\n(-1)*(-1) + 2*0 +1*1 = 1 +0 +1 =2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8\u03c8 | P0 | \u03c8\u27e9 =2. \n\nThe norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =6. \n\nTherefore, the probability is (2)/6 = 1/3. \n\nSame result as before. So this confirms that the probability is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 1/3.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Because if the eigenspace was higher-dimensional, maybe there are other vectors contributing, but in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so only that projection. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvectors? Let me think again. Suppose someone might think that there's another eigenvector. Let me see. The equations for eigenvalue 0 were v2=0, v1 + v3=0. So only one free variable (v1), so indeed only one eigenvector. So the projection is indeed only onto that vector, so the calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C.\n\n\nThe probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) yielding 0 is determined by projecting the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0 and squaring the norm of this projection. \n\n1. **Find Eigenvalues of \\( P \\):**\n   The matrix \\( P \\) has eigenvalues \\( 0 \\), \\( 1 \\), and \\( -1 \\). \n\n2. **Eigenvectors for \\( \\lambda = 0 \\):**\n   Solving \\( P\\mathbf{v} = 0 \\), the eigenvectors are of the form \\( (a, 0, -a) \\), normalized to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \\).\n\n3. **Normalize the State Vector:**\n   The given state vector \\( \\psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\) has norm \\( \\sqrt{6} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by the matrix operator P, which has first row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable gives 0. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, maybe I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P first? Because the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, so 0 must be an eigenvalue of P. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to consider that the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. But perhaps the straightforward way is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenspace, and square the norm. \n\nLet me start by writing down matrix P. Let me note its entries:\n\nFirst row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSecond row: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nThird row: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nSo P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:\n\nP = \n[ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ]\n[1/\u221a2     0       1/\u221a2  ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ]\n\nHmm, okay. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation would be determinant of (P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute that determinant.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2       0     ]\n[1/\u221a2      -\u03bb        1/\u221a2  ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * ... \n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * ... \n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\nFirst element: -\u03bb multiplied by the minor of the (1,1) element. The minor is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb    1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2  -\u03bb ]\n\nSo that's (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2).\n\nThen the second element in first row is (1/\u221a2), but since it's in the first row second column, the cofactor has a sign of (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by the minor for (1,2):\n\nThe minor for (1,2) is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column2:\n\n[1/\u221a2   1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0      -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the submatrix for element (1,2) (which is the first row second column) is the matrix without first row and second column. So the rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.\n\nWait, original matrix (P - \u03bbI):\n\nRow1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo the minor for (1,2) is the determinant of rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. That would be:\n\nRow2 columns 1 and 3: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow3 columns 1 and 3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = - (\u03bb)/\u221a2.\n\nSo the second term in the determinant expansion is - (1/\u221a2) * [ - \u03bb /\u221a2 ] = - (1/\u221a2)( - \u03bb /\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/2.\n\nThe third element in the first row is 0, so that term is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb)/2 \n\nWait, hold on, the first term was -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2). Wait, the first term is (element (1,1) * minor) with sign, but the minor determinant was \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2). So the first term is (-\u03bb)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2). The second term is the second element's contribution, which was (1/\u221a2) multiplied by its cofactor, which was - [ determinant of minor ] ?\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the determinant properly.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the matrix:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\ng h i\n\nDeterminant is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nSo applying this to P - \u03bbI:\n\na = -\u03bb, b = 1/\u221a2, c = 0\n\nd = 1/\u221a2, e = -\u03bb, f = 1/\u221a2\n\ng = 0, h = 1/\u221a2, i = -\u03bb\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)[ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nSo first term: (-\u03bb)[ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) [ ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) - 0 ] \n\nThird term: 0.\n\nCalculating the second term:\n\n- (1/\u221a2) * ( - \u03bb / \u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb / \u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo total determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb \n\nSo determinant equation: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) =0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh! So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. \n\nSo 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. \n\nSo the question is, when we measure the observable P, the probability of getting 0 is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the given state vector onto that subspace, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is in a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1, 2, 1]^T (written as a column vector), the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the sum of |\u27e8\u03c8|v_i\u27e9|\u00b2 for each orthonormal eigenvector v_i in the 0-eigenspace. Since the eigenspace for 0 might be multi-dimensional, we need to find all eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, form an orthonormal basis for that space, and then compute the projection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way. Since P is a Hermitian operator (as an observable must be), the probability can be found by \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9, where P_0 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0. But maybe that's equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: For an eigenvalue \u03bb, the probability is the sum over all eigenvectors v with eigenvalue \u03bb of |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to compute the projection of the state onto the 0-eigenspace. To do that, I need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.\n\nLet me find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nv2 =0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors must satisfy v2=0, v3 = -v1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T. \n\nSo any vector like that. So the eigenspace for 0 is two-dimensional? Wait, no. Wait, let me see. Wait, the equations say v2=0 and v1 +v3 =0, so that gives two conditions. So the eigenspace is 1-dimensional. Wait, how?\n\nWait, in 3-dimensional space, each equation reduces the dimension by 1. So starting with 3 variables, two equations (v2=0 and v1 +v3=0) would leave a 1-dimensional eigenspace. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1)^T. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Let me set v1 = t, then v3 = -t. v2 =0. So the vector is t*(1,0,-1). So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I set v1 =1, then v3 =-1, so (1,0,-1). Let me check if this vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0:\n\nMultiply P by (1,0,-1)^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) =0.\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. \n\nYes, so that works. So the eigenspace is indeed 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nTherefore, the projection of the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 onto the 0-eigenspace is the component of \u03c8 in that direction. \n\nThe state vector given is \u03c8 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. \n\nWe need to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v = (1,0,-1)^T. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the component of \u03c8 in that direction. \n\nHowever, first, we need to make sure that the eigenvector is normalized. Let me compute the norm of v: ||v|| = sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T. \n\nTherefore, the projection of \u03c8 onto this eigenvector is the inner product of \u03c8 with this unit eigenvector. \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= (-1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) \n\n= -2/\u221a2 \n\n= -\u221a2.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this: | -\u221a2 |\u00b2 = ( \u221a2 )\u00b2 = 2.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the projection is the inner product squared. Wait, but the state vector must be a normalized vector? Wait, wait, the problem didn't say the state vector is normalized. Hmm. Oh, right! The given state vector might not be normalized. Wait, that's an important point. \n\nThe question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, so perhaps this vector is already normalized, or maybe we have to normalize it first?\n\nWait, the problem might be assuming that the given vector is already normalized, but let me check. Let me compute the norm of the given state vector \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector must be the given vector divided by sqrt(6). \n\nOh, right! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have norm 1. So the problem probably expects us to first normalize the given vector. \n\nSo I need to take that into account. \n\nTherefore, the actual state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/\u221a6)*[ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nTherefore, the projection onto the eigenvector v (unit vector) is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8_normalized\u27e9 \n\n= (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) \n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe unit eigenvector v_normalized is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe normalized state vector is ( -1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6 ).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6)\n\n= [ -1/(\u221a2 \u221a6) ] + [ -1/(\u221a2 \u221a6) ]\n\n= (-1 -1)/(\u221a2 \u221a6 )\n\n= -2/(\u221a12 )\n\nSimplify \u221a12 = 2\u221a3, so denominator is 2\u221a3, so:\n\n-2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me recast all steps again carefully because this is a bit error-prone.\n\nFirst, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm squared is 1+4+1=6. So the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)*[-1,2,1]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is v = [1,0,-1]^T, which has norm sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/\u221a2)[1,0,-1]^T.\n\nThe inner product between the normalized state and this eigenvector is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)*(-1) * (1/\u221a2) (from first component)\n\nplus (2/\u221a6)*0 (second component term)\n\nplus (1/\u221a6)*( -1/\u221a2 ) (third component)\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2) \n\nThird term: (1)(-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ -1/(\u221a12) ) ] + [ -1/(\u221a12) ]\n\nWait wait, third term is (1/\u221a6)*( -1/\u221a2 ) = -1/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nWait, so total is:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nThird term: (1/\u221a6)*(-1/\u221a2 ) = -1/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nSo total is (-1 -1)/ (\u221a6 * \u221a2 ) = -2/(\u221a12) = -2/(2*\u221a3) ) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute square is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. So yes, 1/3. \n\nTherefore the probability is 1/3, so the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this probability without going through eigenvalues. Since the expectation value of P in the state \u03c8 is \u27e8\u03c8 | P | \u03c8\u27e9, but that's not directly needed here. Alternatively, since the question is about the probability of getting 0, which is the squared norm of the projection onto the 0-eigenspace. Since that's exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, another method: Let me think if I can use the spectral theorem. The operator P can be written as P = 0 * P_0 + 1 * P_1 + (-1) * P_{-1}, where P_0 is the projection onto the 0-eigenvalue eigenspace, and similarly for P_1 and P_{-1}. Then, the probability of measuring 0 is \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9. Since P_0 projects onto the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, which is the same as the projection I calculated earlier. So that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C) 1/3. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2/3, B)1, C)1/3, D)sqrt(2/3). So C is the answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute the inner product:\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe normalized state vector is ( -1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6 ).\n\nInner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) \n\nFirst term: -1/(\u221a2 * \u221a6)\n\nThird term: (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) = -1/(\u221a2 * \u221a6 )\n\nTotal: -2/(\u221a2 * \u221a6 ) = -2/(\u221a12) = -2/(2*\u221a3) ) = -1/\u221a3. \n\nYes, so squared is 1/3. Correct. \n\nSo I think the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The observable is represented by the matrix operator P, which has first row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable gives 0. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, maybe I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P first? Because the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, so 0 must be an eigenvalue of P. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to consider that the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. But perhaps the straightforward way is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection of the given state onto that eigenspace, and square the norm. \n\nLet me start by writing down matrix P.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation would be determinant of (P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute that determinant.\n\nThe matrix P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ -\u03bb        1/\u221a2       0     ]\n[1/\u221a2      -\u03bb        1/\u221a2  ]\n[ 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * ... \n\nWait, maybe expanding along the first row:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * ... \n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\nFirst element: -\u03bb multiplied by the minor of the (1,1) element.

Let me recalculate the determinant properly.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the matrix:\n\na b c\n\nd e f\n\ng h i\n\nDeterminant is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nSo applying this to P - \u03bbI:\n\na = -\u03bb, b = 1/\u221a2, c = 0\n\nd = 1/\u221a2, e = -\u03bb, f = 1/\u221a2\n\ng = 0, h = 1/\u221a2, i = -\u03bb\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n(-\u03bb)[ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nSo first term: (-\u03bb)[ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) [ ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) - 0 ] \n\nThird term: 0.\n\nCalculating the second term:\n\n- (1/\u221a2) * ( - \u03bb / \u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb / \u221a2) ) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nSo total determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb \n\nSo determinant equation: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) =0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh! So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. \n\nSo 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. \n\nSo the question is, when we measure the observable P, the probability of getting 0 is the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the given state vector onto that subspace, then compute the squared norm of that projection.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is in a state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1, 2, 1]^T (written as a column vector), the probability of measuring eigenvalue 0 is the sum of |\u27e8\u03c8|v_i\u27e9|\u00b2 for each orthonormal eigenvector v_i in the 0-eigenspace. Since the eigenspace for 0 might be multi-dimensional, we need to find all eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, form an orthonormal basis for that space, and then compute the projection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way. Since P is a Hermitian operator (as an observable must be), the probability can be found by \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9, where P_0 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0. But maybe that's equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: For an eigenvalue \u03bb, the probability is the sum over all eigenvectors v with eigenvalue \u03bb of |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to compute the projection of the state onto the 0-eigenspace. To do that, I need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.\n\nLet me find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. \n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv = 0.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nFirst row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u21d2 v2 =0.\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u21d2 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u21d2 v1 + v3 =0.\n\nThird row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u21d2 same as first row, so v2=0.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nv2 =0,\n\nv1 + v3 =0,\n\nv2 =0.\n\nSo the eigenvectors must satisfy v2=0, v3 = -v1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1)^T. \n\nSo any vector like that. So the eigenspace for 0 is two-dimensional? Wait, no. Wait, let me see. Wait, the equations say v2=0 and v1 +v3 =0, so that gives two conditions. So the eigenspace is 1-dimensional. Wait, how?\n\nWait, in 3-dimensional space, each equation reduces the dimension by 1. So starting with 3 variables, two equations (v2=0 and v1 +v3=0) would leave a 1-dimensional eigenspace. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1)^T. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Let me set v1 = t, then v3 = -t. v2 =0. So the vector is t*(1,0,-1). So the eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I set v1 =1, then v3 =-1, so (1,0,-1). Let me check if this vector is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0:\n\nMultiply P by (1,0,-1)^T:\n\nFirst component: 0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1) =0.\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*1 +0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1) = (1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) =0.\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/\u221a2)*0 +0*(-1)=0. \n\nYes, so that works. So the eigenspace is indeed 1-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1)^T. \n\nTherefore, the projection of the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 onto the 0-eigenspace is the component of \u03c8 in that direction. \n\nThe state vector given is \u03c8 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. \n\nWe need to find the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v = (1,0,-1)^T. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the component of \u03c8 in that direction. \n\nHowever, first, we need to make sure that the eigenvector is normalized. Let me compute the norm of v: ||v|| = sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T. \n\nTherefore, the projection of \u03c8 onto this eigenvector is the inner product of \u03c8 with this unit eigenvector. \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= (-1/\u221a2) - (1/\u221a2) \n\n= -2/\u221a2 \n\n= -\u221a2.\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this: | -\u221a2 |\u00b2 = ( \u221a2 )\u00b2 = 2.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the projection is the inner product squared. Wait, but the state vector must be a normalized vector? Wait, wait, the problem didn't say the state vector is normalized. Hmm. Oh, right! The given state vector might not be normalized. Wait, that's an important point. \n\nThe question says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, so perhaps this vector is already normalized, or maybe we have to normalize it first?\n\nWait, the problem might be assuming that the given vector is already normalized, but let me check. Let me compute the norm of the given state vector \u03c8 = [-1, 2, 1]^T.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector must be the given vector divided by sqrt(6). \n\nOh, right! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have norm 1. So the problem probably expects us to first normalize the given vector. \n\nSo I need to take that into account. \n\nTherefore, the actual state is \u03c8_normalized = (1/\u221a6)*[ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.\n\nTherefore, the projection onto the eigenvector v (unit vector) is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8_normalized\u27e9 \n\n= (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) \n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe unit eigenvector v_normalized is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe normalized state vector is ( -1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6 ).\n\nThe inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6)\n\n= [ -1/(\u221a2 \u221a6) ] + [ -1/(\u221a2 \u221a6) ]\n\n= (-1 -1)/(\u221a2 \u221a6 )\n\n= -2/(\u221a12 )\n\nSimplify \u221a12 = 2\u221a3, so denominator is 2\u221a3, so:\n\n-2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me recast all steps again carefully because this is a bit error-prone.\n\nFirst, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm squared is 1+4+1=6. So the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)*[-1,2,1]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is v = [1,0,-1]^T, which has norm sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/\u221a2)[1,0,-1]^T.\n\nThe inner product between the normalized state and this eigenvector is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)*(-1) * (1/\u221a2) (from first component)\n\nplus (2/\u221a6)*0 (second component term)\n\nplus (1/\u221a6)*( -1/\u221a2 ) (third component)\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2) \n\nThird term: (1)(-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[ -1/(\u221a12) ) ] + [ -1/(\u221a12) ]\n\nWait wait, third term is (1/\u221a6)*( -1/\u221a2 ) = -1/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nWait, so total is:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nThird term: (1/\u221a6)*(-1/\u221a2 ) = -1/(\u221a6 * \u221a2 )\n\nSo total is (-1 -1)/ (\u221a6 * \u221a2 ) = -2/(\u221a12) = -2/(2*\u221a3) ) = -1/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute square is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. So yes, 1/3. \n\nTherefore the probability is 1/3, so the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this probability without going through eigenvalues. Since the expectation value of P in the state \u03c8 is \u27e8\u03c8 | P | \u03c8\u27e9, but that's not directly needed here. Alternatively, since the question is about the probability of getting 0, which is the squared norm of the projection onto the 0-eigenspace. Since that's exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, another method: Let me think if I can use the spectral theorem. The operator P can be written as P = 0 * P_0 + 1 * P_1 + (-1) * P_{-1}, where P_0 is the projection onto the 0-eigenvalue eigenspace, and similarly for P_1 and P_{-1}. Then, the probability of measuring 0 is \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 | \u03c8\u27e9. Since P_0 projects onto the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0, which is the same as the projection I calculated earlier. So that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C) 1/3. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2/3, B)1, C)1/3, D)sqrt(2/3). So C is the answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute the inner product:\n\nThe normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe normalized state vector is ( -1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6 ).\n\nInner product:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) \n\nFirst term: -1/(\u221a2 * \u221a6)\n\nThird term: (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) = -1/(\u221a2 * \u221a6 )\n\nTotal: -2/(\u221a2 * \u221a6 ) = -2/(\u221a12) = -2/(2*\u221a3) ) = -1/\u221a3. \n\nYes, so squared is 1/3. Correct. \n\nSo I think the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) as 0, we first identify the eigenvalues of \\( P \\). The characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\) yields eigenvalues \\( 0, 1, -1 \\). The eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 are found by solving \\( Pv = 0 \\), resulting in vectors of the form \\( (v_1, 0, -v_1)^T \\). The normalized eigenvector is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \\).\n\nThe given state vector \\( \\psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\) has a norm \\( \\sqrt{6} \\), so the normalized state is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T \\). The projection of this state onto the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \\bigg| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{6}} \\left( (-1) - 1 \\right) = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the square of the absolute value of this projection, yielding \\( \\left| -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
