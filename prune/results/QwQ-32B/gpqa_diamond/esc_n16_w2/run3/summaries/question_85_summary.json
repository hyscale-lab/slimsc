      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The question says both have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star, and the albedo. Since albedo is the same, it won't affect the ratio. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = [(L_star/(16 * \u03c0 * \u03c3 * a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo)]^(1/4), right? But since albedo is the same for both, it cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio of T1 to T2 would be [(L1/L2) * (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2)]^(1/4). Wait, but both planets orbit the same star, so L1 and L2 are the same. So actually, the ratio simplifies to (a2/a1)^(-1/2). Because the temperature is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). So T1/T2 = ( (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) )^(1/4) = (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2)^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^0.5. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = sqrt( sqrt( (L * (1 - A) ) / (16 * \u03c0 * \u03c3 * a\u00b2) ) ), but maybe it's better to recall the exact formula. The standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), but that's if the star's temperature is T_star. Alternatively, another version is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ). Wait, maybe another way. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - A)/\u03b5 ), where A is albedo and \u03b5 is the emissivity. But if emissivity is 1 (assuming blackbody), then (1 - A) is part of it. Since the albedo is same for both, that term would cancel in the ratio. Wait, but the problem states to assume same albedo. So the ratio would be (T1_eq / T2_eq) = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) * sqrt( (1 - A)/ (1 - A) ) )? Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the planet's thermal emission. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = [ (L_star / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - A) ) ]^(1/4 )\n\nWhere L_star is the star's luminosity, a is the semi-major axis, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and A is albedo. Since L_star and \u03c3 are the same for both planets, and A is the same, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would be:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = [ (a2\u00b2 / a1\u00b2 ) ]^(1/4) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2).\n\nTherefore, the ratio depends on the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances. Wait, no, because inside the brackets it's (L/(a\u00b2))*(1-A), so when you take the ratio, the L and (1-A) terms cancel. So T1/T2 = [ (a2\u00b2 / a1\u00b2) ]^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). Wait, but that would be (a2/a1)^0.5. So if a1 is smaller than a2, then T1 would be higher. But how do I find a1 and a2?\n\nHmm, the problem gives information about the radial velocity shifts induced by each planet. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The amplitude of the RV shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 a sin i ) / (P) )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is the simplified version. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (G M_p / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * ( (a)^( -2/3 ) ) * ( sin i ) ) / ( 2 \u03c0 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should recall that the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3)) ) * (a)^( -1/2 ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the formula correctly. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G / (2 \u03c0) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) ) * ( (1 / a)^{1/2} ) ) * ( (1 / P)^{1/3} ) )\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, and we can relate their RV amplitudes to their orbital distances. Let me see.\n\nThe key idea is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star)^{2/3}) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), assuming that the inclination angle i is the same for both (since we can't know the inclination, but if the problem doesn't mention different inclinations, perhaps we can assume that the sin i terms are the same, so they cancel in the ratio? Or maybe the problem gives the actual shifts which already account for sin i, so we can treat them as measured values.\n\nAlternatively, the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^{2/3} * sqrt(a) ) ), because the formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G)^(1/3) / (2 \u03c0)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(a) )\n\nAssuming that the period P is related to a via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G (M_star + M_p)), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (since their masses are Earth-like and the star is 1.5 solar masses), we can approximate M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. So, P \u2248 sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3)/(G M_star) ). But maybe we can avoid dealing with periods here.\n\nThe key point is that the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/sqrt(a)). So, K \u221d (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/sqrt(a)). \n\nGiven that both planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for both, so the ratio K1/K2 would be (M1 / M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because:\n\nK1/K2 = [ (M1 / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/sqrt(a1)) ) ] / [ (M2 / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/sqrt(a2)) ) ]\n\nThe M_star^(2/3) terms cancel. So,\n\nK1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a1)) )\n\n=> (K1/K2) = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nRearranged, we can solve for the ratio of a1 to a2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers given. \n\nPlanet1's K is 0.03 \u00c5, Planet2's is 0.04 \u00c5. Wait, the question says \"induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5\" for Planet1 and \"0.04 \u00c5\" for Planet2. So K1 = 0.03, K2 = 0.04. \n\nMasses: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses. \n\nSo M1 =7, M2=5. \n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n0.03 / 0.04 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nLet me compute the left side: 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.\n\nSo 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nThen, sqrt(a2/a1) = (0.75) / (7/5) = (0.75) * (5/7) = 3.75 /7 \u2248 0.5357.\n\nThen square both sides to get a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287. Wait, but that's a2/a1 = (sqrt(a2/a1))\u00b2. Wait, let me see:\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = 0.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 \u2248 0.287. So a1/a2 = 1/0.287 \u2248 3.485. \n\nWait, but I need a1 and a2 to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 is proportional to (a2/a1)^(-1/2), as per earlier. Let me recheck that.\n\nEarlier, I had T_eq \u221d (L / a\u00b2)^{1/4}, so T1/T2 = ( (L/a1\u00b2)/(L/a2\u00b2) )^{1/4} ) = (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2)^{1/4} = (a2/a1)^{1/2}. \n\nSo T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^{0.5}. \n\nWait, so if a2/a1 is 0.287, then T1/T2 would be sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. \n\nWait, that would give T1/T2 \u2248 0.536, so the answer would be approximately 0.53, which is option C. \n\nBut let me check all steps again. \n\nFirst, the formula for K: \n\nK \u221d (M_p / (M_star)^{2/3}) * (1/\u221aa). \n\nSo the ratio K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^{1/2} \n\nWait, no, let me re-derive that properly. \n\nLet me write K1 = C * (M1) / (M_star^{2/3}) ) * (1/\u221aa1 )\n\nSimilarly K2 = C * (M2) / (M_star^{2/3}) ) * (1/\u221aa2 )\n\nDivide K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * ( sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a1) )\n\nYes, so K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nThen solving for sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nK1 =0.03, K2=0.04 \u2192 K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75\n\nM1/M2 is 7/5 \u2192 M2/M1 = 5/7.\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (0.75 *5)/7 = 3.75 /7 \u22480.5357. \n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) \u22480.5357 \u2192 a2/a1 \u2248 (0.5357)^2 \u22480.287. \n\nThus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^{0.5} \u2192 sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536. So approximately 0.53. \n\nSo that would be option C. \n\nWait, but the options have 0.53 as C. So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me confirm:\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Because T \u221d (1/a)^{0.5} (since T is proportional to (L/a\u00b2)^{0.25}, so (1/a^2)^0.25 is 1/a^0.5. So T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nWait, wait! Wait a second. Wait, the formula is T \u221d (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4}, so T is proportional to (1/a)^{1/2}. \n\nSo T1/T2 = ( (1/a1) / (1/a2) )^{1/2} ) = (a2/a1)^{1/2}. \n\nYes, so that's exactly what I had. \n\nTherefore, since a2/a1 is ~0.287, the square root is ~0.536. \n\nTherefore, the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.536, so the closest option is C (0.53). \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

Let me confirm:\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Because T \u221d (1/a)^{0.5} (since T is proportional to (L/a\u00b2)^{0.25}, so (1/a^2)^0.25 is 1/a^0.5. So T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nWait, wait! Wait a second. Wait, the formula is T \u221d (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4}, so T is proportional to (1/a)^{1/2}. \n\nSo T1/T2 = ( (1/a1) / (1/a2) )^{1/2} ) = (a2/a1)^{1/2}. \n\nYes, so that's exactly what I had. \n\nTherefore, since a2/a1 is ~0.287, the square root is ~0.536. \n\nTherefore, the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.536, so the closest option is C (0.53). \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula, which depends on the star's luminosity, the orbital distance, and the albedo. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude relation. The RV amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\). For both planets:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n- \\( K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\), \\( K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\)\n- \\( M_1 = 7 \\, M_{\\oplus} \\), \\( M_2 = 5 \\, M_{\\oplus} \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \\implies 0.75 = 1.4 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \\implies \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{0.75}{1.4} \\approx 0.5357\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx (0.5357)^2 \\approx 0.287\n\\]\n\nThus, the temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\sqrt{0.287} \\approx 0.536\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **C) ~0.53**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me start by recalling what equilibrium temperature means. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio, right?\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, actually, I might be mixing up some terms here. Let me think again. The standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L_star/(4\u03c0\u03c3a\u00b2))^(1/4)... Wait, maybe I should remember it in terms of the star's luminosity. \n\nOh right, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / 0.39 )^(1/4) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach it from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ?\n\nAlternatively, another version is T_eq = ( (L_star/(16\u03c0\u03c3a\u00b2))^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). But since both planets have the same albedo, that term would be the same for both, so the ratio would depend only on the other factors. \n\nSo the key variables here are the distance from the star (a) and the star's luminosity. Since the star's properties are given, we can find the ratio based on their orbital distances. \n\nBut how do we find the orbital distances from the given data? The question mentions the radial velocity (RV) shifts caused by each planet. The RV semi-amplitude (the maximum Doppler shift) is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. \n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is:\n\nK = (G (M_p / sin i) ) / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )^( -1 ) ... Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (G M_p sin i / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * something? Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nWait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ?\n\nNo, maybe I should remember that for a circular orbit, the RV amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ... Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of the mass function. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p / sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3)) ? Hmm, this is getting tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Kepler's third law. The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. But we don't have the periods here. Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shift amplitudes. Maybe I can relate the RV shift to the orbital parameters. \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p) \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think. The velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity can be approximated as:\n\nv_star = ( (G M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Since the problem gives the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, and we can relate those shifts to their orbital velocities. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c, where v is the star's velocity towards or away from us. The maximum shift (semi-amplitude) K (in velocity terms) would correspond to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. \n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude K (in velocity units) is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ? \n\nAlternatively, I think the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p / sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3)) \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I should just use the relation that K is proportional to (M_p / a)^(1/3), but maybe that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law in terms of the star's velocity. \n\nLet me think of Kepler's third law: (M_p + M_star) * a^3 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) P\u00b2. But rearranged, but perhaps it's better to consider the relation between the star's velocity and the planet's mass. \n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet is given by v_star = (2\u03c0 a sin i) / P. So the semi-amplitude K is this velocity divided by sin i, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) )? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look up the formula for K. Wait, since I can't look it up, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the gravitational force between the planet and star provides the centripetal acceleration for the star's motion. \n\nThe gravitational force F = G M_p M_star / a\u00b2. \n\nThis must equal the centripetal force on the star: F = M_star v\u00b2 / a, where v is the star's orbital speed. \n\nSo setting them equal: G M_p M_star / a\u00b2 = M_star v\u00b2 /a \u2192 v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt(G M_p / a). \n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo the star's velocity v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is equal to this v (since we're considering the maximum velocity in the line of sight, assuming i=90 degrees, but since we don't know inclination, but since both planets have the same inclination term (sin i), but since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe we can assume that the given shifts are already accounting for sin i, or that we can consider the ratio where the sin i cancels. \n\nWait, but the problem states that both planets induce a certain shift. The problem gives the shifts in \u00c5 (Angstroms), which is a Doppler shift in wavelength. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v/c, so the velocity v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for each planet, the velocity K (semi-amplitude) can be calculated from their given shifts. \n\nSo first, let's compute K1 and K2 for each planet. \n\nThe forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the wavelength \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5. \n\nPlanet1's shift is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb1 = 0.03 \u00c5. \n\nSimilarly, Planet2's \u0394\u03bb2 = 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nSo the velocity for Planet1: v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. \n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300)*c. \n\nSo the ratio v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75. \n\nBut how does this relate to their orbital parameters?\n\nFrom earlier, v (the star's velocity) is sqrt(G M_p /a). \n\nTherefore, v1 = sqrt( G M_p1 /a1 ), \n\nv2 = sqrt( G M_p2 /a2 )\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nv1/v2 = sqrt( (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) )\n\n=> (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\n=> (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1)\n\nRearranged, (a1/a2) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (v2/v1)^2 \n\nWe can plug in the known values. \n\nM_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. \n\nv1/v2 is 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so v2/v1 is 1/0.75 \u2248 1.333. \n\nTherefore, (a1/a2) = (7/5) * ( (1.333)^2 )\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, (v1/v2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625. \n\nSo (M_p1/a1)/(M_p2/a2) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (7/a1)/(5/a2) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (7 a2)/(5 a1) ) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (a2/a1) = (0.5625 *5)/7 \n\nWait, solving for a2/a1:\n\nMultiply both sides by (5 a1)/(7 a2):\n\nWait, let me rearrange the equation properly. \n\nStarting from:\n\n(7/a1) / (5/a2) ) = 0.5625 \n\nWhich is (7/a1) * (a2/5) = 0.5625 \n\nSo (7 a2)/(5 a1) = 0.5625 \n\nThen, a2/a1 = (0.5625 *5)/7 \n\nCalculates to 2.8125 /7 \u2248 0.4018 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018, so a1/a2 \u2248 1/0.4018 \u2248 2.49. \n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is approximately 2.49. \n\nWait, so the orbital distance of Planet1 is about 2.49 times that of Planet2. \n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) ) ? Hmm, perhaps better to write it using the star's luminosity. \n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun) / (R_sun^2) )^(1/4) )? Not sure. Let me recall the standard formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the effective temperature of the star adjusted by the distance and albedo. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/0.39 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is calculated using the formula derived from the balance between incoming starlight and outgoing thermal radiation. \n\nThe incoming flux is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2), where L is the star's luminosity. The equilibrium temperature satisfies:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) / 4 \n\nWhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and the factor of 4 comes from the planet's surface area being \u03c0 r\u00b2, so the effective area is half the cross-section. \n\nRearranged, T_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nThus, T_eq = [ (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = [ (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nBecause L and other constants cancel except for the a terms. \n\nWait, since L is the same for both planets, the ratio simplifies to (a2\u00b2 /a1\u00b2 )^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nThe T_eq ratio is [ ( (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nThe L cancels, so it's ( (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2) )^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T1_eq / T2_eq = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nBecause T1's a is a1, so T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), and T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). \n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nWait, let me confirm: \n\nT_eq \u221d (1/a)^0.5 \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5 \n\nYes, because T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5, so the ratio is (a2/a1)^0.5. \n\nEarlier, we found that a1/a2 \u2248 2.49, so a2/a1 \u2248 1/2.49 \u2248 0.4016 \n\nTaking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.4016) \u2248 0.633. Wait, but none of the options are 0.63. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me check the steps again. \n\nFirst, the calculation of the ratio a1/a2: \n\nWe had:\n\nv1/v2 = sqrt( (M_p1/a1)/(M_p2/a2) )\n\nSo (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\n=> (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) = (v1/v2)^2 \n\n=> (M_p1 * a2)/(M_p2 * a1) = (v1/v2)^2 \n\n=> (a2/a1) = (M_p2/M_p1) * (v1/v2)^2 \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the algebra here. Let me re-derive. \n\nStarting over with the equation:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2/a2) = M_p1/a1 \n\nMultiply both sides by a1 a2:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 * M_p2 a1 = M_p1 a2 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2 / M_p1) \n\nAh! I see I made a mistake earlier. The correct ratio is (a2/a1) = (v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2/M_p1)\n\nOkay, let's redo the calculations with this corrected formula. \n\nGiven:\n\nM_p1 =7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 =5 Earth masses\n\nv1 = 0.03 \u00c5 shift\n\nv2 =0.04 \u00c5 shift\n\nThus, v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (v1/v2)^2 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = 0.5625 * (5/7) \n\nCompute that: 0.5625 *5 = 2.8125 \n\n2.8125 /7 \u2248 0.4018 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.4018 \n\nTherefore, a1/a2 \u22482.49, same as before. \n\nWait, but the ratio a2/a1 is 0.4018, so the T ratio is (a2/a1)^(1/2) \n\nWait, T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1 / T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5 \n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 sqrt(0.4) is approx 0.632. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps I missed a factor. Wait, maybe I need to consider the star's luminosity. \n\nWait, the formula for equilibrium temperature also depends on the star's luminosity. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) ) ?\n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe star's luminosity L is given by L = 4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4. \n\nSo substituting into the equilibrium temperature equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = ( (4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - albedo) /4 \n\nWait, let me recast the equilibrium temp formula properly. \n\nThe incoming flux is F = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = F * (1 - albedo)/4 \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo)/4 * (1/\u03c3) \n\nWait, perhaps better to rearrange:\n\nT_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq = [ L (1 - albedo) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4) \n\nBut since both planets are around the same star, L and \u03c3 are the same. The albedo is the same for both. So the ratio becomes:\n\nT1_eq / T2_eq = [ (a2\u00b2)/(a1\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nWait, because the a\u00b2 term is in the denominator, so flipping the ratio. \n\nWait, let me compute the ratio step by step:\n\n(T1/T2)^4 = ( L/(a1\u00b2) ) / ( L/(a2\u00b2) ) * ( (1 - alb)/(1 - alb) ) ) \n\nThe L and (1 - alb) terms cancel, so (T1/T2)^4 = (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2) \n\nSo the same as before. \n\nHmm. So that gives T ratio \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.633. \n\nBut the options don't have this. Wait, the options are 0.98, 1.3, 0.53, 1.05. \n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake. Let me check all steps again. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the relation between the velocity and the orbital parameters. Let me re-express the key equation. \n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity is v = (G M_p / (a (M_star + M_p))) )^(1/3) ??? Wait, perhaps I need to use the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K. \n\nLet me recall the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K (in velocity units). \n\nThe formula is: \n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to recall that K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) \n\nHmm, maybe it's better to use the formula derived from Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law states that (M_p + M_star) * a\u00b3 = (G P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2)\n\nBut rearranged for P, but since we don't know the period, perhaps it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the star (v) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. \n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is F = G M_p M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThis provides the centripetal acceleration for the star's motion: F = M_star v\u00b2 / a \n\nSo:\n\nG M_p M_star /a\u00b2 = M_star v\u00b2 /a \n\nCancel M_star:\n\nG M_p / a\u00b2 = v\u00b2 /a \n\nSo v\u00b2 = G M_p / a \n\nThus, v = sqrt( G M_p / a )\n\nSo that's the star's velocity. \n\nTherefore, the RV semi-amplitude K (maximum velocity) is v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nTherefore, K^2 = G M_p / a \u2192 a = G M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nThus, the semi-major axis a is proportional to M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a1 = G M_p1 / K1\u00b2 \n\na2 = G M_p2 / K2\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, the ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1/K1\u00b2) / (M_p2/K2\u00b2 ) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nSo, a1/a2 = (7/5) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nNow, K1 and K2 are the velocities derived from the Doppler shifts. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v/c \u2192 v = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) * c \n\nThus, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5 ) * c \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 /6300)*c \n\nSo the ratio K2/K1 = (0.04/0.03) = 4/3 \u22481.333 \n\nThus, (K2/K1)^2 = (16/9) \u22481.777 \n\nTherefore, \n\na1/a2 = (7/5)*(16/9) \n\n7/5 is 1.4, 16/9 is ~1.777 \n\nMultiply them: 1.4 * 1.777 \u2248 2.488 \n\nSo same as before, a1/a2 \u22482.488 \u2192 a2/a1 \u22480.4018 \n\nTherefore, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u22480.633 \n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before. But the options don't have this. The closest is option C (0.53) and A (0.98). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. \n\nWait, maybe I forgot that the star's luminosity depends on its radius and temperature. \n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature formula actually requires the star's luminosity. Let me recalculate including that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) \n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be written in terms of the star's effective temperature. \n\nThe star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 \n\nThus, substituting into the equilibrium temperature equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ (4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - albedo) ] / (4 \u03c3) \n\nWait, let me do this step carefully. \n\nThe equilibrium condition is \u03c3 T_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo)/4 \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nBut L = 4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 \n\nSo substituting,\n\nT_eq^4 = (4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 (1 - albedo) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, 4/16 is 1/4, \u03c3 cancels, so:\n\nT_eq^4 = ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - albedo) ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThus,\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/0.39 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, but the (1 - albedo) term is still there. Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio will have (1 - albedo)^(1/4) cancel out. \n\nTherefore, the ratio between T1 and T2 is:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = ( T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) ) / ( T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) \n\nThe T_eff and R_star terms cancel out, so:\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm, so the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I missed something else. \n\nWait, the problem states that the planets are detected via transit and RV methods, but maybe the albedo is not the only factor. Wait, the question says to assume same albedo, so that's okay. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for T2/T1 instead of T1/T2? Let me check the question again. \n\n\"what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\" \n\nSo T1 / T2. \n\nHmm. The options are A 0.98, B1.3, C0.53, D1.05. \n\nHmm, 0.63 isn't there. So maybe there's an error in the approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature includes the star's radius in another way. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the relation between the velocity and the semi-major axis. \n\nWait, the velocity of the star is v = sqrt( G M_p / a ), so the semi-amplitude K = v. \n\nTherefore, a = G M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nBut here, M_p is in kg, and K in m/s, but since we are taking ratios, the units would cancel. \n\nWait, but in the ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1 / K1\u00b2) / (M_p2 / K2\u00b2) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the mass of the star comes into play here. \n\nWait, the formula v = sqrt( G M_p / a ) assumes that the star's mass is much larger than the planet's. But in reality, the star's mass is involved. \n\nWait, let's rederive the velocity. \n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is F = G (M_p M_star)/a\u00b2 \n\nThis provides the centripetal acceleration for both bodies. \n\nThe star's acceleration a_star = F / M_star = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThe planet's acceleration a_p = F / M_p = G M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThe star's velocity v is related to its acceleration and the orbital period. \n\nWait, in circular motion, a = v\u00b2 / r \n\nThus, a_star = v\u00b2 / a \n\nSo setting equal: \n\nG M_p /a\u00b2 = v\u00b2 /a \n\nThus, v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt(G M_p /a )\n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the previous calculations are correct, leading to T1/T2 \u22480.633. \n\nHmm, since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's given data. Let me check again. \n\nThe star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses. Wait, did I consider that? \n\nWait a second! Oh no! I forgot the star's mass. The star's mass is 1.5 Msun, so when calculating the velocity, perhaps the formula should involve the star's mass? \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe velocity of the star is due to the planet's gravity, so the formula v = sqrt( G M_p /a ) is correct only if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, but perhaps the correct formula is different. \n\nWait, the correct formula for the star's velocity in the two-body system is:\n\nThe center of mass is at a distance d from the star, given by:\n\nd = (M_p / (M_p + M_star)) * a \n\nThe star's orbital speed is v = (2\u03c0 d)/P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 a\u00b3 = (G (M_p + M_star)) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is needed. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by: \n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, this formula might be more accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) * (1/a^(1/3)) ? \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use the formula that includes the star's mass. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, but without knowing the period P, this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates K, M_p, and a directly. \n\nThe star's velocity v is given by:\n\nv = (2\u03c0 a sin i / P) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) \n\nSo P = sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) \n\nThus, v = (2\u03c0 a sin i) / sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nv = (2\u03c0 a sin i ) / ( 2\u03c0 sqrt(a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) ) )\n\n= ( sin i ) * sqrt( G (M_p + M_star) / a ) \n\nTherefore, \n\nv = sin i * sqrt( G (M_p + M_star)/a )\n\nAssuming that sin i is the same for both planets (since the problem doesn't provide info to differentiate, but the given shifts would account for sin i), but in the ratio, sin i would cancel. \n\nThus, the ratio of velocities:\n\nv1 / v2 = sqrt( ( (G (M_p1 + M_star)/a1 ) / ( G (M_p2 + M_star)/a2 )) )\n\n= sqrt( ( (M_p1 + M_star)/a1 ) / ( (M_p2 + M_star)/a2 ) )\n\nBut since M_star is 1.5 solar masses, which is way larger than the planets' masses (7 and 5 Earth masses, which are negligible compared to 1.5 Msun). \n\nSo, M_p1 + M_star \u2248 M_star \n\nSimilarly for M_p2 + M_star \u2248 M_star \n\nTherefore, the ratio simplifies to sqrt( ( (M_star)/a1 ) / ( M_star/a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nTherefore, v1/v2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nWait, so v1/v2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nBut earlier, we had v1/v2 = 0.75 \n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 \u2192 a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nWait, this is different from before! \n\nOh my god, this is where I messed up earlier. \n\nWait, so according to this derivation, v is proportional to sqrt(1/a), so v1/v2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nTherefore, rearranged: (v1/v2)^2 = a2/a1 \n\nSo a2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nv1 = sqrt( G M_star /a1 ) * sin i \n\nv2 = sqrt( G M_star /a2 ) * sin i \n\nThus, v1/v2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nThus, (v1/v2)^2 = a2/a1 \n\nTherefore, a2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 \n\nThus, the ratio of a2/a1 is (0.03/0.04)^2 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nTherefore, a2/a1 =0.5625 \u2192 a1/a2 =1/0.5625 \u22481.777 \n\nAh! This is a different result. \n\nSo this is the key mistake I made earlier. \n\nI had previously thought that v^2 = G M_p /a, but actually, since M_p is negligible compared to M_star, the star's velocity is v = sqrt( G M_star /a ), not M_p. \n\nWait, let me rederive this properly. \n\nThe star and planet orbit around their common center of mass. The star's velocity v is given by the two-body problem. \n\nThe gravitational force between them is F = G (M_p M_star)/a\u00b2 \n\nThe acceleration of the star is a = F / M_star = G M_p / (a\u00b2 M_star) * M_p? \n\nWait no: F = M_p * a_p = M_star * a_s \n\nWhere a_p is planet's acceleration, a_s is star's acceleration. \n\nThe acceleration of the star is a_s = F / M_star = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThe acceleration of the planet is a_p = F / M_p = G M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThe star's velocity in circular orbit is v_s = sqrt( a_s * a ), where a is the orbital radius (distance between them). \n\nWait, the acceleration a_s = v_s\u00b2 / a \n\nThus, v_s = sqrt( a_s * a ) = sqrt( (G M_p / a\u00b2) * a ) = sqrt( G M_p /a )\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion. \n\nHmm, confusion here. Let me think again. \n\nThe star's acceleration towards the center is a_s = v_s\u00b2 / a \n\nBut also, a_s = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThus,\n\nv_s\u00b2 / a = G M_p / a\u00b2 \u2192 v_s\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v_s = sqrt( G M_p /a )\n\nSo this is the same as before. \n\nBut when I considered the two-body problem, the velocity of the star is proportional to M_p. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the star's mass is given as 1.5 Msun, which is much larger than the planets' masses (7 and 5 Earth masses, which are ~0.023 and 0.016 Jupiter masses, which are way smaller than 1.5 Msun). \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity is v_s = sqrt( G M_p /a ), but since M_p is negligible compared to M_star, the formula holds. \n\nWait but then the previous approach would be correct, but in that case, the ratio of a2/a1 was 0.4018, leading to T ratio sqrt(0.4018)=0.63. \n\nBut then why did the other approach (using the two-body formula with star's mass) give a different result? \n\nAh! The confusion comes from whether the formula for K (the radial velocity) is dependent on the planet's mass or the star's mass. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the first derivation. \n\nThe correct formula for K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) is actually: \n\nK = (v_s) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ? \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nBut since P is the orbital period, which we don't have, perhaps we can relate it through Kepler's third law. \n\nLet me try again with the correct formula for K:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) \n\nBut using Kepler's third law: \n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) \n\nThus, P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) )\n\nPlugging this into K's formula:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( ( sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) ) / (2\u03c0) )^(2/3) ) )\n\nThis is getting too complex. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be simplified to:\n\nK = (v_s) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the approximation where M_p << M_star. \n\nIf M_p is much smaller than M_star, then M_p + M_star \u2248 M_star. \n\nThus, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / ( M_star^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )\n\nBut using Kepler's third law for the planet's orbit:\n\nP\u00b2 a\u00b3 = (G (M_p + M_star))/(4\u03c0\u00b2) \u2248 (G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) \n\nThus, P \u2248 sqrt( (G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) * (1/a^(3/2)) \n\nWait, perhaps substituting P into K's formula:\n\nLet me write P as:\n\nP = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) \n\nThus, (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star))^(1/2) / (2\u03c0) ) )^(2/3) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way when M_p << M_star. \n\nThe star's velocity v_s = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * v_p \u2248 (M_p/M_star) v_p \n\nWhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity. \n\nThe planet's orbital velocity v_p = sqrt( G M_star /a )\n\nThus, v_s \u2248 (M_p/M_star) * sqrt(G M_star/a ) = sqrt(G M_p M_star / (a M_star\u00b2 )) * M_p/M_star ?\n\nWait, no, better:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_star /a )\n\nv_s = (M_p/(M_p + M_star)) v_p \u2248 (M_p/M_star) v_p \n\nThus, v_s \u2248 (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star /a ) \n\n= sqrt( G M_p^2 M_star ) / ( M_star sqrt(a) ) \n\n= sqrt( G M_p^2 / ( M_star a ) )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting me somewhere. \n\nThus, v_s = sqrt( G M_p^2 / ( M_star a ) ) \n\nWait, so v_s squared is G M_p\u00b2/(M_star a) \n\nThus, v_s = ( M_p / sqrt(M_star a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nBut then, the ratio of the velocities squared would be:\n\n(v_s1 / v_s2)^2 = ( (M_p1^2)/(M_star a1) ) / ( (M_p2^2)/(M_star a2) ) ) \n\n= (M_p1^2 a2 )/( M_p2^2 a1 )\n\nThus,\n\n(v_s1 / v_s2)^2 = (M_p1\u00b2/M_p2\u00b2) * (a2/a1 )\n\nRearranged,\n\na2/a1 = (v_s1/v_s2)^2 * (M_p2\u00b2/M_p1\u00b2 )\n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that v_s1/v_s2 is the ratio of their velocities (from Doppler shifts), which is 0.03/0.04 =0.75 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (5^2/7^2) \n\nWait, since M_p2 is 5 and M_p1 is 7. \n\nSo:\n\n(0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\n(5/7)^2 =25/49 \u22480.5102 \n\nMultiply them: 0.5625 *0.5102 \u22480.287 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.287 \u2192 a1/a2\u22483.484 \n\nThen T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536 \n\nAh! That's approximately 0.54, which matches option C (0.53). \n\nSo this is the correct approach. \n\nThe mistake earlier was not considering that the star's velocity depends on both the planet's mass and the star's mass. \n\nSo the correct ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.287)\u22480.536, which rounds to 0.53 (option C). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me start by recalling what equilibrium temperature means. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio, right?\n\nThe formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, actually, I might be mixing up some terms here. Let me think again. The standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L_star/(4\u03c0\u03c3a\u00b2))^(1/4)... Wait, maybe I should remember it in terms of the star's luminosity. \n\nOh right, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / 0.39 )^(1/4) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach it from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ?\n\nAlternatively, another version is T_eq = ( (L_star/(16\u03c0\u03c3a\u00b2))^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). But since both planets have the same albedo, that term would be the same for both, so the ratio would depend only on the other factors. \n\nSo the key variables here are the distance from the star (a) and the star's luminosity. Since the star's properties are given, we can find the ratio based on their orbital distances. \n\nBut how do we find the orbital distances from the given data? The question mentions the radial velocity (RV) shifts caused by each planet. The RV semi-amplitude (the maximum Doppler shift) is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. \n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is:\n\nK = (G (M_p / sin i) ) / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )^( -1 ) ... Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (G M_p sin i / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * something? Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula. \n\nWait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ?\n\nNo, maybe I should remember that for a circular orbit, the RV amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ... Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of the mass function. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p / sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3)) ? Hmm, this is getting tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Kepler's third law. The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. But we don't have the periods here. Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shift amplitudes. Maybe I can relate the RV shift to the orbital parameters. \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (v) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p) \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think. The velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity can be approximated as:\n\nv_star = ( (G M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Since the problem gives the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, and we can relate those shifts to their orbital velocities. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c, where v is the star's velocity towards or away from us. The maximum shift (semi-amplitude) K (in velocity terms) would correspond to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. \n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude K (in velocity units) is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ? \n\nAlternatively, I think the correct formula is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p / sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3)) \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ) ... Hmm, maybe I should just use the relation that K is proportional to (M_p / a)^(1/3), but maybe that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law in terms of the star's velocity. \n\nLet me think of Kepler's third law: (M_p + M_star) * a^3 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G) P\u00b2. But rearranged, but perhaps it's better to consider the relation between the star's velocity and the planet's mass. \n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet is given by v_star = (2\u03c0 a sin i) / P. So the semi-amplitude K is this velocity divided by sin i, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) )? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look up the formula for K. Wait, since I can't look it up, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the gravitational force between the planet and star provides the centripetal acceleration for the star's motion. \n\nThe gravitational force F = G M_p M_star / a\u00b2. \n\nThis must equal the centripetal force on the star: F = M_star v\u00b2 / a, where v is the star's orbital speed. \n\nSo setting them equal: G M_p M_star / a\u00b2 = M_star v\u00b2 /a \u2192 v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt(G M_p / a). \n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo the star's velocity v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is equal to this v (since we're considering the maximum velocity in the line of sight, assuming i=90 degrees, but since we don't know inclination, but since both planets have the same inclination term (sin i), but since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe we can assume that the given shifts are already accounting for sin i, or that we can consider the ratio where the sin i cancels. \n\nWait, but the problem states that both planets induce a certain shift. The problem gives the shifts in \u00c5 (Angstroms), which is a Doppler shift in wavelength. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v/c, so the velocity v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for each planet, the velocity K (semi-amplitude) can be calculated from their given shifts. \n\nSo first, let's compute K1 and K2 for each planet. \n\nThe forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the wavelength \u03bb is 6300 \u00c5. \n\nPlanet1's shift is 0.03 \u00c5, so \u0394\u03bb1 = 0.03 \u00c5. \n\nSimilarly, Planet2's \u0394\u03bb2 = 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nSo the velocity for Planet1: v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. \n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300)*c. \n\nSo the ratio v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75. \n\nBut how does this relate to their orbital parameters?\n\nFrom earlier, v (the star's velocity) is sqrt(G M_p /a). \n\nTherefore, v1 = sqrt( G M_p1 /a1 ), \n\nv2 = sqrt( G M_p2 /a2 )\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\nv1/v2 = sqrt( (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) )\n\n=> (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\n=> (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1)\n\nRearranged, (a1/a2) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (v2/v1)^2 \n\nWe can plug in the known values. \n\nM_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. \n\nv1/v2 is 0.03/0.04 = 0.75, so v2/v1 is 1/0.75 \u2248 1.333. \n\nTherefore, (a1/a2) = (7/5) * ( (1.333)^2 )\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, (v1/v2)^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625. \n\nSo (M_p1/a1)/(M_p2/a2) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (7/a1)/(5/a2) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (7 a2)/(5 a1) ) = 0.5625 \n\n=> (a2/a1) = (0.5625 *5)/7 \n\nWait, solving for a2/a1:\n\nMultiply both sides by (5 a1)/(7 a2):\n\nWait, let me rearrange the equation properly. \n\nStarting from:\n\n(7/a1) / (5/a2) ) = 0.5625 \n\nWhich is (7/a1) * (a2/5) = 0.5625 \n\nSo (7 a2)/(5 a1) = 0.5625 \n\nThen, a2/a1 = (0.5625 *5)/7 \n\nCalculates to 2.8125 /7 \u2248 0.4018 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 0.4018, so a1/a2 \u2248 1/0.4018 \u2248 2.49. \n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is approximately 2.49. \n\nWait, so the orbital distance of Planet1 is about 2.49 times that of Planet2. \n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) ) ? Hmm, perhaps better to write it using the star's luminosity. \n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun) / (R_sun^2) )^(1/4) )? Not sure. Let me recall the standard formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the effective temperature of the star adjusted by the distance and albedo. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/0.39 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is calculated using the formula derived from the balance between incoming starlight and outgoing thermal radiation. \n\nThe incoming flux is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2), where L is the star's luminosity. The equilibrium temperature satisfies:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) / 4 \n\nWhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and the factor of 4 comes from the planet's surface area being \u03c0 r\u00b2, so the effective area is half the cross-section. \n\nRearranged, T_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nThus, T_eq = [ (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = [ (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nBecause L and other constants cancel except for the a terms. \n\nWait, since L is the same for both planets, the ratio simplifies to (a2\u00b2 /a1\u00b2 )^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nThe T_eq ratio is [ ( (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nThe L cancels, so it's ( (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2) )^(1/4) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T1_eq / T2_eq = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nBecause T1's a is a1, so T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), and T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). \n\nSo the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nWait, let me confirm: \n\nT_eq \u221d (1/a)^0.5 \n\nSo T1 / T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5 \n\nYes, because T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5, so the ratio is (a2/a1)^0.5. \n\nEarlier, we found that a1/a2 \u2248 2.49, so a2/a1 \u2248 1/2.49 \u2248 0.4016 \n\nTaking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.4016) \u2248 0.633. Wait, but none of the options are 0.63. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me check the steps again. \n\nFirst, the calculation of the ratio a1/a2: \n\nWe had:\n\nv1/v2 = sqrt( (M_p1/a1)/(M_p2/a2) )\n\nSo (v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\n=> (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) = (v1/v2)^2 \n\n=> (M_p1 * a2)/(M_p2 * a1) = (v1/v2)^2 \n\n=> (a2/a1) = (M_p2/M_p1) * (v1/v2)^2 \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the algebra here. Let me re-derive. \n\nStarting over with the equation:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 = (M_p1/a1) / (M_p2/a2) \n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2/a2) = M_p1/a1 \n\nMultiply both sides by a1 a2:\n\n(v1/v2)^2 * M_p2 a1 = M_p1 a2 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2 / M_p1) \n\nAh! I see I made a mistake earlier. The correct ratio is (a2/a1) = (v1/v2)^2 * (M_p2/M_p1)\n\nOkay, let's redo the calculations with this corrected formula. \n\nGiven:\n\nM_p1 =7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 =5 Earth masses\n\nv1 = 0.03 \u00c5 shift\n\nv2 =0.04 \u00c5 shift\n\nThus, v1/v2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \n\nTherefore, (v1/v2)^2 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = 0.5625 * (5/7) \n\nCompute that: 0.5625 *5 = 2.8125 \n\n2.8125 /7 \u2248 0.4018 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.4018 \n\nTherefore, a1/a2 \u22482.49, same as before. \n\nWait, but the ratio a2/a1 is 0.4018, so the T ratio is (a2/a1)^(1/2) \n\nWait, T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nBecause T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2). So T1 / T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5 \n\nSo sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 sqrt(0.4) is approx 0.632. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps I missed a factor. Wait, maybe I need to consider the star's luminosity. \n\nWait, the formula for equilibrium temperature also depends on the star's luminosity. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) ) ?\n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe star's luminosity L is given by L = 4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4. \n\nSo substituting into the equilibrium temperature equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = ( (4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - albedo) /4 \n\nWait, let me recast the equilibrium temp formula properly. \n\nThe incoming flux is F = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = F * (1 - albedo)/4 \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo)/4 * (1/\u03c3) \n\nWait, perhaps better to rearrange:\n\nT_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq = [ L (1 - albedo) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4) \n\nBut since both planets are around the same star, L and \u03c3 are the same. The albedo is the same for both. So the ratio becomes:\n\nT1_eq / T2_eq = [ (a2\u00b2)/(a1\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) \n\nWait, because the a\u00b2 term is in the denominator, so flipping the ratio. \n\nWait, let me compute the ratio step by step:\n\n(T1/T2)^4 = ( L/(a1\u00b2) ) / ( L/(a2\u00b2) ) * ( (1 - alb)/(1 - alb) ) ) \n\nThe L and (1 - alb) terms cancel, so (T1/T2)^4 = (a2\u00b2/a1\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2) \n\nSo the same as before. \n\nHmm. So that gives T ratio \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u2248 0.633. \n\nBut the options don't have this. Wait, the options are 0.98, 1.3, 0.53, 1.05. \n\nHmm, so I must have made a mistake. Let me check all steps again. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the relation between the velocity and the orbital parameters. Let me re-express the key equation. \n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity is v = (G M_p / (a (M_star + M_p))) )^(1/3) ??? Wait, perhaps I need to use the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K. \n\nLet me recall the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K (in velocity units). \n\nThe formula is: \n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to recall that K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) \n\nHmm, maybe it's better to use the formula derived from Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law states that (M_p + M_star) * a\u00b3 = (G P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2)\n\nBut rearranged for P, but since we don't know the period, perhaps it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the star (v) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. \n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is F = G M_p M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThis provides the centripetal acceleration for the star's motion: F = M_star v\u00b2 / a \n\nSo:\n\nG M_p M_star /a\u00b2 = M_star v\u00b2 /a \n\nCancel M_star:\n\nG M_p / a\u00b2 = v\u00b2 /a \n\nSo v\u00b2 = G M_p / a \n\nThus, v = sqrt( G M_p / a )\n\nSo that's the star's velocity. \n\nTherefore, the RV semi-amplitude K (maximum velocity) is v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nTherefore, K^2 = G M_p / a \u2192 a = G M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nThus, the semi-major axis a is proportional to M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nSo for each planet, a1 = G M_p1 / K1\u00b2 \n\na2 = G M_p2 / K2\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, the ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1/K1\u00b2) / (M_p2/K2\u00b2 ) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nSo, a1/a2 = (7/5) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nNow, K1 and K2 are the velocities derived from the Doppler shifts. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v/c \u2192 v = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) * c \n\nThus, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5 ) * c \n\nSimilarly, K2 = (0.04 /6300)*c \n\nSo the ratio K2/K1 = (0.04/0.03) = 4/3 \u22481.333 \n\nThus, (K2/K1)^2 = (16/9) \u22481.777 \n\nTherefore, \n\na1/a2 = (7/5)*(16/9) \n\n7/5 is 1.4, 16/9 is ~1.777 \n\nMultiply them: 1.4 * 1.777 \u2248 2.488 \n\nSo same as before, a1/a2 \u22482.488 \u2192 a2/a1 \u22480.4018 \n\nTherefore, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2/a1 ) \u2248 sqrt(0.4018) \u22480.633 \n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before. But the options don't have this. The closest is option C (0.53) and A (0.98). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for equilibrium temperature. \n\nWait, maybe I forgot that the star's luminosity depends on its radius and temperature. \n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature formula actually requires the star's luminosity. Let me recalculate including that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (L/L_sun)/(R_sun^2) )^(1/4) \n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be written in terms of the star's effective temperature. \n\nThe star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 \n\nThus, substituting into the equilibrium temperature equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ (4\u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 )/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1 - albedo) ] / (4 \u03c3) \n\nWait, let me do this step carefully. \n\nThe equilibrium condition is \u03c3 T_eq^4 = (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo)/4 \n\nSo,\n\nT_eq^4 = (L (1 - albedo))/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nBut L = 4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 \n\nSo substituting,\n\nT_eq^4 = (4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 (1 - albedo) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, 4/16 is 1/4, \u03c3 cancels, so:\n\nT_eq^4 = ( R_star\u00b2 T_eff^4 (1 - albedo) ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThus,\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/0.39 )^(1/4 )\n\nWait, but the (1 - albedo) term is still there. Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio will have (1 - albedo)^(1/4) cancel out. \n\nTherefore, the ratio between T1 and T2 is:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = ( T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) ) / ( T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) \n\nThe T_eff and R_star terms cancel out, so:\n\n= sqrt( a2 / a1 ) \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm, so the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I missed something else. \n\nWait, the problem states that the planets are detected via transit and RV methods, but maybe the albedo is not the only factor. Wait, the question says to assume same albedo, so that's okay. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for T2/T1 instead of T1/T2? Let me check the question again. \n\n\"what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\" \n\nSo T1 / T2. \n\nHmm. The options are A 0.98, B1.3, C0.53, D1.05. \n\nHmm, 0.63 isn't there. So maybe there's an error in the approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula for equilibrium temperature includes the star's radius in another way. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the relation between the velocity and the semi-major axis. \n\nWait, the velocity of the star is v = sqrt( G M_p / a ), so the semi-amplitude K = v. \n\nTherefore, a = G M_p / K\u00b2 \n\nBut here, M_p is in kg, and K in m/s, but since we are taking ratios, the units would cancel. \n\nWait, but in the ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1 / K1\u00b2) / (M_p2 / K2\u00b2) = (M_p1/M_p2) * (K2/K1)^2 \n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the mass of the star comes into play here. \n\nWait, the formula v = sqrt( G M_p / a ) assumes that the star's mass is much larger than the planet's. But in reality, the star's mass is involved. \n\nWait, let's rederive the velocity. \n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is F = G (M_p M_star)/a\u00b2 \n\nThis provides the centripetal acceleration for both bodies. \n\nThe star's acceleration a_star = F / M_star = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThe planet's acceleration a_p = F / M_p = G M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThe star's velocity v is related to its acceleration and the orbital period. \n\nWait, in circular motion, a = v\u00b2 / r \n\nThus, a_star = v\u00b2 / a \n\nSo setting equal: \n\nG M_p /a\u00b2 = v\u00b2 /a \n\nThus, v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt(G M_p /a )\n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the previous calculations are correct, leading to T1/T2 \u22480.633. \n\nHmm, since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's given data. Let me check again. \n\nThe star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses. Wait, did I consider that? \n\nWait a second! Oh no! I forgot the star's mass. The star's mass is 1.5 Msun, so when calculating the velocity, perhaps the formula should involve the star's mass? \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe velocity of the star is due to the planet's gravity, so the formula v = sqrt( G M_p /a ) is correct only if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, but perhaps the correct formula is different. \n\nWait, the correct formula for the star's velocity in the two-body system is:\n\nThe center of mass is at a distance d from the star, given by:\n\nd = (M_p / (M_p + M_star)) * a \n\nThe star's orbital speed is v = (2\u03c0 d)/P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 a\u00b3 = (G (M_p + M_star)) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is needed. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by: \n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, this formula might be more accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for K is:\n\nK = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) * (1/a^(1/3)) ? \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use the formula that includes the star's mass. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nWait, but without knowing the period P, this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates K, M_p, and a directly. \n\nThe star's velocity v is given by:\n\nv = (2\u03c0 a sin i / P) \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) \n\nSo P = sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) \n\nThus, v = (2\u03c0 a sin i) / sqrt(4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nv = (2\u03c0 a sin i ) / ( 2\u03c0 sqrt(a\u00b3/(G (M_p + M_star))) ) )\n\n= ( sin i ) * sqrt( G (M_p + M_star) / a ) \n\nTherefore, \n\nv = sin i * sqrt( G (M_p + M_star)/a )\n\nAssuming that sin i is the same for both planets (since the problem doesn't provide info to differentiate, but the given shifts would account for sin i), but in the ratio, sin i would cancel. \n\nThus, the ratio of velocities:\n\nv1 / v2 = sqrt( ( (G (M_p1 + M_star)/a1 ) / ( G (M_p2 + M_star)/a2 )) )\n\n= sqrt( ( (M_p1 + M_star)/a1 ) / ( (M_p2 + M_star)/a2 ) )\n\nBut since M_star is 1.5 solar masses, which is way larger than the planets' masses (7 and 5 Earth masses, which are negligible compared to 1.5 Msun). \n\nSo, M_p1 + M_star \u2248 M_star \n\nSimilarly for M_p2 + M_star \u2248 M_star \n\nTherefore, the ratio simplifies to sqrt( ( (M_star)/a1 ) / ( M_star/a2 ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nTherefore, v1/v2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nWait, so v1/v2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )\n\nBut earlier, we had v1/v2 = 0.75 \n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 \u2192 a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nWait, this is different from before! \n\nOh my god, this is where I messed up earlier. \n\nWait, so according to this derivation, v is proportional to sqrt(1/a), so v1/v2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nTherefore, rearranged: (v1/v2)^2 = a2/a1 \n\nSo a2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nv1 = sqrt( G M_star /a1 ) * sin i \n\nv2 = sqrt( G M_star /a2 ) * sin i \n\nThus, v1/v2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nThus, (v1/v2)^2 = a2/a1 \n\nTherefore, a2/a1 = (v1/v2)^2 \n\nThus, the ratio of a2/a1 is (0.03/0.04)^2 = (0.75)^2 =0.5625 \n\nTherefore, a2/a1 =0.5625 \u2192 a1/a2 =1/0.5625 \u22481.777 \n\nAh! This is a different result. \n\nSo this is the key mistake I made earlier. \n\nI had previously thought that v^2 = G M_p /a, but actually, since M_p is negligible compared to M_star, the star's velocity is v = sqrt( G M_star /a ), not M_p. \n\nWait, let me rederive this properly. \n\nThe star and planet orbit around their common center of mass. The star's velocity v is given by the two-body problem. \n\nThe gravitational force between them is F = G (M_p M_star)/a\u00b2 \n\nThe acceleration of the star is a = F / M_star = G M_p / (a\u00b2 M_star) * M_p? \n\nWait no: F = M_p * a_p = M_star * a_s \n\nWhere a_p is planet's acceleration, a_s is star's acceleration. \n\nThe acceleration of the star is a_s = F / M_star = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThe acceleration of the planet is a_p = F / M_p = G M_star / a\u00b2 \n\nThe star's velocity in circular orbit is v_s = sqrt( a_s * a ), where a is the orbital radius (distance between them). \n\nWait, the acceleration a_s = v_s\u00b2 / a \n\nThus, v_s = sqrt( a_s * a ) = sqrt( (G M_p / a\u00b2) * a ) = sqrt( G M_p /a )\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous conclusion. \n\nHmm, confusion here. Let me think again. \n\nThe star's acceleration towards the center is a_s = v_s\u00b2 / a \n\nBut also, a_s = G M_p / a\u00b2 \n\nThus,\n\nv_s\u00b2 / a = G M_p / a\u00b2 \u2192 v_s\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v_s = sqrt( G M_p /a )\n\nSo this is the same as before. \n\nBut when I considered the two-body problem, the velocity of the star is proportional to M_p. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the star's mass is given as 1.5 Msun, which is much larger than the planets' masses (7 and 5 Earth masses, which are ~0.023 and 0.016 Jupiter masses, which are way smaller than 1.5 Msun). \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity is v_s = sqrt( G M_p /a ), but since M_p is negligible compared to M_star, the formula holds. \n\nWait but then the previous approach would be correct, but in that case, the ratio of a2/a1 was 0.4018, leading to T ratio sqrt(0.4018)=0.63. \n\nBut then why did the other approach (using the two-body formula with star's mass) give a different result? \n\nAh! The confusion comes from whether the formula for K (the radial velocity) is dependent on the planet's mass or the star's mass. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the first derivation. \n\nThe correct formula for K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) is actually: \n\nK = (v_s) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) ? \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G / (2\u03c0) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) ) * (P^(2/3) )\n\nBut since P is the orbital period, which we don't have, perhaps we can relate it through Kepler's third law. \n\nLet me try again with the correct formula for K:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) \n\nBut using Kepler's third law: \n\nP\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) \n\nThus, P = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) )\n\nPlugging this into K's formula:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( ( sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G (M_p + M_star)) ) / (2\u03c0) )^(2/3) ) )\n\nThis is getting too complex. \n\nAlternatively, the formula can be simplified to:\n\nK = (v_s) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_star) a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the approximation where M_p << M_star. \n\nIf M_p is much smaller than M_star, then M_p + M_star \u2248 M_star. \n\nThus, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / ( M_star^2 a ) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) )\n\nBut using Kepler's third law for the planet's orbit:\n\nP\u00b2 a\u00b3 = (G (M_p + M_star))/(4\u03c0\u00b2) \u2248 (G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) \n\nThus, P \u2248 sqrt( (G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2) ) * (1/a^(3/2)) \n\nWait, perhaps substituting P into K's formula:\n\nLet me write P as:\n\nP = sqrt( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_star) ) \n\nThus, (P/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) = ( (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3/(G M_star))^(1/2) / (2\u03c0) ) )^(2/3) \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way when M_p << M_star. \n\nThe star's velocity v_s = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * v_p \u2248 (M_p/M_star) v_p \n\nWhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity. \n\nThe planet's orbital velocity v_p = sqrt( G M_star /a )\n\nThus, v_s \u2248 (M_p/M_star) * sqrt(G M_star/a ) = sqrt(G M_p M_star / (a M_star\u00b2 )) * M_p/M_star ?\n\nWait, no, better:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_star /a )\n\nv_s = (M_p/(M_p + M_star)) v_p \u2248 (M_p/M_star) v_p \n\nThus, v_s \u2248 (M_p / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star /a ) \n\n= sqrt( G M_p^2 M_star ) / ( M_star sqrt(a) ) \n\n= sqrt( G M_p^2 / ( M_star a ) )\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting me somewhere. \n\nThus, v_s = sqrt( G M_p^2 / ( M_star a ) ) \n\nWait, so v_s squared is G M_p\u00b2/(M_star a) \n\nThus, v_s = ( M_p / sqrt(M_star a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nBut then, the ratio of the velocities squared would be:\n\n(v_s1 / v_s2)^2 = ( (M_p1^2)/(M_star a1) ) / ( (M_p2^2)/(M_star a2) ) ) \n\n= (M_p1^2 a2 )/( M_p2^2 a1 )\n\nThus,\n\n(v_s1 / v_s2)^2 = (M_p1\u00b2/M_p2\u00b2) * (a2/a1 )\n\nRearranged,\n\na2/a1 = (v_s1/v_s2)^2 * (M_p2\u00b2/M_p1\u00b2 )\n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that v_s1/v_s2 is the ratio of their velocities (from Doppler shifts), which is 0.03/0.04 =0.75 \n\nThus,\n\na2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (5^2/7^2) \n\nWait, since M_p2 is 5 and M_p1 is 7. \n\nSo:\n\n(0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\n(5/7)^2 =25/49 \u22480.5102 \n\nMultiply them: 0.5625 *0.5102 \u22480.287 \n\nSo a2/a1 \u22480.287 \u2192 a1/a2\u22483.484 \n\nThen T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.287) \u22480.536 \n\nAh! That's approximately 0.54, which matches option C (0.53). \n\nSo this is the correct approach. \n\nThe mistake earlier was not considering that the star's velocity depends on both the planet's mass and the star's mass. \n\nSo the correct ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.287)\u22480.536, which rounds to 0.53 (option C). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital distance from the star. The key steps involve calculating the orbital distances using the radial velocity (RV) shifts caused by each planet.\n\n1. **Radial Velocity Relationship**: The RV semi-amplitude \\( K \\) (in velocity terms) for each planet is derived from the Doppler shift. The velocity \\( v \\) of the star due to the planet's gravity is given by:\n   \\[\n   v \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{M_p}{a}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( M_p \\) is the planet's mass and \\( a \\) is its orbital distance. However, considering the star's mass \\( M_{\\text{star}} \\), the correct relationship for the star's velocity \\( v_s \\) is:\n   \\[\n   v_s \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{M_p^2}{M_{\\text{star}} a}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Velocity Ratio**: Using the given Doppler shifts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{v_{s1}}{v_{s2}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\n   \\]\n   Squaring this ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{v_{s1}}{v_{s2}}\\right)^2 = 0.5625\n   \\]\n\n3. **Orbital Distance Ratio**: Using the proportionality:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{v_{s1}}{v_{s2}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting values (\\( M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\), \\( M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{\\text{Earth}} \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.5625 \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 = 0.5625 \\times 0.5102 \\approx 0.287\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The equilibrium temperature \\( T_{\\text{eq}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{0.287} \\approx 0.536\n   \\]\n\nThe closest option to \\( 0.536 \\) is **C) ~0.53**.\n\nAnswer: C",
