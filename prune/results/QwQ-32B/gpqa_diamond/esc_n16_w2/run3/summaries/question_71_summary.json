      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is about finding the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, given their orbital periods and assuming the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature relates to the planet's distance from the star, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the stellar flux it receives. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/4), where R is the radius of the star and a is the orbital distance. But since all the planets are around the same star, the star's parameters (like temperature and radius) would be the same for all. Also, since albedo is the same, that term cancels out in the ratio. \n\nWait, the key here is that the orbital periods are given. So using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period squared to the semi-major axis cubed. The formula is P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. Since the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can express each planet's period as multiples of the first one. \n\nLet me note down the given ratios. The periods are in the order 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, Planet_4 has 3.5 units. \n\nSo, using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of their distances a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nCalculating that: P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. Then 1.75 raised to the 2/3 power. Let me compute that. Let's see, 1.75^(1/3) is approximately cube root of 1.75. The cube of 1.2 is about 1.728, so cube root of 1.75 is roughly 1.2. So 1.2 squared is 1.44. Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Alternatively, 1.75^(2/3) is the same as (7/4)^(2/3). Not sure if that helps, but let's think numerically. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute 3.5/2 = 1.75. Then taking natural logarithm? Maybe overcomplicating. Let's see, 1.75^(2/3). Let me think of 1.75 as 7/4. (7/4)^(2/3) = (7^(2/3))/(4^(2/3)). 4^(2/3) is (2^2)^(2/3) = 2^(4/3) \u2248 2.5198. 7^(2/3) is approximately (7^(1/3))^2. The cube root of 7 is about 1.913, so squared is ~3.66. So 3.66 / 2.5198 \u2248 1.453. Hmm, so a4/a2 \u2248 1.453. \n\nBut since the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance (since flux is proportional to 1/a\u00b2, and temperature is proportional to (flux)^(1/4)), so the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Wait, let me get the exact relationship. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo)/4 )^(1/4) * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2). Since albedo is the same, and all other terms except a are same for both planets, the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4). Because the a is in the denominator under a square root (since (R/(2a))^(1/2) is part of the formula). \n\nSo T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nSince a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3), then a2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3). Therefore, sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait let me check again. Let me rederive it properly. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 \u2192 a \u221d P^(2/3). \n\nSo a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because the flux is proportional to 1/a\u00b2, and temperature is proportional to (flux)^(1/4). So flux F = L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2), and equilibrium temp T = [F(1 - albedo)/\u03c3]^(1/4), where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since L and \u03c3 are constants for the star, and albedo is same, so T \u221d (1/a\u00b2)^(1/4) = (1/a)^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). \n\nTherefore, T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [ (a2/a4) ]^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nSo substituting P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5. \n\nThus, the ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/3). Let's compute 2 divided by 3.5. That's 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo (4/7)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. \n\nThe cube root of 0.5714. Let me see. 0.8^3 is 0.512, which is less than 0.57. 0.83^3 is approx 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, *0.83 \u2248 0.5718. Oh, that's very close! \n\nSo (4/7) is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of that is approximately 0.83, since 0.83 cubed is ~0.57175. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. But wait, let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake in steps. \n\nWait, wait. Wait the formula again: T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\na2/a4 is (P2/P4)^(2/3). So (a2/a4)^(1/2) is (P2/P4)^( (2/3)*(1/2) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nYes, so (2/3.5)^(1/3). \n\nWait 2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7, so 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, as I said. So the ratio of temperatures (Planet4 / Planet2) would be ~0.83. \n\nLooking at the options: option C is 0.83. So that should be the answer. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the ratio. The question asks for Planet_4 over Planet_2. Since Planet_4 is farther out, it's colder, so the ratio should be less than 1. 0.83 is less than 1, which makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I miscalculated, maybe? Let me see:\n\nSuppose P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nThe ratio of their distances a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3). \n\nSo 3.5/2 is 1.75. 1.75^(2/3). \n\nLet me compute 1.75^(1/3) first. Let's approximate:\n\n1.75^(1/3). Let me note that 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approx 1.2 + a little. Let's say approximately 1.2007. \n\nThen (1.75^(1/3))^2 would be (1.2007)^2 \u2248 1.4417. \n\nThus a4/a2 \u2248 1.4417. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u2248 1/1.4417 \u2248 0.6934. \n\nThen T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.6934) \u2248 0.833. \n\nAh, that's the same as before. So that's about 0.83. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but the options have B as 0.69 and D as 0.75. Let me check again. \n\nWait, sqrt(0.6934) is sqrt(0.6934). Let me compute that numerically. \n\n0.83 squared is 0.6889. 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is close to 0.6934. So sqrt(0.6934) is about 0.833. So yes, 0.83. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nHmm. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip any ratios. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a. So T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is 1/sqrt(a2). \n\nThus T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought of the temperature ratio as (distance ratio)^(-1/2), so since a4 is bigger, T4 is smaller. \n\nTherefore, yes, the calculation is correct. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the problem is about finding the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets are part of a system where their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question mentions they're in orbital resonance, but I think that might not be directly relevant here since we're dealing with equilibrium temperatures. \n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Since all the planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq \u221d (L_sun / a^2)^(1/4), right? Wait, actually, the exact formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25. But since albedo is the same, the ratio would just depend on the distance from the star. \n\nWait, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (Teq) is given by the equation:\n\nTeq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut since all the planets are around the same star, T_star and R_star are constants. Also, the albedo is the same for all, so the (1 - albedo)^{1/4} term is also a constant for all. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would depend on the square root of 1/a, since a is the semi-major axis. \n\nAlternatively, another version of the formula might be written as:\n\nTeq \u221d ( (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) )^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nSince L (luminosity) and the constants are the same for all planets, and albedo is same, the key factor is (1/a\u00b2)^{1/4} = 1/a^{1/2}. So Teq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because Teq4 / Teq2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Wait, let me confirm:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nTeq1 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), since Teq \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So if I have two planets, Planet4 and Planet2, then their temperature ratio (T4/T2) would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nSo, the key here is to find the ratio of their orbital distances a2 and a4. \n\nBut how do we find the distances given the orbital periods? Oh right, Kepler's third law. For a planet orbiting a star, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. Since all these planets are around the same star, the proportionality constant is the same. So (P1)^2 / a1^3 = (P2)^2 / a2^3 = ... etc. \n\nGiven the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me note the planets as Planet_1 to Planet_5 with their periods P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 in the order given. \n\nWe need the ratio of a4 to a2. Let's let the orbital periods be in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me assign numerical values for simplicity. Let\u2019s say P1 is 1 unit, so then P2 is 2 units, P3 is 2.5, P4 is 3.5, and P5 is 5. \n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d a^3. So, for Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are P2 = 2 and P4 =3.5. \n\nSo, (P2)^2 / a2^3 = (P4)^2 / a4^3. \n\nWe can rearrange to find (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2. \n\nTherefore, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the values: P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So the ratio P4/P2 = 3.5 /2 = 1.75. \n\nThus, a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). \n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute numerically. \n\n1.75^(2/3). Let's see, 1.75 squared is 3.0625, then take the cube root? Wait no, the exponent is 2/3, so it's the same as (1.75^(1/3)) squared. \n\nAlternatively, natural logs. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3):\n\nTake natural log: ln(1.75) \u2248 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * (2/3) \u2248 0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452. \n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate 1.75^(2/3). Let me think of 1.75 as 7/4. Let me see, (7/4)^(2/3). Maybe 7^(2/3) /4^(2/3). \n\n7^(1/3) is about 1.913, so squared is ~3.66. 4^(1/3) is about 1.587, squared is ~2.5198. So 3.66 / 2.5198 \u2248 1.453. So same as before. So a4/a2 \u2248 1.453. \n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a4 is 1/1.453 \u2248 0.688. \n\nThen, going back to the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ). \n\nSo sqrt(0.688) \u2248 sqrt(0.688). Let's calculate that. \n\nsqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85, so sqrt(0.688) is between them. Let's compute 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is very close. So sqrt(0.688) is approximately 0.83. \n\nWait, wait. Let me check that again. If 0.83 squared is 0.6889, then sqrt(0.688) is about 0.83. \n\nWait, so the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.688) \u2248 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps. \n\nWe have the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet4 and Planet2. \n\nThe formula is T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5. \n\nWe found a4/a2 \u22481.453, so a2/a4 \u22480.688, so sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me confirm if I didn't mix up the planets. The question is Planet_4 and Planet_2. The orbital periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has period 2, Planet_4 has period 3.5. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nAnother way: the equilibrium temperature formula is often written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut since all the planets are around the same star, and albedo is same, the ratio between two planets would be:\n\n(T4 / T2) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )\n\nWhich is exactly what I used. \n\nAlternatively, another version of the formula uses the stellar luminosity:\n\nT_eq = ( (L/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ))^{1/4} ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nWhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So again, the dependence on a is 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio would be sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. The answer should be C, 0.83. \n\nWait, but let me check the exponent in Kepler's law again. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. \n\nSo (P2/P4)^2 = (a2^3)/(a4^3) \u2192 (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2 \u2192 a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nWait, that's another way to write it. So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nWait, that's the same as before. Let me compute that:\n\nP2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 \u22480.5714. \n\nTaking that to the 2/3 power. \n\nSo (0.5714)^(2/3). Let me compute that. \n\nLet me see, 0.5714 is approximately 4/7 (since 4/7 is ~0.5714). So (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^(1/3) )^2. \n\nAlternatively, natural logs: ln(0.5714) \u2248-0.56, multiplied by 2/3 gives -0.373. Exponentiate gives e^-0.373 \u22480.688, so same as before. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u22480.688, so sqrt of that is 0.83. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A:0.57, B:0.69, C:0.83, D:0.75. \n\nSo 0.83 is option C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, equilibrium temperature formula is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} times (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. Since L and albedo are same, then the ratio is (a2\u00b2 / a4\u00b2)^{1/4} ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's re-derive that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula comes from the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation. \n\nThe incoming power is L * (R_p\u00b2)/(4a\u00b2), where R_p is planet radius, but that might not matter here. Wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature is derived from the flux. \n\nThe flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). The planet absorbs (1 - albedo) of that flux, and radiates as a blackbody: F_absorbed = F * (1 - albedo). \n\nThe outgoing flux is \u03c3 T_eq^4. Since the planet radiates over its surface area (4\u03c0R_p\u00b2), and absorbs over its cross-section (\u03c0R_p\u00b2). So equating:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = (L/(4 \u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nRight: (L/(4 \u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = (L R_p\u00b2 (1 - albedo)) / (4 a\u00b2) )\n\nCancel \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n4 \u03c3 T^4 = (L (1 - albedo)) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2 / (4 \u03c3):\n\nWait, let's do the algebra step by step:\n\n4 \u03c3 T^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen, solving for T^4:\n\nT^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ) \n\nWait, no, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, perhaps better to write:\n\nAfter cancelling terms, the equation becomes:\n\n4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 = ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2 / (4 \u03c3):\n\nWait, sorry, maybe better to rearrange:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 )\n\nWait, actually, maybe I messed up the constants. Let me see another way. \n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut another way to write it is:\n\nT_eq = ( (L/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ))^{1/4} ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nYes, because L = 4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_star^4, so substituting that into the formula would give the first expression. \n\nIn any case, the key point is that T_eq is proportional to ( L / a\u00b2 )^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nSince L and (1 - albedo) are the same for both planets, the ratio of T_eq4 / T_eq2 is ( (a2\u00b2)/(a4\u00b2) )^{1/4} ) = (a2/a4)^{1/2} = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nSo my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the answer is C, 0.83. \n\nWait, but wait the options given include 0.75 which is D. Let me see if I miscalculated the exponent. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the a2/a4 ratio again. \n\nP2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nKepler's law: (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\nSo (3.5/2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\n3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. Squared is 3.0625. \n\nSo (a4/a2)^3 = 3.0625 \u2192 a4/a2 = cube root of 3.0625. \n\nCube root of 3.0625. Let's see: 1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.5^3=3.375. So 3.0625 is between those. \n\nLet me compute 1.45^3: 1.45 *1.45 = 2.1025, then *1.45 \u2192 2.1025 *1.45 \u2248 3.048. Close to 3.0625. \n\nSo cube root of 3.0625 \u22481.453. So a4/a2\u22481.453, so a2/a4\u22480.688. \n\nThen sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me think again: the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2\". So T4/T2 is 0.83, which would be option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted something. Let me check. \n\nIf a4 is larger than a2 (since 3.5 period is longer than 2, so by Kepler's law, it's farther away), so Planet4 is farther out. \n\nSince T_eq decreases with distance, T4 should be less than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is less than 1. The value we got is 0.83, which is less than 1, so that makes sense. \n\nLooking at the options, 0.83 is option C, so that must be correct. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the problem is about finding the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets are part of a system where their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question mentions they're in orbital resonance, but I think that might not be directly relevant here since we're dealing with equilibrium temperatures. \n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Since all the planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq \u221d (L_sun / a^2)^(1/4), right? Wait, actually, the exact formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25. But since albedo is the same, the ratio would just depend on the distance from the star. \n\nWait, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (Teq) is given by the equation:\n\nTeq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut since all the planets are around the same star, T_star and R_star are constants. Also, the albedo is the same for all, so the (1 - albedo)^{1/4} term is also a constant for all. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would depend on the square root of 1/a, since a is the semi-major axis. \n\nAlternatively, another version of the formula might be written as:\n\nTeq \u221d ( (L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2)) )^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nSince L (luminosity) and the constants are the same for all planets, and albedo is same, the key factor is (1/a\u00b2)^{1/4} = 1/a^{1/2}. So Teq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because Teq4 / Teq2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Wait, let me confirm:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nTeq1 / Teq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), since Teq \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So if I have two planets, Planet4 and Planet2, then their temperature ratio (T4/T2) would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nSo, the key here is to find the ratio of their orbital distances a2 and a4. \n\nBut how do we find the distances given the orbital periods? Oh right, Kepler's third law. For a planet orbiting a star, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. Since all these planets are around the same star, the proportionality constant is the same. So (P1)^2 / a1^3 = (P2)^2 / a2^3 = ... etc. \n\nGiven the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me note the planets as Planet_1 to Planet_5 with their periods P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 in the order given. \n\nWe need the ratio of a4 to a2. Let's let the orbital periods be in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me assign numerical values for simplicity. Let\u2019s say P1 is 1 unit, so then P2 is 2 units, P3 is 2.5, P4 is 3.5, and P5 is 5. \n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, P^2 \u221d a^3. So, for Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are P2 = 2 and P4 =3.5. \n\nSo, (P2)^2 / a2^3 = (P4)^2 / a4^3. \n\nWe can rearrange to find (a4/a2)^3 = (P4/P2)^2. \n\nTherefore, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the values: P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So the ratio P4/P2 = 3.5 /2 = 1.75. \n\nThus, a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). \n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute numerically. \n\n1.75^(2/3). Let's see, 1.75 squared is 3.0625, then take the cube root? Wait no, the exponent is 2/3, so it's the same as (1.75^(1/3)) squared. \n\nAlternatively, natural logs. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3):\n\nTake natural log: ln(1.75) \u2248 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * (2/3) \u2248 0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452. \n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate 1.75^(2/3). Let me think of 1.75 as 7/4. Let me see, (7/4)^(2/3). Maybe 7^(2/3) /4^(2/3). \n\n7^(1/3) is about 1.913, so squared is ~3.66. 4^(1/3) is about 1.587, squared is ~2.5198. So 3.66 / 2.5198 \u2248 1.453. So same as before. So a4/a2 \u2248 1.453. \n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a4 is 1/1.453 \u2248 0.688. \n\nThen, going back to the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ). \n\nSo sqrt(0.688) \u2248 sqrt(0.688). Let's calculate that. \n\nsqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85, so sqrt(0.688) is between them. Let's compute 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is very close. So sqrt(0.688) is approximately 0.83. \n\nWait, wait. Let me check that again. If 0.83 squared is 0.6889, then sqrt(0.688) is about 0.83. \n\nWait, so the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.688) \u2248 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps. \n\nWe have the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet4 and Planet2. \n\nThe formula is T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5. \n\nWe found a4/a2 \u22481.453, so a2/a4 \u22480.688, so sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me confirm if I didn't mix up the planets. The question is Planet_4 and Planet_2. The orbital periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has period 2, Planet_4 has period 3.5. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nAnother way: the equilibrium temperature formula is often written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut since all the planets are around the same star, and albedo is same, the ratio between two planets would be:\n\n(T4 / T2) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )\n\nWhich is exactly what I used. \n\nAlternatively, another version of the formula uses the stellar luminosity:\n\nT_eq = ( (L/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ))^{1/4} ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nWhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So again, the dependence on a is 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio would be sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. The answer should be C, 0.83. \n\nWait, but let me check the exponent in Kepler's law again. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. \n\nSo (P2/P4)^2 = (a2^3)/(a4^3) \u2192 (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2 \u2192 a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nWait, that's another way to write it. So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nWait, that's the same as before. Let me compute that:\n\nP2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 = 2/3.5 \u22480.5714. \n\nTaking that to the 2/3 power. \n\nSo (0.5714)^(2/3). Let me compute that. \n\nLet me see, 0.5714 is approximately 4/7 (since 4/7 is ~0.5714). So (4/7)^(2/3) = ( (4/7)^(1/3) )^2. \n\nAlternatively, natural logs: ln(0.5714) \u2248-0.56, multiplied by 2/3 gives -0.373. Exponentiate gives e^-0.373 \u22480.688, so same as before. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u22480.688, so sqrt of that is 0.83. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A:0.57, B:0.69, C:0.83, D:0.75. \n\nSo 0.83 is option C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, equilibrium temperature formula is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^{1/4} times (1 - albedo)^{1/4}. Since L and albedo are same, then the ratio is (a2\u00b2 / a4\u00b2)^{1/4} ?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's re-derive that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula comes from the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation. \n\nThe incoming power is L * (R_p\u00b2)/(4a\u00b2), where R_p is planet radius, but that might not matter here. Wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature is derived from the flux. \n\nThe flux from the star at distance a is F = L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). The planet absorbs (1 - albedo) of that flux, and radiates as a blackbody: F_absorbed = F * (1 - albedo). \n\nThe outgoing flux is \u03c3 T_eq^4. Since the planet radiates over its surface area (4\u03c0R_p\u00b2), and absorbs over its cross-section (\u03c0R_p\u00b2). So equating:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = (L/(4 \u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nRight: (L/(4 \u03c0 a\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = (L R_p\u00b2 (1 - albedo)) / (4 a\u00b2) )\n\nCancel \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n4 \u03c3 T^4 = (L (1 - albedo)) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2 / (4 \u03c3):\n\nWait, let's do the algebra step by step:\n\n4 \u03c3 T^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen, solving for T^4:\n\nT^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ) \n\nWait, no, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, perhaps better to write:\n\nAfter cancelling terms, the equation becomes:\n\n4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 = ( L (1 - albedo) ) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 a\u00b2 / (4 \u03c3):\n\nWait, sorry, maybe better to rearrange:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 )\n\nWait, actually, maybe I messed up the constants. Let me see another way. \n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nBut another way to write it is:\n\nT_eq = ( (L/(16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2 ))^{1/4} ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nYes, because L = 4 \u03c0 R_star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_star^4, so substituting that into the formula would give the first expression. \n\nIn any case, the key point is that T_eq is proportional to ( L / a\u00b2 )^{1/4} * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}\n\nSince L and (1 - albedo) are the same for both planets, the ratio of T_eq4 / T_eq2 is ( (a2\u00b2)/(a4\u00b2) )^{1/4} ) = (a2/a4)^{1/2} = sqrt(a2/a4). \n\nSo my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the answer is C, 0.83. \n\nWait, but wait the options given include 0.75 which is D. Let me see if I miscalculated the exponent. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the a2/a4 ratio again. \n\nP2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nKepler's law: (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\nSo (3.5/2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\n3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. Squared is 3.0625. \n\nSo (a4/a2)^3 = 3.0625 \u2192 a4/a2 = cube root of 3.0625. \n\nCube root of 3.0625. Let's see: 1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.5^3=3.375. So 3.0625 is between those. \n\nLet me compute 1.45^3: 1.45 *1.45 = 2.1025, then *1.45 \u2192 2.1025 *1.45 \u2248 3.048. Close to 3.0625. \n\nSo cube root of 3.0625 \u22481.453. So a4/a2\u22481.453, so a2/a4\u22480.688. \n\nThen sqrt(0.688) \u22480.83. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me think again: the question says \"the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2\". So T4/T2 is 0.83, which would be option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted something. Let me check. \n\nIf a4 is larger than a2 (since 3.5 period is longer than 2, so by Kepler's law, it's farther away), so Planet4 is farther out. \n\nSince T_eq decreases with distance, T4 should be less than T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is less than 1. The value we got is 0.83, which is less than 1, so that makes sense. \n\nLooking at the options, 0.83 is option C, so that must be correct. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \\( T_{\\text{eq}} \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\), where \\( a \\) is the orbital distance. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law (\\( P^2 \\propto a^3 \\)), we find the ratio of orbital distances \\( \\frac{a_4}{a_2} \\). Given the orbital periods \\( P_2 = 2 \\) and \\( P_4 = 3.5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_4}{a_2} \\right)^3 \\implies \\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx 1.453.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\approx 0.688 \\). The temperature ratio \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.688} \\approx 0.83.\n\\]\n\nThe correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
