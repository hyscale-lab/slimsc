      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details. \n\nThe problem is about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, they form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y under severe conditions gives the same hydrocarbon Z, which is part of Y and has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X. The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance is an alkene or alkyne, since they can undergo addition reactions with bromine. Since the problem mentions that mixture X consists of two liquids that do this, they are likely alkenes or alkynes. But since after heating with platinum (a catalyst for some reactions) they disproportionate into mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine, that suggests that the products of Y are saturated (maybe alkanes or something else that can't react with bromine via addition).\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you hydrogenate both X and Y, you get the same hydrocarbon Z. So, hydrogenation of X would require adding hydrogen across double or triple bonds, right? Similarly for Y, but since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, maybe Y's components are already saturated, so hydrogenating them would not change them? But the problem states that hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are not saturated but maybe have other functional groups, but that contradicts the decolorization part. Wait, no, the Y mixture doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y would not change them. But the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same Z. So Z must be the same as the products of hydrogenation of X and Y. So maybe Y contains Z and another saturated compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z? Wait, but the problem states that Z is a constituent of Y. So perhaps Y is a mixture of Z and another saturated compound, but when you hydrogenate Y, since they are already saturated, they don't change, so the product would still have both. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. That suggests that the other component in Y must hydrogenate to Z as well. Hmm, maybe the other component in Y is a different isomer that upon hydrogenation becomes Z? Wait, but hydrogenation usually reduces double bonds to single. So perhaps the components of Y are different alkanes that, when hydrogenated (but they are already alkanes) would stay the same. Unless the Y's components are something else. \n\nWait, maybe the original X mixture is a mixture of two different alkenes (since they decolorize bromine) that disproportionate when heated with platinum. Disproportionation in alkenes? Wait, disproportionation usually involves a reaction where the same substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some cases, maybe a diene reacting to form different products? Or perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, they form an alkane and another alkene? Or maybe form an alkane and another compound?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a metathesis reaction? But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids which decolorize bromine. The reaction with platinum when heated leads to Y, an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. Since decolorizing bromine implies unsaturation, Y's components must be saturated (no double or triple bonds), so they can't decolorize bromine. \n\nHydrogenation of X (the two alkenes/alkynes) would add hydrogen across their double/triple bonds to form the same Z. Hydrogenation of Y (the saturated compounds) would not change them, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, the two components of Y must both hydrogenate to Z. Since Z is already a constituent of Y, the other component must hydrogenate to Z. That suggests that one of the Y components is Z, and the other is a compound that hydrogenates to Z. Wait, but if Y is an equimolar mixture, then both components must hydrogenate to Z. Since Z is a constituent of Y, that implies that one of the components is Z, and the other is a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. But when you hydrogenate Y (which includes Z), the Z would not change, and the other component would become Z, so the total would be Z only. But since the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, that's possible. So Y must consist of Z and another compound that hydrogenates to Z. \n\nNow, the hydrogenation of X (the original unsaturated compounds) would turn both into Z. So each of the two components in X must hydrogenate to Z. Therefore, each component in X must be an unsaturated version of Z, such that adding H2 gives Z. So Z must be an alkane, since hydrogenation of alkenes/alkynes gives alkanes. Since Z is part of Y, which is the product of the disproportionation of X, perhaps the reaction of X (the two alkenes) leads to Z and another alkane. \n\nThe problem also mentions that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. So the two alkenes in X are not conjugated. \n\nNow, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me compute the molecular formula of Z. Let's let the formula of Z be CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane). The mass fraction of H is (2n+2)*1 / (12n + 2n+2) = 14.28%, which is 1/7 (since 14.28 is approximately 1/7, which is ~14.2857%). Let me set up the equation:\n\n(2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = 1/7\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n + 2):\n\n7*(2n + 2) = 14n + 2\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 Hmm, that gives 14 = 2, which is impossible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The molar mass is 12n + (2n+2) =14n +2. The mass of H is (2n+2) g/mol. So:\n\n(2n + 2) / (14n +2) = 1/7\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7*(2n+2) =1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 = 2 \u2192 Not possible. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe Z isn't an alkane? But hydrogenation of an alkene or alkyne would give an alkane. Wait, maybe I made an error in assuming Z is an alkane. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon. So it's a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Let me think of possible alkanes:\n\nFor example, methane: C1H4. Mass H: 4/(12+4)=4/16=25% \u2192 too high.\n\nEthane: C2H6 \u2192 H mass is 6/(30) = 20%.\n\nPropane: C3H8 \u2192 8/(44) \u2248 18.18%.\n\nButane: C4H10 \u2192 10/(58)\u224817.24%.\n\nPentane: C5H12 \u2192 12/(72)=16.67%.\n\nHexane: C6H14 \u219214/(86)= ~16.28%.\n\nWait, 14.28 is exactly 1/7. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the mass fraction is exactly 1/7. Let me set up the equation again. Let the formula be CnHm. Since it's a hydrocarbon, m is 2n+2 (if alkane), 2n (alkene), or 2n-2 (alkyne). But since Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, so an alkane. Wait, but the hydrogenation of Y gives Z, and Y's components are already saturated (since they don't decolorize bromine). Therefore, Z must be an alkane. So the problem with the equation must be a calculation mistake.\n\nWait let me recalculate the equation properly. Let me re-define variables:\n\nLet the molecular formula of Z be CnH2n+2 (alkane).\n\nMass of hydrogen: (2n +2)*1 = 2n+2.\n\nMolar mass: 12n + (2n+2) =14n +2.\n\nMass fraction H = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7.\n\nSo:\n\n(2n +2)/(14n +2) =1/7 \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n7*(2n +2) =1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 =2 \u2192 no solution. Hmm, that's impossible. So maybe Z isn't an alkane? But that contradicts the hydrogenation part. Unless Z is a cycloalkane? Wait, cycloalkanes are also saturated and would not react with bromine. Let me see.\n\nIf Z is a cycloalkane, the formula would be CnH2n. Let's try that. Then mass of H is 2n, molar mass 12n +2n =14n.\n\nSo mass fraction H = 2n/(14n) =1/7. Which is exactly 14.2857%. So that works! So Z must be a cycloalkane. \n\nAh! So that makes sense. So Z is a cycloalkane with formula CnH2n. Therefore, its hydrogen mass fraction is (2n)/(14n) =1/7. Perfect. So that must be the case. So Z is a cycloalkane. \n\nTherefore, when X (the two unsaturated compounds) are hydrogenated, they become Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane, that suggests that the original compounds in X must have been cycloalkenes (since adding hydrogen would close the ring?), but wait, cycloalkenes would become cycloalkanes upon hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the original compounds were alkenes that form cycloalkanes when hydrogenated? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, but the problem states that mixture X is treated with platinum and heated to form Y. Since platinum is a catalyst, perhaps the reaction is an isomerization or a metathesis? Alternatively, maybe the two alkenes undergo some kind of rearrangement. Wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation usually involves a substance acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in some reactions, a molecule might form two different products, one more oxidized and one more reduced. But in organic terms, perhaps a diene undergoing a reaction to form a cycloalkane and another alkene?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, one loses hydrogen (becomes more oxidized?) and the other gains? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dimerization? Like two alkenes combining? But the problem says the products are two different liquids, so that's probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, but the catalyst is platinum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that's a cycloaddition, leading to a cyclohexene or something. But the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nWait, since Y's components don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. So the reaction of X (two alkenes) with platinum under heat leads to two saturated compounds (Y). Since it's a disproportionation, the two alkenes must form two different products. \n\nWait, perhaps the two alkenes in X are the same? No, it says it's a mixture of two liquids. So they must be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each alkene in X undergoes a different reaction. Let me think of possible reactions. \n\nSuppose the two alkenes in X are both cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopropane and cyclobutane? No, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane ring, which is an alkane. Wait, no, cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring, which is a cyclopropane, but that's an alkane. Wait, no, wait: cyclopropane is an alkane, but cyclopropane is actually a cyclopropane, which is an alkane with three carbons in a ring. Wait, no, actually, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane, which is a cycloalkane. Wait, no, wait: maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, cycloalkanes are saturated. For example, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane ring with three carbons, each with single bonds. Wait, but that's actually a cyclopropane, which is a cycloalkane. Wait, but then cyclopropane would not decolorize bromine. Hmm, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes are linear alkenes. Suppose the two are, say, 1-pentene and 2-pentene. But how would they disproportionate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alkenes are such that when they react, one becomes a cycloalkane (Z) and the other becomes another saturated compound. Wait, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which upon hydrogenation both become Z. So one of them must be Z, and the other must be a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. Since Z is already part of Y, the other must be an unsaturated compound, but that contradicts the fact that Y doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, but if Y's components don't decolorize, they must be saturated. Therefore, the other component in Y must be a different saturated compound that hydrogenates to Z. Wait, but if it's saturated, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Therefore, that can't be. Therefore, the other component must also be Z? But then Y would be a pure substance, not a mixture. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components in Y are different alkanes, but when hydrogenated (even though they are alkanes), they still become Z. That would only be possible if both are Z, but again Y is a mixture. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since Z is a constituent of Y, and hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, the other component must be a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. Since Y's components don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. So the only way is that the other component is an alkane that is isomeric with Z? Wait, but alkanes don't hydrogenate further. Unless the other component is a cycloalkane? Wait, but cycloalkanes are also saturated. For example, suppose Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other component in Y is hexane (C6H14). Then hydrogenation of hexane wouldn't change it. So that wouldn't give only Z. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Z is an alkane, and the other component is an alkene? But that can't be because Y's components don't decolorize bromine. So that's not possible. \n\nWait, maybe the other component in Y is a different cycloalkane? Let's suppose Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component might be, say, cyclopentane? But hydrogenating cyclopentane would still be cyclopentane. So hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and cyclopentane) would just give both, which contradicts the problem's statement that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, the other component must hydrogenate to Z. \n\nWait a minute, perhaps the other component in Y is an alkene? But then Y would decolorize bromine. So that can't be. Therefore, this line of thinking might not be correct.\n\nLet me go back. Let's think of Z's formula. Since the mass fraction of H is 1/7, and Z is a cycloalkane (as we saw earlier), then:\n\nH mass fraction = 2n/(14n) =1/7, which is true for any n. So Z can be any cycloalkane. But the problem says that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkanes used as solvents are cyclohexane. Yes, cyclohexane is a common solvent. So maybe Z is cyclohexane. Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:\n\nC6H12. H is 12/(72 + 12?) Wait, wait, molecular formula is C6H12. Molar mass is (12*6)+(1*12)=72+12=84 g/mol. Hydrogen mass is 12 g/mol. So 12/84 = 1/7. Exactly 14.2857%. Perfect. So Z must be cyclohexane. \n\nSo Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nNow, the hydrogenation of X (the original mixture of two liquids) gives cyclohexane. Since hydrogenation of alkenes gives alkanes, but here it gives a cycloalkane. That suggests that the original alkenes in X are cycloalkenes. Because when you hydrogenate a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene), you get cyclohexane. \n\nSo the two liquids in X are cycloalkenes. Since they are equimolar and when treated with platinum and heated, they disproportionate into two other liquids (Y), which are saturated (so cyclohexane and another saturated compound). \n\nWait, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids which do not decolorize bromine. So Y must consist of cyclohexane (Z) and another saturated compound. Since the reaction is a disproportionation, perhaps the two cycloalkenes in X react to form cyclohexane and another cycloalkane? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes are different, and when they undergo a reaction (disproportionation), they form cyclohexane and another product. \n\nWait, let's think of specific examples. Suppose the two cycloalkenes in X are cyclopropane and cyclobutane? No, cyclopropane is an alkane. Wait, no, cyclopropane is actually a cyclopropane, which is an alkane. So that can't be. Wait, I think I'm getting confused between cyclopropane and cyclopropane's structure. Wait, cyclopropane is a three-membered ring of carbon atoms with single bonds. So it's a cycloalkane, so it doesn't have double bonds. So that can't be part of X, since X's components decolorize bromine. \n\nAh! The two components in X must be cycloalkenes. For example, cyclohexene and another cycloalkene. Wait, but cyclohexene is a cycloalkene (has a double bond in the ring). When you hydrogenate cyclohexene, you get cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, say cyclopentene. Let me see. But then, when they undergo disproportionation, maybe they form cyclohexane and another product. Wait, but the problem says that after the reaction with platinum and heating, you get Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe the two cycloalkenes (like cyclohexene and cyclopentene) undergo a reaction where they form cyclohexane and another product. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement where one loses a hydrogen and the other gains? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes undergo a Diels-Alder reaction, but that forms a six-membered ring. But that would be a cyclohexene, but then it would still have a double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes are undergoing an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, but the catalyst here is platinum. Hmm, maybe it's a metathesis reaction? For example, in a ring-opening metathesis polymerization, but that's more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two cycloalkenes are such that they form a cycloalkane and another cycloalkane. Let's suppose that the two components of X are both cyclopropane (but no, cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, not an alkene). Wait, maybe the two are cyclopropene (which is a three-membered ring with a double bond) and another cycloalkene, like cyclobutene. Let's see:\n\nCyclopropene is C3H4, and cyclobutene is C4H6. \n\nIf they disproportionate, maybe they form two different products. Let's see:\n\nSuppose when they react, cyclopropene becomes cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclobutene becomes cyclobutane (C4H8). But then, the products would be cyclopropane and cyclobutane. Then Y would be a mixture of those. But when hydrogenated, cyclopropane (already saturated) would stay, and cyclobutane would stay, so the product would be both. But the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are such that their reaction forms cyclohexane and another compound which hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Let me think. Suppose the two alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but that's linear. Wait, but the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So the alkenes can't have conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, the two alkenes could be cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, but let's think of another possibility. Let me think of the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. \n\nIf Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond (or triple?) that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose each of the two alkenes in X has a double bond. For example, if X contains two different cycloalkenes, each with one double bond. Let me think of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cycloalkene. \n\nWait, hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10) would give cyclohexane (C6H12). So that's one component. The other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So another cycloalkene with the same number of carbons but different structure? Like methylcyclopentene? Wait, but then the formula would be C6H11? No, wait, methylcyclopentene would be C6H10 (since cyclopentene is C5H8, adding a methyl would make C6H10). So if the two components in X are cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene (both C6H10), then their mixture would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. \n\nBut then, when X is treated with platinum and heated (disproportionation), they form Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's suppose that the reaction between cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene leads to cyclohexane and another product. Wait, but how? Maybe via a rearrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are the same? But the problem says it's a mixture of two liquids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are two different cycloalkenes with the same molecular formula but different structures (like cis and trans isomers?), but that might not lead to disproportionation. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the total hydrogens in X's two components. Since each of them hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12), each must have two fewer hydrogens (since adding H2 adds two H per double bond). So each has a double bond. \n\nLet me suppose each of the two components in X has one double bond. So each has formula CnH2n-2 (since alkene is CnH2n-2). The hydrogenation adds two H, so becomes CnH2n. Since Z is C6H12 (which is 2n=12 \u2192 n=6), so each component must be C6H10. \n\nTherefore, the two components in X are two different C6H10 cycloalkenes. \n\nThe total number of H in the two would be 10 +10 =20? But the options don't have 20. Hmm, the options are 16,18,22,12. Wait, maybe they are not both C6H10. Wait, maybe each has more than one double bond? But the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So if they have two double bonds, they must be isolated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are different. Let me think of the possible cycloalkenes with formula C6H10. The possible structures include cyclohexene, methylcyclopentene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but that has conjugated double bonds, which are not allowed). Wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So 1,3-cyclohexadiene would have conjugated double bonds, so that's excluded. So possible structures are cyclohexene (one double bond), methylcyclopentene (one double bond in the ring), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which would have non-conjugated double bonds?), but wait, cyclohexadiene with double bonds separated by a single bond would be non-conjugated. \n\nWait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is single. For non-conjugated dienes, like 1,4-cyclohexadiene, the double bonds are separated by two single bonds. Wait, actually, in a six-membered ring, 1,3 would be conjugated, 1,4 would be separated by one CH2 group. Wait, maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds but not conjugated? Let me think: \n\nIn cyclohexane, numbering the carbons 1-6, a 1,4 diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 4-5? Wait no, that would be 1,2 and 4,5? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 1,4 is two separate double bonds with a single bond between them. Wait, perhaps it's possible. \n\nWait, if there are two double bonds in the ring but not conjugated, like 1,3,5 would be conjugated, but 1,4 would have a single bond between them. Wait, maybe it's not possible in a six-membered ring to have two double bonds without being conjugated? Because in a six-membered ring, two double bonds would have to be either conjugated (like 1,3 and 3,5) or separated by one single bond. Hmm, perhaps 1,4 would actually be non-conjugated? \n\nWait, perhaps the two double bonds are on opposite sides. Let me think: if the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 4-5, then between them there's a single bond (positions 3 and 4?), so that might not be conjugated. Wait, perhaps in cyclohexane, a 1,4 diene would have the double bonds separated by a single bond, so they are not conjugated. So that would be allowed. \n\nSo, possible structures for the two components in X could be cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (but wait, that has two double bonds, so hydrogenating would add two H2 per molecule, leading to C6H12. So each of those would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. \n\nBut in that case, the two components would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Wait, but 1,4-cyclohexadiene would have two double bonds, so its formula would be C6H8. Hydrogenating it would add two H2 molecules (4 H atoms), leading to C6H12. So that's possible. However, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene would have two double bonds but not conjugated? Let me confirm: \n\nIn a six-membered ring, if the double bonds are at 1-2 and 4-5, then between the two double bonds there are single bonds (positions 3-4?), so they are not conjugated. So that would be allowed. \n\nThus, if X contains cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H in the two would be 10+8=18. Which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component is methylcyclopentene (which would be C6H10 as well). Then the total H would be 10+10=20, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the two are both cyclohexene and another cycloalkene with a different structure but same formula? Like cis and trans isomers? But that would still give total H as 20. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components have different numbers of carbons? Let me see. Suppose one is cyclopentene (C5H8) and another is something else. But then their hydrogenation would give cyclopentane (C5H10) and another, but Z is supposed to be cyclohexane, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C7H12? No, that would complicate things. \n\nWait, the problem says that when you hydrogenate both X and Y, you get the same Z. So Z must be the same for both. Since Z is cyclohexane, then the two components of X must be such that each hydrogenates to cyclohexane, so they must have the same number of carbons as cyclohexane (6 carbons). \n\nTherefore, the two components in X are two different C6H10 compounds (each with one double bond) or one with one and another with two double bonds (but non-conjugated). \n\nWait, if one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is a diene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H is 10+8=18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, the other component could be a different diene. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and another diene like methylcyclopentene (which is C6H10 again, so total H would be 20, but that's not an option). \n\nHmm, but 18 is an option (B). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C6H10, but different isomers (like different cycloalkenes with one double bond each). Then the total H would be 10+10=20, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are not both cycloalkenes but linear alkenes? For example, two different alkenes that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane? That would require that the alkenes are cyclohexene, but then again same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original alkenes are not cycloalkenes but linear alkenes that form a ring upon some reaction. Wait, but when hydrogenated, they must form cyclohexane, so the alkenes must be such that adding H2 gives cyclohexane. That would require that the alkene is cyclohexene. So I think the first possibility is the right way. \n\nSo if the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H is 18. So the answer is B)18. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component is a different diene. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the two components in X are two different dienes with two double bonds each, but non-conjugated. For example, 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene would have conjugated triple bonds (if triple?), but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds. Wait, but trienes would have more. Alternatively, two separate double bonds. \n\nWait, maybe the two components are both 1,4-cyclohexadiene (so two molecules of that?), but the problem states it's a mixture of two different liquids. So they must be different. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the two components are cyclohexene and another compound like 2-methylcyclopentene. Wait, 2-methylcyclopentene would have the formula C6H10. So again, total H would be 10+10=20. Not in options. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the two components in X are 1-hexene and 3-hexene? But those are linear alkenes. Hydrogenating them would give hexane, but the problem states Z is cyclohexane, so that doesn't fit. \n\nWait a second, maybe the original X's components are not cycloalkenes but linear alkenes that form cyclohexane upon some reaction? No, hydrogenation of linear alkenes would give linear alkanes. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction with platinum and heat causes cyclization? Like, for example, two alkenes undergo a Diels-Alder reaction to form a cyclohexene, but that would form a six-membered ring with a double bond. But then the product would still have a double bond. Wait, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes (like 1-pentene and another) undergo a reaction forming cyclohexane and another alkane. For instance, if two propene molecules combine to form cyclohexane and something else? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components of X are both butadiene? But that's conjugated. Wait, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So butadiene has conjugated double bonds, so that's excluded. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's recap:\n\n- Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n- The two components in X are unsaturated (alkenes/alkynes), which upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond (or triple?), such that adding H2 gives cyclohexane. \n\n- The two components of X disproportionate when heated with platinum to form Y, which contains cyclohexane (Z) and another saturated compound. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is that when you heat the two alkenes with platinum (a catalyst for hydrogenation?), but under different conditions. For example, maybe the reaction is an isomerization or rearrangement. \n\nWait, maybe the two alkenes in X are cis and trans isomers of cyclohexene. But they would hydrogenate to the same product. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are such that when they react, they form cyclohexane and another alkane. For example, suppose the two alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but that would give hexane, not cyclohexane. \n\nWait, maybe the two components in X are two different cyclopropanes? No, cyclopropane is a cycloalkane. \n\nAlternatively, the two components are cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, like cyclopentene (C5H8). But then hydrogenating cyclopentene would give cyclopentane (C5H10), which is not Z (which is C6H12). So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Since the problem states that the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X is one of the options, let me see what the options are. The options are 16,18,22,12. \n\nIf the two components are both C6H10 (cyclohexene and another C6H10 isomer), total H is 20. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if one is C5H8 (cyclopentadiene?), but that would need another component. Wait, cyclopentadiene has a double bond. Hydrogenation would give cyclopentane (C5H10). Not Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components in X are both C7H12? No. \n\nWait, maybe the two components are 1,3-pentadiene and something else? But that has conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are both C6H12 but with double bonds? No, C6H12 is cyclohexane, which is saturated. \n\nWait, perhaps the two components are both C6H10, but each has one double bond, so total H is 10+10=20. Not an option. So this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound like 1-hexene (C6H12?), wait no. 1-hexene is C6H12? No, hexene is C6H12? Wait, hexene is C6H12? No. Wait, hexane is C6H14. Hexene is C6H12. Oh right! Hexene has the formula C6H12. Wait, wait a minute! Wait, alkene formula is CnH2n. So hexene is C6H12. Wait, that's right. So if the two components in X are two different alkenes with the formula C6H12, then hydrogenating them would give hexane (C6H14), but the problem states that Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which would be cyclohexane. So that contradicts. \n\nWait, this is a key point. Let me recalculate Z's possible formula again. \n\nEarlier, I assumed Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). But if the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives Z, and if X's components are alkenes (like hexene), then their hydrogenation would give hexane (C6H14), which would have a different H mass fraction. \n\nLet me recalculate Z's formula correctly. \n\nThe problem states that Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me recompute using alkane formula. Suppose Z is an alkane: CnH2n+2. \n\nThen:\n\nHydrogen mass fraction = (2n+2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7 \n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7(2n+2) = 14n + 2 \n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \n\nWhich gives 14=2, which is impossible. \n\nSo Z cannot be an alkane. Therefore, it must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n). Then, mass fraction is (2n)/(14n) =1/7, which is true for any n. So Z can be any cycloalkane. \n\nThe problem says that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nSo, the components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each must be a cycloalkene (since adding H2 to cycloalkene gives cycloalkane). \n\nThus, each component in X is a cycloalkene with formula CnH2n-2. When hydrogenated, they become CnH2n. Since Z is C6H12, n=6. So each component in X must be C6H10 (since 2n-2=10 when n=6). \n\nTherefore, each component in X is a cyclohexene (or another cyclohexene isomer). Since it's a mixture of two different liquids, they must be different isomers. \n\nThe total number of H in the two components would be 10 +10 =20. But this is not among the options. Wait, the options are 16,18,22,12. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the two components are not both C6H10. Maybe one has two double bonds (but non-conjugated), so it's C6H8. \n\nFor example, if one component is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then total H is 10+8=18 (option B). \n\nThis would satisfy the conditions:\n\n- Both are cycloalkenes with no conjugated double bonds (the 1,4 diene has non-conjugated double bonds).\n\n- Hydrogenation of each would give cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\n- When heated with platinum, they undergo disproportionation to form Y. The reaction could be such that one loses a double bond (becoming cyclohexane) and the other loses two double bonds (but how? Or perhaps they rearrange. \n\nWait, if you have cyclohexene (one double bond) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (two double bonds), maybe they react to form two products. Perhaps the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses a double bond to become cyclohexene, but that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a rearrangement where the two alkenes form cyclohexane and another saturated compound. For instance, if the two alkenes undergo a reaction where one becomes cyclohexane and the other becomes another alkane. But the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe the reaction is that each molecule of X's components reacts to form one molecule of Z (cyclohexane) and another product. \n\nWait, but since it's an equimolar mixture, maybe the two components in X react in a 1:1 ratio to form two products in 1:1 ratio. \n\nSuppose each cyclohexene molecule and each 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule undergoes a reaction that produces one cyclohexane and another product. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction could be a dimerization, but that would form a larger molecule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two H2 molecules to form cyclohexane, and the cyclohexene loses one H2 to form cyclohexane, but that would just give cyclohexane as the only product, not a mixture. \n\nHmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is only asking for the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X, so perhaps I can proceed with the calculation even if I'm unsure about the reaction mechanism. \n\nIf the two components are C6H10 and C6H8, then total H is 18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C6H10 (like two different cyclohexene isomers, such as cis and trans), giving total H of 20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the other possibility is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are both C5H8 (cyclopentadiene?), but then hydrogenating them would give cyclopentane (C5H10). Not Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are 1,2-cyclohexadiene and another? Wait, but that would have conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds), but the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds. So that's excluded. \n\nHmm. The only way to get an answer in the options is 18. So I'll go with that. \n\nThus, the answer should be B)18.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which decolorize bromine water and disproportionate into mixture Y upon heating with platinum. Hydrogenation of both mixtures yields hydrocarbon Z, a solvent with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. \n\n1. **Identifying Z**: The hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7 indicates Z is a cycloalkane (C\u2099H\u2082\u2099). Since Z is a common solvent, it is likely cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082), which fits the mass fraction calculation.\n   \n2. **Composition of X**: The two liquids in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Thus, they are cycloalkenes (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080 each) or a combination allowing this. However, considering no conjugated double bonds, one possibility is cyclohexene (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C\u2086H\u2088), which has non-conjugated double bonds. \n\n3. **Total Hydrogen Calculation**: \n   - Cyclohexene (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080) contributes 10 H atoms.\n   - 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C\u2086H\u2088) contributes 8 H atoms.\n   - Total H = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis matches option B. \n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details. \n\nThe problem is about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, they form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y under severe conditions gives the same hydrocarbon Z, which is part of Y and has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X. The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance is an alkene or alkyne, since they can undergo addition reactions with bromine. Since the problem mentions that mixture X consists of two liquids that do this, they are likely alkenes or alkynes. But since after heating with platinum (a catalyst for some reactions) they disproportionate into mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine, that suggests that the products of Y are saturated (maybe alkanes or something else that can't react with bromine via addition).\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you hydrogenate both X and Y, you get the same hydrocarbon Z. So, hydrogenation of X would require adding hydrogen across double or triple bonds, right? Similarly for Y, but since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, maybe Y's components are already saturated, so hydrogenating them would not change them? But the problem states that hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are not saturated but maybe have other functional groups, but that contradicts the decolorization part. Wait, no, the Y mixture doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y would not change them. But the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same Z. So Z must be the same as the products of hydrogenation of X and Y. So maybe Y contains Z and another saturated compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z? Wait, but the problem states that Z is a constituent of Y. So perhaps Y is a mixture of Z and another saturated compound, but when you hydrogenate Y, since they are already saturated, they don't change, so the product would still have both. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. That suggests that the other component in Y must hydrogenate to Z as well. Hmm, maybe the other component in Y is a different isomer that upon hydrogenation becomes Z? Wait, but hydrogenation usually reduces double bonds to single. So perhaps the components of Y are different alkanes that, when hydrogenated (but they are already alkanes) would stay the same. Unless the Y's components are something else. \n\nWait, maybe the original X mixture is a mixture of two different alkenes (since they decolorize bromine) that disproportionate when heated with platinum. Disproportionation in alkenes? Wait, disproportionation usually involves a reaction where the same substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some cases, maybe a diene reacting to form different products? Or perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, they form an alkane and another alkene? Or maybe form an alkane and another compound?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a metathesis reaction? But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids which decolorize bromine. The reaction with platinum when heated leads to Y, an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. Since decolorizing bromine implies unsaturation, Y's components must be saturated (no double or triple bonds), so they can't decolorize bromine. \n\nHydrogenation of X (the two alkenes/alkynes) would add hydrogen across their double/triple bonds to form the same Z. Hydrogenation of Y (the saturated compounds) would not change them, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, the two components of Y must both hydrogenate to Z. Since Z is already a constituent of Y, the other component must hydrogenate to Z. That suggests that one of the Y components is Z, and the other is a compound that hydrogenates to Z. Wait, but if Y is an equimolar mixture, then both components must hydrogenate to Z. Since Z is a constituent of Y, that implies that one of the components is Z, and the other is a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. But when you hydrogenate Y (which includes Z), the Z would not change, and the other component would become Z, so the total would be Z only. But since the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, that's possible. So Y must consist of Z and another compound that hydrogenates to Z. \n\nNow, the hydrogenation of X (the original unsaturated compounds) would turn both into Z. So each of the two components in X must hydrogenate to Z. Therefore, each component in X must be an unsaturated version of Z, such that adding H2 gives Z. So Z must be an alkane, since hydrogenation of alkenes/alkynes gives alkanes. Since Z is part of Y, which is the product of the disproportionation of X, perhaps the reaction of X (the two alkenes) leads to Z and another alkane. \n\nThe problem also mentions that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. So the two alkenes in X are not conjugated. \n\nNow, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me compute the molecular formula of Z. Let's let the formula of Z be CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane). The mass fraction of H is (2n+2)*1 / (12n + 2n+2) = 14.28%, which is 1/7 (since 14.28 is approximately 1/7, which is ~14.2857%). Let me set up the equation:\n\n(2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = 1/7\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n + 2):\n\n7*(2n + 2) = 14n + 2\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 Hmm, that gives 14 = 2, which is impossible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. The molar mass is 12n + (2n+2) =14n +2. The mass of H is (2n+2) g/mol. So:\n\n(2n + 2) / (14n +2) = 1/7\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7*(2n+2) =1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 = 2 \u2192 Not possible. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe Z isn't an alkane? But hydrogenation of an alkene or alkyne would give an alkane. Wait, maybe I made an error in assuming Z is an alkane. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon. So it's a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Let me think of possible alkanes:\n\nFor example, methane: C1H4. Mass H: 4/(12+4)=4/16=25% \u2192 too high.\n\nEthane: C2H6 \u2192 H mass is 6/(30) = 20%.\n\nPropane: C3H8 \u2192 8/(44) \u2248 18.18%.\n\nButane: C4H10 \u2192 10/(58)\u224817.24%.\n\nPentane: C5H12 \u2192 12/(72)=16.67%.\n\nHexane: C6H14 \u219214/(86)= ~16.28%.\n\nWait, 14.28 is exactly 1/7. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the mass fraction is exactly 1/7. Let me set up the equation again. Let the formula be CnHm. Since it's a hydrocarbon, m is 2n+2 (if alkane), 2n (alkene), or 2n-2 (alkyne). But since Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be saturated, so an alkane. Wait, but the hydrogenation of Y gives Z, and Y's components are already saturated (since they don't decolorize bromine). Therefore, Z must be an alkane. So the problem with the equation must be a calculation mistake.\n\nWait let me recalculate the equation properly. Let me re-define variables:\n\nLet the molecular formula of Z be CnH2n+2 (alkane).\n\nMass of hydrogen: (2n +2)*1 = 2n+2.\n\nMolar mass: 12n + (2n+2) =14n +2.\n\nMass fraction H = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7.\n\nSo:\n\n(2n +2)/(14n +2) =1/7 \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n7*(2n +2) =1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 =2 \u2192 no solution. Hmm, that's impossible. So maybe Z isn't an alkane? But that contradicts the hydrogenation part. Unless Z is a cycloalkane? Wait, cycloalkanes are also saturated and would not react with bromine. Let me see.\n\nIf Z is a cycloalkane, the formula would be CnH2n. Let's try that. Then mass of H is 2n, molar mass 12n +2n =14n.\n\nSo mass fraction H = 2n/(14n) =1/7. Which is exactly 14.2857%. So that works! So Z must be a cycloalkane. \n\nAh! So that makes sense. So Z is a cycloalkane with formula CnH2n. Therefore, its hydrogen mass fraction is (2n)/(14n) =1/7. Perfect. So that must be the case. So Z is a cycloalkane. \n\nTherefore, when X (the two unsaturated compounds) are hydrogenated, they become Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane, that suggests that the original compounds in X must have been cycloalkenes (since adding hydrogen would close the ring?), but wait, cycloalkenes would become cycloalkanes upon hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the original compounds were alkenes that form cycloalkanes when hydrogenated? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, but the problem states that mixture X is treated with platinum and heated to form Y. Since platinum is a catalyst, perhaps the reaction is an isomerization or a metathesis? Alternatively, maybe the two alkenes undergo some kind of rearrangement. Wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation usually involves a substance acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in some reactions, a molecule might form two different products, one more oxidized and one more reduced. But in organic terms, perhaps a diene undergoing a reaction to form a cycloalkane and another alkene?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, one loses hydrogen (becomes more oxidized?) and the other gains? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dimerization? Like two alkenes combining? But the problem says the products are two different liquids, so that's probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, but the catalyst is platinum. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that's a cycloaddition, leading to a cyclohexene or something. But the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nWait, since Y's components don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. So the reaction of X (two alkenes) with platinum under heat leads to two saturated compounds (Y). Since it's a disproportionation, the two alkenes must form two different products. \n\nWait, perhaps the two alkenes in X are the same? No, it says it's a mixture of two liquids. So they must be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each alkene in X undergoes a different reaction. Let me think of possible reactions. \n\nSuppose the two alkenes in X are both cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopropane and cyclobutane? No, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane ring, which is an alkane. Wait, no, cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring, which is a cyclopropane, but that's an alkane. Wait, no, wait: cyclopropane is an alkane, but cyclopropane is actually a cyclopropane, which is an alkane with three carbons in a ring. Wait, no, actually, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane, which is a cycloalkane. Wait, no, wait: maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, cycloalkanes are saturated. For example, cyclopropane is a cyclopropane ring with three carbons, each with single bonds. Wait, but that's actually a cyclopropane, which is a cycloalkane. Wait, but then cyclopropane would not decolorize bromine. Hmm, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes are linear alkenes. Suppose the two are, say, 1-pentene and 2-pentene. But how would they disproportionate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alkenes are such that when they react, one becomes a cycloalkane (Z) and the other becomes another saturated compound. Wait, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which upon hydrogenation both become Z. So one of them must be Z, and the other must be a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. Since Z is already part of Y, the other must be an unsaturated compound, but that contradicts the fact that Y doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, but if Y's components don't decolorize, they must be saturated. Therefore, the other component in Y must be a different saturated compound that hydrogenates to Z. Wait, but if it's saturated, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. Therefore, that can't be. Therefore, the other component must also be Z? But then Y would be a pure substance, not a mixture. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components in Y are different alkanes, but when hydrogenated (even though they are alkanes), they still become Z. That would only be possible if both are Z, but again Y is a mixture. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since Z is a constituent of Y, and hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, the other component must be a compound that when hydrogenated becomes Z. Since Y's components don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. So the only way is that the other component is an alkane that is isomeric with Z? Wait, but alkanes don't hydrogenate further. Unless the other component is a cycloalkane? Wait, but cycloalkanes are also saturated. For example, suppose Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other component in Y is hexane (C6H14). Then hydrogenation of hexane wouldn't change it. So that wouldn't give only Z. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Z is an alkane, and the other component is an alkene? But that can't be because Y's components don't decolorize bromine. So that's not possible. \n\nWait, maybe the other component in Y is a different cycloalkane? Let's suppose Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). The other component might be, say, cyclopentane? But hydrogenating cyclopentane would still be cyclopentane. So hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and cyclopentane) would just give both, which contradicts the problem's statement that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. Therefore, the other component must hydrogenate to Z. \n\nWait a minute, perhaps the other component in Y is an alkene? But then Y would decolorize bromine. So that can't be. Therefore, this line of thinking might not be correct.\n\nLet me go back. Let's think of Z's formula. Since the mass fraction of H is 1/7, and Z is a cycloalkane (as we saw earlier), then:\n\nH mass fraction = 2n/(14n) =1/7, which is true for any n. So Z can be any cycloalkane. But the problem says that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkanes used as solvents are cyclohexane. Yes, cyclohexane is a common solvent. So maybe Z is cyclohexane. Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane:\n\nC6H12. H is 12/(72 + 12?) Wait, wait, molecular formula is C6H12. Molar mass is (12*6)+(1*12)=72+12=84 g/mol. Hydrogen mass is 12 g/mol. So 12/84 = 1/7. Exactly 14.2857%. Perfect. So Z must be cyclohexane. \n\nSo Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nNow, the hydrogenation of X (the original mixture of two liquids) gives cyclohexane. Since hydrogenation of alkenes gives alkanes, but here it gives a cycloalkane. That suggests that the original alkenes in X are cycloalkenes. Because when you hydrogenate a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene), you get cyclohexane. \n\nSo the two liquids in X are cycloalkenes. Since they are equimolar and when treated with platinum and heated, they disproportionate into two other liquids (Y), which are saturated (so cyclohexane and another saturated compound). \n\nWait, but the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids which do not decolorize bromine. So Y must consist of cyclohexane (Z) and another saturated compound. Since the reaction is a disproportionation, perhaps the two cycloalkenes in X react to form cyclohexane and another cycloalkane? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes are different, and when they undergo a reaction (disproportionation), they form cyclohexane and another product. \n\nWait, let's think of specific examples. Suppose the two cycloalkenes in X are cyclopropane and cyclobutane? No, cyclopropane is an alkane. Wait, no, cyclopropane is actually a cyclopropane, which is an alkane. So that can't be. Wait, I think I'm getting confused between cyclopropane and cyclopropane's structure. Wait, cyclopropane is a three-membered ring of carbon atoms with single bonds. So it's a cycloalkane, so it doesn't have double bonds. So that can't be part of X, since X's components decolorize bromine. \n\nAh! The two components in X must be cycloalkenes. For example, cyclohexene and another cycloalkene. Wait, but cyclohexene is a cycloalkene (has a double bond in the ring). When you hydrogenate cyclohexene, you get cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, say cyclopentene. Let me see. But then, when they undergo disproportionation, maybe they form cyclohexane and another product. Wait, but the problem says that after the reaction with platinum and heating, you get Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe the two cycloalkenes (like cyclohexene and cyclopentene) undergo a reaction where they form cyclohexane and another product. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement where one loses a hydrogen and the other gains? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes undergo a Diels-Alder reaction, but that forms a six-membered ring. But that would be a cyclohexene, but then it would still have a double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two cycloalkenes are undergoing an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, but the catalyst here is platinum. Hmm, maybe it's a metathesis reaction? For example, in a ring-opening metathesis polymerization, but that's more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two cycloalkenes are such that they form a cycloalkane and another cycloalkane. Let's suppose that the two components of X are both cyclopropane (but no, cyclopropane is a cycloalkane, not an alkene). Wait, maybe the two are cyclopropene (which is a three-membered ring with a double bond) and another cycloalkene, like cyclobutene. Let's see:\n\nCyclopropene is C3H4, and cyclobutene is C4H6. \n\nIf they disproportionate, maybe they form two different products. Let's see:\n\nSuppose when they react, cyclopropene becomes cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclobutene becomes cyclobutane (C4H8). But then, the products would be cyclopropane and cyclobutane. Then Y would be a mixture of those. But when hydrogenated, cyclopropane (already saturated) would stay, and cyclobutane would stay, so the product would be both. But the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are such that their reaction forms cyclohexane and another compound which hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Let me think. Suppose the two alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but that's linear. Wait, but the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So the alkenes can't have conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, the two alkenes could be cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, but let's think of another possibility. Let me think of the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. \n\nIf Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond (or triple?) that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose each of the two alkenes in X has a double bond. For example, if X contains two different cycloalkenes, each with one double bond. Let me think of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cycloalkene. \n\nWait, hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C6H10) would give cyclohexane (C6H12). So that's one component. The other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So another cycloalkene with the same number of carbons but different structure? Like methylcyclopentene? Wait, but then the formula would be C6H11? No, wait, methylcyclopentene would be C6H10 (since cyclopentene is C5H8, adding a methyl would make C6H10). So if the two components in X are cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene (both C6H10), then their mixture would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. \n\nBut then, when X is treated with platinum and heated (disproportionation), they form Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's suppose that the reaction between cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene leads to cyclohexane and another product. Wait, but how? Maybe via a rearrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are the same? But the problem says it's a mixture of two liquids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are two different cycloalkenes with the same molecular formula but different structures (like cis and trans isomers?), but that might not lead to disproportionation. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the total hydrogens in X's two components. Since each of them hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H12), each must have two fewer hydrogens (since adding H2 adds two H per double bond). So each has a double bond. \n\nLet me suppose each of the two components in X has one double bond. So each has formula CnH2n-2 (since alkene is CnH2n-2). The hydrogenation adds two H, so becomes CnH2n. Since Z is C6H12 (which is 2n=12 \u2192 n=6), so each component must be C6H10. \n\nTherefore, the two components in X are two different C6H10 cycloalkenes. \n\nThe total number of H in the two would be 10 +10 =20? But the options don't have 20. Hmm, the options are 16,18,22,12. Wait, maybe they are not both C6H10. Wait, maybe each has more than one double bond? But the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So if they have two double bonds, they must be isolated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are different. Let me think of the possible cycloalkenes with formula C6H10. The possible structures include cyclohexene, methylcyclopentene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but that has conjugated double bonds, which are not allowed). Wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So 1,3-cyclohexadiene would have conjugated double bonds, so that's excluded. So possible structures are cyclohexene (one double bond), methylcyclopentene (one double bond in the ring), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which would have non-conjugated double bonds?), but wait, cyclohexadiene with double bonds separated by a single bond would be non-conjugated. \n\nWait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is single. For non-conjugated dienes, like 1,4-cyclohexadiene, the double bonds are separated by two single bonds. Wait, actually, in a six-membered ring, 1,3 would be conjugated, 1,4 would be separated by one CH2 group. Wait, maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds but not conjugated? Let me think: \n\nIn cyclohexane, numbering the carbons 1-6, a 1,4 diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 4-5? Wait no, that would be 1,2 and 4,5? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 1,4 is two separate double bonds with a single bond between them. Wait, perhaps it's possible. \n\nWait, if there are two double bonds in the ring but not conjugated, like 1,3,5 would be conjugated, but 1,4 would have a single bond between them. Wait, maybe it's not possible in a six-membered ring to have two double bonds without being conjugated? Because in a six-membered ring, two double bonds would have to be either conjugated (like 1,3 and 3,5) or separated by one single bond. Hmm, perhaps 1,4 would actually be non-conjugated? \n\nWait, perhaps the two double bonds are on opposite sides. Let me think: if the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 4-5, then between them there's a single bond (positions 3 and 4?), so that might not be conjugated. Wait, perhaps in cyclohexane, a 1,4 diene would have the double bonds separated by a single bond, so they are not conjugated. So that would be allowed. \n\nSo, possible structures for the two components in X could be cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (but wait, that has two double bonds, so hydrogenating would add two H2 per molecule, leading to C6H12. So each of those would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. \n\nBut in that case, the two components would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Wait, but 1,4-cyclohexadiene would have two double bonds, so its formula would be C6H8. Hydrogenating it would add two H2 molecules (4 H atoms), leading to C6H12. So that's possible. However, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. The 1,4-cyclohexadiene would have two double bonds but not conjugated? Let me confirm: \n\nIn a six-membered ring, if the double bonds are at 1-2 and 4-5, then between the two double bonds there are single bonds (positions 3-4?), so they are not conjugated. So that would be allowed. \n\nThus, if X contains cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H in the two would be 10+8=18. Which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component is methylcyclopentene (which would be C6H10 as well). Then the total H would be 10+10=20, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the two are both cyclohexene and another cycloalkene with a different structure but same formula? Like cis and trans isomers? But that would still give total H as 20. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components have different numbers of carbons? Let me see. Suppose one is cyclopentene (C5H8) and another is something else. But then their hydrogenation would give cyclopentane (C5H10) and another, but Z is supposed to be cyclohexane, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C7H12? No, that would complicate things. \n\nWait, the problem says that when you hydrogenate both X and Y, you get the same Z. So Z must be the same for both. Since Z is cyclohexane, then the two components of X must be such that each hydrogenates to cyclohexane, so they must have the same number of carbons as cyclohexane (6 carbons). \n\nTherefore, the two components in X are two different C6H10 compounds (each with one double bond) or one with one and another with two double bonds (but non-conjugated). \n\nWait, if one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is a diene like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H is 10+8=18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, the other component could be a different diene. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and another diene like methylcyclopentene (which is C6H10 again, so total H would be 20, but that's not an option). \n\nHmm, but 18 is an option (B). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C6H10, but different isomers (like different cycloalkenes with one double bond each). Then the total H would be 10+10=20, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are not both cycloalkenes but linear alkenes? For example, two different alkenes that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane? That would require that the alkenes are cyclohexene, but then again same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original alkenes are not cycloalkenes but linear alkenes that form a ring upon some reaction. Wait, but when hydrogenated, they must form cyclohexane, so the alkenes must be such that adding H2 gives cyclohexane. That would require that the alkene is cyclohexene. So I think the first possibility is the right way. \n\nSo if the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then the total H is 18. So the answer is B)18. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component is a different diene. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the two components in X are two different dienes with two double bonds each, but non-conjugated. For example, 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene would have conjugated triple bonds (if triple?), but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds. Wait, but trienes would have more. Alternatively, two separate double bonds. \n\nWait, maybe the two components are both 1,4-cyclohexadiene (so two molecules of that?), but the problem states it's a mixture of two different liquids. So they must be different. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the two components are cyclohexene and another compound like 2-methylcyclopentene. Wait, 2-methylcyclopentene would have the formula C6H10. So again, total H would be 10+10=20. Not in options. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the two components in X are 1-hexene and 3-hexene? But those are linear alkenes. Hydrogenating them would give hexane, but the problem states Z is cyclohexane, so that doesn't fit. \n\nWait a second, maybe the original X's components are not cycloalkenes but linear alkenes that form cyclohexane upon some reaction? No, hydrogenation of linear alkenes would give linear alkanes. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction with platinum and heat causes cyclization? Like, for example, two alkenes undergo a Diels-Alder reaction to form a cyclohexene, but that would form a six-membered ring with a double bond. But then the product would still have a double bond. Wait, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes (like 1-pentene and another) undergo a reaction forming cyclohexane and another alkane. For instance, if two propene molecules combine to form cyclohexane and something else? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components of X are both butadiene? But that's conjugated. Wait, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So butadiene has conjugated double bonds, so that's excluded. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's recap:\n\n- Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n- The two components in X are unsaturated (alkenes/alkynes), which upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond (or triple?), such that adding H2 gives cyclohexane. \n\n- The two components of X disproportionate when heated with platinum to form Y, which contains cyclohexane (Z) and another saturated compound. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is that when you heat the two alkenes with platinum (a catalyst for hydrogenation?), but under different conditions. For example, maybe the reaction is an isomerization or rearrangement. \n\nWait, maybe the two alkenes in X are cis and trans isomers of cyclohexene. But they would hydrogenate to the same product. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are such that when they react, they form cyclohexane and another alkane. For example, suppose the two alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but that would give hexane, not cyclohexane. \n\nWait, maybe the two components in X are two different cyclopropanes? No, cyclopropane is a cycloalkane. \n\nAlternatively, the two components are cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, like cyclopentene (C5H8). But then hydrogenating cyclopentene would give cyclopentane (C5H10), which is not Z (which is C6H12). So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Since the problem states that the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X is one of the options, let me see what the options are. The options are 16,18,22,12. \n\nIf the two components are both C6H10 (cyclohexene and another C6H10 isomer), total H is 20. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if one is C5H8 (cyclopentadiene?), but that would need another component. Wait, cyclopentadiene has a double bond. Hydrogenation would give cyclopentane (C5H10). Not Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components in X are both C7H12? No. \n\nWait, maybe the two components are 1,3-pentadiene and something else? But that has conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are both C6H12 but with double bonds? No, C6H12 is cyclohexane, which is saturated. \n\nWait, perhaps the two components are both C6H10, but each has one double bond, so total H is 10+10=20. Not an option. So this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound like 1-hexene (C6H12?), wait no. 1-hexene is C6H12? No, hexene is C6H12? Wait, hexene is C6H12? No. Wait, hexane is C6H14. Hexene is C6H12. Oh right! Hexene has the formula C6H12. Wait, wait a minute! Wait, alkene formula is CnH2n. So hexene is C6H12. Wait, that's right. So if the two components in X are two different alkenes with the formula C6H12, then hydrogenating them would give hexane (C6H14), but the problem states that Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which would be cyclohexane. So that contradicts. \n\nWait, this is a key point. Let me recalculate Z's possible formula again. \n\nEarlier, I assumed Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). But if the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives Z, and if X's components are alkenes (like hexene), then their hydrogenation would give hexane (C6H14), which would have a different H mass fraction. \n\nLet me recalculate Z's formula correctly. \n\nThe problem states that Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me recompute using alkane formula. Suppose Z is an alkane: CnH2n+2. \n\nThen:\n\nHydrogen mass fraction = (2n+2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7 \n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7(2n+2) = 14n + 2 \n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \n\nWhich gives 14=2, which is impossible. \n\nSo Z cannot be an alkane. Therefore, it must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n). Then, mass fraction is (2n)/(14n) =1/7, which is true for any n. So Z can be any cycloalkane. \n\nThe problem says that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nSo, the components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So each must be a cycloalkene (since adding H2 to cycloalkene gives cycloalkane). \n\nThus, each component in X is a cycloalkene with formula CnH2n-2. When hydrogenated, they become CnH2n. Since Z is C6H12, n=6. So each component in X must be C6H10 (since 2n-2=10 when n=6). \n\nTherefore, each component in X is a cyclohexene (or another cyclohexene isomer). Since it's a mixture of two different liquids, they must be different isomers. \n\nThe total number of H in the two components would be 10 +10 =20. But this is not among the options. Wait, the options are 16,18,22,12. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the two components are not both C6H10. Maybe one has two double bonds (but non-conjugated), so it's C6H8. \n\nFor example, if one component is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then total H is 10+8=18 (option B). \n\nThis would satisfy the conditions:\n\n- Both are cycloalkenes with no conjugated double bonds (the 1,4 diene has non-conjugated double bonds).\n\n- Hydrogenation of each would give cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\n- When heated with platinum, they undergo disproportionation to form Y. The reaction could be such that one loses a double bond (becoming cyclohexane) and the other loses two double bonds (but how? Or perhaps they rearrange. \n\nWait, if you have cyclohexene (one double bond) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (two double bonds), maybe they react to form two products. Perhaps the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses a double bond to become cyclohexene, but that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a rearrangement where the two alkenes form cyclohexane and another saturated compound. For instance, if the two alkenes undergo a reaction where one becomes cyclohexane and the other becomes another alkane. But the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe the reaction is that each molecule of X's components reacts to form one molecule of Z (cyclohexane) and another product. \n\nWait, but since it's an equimolar mixture, maybe the two components in X react in a 1:1 ratio to form two products in 1:1 ratio. \n\nSuppose each cyclohexene molecule and each 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule undergoes a reaction that produces one cyclohexane and another product. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction could be a dimerization, but that would form a larger molecule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two H2 molecules to form cyclohexane, and the cyclohexene loses one H2 to form cyclohexane, but that would just give cyclohexane as the only product, not a mixture. \n\nHmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is only asking for the total number of hydrogens in the two liquids of X, so perhaps I can proceed with the calculation even if I'm unsure about the reaction mechanism. \n\nIf the two components are C6H10 and C6H8, then total H is 18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are both C6H10 (like two different cyclohexene isomers, such as cis and trans), giving total H of 20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the other possibility is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are both C5H8 (cyclopentadiene?), but then hydrogenating them would give cyclopentane (C5H10). Not Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are 1,2-cyclohexadiene and another? Wait, but that would have conjugated double bonds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds), but the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds. So that's excluded. \n\nHmm. The only way to get an answer in the options is 18. So I'll go with that. \n\nThus, the answer should be B)18.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which decolorize bromine water and disproportionate into mixture Y upon heating with platinum. Hydrogenation of both mixtures yields hydrocarbon Z, a solvent with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. \n\n1. **Identifying Z**: The hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7 indicates Z is a cycloalkane (C\u2099H\u2082\u2099). Since Z is a common solvent, it is likely cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082), which fits the mass fraction calculation.\n   \n2. **Composition of X**: The two liquids in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Thus, they are cycloalkenes (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080 each) or a combination allowing this. However, considering no conjugated double bonds, one possibility is cyclohexene (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C\u2086H\u2088), which has non-conjugated double bonds. \n\n3. **Total Hydrogen Calculation**: \n   - Cyclohexene (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080) contributes 10 H atoms.\n   - 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C\u2086H\u2088) contributes 8 H atoms.\n   - Total H = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis matches option B. \n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, and we need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance is a reducing agent, like an alkene or alkyne, which can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So maybe the liquids in X are alkenes or alkynes. Since they are in an equimolar mixture and they can decolorize bromine, that's a clue.\n\nThen, when treated with platinum and heated, they form mixture Y through disproportionation. Disproportionation typically involves a substance acting both as an oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, maybe an alkene converting into different products where one is oxidized and another reduced? Wait, but platinum is a catalyst here. Wait, platinum is often used in hydrogenation, but here the reaction is heating with platinum leading to disproportionation. Hmm.\n\nThe products Y are two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So those must be saturated (no double bonds) or perhaps different structures that can't react with bromine. Also, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane). \n\nAdditionally, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. That's important because conjugated dienes, for example, have conjugated double bonds, so if X doesn't have those, maybe they are isolated dienes or alkynes?\n\nLet me start by figuring out what hydrocarbon Z is. Since Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, let's calculate its formula. \n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the mass fraction of carbon would be 85.72%. Let me denote the formula as CnHm. The molar mass of H is 1, and C is 12. Let me set up the ratio:\n\nHydrogen mass / (Carbon mass + Hydrogen mass) = 0.1428\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of C atoms as n and H as m. Then:\n\n(m * 1) / (12n + m * 1) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nm = 0.1428 * (12n + m)\n\nm = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428m\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\n\nDivide both sides by 0.8572:\n\nm = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n \u2248 2n\n\nHmm, so m \u2248 2n. Since the formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. Wait, so that would mean the hydrogen count is 2n+2. But according to this calculation, m is approximately 2n, so maybe there's a slight discrepancy. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, let me do it more precisely. Let me write the equation again:\n\n(m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nCross-multiplying: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)\n\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n \u2192 0.8572m = 1.7136n \u2192 m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n \n\nCalculating that: 1.7136 divided by 0.8572. Let me compute this:\n\n1.7136 / 0.8572 \u2248 2.0 (since 0.8572 * 2 = 1.7144). Oh, so actually it's approximately exactly 2. So m \u2248 2n. So the ratio is H is twice the number of C atoms. \n\nWait, for an alkane, H is 2n + 2. So that would give H = 2n + 2. So 2n + 2 \u2248 2n? That can't be. Wait, unless n is large, but maybe the error is in the calculation. Wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is exact. Let me try with exact fractions. Let me see, 14.28% is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 is ~14.2857%). Let's assume that the mass fraction of H is exactly 1/7. Then, the mass of H is 1/7 of the total mass. \n\nLet the formula be CnHm. \n\nSo (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7 \u2192 cross multiply: 7m = 12n + m \u2192 6m = 12n \u2192 m = 2n. \n\nAh! So exactly, m = 2n. Therefore the molecular formula must be CnH2n. So that's an alkene (since alkanes have 2n+2 H, alkynes have 2n-2, but alkenes have 2n). Wait, wait, an alkene is CnH2n. So Z is an alkene? But wait, the problem says that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z, which doesn't react further. Wait, but if Z is an alkene, then hydrogenation would add more H. Wait, the problem says that hydrogenation of mixture Y (which includes Z) gives Z, but Z itself doesn't react further. That's a contradiction unless Z is an alkane. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that both mixtures X and Y when hydrogenated under severe conditions give hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be the fully hydrogenated product. So Z is an alkane. But according to the calculation, if H's mass fraction is exactly 1/7, then m=2n, so the formula would be CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the mass fraction. Let's see:\n\nIf Z is an alkane, then its formula is CnH2n+2. Let me plug that into the mass fraction:\n\nH mass fraction = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) \n\nWe set this equal to 14.28%, which is 1/7. \n\nSo:\n\n(2n +2)/(14n +2) = 1/7 \n\nCross-multiplying: 7*(2n +2) = 1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 = 14n +2 \n\nSubtract 14n from both sides: 14 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. \n\nHmm, so that can't be. So maybe Z isn't an alkane. Wait, but the problem says that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z. So maybe Z is the product of full hydrogenation. Wait, but if Z is a constituent of Y, then Y contains Z. Wait, the problem says \"a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y\". So Y is a mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z. \n\nWait, but if Z is an alkane, then the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to Z as well. Since when you hydrogenate Y, you get only Z, that implies that the other component in Y also hydrogenates to Z. So the two components in Y must be different compounds that both hydrogenate to Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Z is an alkene. Let's try again with Z being an alkene (so formula CnH2n). Let's plug into the mass fraction:\n\nH mass fraction is (2n)/(12n +2n) = 2n/(14n) = 1/7 \u224814.28%, which matches exactly. \n\nAh! So that works. So Z must be an alkene. But the problem states that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it doesn't react further. Wait, but an alkene would hydrogenate further to an alkane. So this is confusing. Wait, maybe \"severe conditions\" here means that even if it's an alkene, it's being hydrogenated to the alkane? But the problem says that Z is the product, and that Z does not react further. So maybe Z is indeed the alkane. But according to the calculation, the mass fraction would not give 14.28% for an alkane. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in assuming the formula. Let me re-calculate with Z being an alkane. Let me try with an alkane formula CnH2n+2. Let's suppose the mass fraction is 14.28%, so H/(C+H) = 1/7. Let me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the molecular formula as CnH2n+2.\n\nTotal mass: 12n + (2n +2) =14n +2.\n\nH mass is (2n+2), so:\n\n(2n+2)/(14n +2) =1/7\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n+2)*7:\n\n7*(2n +2) =14n +2\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 =2 \u2192 no solution. So impossible. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. So maybe Z is not an alkane. Let me think again. The problem says Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it must be saturated. Because unsaturated would react. Wait, but if it's an alkane, then it can't react with hydrogen. So that's correct. But then the mass fraction calculation must be wrong? Or perhaps the problem states the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, so maybe the calculation must lead to an alkane?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using approximate values. Let me try with an alkane. Let me see for a possible alkane where H's mass fraction is close to 14.28%.\n\nLet me try with hexane: C6H14.\n\nH mass is 14*1=14. C: 6*12=72. Total mass is 86.\n\nH% is (14/86)*100 \u224816.28% \u2192 higher than 14.28.\n\nPentane: C5H12 \u2192 H is 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.67%.\n\nButane: 5.33% H? Wait no, C4H10: H is 10/(58)\u224817.24%.\n\nWait, that's even higher. Wait, propane: 8/(30 +8)=8/38\u224821.05%. Methane: 4/16=25%. Hmm, all alkanes have higher H percentages. \n\nWait, maybe it's an alkene? Let's try hexene, C6H12. H is 12/(72+12)=12/84\u224814.2857%. Exactly 1/7! So 14.2857%, which is approximately 14.28%. So that's the exact value. So Z must be hexene (C6H12). \n\nWait, but then when hydrogenated, hexene would become hexane (C6H14). But the problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y (which contains Z) gives only Z. Wait, that's a problem. Because if Z is hexene, then hydrogenation would convert it into hexane, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So that contradicts unless Z is the product. Wait, the wording is: \"Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y...\"\n\nAh! So Z is a constituent of Y, and when you hydrogenate Y, you get Z. Wait, but if Y contains Z, which is hexene, then hydrogenating Y would produce hexane from the other component, but Z (hexene) would become hexane as well. But the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, so that's not possible unless the other component in Y also hydrogenates to Z. \n\nWait, maybe the other component in Y is a different alkene that hydrogenates to the same Z. For instance, if Y has two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same alkane, then when you hydrogenate Y, you get only the alkane. But the problem says Z is a constituent of Y. So if Z is the alkane, then Y would have the alkane and another compound that hydrogenates to the alkane, so when you hydrogenate Y, you get the alkane (Z) from both components, so the product is just Z. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nSuppose Z is the alkane (C6H14), which has H% as follows: H is 14/(86)*100\u224816.28%. But that doesn't match the given 14.28%. So maybe my previous thought is wrong. Wait, but the problem says Z has a H mass fraction of exactly 14.28%, which matches the hexene (C6H12). Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate for hexene:\n\nHexene is C6H12. Total mass: 6*12 +12 =72+12=84. H mass is 12. So 12/84 = 0.142857... which is exactly 14.2857%, so the given 14.28% is an approximation. So Z must be hexene. But then, when you hydrogenate Y (which contains Z), you should get the hydrogenated form of the other component in Y. Wait, but the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So that suggests that Z is the product, not a reactant. That can't be if Z is hexene. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Z is the product of hydrogenation, so it must be an alkane. Let me see if there's an alkane where H% is 14.28% but with some rounding. Let me try butane? No, as before, butane's H% is ~17.24%. Wait, maybe a larger alkane? Let's see for heptane: C7H16. H is 16/(100) (since 7*12=84 +16=100) \u2192 16/100=16% \u2192 still higher. Octane: C8H18 \u2192 H is 18/(120) = 15% \u2192 closer. Hmm, 15% vs 14.28%. Maybe the problem is considering an even larger alkane. Let me try C8H18 (octane): H is 18/(12*8 +18) =18/102\u224817.65%? Wait, no, 8*12=96 +18=114. 18/114\u224815.79%.\n\nHmm, not matching. Wait, maybe it's a cycloalkane? Let's see cyclohexane: C6H12 \u2192 same as hexene. Wait, cyclohexane is an alkane (saturated), so H% would be 12/(72 +12)=12/84=14.28%. Exactly! So cyclohexane (C6H12) is an alkane? Wait no, cyclohexane is a cycloalkane, which is indeed saturated. Its formula is C6H12, same as hexene. Wait, but cyclohexane is an alkane? No, alkanes are acyclic. But cyclohexane is a cycloalkane with the formula C6H12. Its hydrogen content is the same as hexene but it's saturated, so it won't react with bromine. So that fits. \n\nAh! So Z must be cyclohexane. Then, its formula is C6H12, which has a hydrogen mass fraction of exactly 14.28%. That matches the given data. And cyclohexane doesn't react with bromine water (since it's saturated). Also, when hydrogenated, it doesn't react further. \n\nSo that makes sense. Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nNow, the problem states that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Since Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y, the other component in Y must be another saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Wait, but since it's already saturated, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. So perhaps the other component in Y is another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. But since Y is formed via disproportionation of X, let's think about what the original mixture X could be.\n\nThe reaction is X (two liquids, which decolorize bromine) \u2192 Y (two liquids, including cyclohexane) via disproportionation with platinum when heated. \n\nDisproportionation usually involves a species acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in some cases, alkenes can undergo disproportionation. Wait, maybe the reaction involves converting an alkene into cyclohexane and something else? But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original mixture X consists of two different alkenes, which upon heating with platinum (maybe a catalyst for some rearrangement?), disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound. \n\nWait, let me think about possible reactions. One common reaction involving alkenes and platinum might be isomerization or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes undergo a reaction where one is hydrogenated (reduction) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidation?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the reaction is disproportionation, perhaps one molecule of the alkene is oxidized (losing H?) and another is reduced (gaining H?), but since it's in the same mixture, maybe they form different products. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where they form cyclohexane and another compound. Let me think of possible alkenes that can form cyclohexane. For instance, if the alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting materials are two different cycloalkenes? Like cyclohexene and something else? Wait, but cyclohexene would decolorize bromine. If they are in mixture X, and upon disproportionation (heating with Pt), they form cyclohexane and another product.\n\nWait, if X has two different cycloalkenes, say cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, then when they disproportionate, maybe one becomes cyclohexane (reduction) and another becomes something else. But the problem states that the products Y are two liquids that don't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, one becomes cyclohexane and another becomes another saturated compound. Let me think of the possibility that the two alkenes in X are 1-hexene and another isomer that, when they disproportionate, form cyclohexane and maybe another compound. Wait, perhaps via a Diels-Alder type reaction? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components of X are the same but in different conformations? No, equimolar mixture implies two different compounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting mixture X consists of two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, two different alkenes whose hydrogenation products are cyclohexane. Then, when they undergo disproportionation (maybe via some reaction where one is hydrogenated and another dehydrogenated?), but that's unclear.\n\nWait, the key here is that the disproportionation reaction leads to Y, which contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound. The other compound in Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane as well. Since when you hydrogenate Y, you get only Z (cyclohexane). \n\nSo the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Let's think of what that could be. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, the other compound must have a double bond or triple bond. Wait, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. Wait, but if it's saturated, then hydrogenation would not change it. Hmm, this is a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the other component in Y is a different saturated compound that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. That can't be, because saturated compounds don't react with hydrogen. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think again. Let me start over with the process:\n\nX (two alkenes) \u2192 upon heating with Pt (disproportionation) \u2192 Y (two liquids, one is Z=cyclohexane, the other is something else). \n\nHydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. So the other component in Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But since Y's components don't decolorize bromine (so they are saturated), that suggests that the other component is also a saturated compound. But if it's saturated, hydrogenation won't change it. Therefore, the only way this works is if the other component in Y is cyclohexane itself. But then Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and something else that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but that's impossible unless the other is unsaturated. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the other component in Y is saturated. The problem says that Y's liquids do not decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated (no double/triple bonds). Therefore, the other component must be a saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it's already saturated, that can't happen. Therefore, maybe the other component is a different saturated compound which is actually the same as cyclohexane? But then Y would be a mixture of two same substances, which contradicts equimolar.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe problem states that the original mixture X has two liquids with no conjugated multiple bonds. So they are either isolated dienes, alkynes, or single double bonds. \n\nIf the products Y are two saturated liquids (since they don't decolorize bromine), then the reaction must be converting the unsaturated bonds into saturated ones. But since it's a disproportionation, perhaps one of the molecules loses a double bond (becomes more saturated) and the other gains a double bond (but that would mean it's less saturated?), but that contradicts because Y's components are saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is such that one molecule becomes more saturated (like going from alkene to alkane) and the other becomes a cycloalkane or something else. Wait, but both products in Y must be saturated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting materials are two different alkenes which, upon heating with platinum, undergo a rearrangement and hydrogen transfer. For example, maybe one becomes cyclohexane and another becomes something else, like another cycloalkane?\n\nWait, suppose the two alkenes in X are both hexenes but different isomers. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene. Upon heating with platinum, maybe they undergo a reaction where one forms cyclohexane and another forms another compound. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the Prins reaction or some cycloaddition? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction but in reverse? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total hydrogens in X. The question asks for the total H in the two liquids of X. Since Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y. \n\nLet me consider that hydrogenation of X (which is two alkenes) gives cyclohexane. Since hydrogenation of an alkene adds two H's across the double bond. Let's suppose that each alkene in X has one double bond. \n\nSuppose each alkene in X has the formula CnH2n. When hydrogenated, they become CnH2n+2. Since both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), that suggests that each alkene must be C6H10. Because adding two H's would give C6H12. \n\nWait, yes! If each alkene in X is a hexene (C6H12?), no. Wait, wait, let me think again. Wait, alkene formula is CnH2n. So if the hydrogenation product is C6H12 (cyclohexane), then the original must have been C6H10 (since adding 2 H's gives C6H12). But C6H10 would be an alkene (since C6H12 is alkane). Wait, no. Wait, CnH2n is alkene. So if the product is C6H12, then the original must have been C6H10 (since adding 2 H's gives C6H12). So each alkene in X would have to be C6H10, which would have one double bond (since C6H12 is the alkane, so subtracting two H's gives the alkene). \n\nWait, but C6H10 can also be a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene is C6H10) or an alkyne (since alkynes are CnH2n-2, so C6H10 would be a di-alkene or an alkyne with two triple bonds? Not sure). Wait, C6H10 could be a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene, which is C6H10), or an alkyne with one triple bond (since C6H10 would have 2n-2 H for alkyne: 2*6 -2=10. So yes, C6H10 can be an alkyne, like 1-hexyne (C6H10). \n\nWait, so the two components in X could be cyclohexene and another compound (maybe another alkyne or another diene?), but the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. \n\nAlternatively, the two components of X are two different alkenes (each C6H10) that don't have conjugated bonds. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene (isolated double bonds) or cyclohexene and another alkene. \n\nIf both are alkenes (each C6H10), then the total H in X would be 2*(10) =20 H, but the options don't have 20. Wait, options are 16,18,22,12. Hmm, so perhaps they are not both alkenes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one is an alkyne and the other is an alkene. Let me think. Suppose one is an alkyne (C6H10) and the other is an alkene (C6H12?), but no. Wait, alkynes have formula CnH2n-2. So for C6H10, 2n-2 =10 \u2192 2n=12 \u2192 n=6. So C6H10 is indeed an alkyne (like hexyne) or a cycloalkene. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are two different alkenes (each C6H10), so each has one double bond. Their total H would be 10 +10 =20, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are a diene and an alkyne? Let me see. Suppose one is a diene (so C6H10? Wait, a diene would have two double bonds, so formula is CnH2n-2. So for a diene in C6: 2n-2 = 2*6 -2*2? Wait, no. Let me compute for a diene: each double bond reduces H by 2. So one double bond gives C6H12-2= C6H10. Two double bonds would be C6H8. So a diene would have two double bonds, so formula C6H8. \n\nIf one component is a diene (C6H8) and another is an alkyne (C6H10), then total H is 8+10=18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, if the two components are both dienes (each C6H8), total H would be 16 (8+8), which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two are a diene and a triene? But then even less H. \n\nThe problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So if they are dienes, they can't be conjugated. So for example, 1,3-pentadiene is conjugated, but 1,4-pentadiene is not. But in hexene, a diene could be like 1,5-hexadiene (isolated double bonds). \n\nSo if both are dienes (each C6H8), then total H is 16 (8+8), which is option A. But how does that fit into the disproportionation?\n\nWait, the reaction is that X (two liquids, maybe dienes) undergoes disproportionation to form Y (two liquids, including cyclohexane). \n\nLet me think of a possible disproportionation. For example, if you have two dienes (each C6H8) undergoing a reaction where one becomes cyclohexane (C6H12) and another becomes something else. \n\nWait, the total H in the reactants (X) would be 8+8=16. The products Y would have total H as 12 (for cyclohexane) plus the other component. Let me see:\n\nSuppose each diene (C6H8) can undergo a reaction where one loses a double bond (becomes more saturated, adding 4 H?), but that may not be. Alternatively, the reaction could be such that one molecule of diene becomes cyclohexane (adding 4 H, since C6H8 \u2192 C6H12 requires adding 4 H) and the other diene loses 4 H to become something else. Wait, but that would require a disproportionation where one gains H and another loses H. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one diene undergoes cyclization to form cyclohexene (which would then be part of Y?), but then Y's components must be saturated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two dienes (each C6H8) disproportionate into cyclohexane (C6H12) and another compound. Let's see the H balance. \n\nThe total H in X is 16. The product Y has two molecules. Let\u2019s say cyclohexane (12 H) plus another compound Y2. The total H in Y must equal the H in X (since it's a disproportionation reaction, not adding H from outside). Wait, but the reaction is with platinum when heated, maybe without H2? Not sure. \n\nWait, the problem states the reaction is \"treated with platinum when heated\", but it's not clear if H2 is present. Wait, the hydrogenation part is a separate step. The disproportionation reaction might not involve H2. \n\nAssuming that the total H is conserved (since no H is added or removed in the disproportionation), then:\n\nTotal H in X (16) must equal total H in Y (12 + H in the other product). So the other product must have 4 H. \n\nBut that's hard to imagine. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces two products where one is cyclohexane and another is something else with 4 H. But 4 H would be like CH4 or something, but that's not a liquid. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think again about the hydrogenation step. Both mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane). \n\nSo each component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, if X is two different alkenes, each hydrogenating to cyclohexane, then each must be a C6H10 (since adding 2 H gives C6H12). \n\nThus, each alkene in X has 10 H. So two of them would total 20 H. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alkynes. An alkyne (C6H10) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (adding 2 H per triple bond). Since an alkyne has one triple bond, adding two H's would make it an alkene, but full hydrogenation would require adding four H's (since triple bond becomes single: C\u2261C becomes C-C, adding 2 H's per bond? Wait, a triple bond requires adding two H2 molecules (4 H atoms) to become a single bond. So an alkyne (C6H10) would need to add 4 H to become cyclohexane. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nAn alkyne, say hexyne (C6H10). To hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), you need to add 2 H's? Wait, no. Wait, the formula of hexyne is C6H10. Adding two H's would give C6H12 (an alkene?), but to get to the alkane, you need to add four H's. Wait, the formula for an alkane is C6H14. Wait, this is confusing. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nAlkynes have formula CnH2n-2. So for hexyne (n=6), it's C6H10. \n\nHydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane requires adding two H2 molecules (four H atoms) across the triple bond. So:\n\nC6H10 \u2192 C6H14 (alkane) requires adding 4 H. \n\nBut the problem states that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z (cyclohexane, which is C6H12). Wait, that's not an alkane. Wait, cyclohexane is a cycloalkane (C6H12), which is an alkane formula? No, cyclohexane has the same formula as an alkene (since it's a 6-membered ring, formula is C6H12). Wait, but cyclohexane is a saturated cycloalkane. Its formula is indeed C6H12. So an alkyne (C6H10) would need to add two H2 (four H atoms) to become cyclohexane? Let me see:\n\nC6H10 + 2 H2 \u2192 C6H14 (the alkane hexane). But that's not cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is in a ring? \n\nWait, maybe the alkyne is in a cyclic form, like cyclohexyne (which is a cycloalkyne). But cyclohexyne would have the formula C6H10 as well. If you hydrogenate cyclohexyne, you would get cyclohexane (C6H12). So that would work. \n\nSo if one component of X is cyclohexyne (C6H10), then hydrogenating it would give cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nAlternatively, if the other component is another unsaturated compound that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose mixture X has two different compounds that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Let's say cyclohexyne and another compound, like 1-hexyne (linear alkyne). Both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane and hexane respectively. Wait, no. Wait, 1-hexyne would hydrogenate to hexane (C6H14), which is different from cyclohexane. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to approach this systematically. \n\nGiven that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and that when you hydrogenate Y (which contains Z) you only get Z, then the other component in Y must also hydrogenate to Z. Since Y's components are saturated, the only way is that the other component is Z itself. But then Y would be a mixture of Z and something else that is already Z, which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component in Y is another cycloalkane that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. For example, maybe methylcyclopentane? No, that would hydrogenate to itself. \n\nWait, perhaps the other component in Y is a different cycloalkene? But then Y's components would decolorize bromine. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should focus on the total hydrogen in X. Let's see the options: 16,18,22,12.\n\nIf X has two molecules each with 8 H, total 16 (option A). For example, two dienes (each C6H8). Then when they disproportionate, they form cyclohexane (12 H) and another compound with 4 H (but that's impossible). Alternatively, maybe the other product is a different diene? No, because Y's components must not decolorize bromine. \n\nAlternatively, if the two components in X are each C6H10 (alkenes or alkynes), then total H is 20, which is not an option. \n\nWait, what if the two components are a diene and an alkyne? Let's see:\n\nSuppose one is a diene (C6H8) and the other is an alkyne (C6H10). Total H = 8+10=18 (option B). \n\nThen, when they disproportionate, perhaps the diene becomes cyclohexane (adding 4 H: C6H8 \u2192 C6H12), and the alkyne becomes something else. But where does the H come from? The alkyne would lose H? \n\nAlternatively, in the disproportionation reaction, one molecule gains H (becoming more saturated) and the other loses H (becoming less saturated?), but that contradicts since Y must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkyne becomes cyclohexane (adding 2 H), but then the diene would need to become another product. \n\nWait, let's think of the total H in X (18) must equal the H in Y (which has two products). Y contains cyclohexane (12 H) and another compound. Let's say the other compound has 6 H. 12+6=18. So that works. \n\nWhat's a saturated compound with C6 and 6 H? Wait, cyclohexane has 12 H. To have 6 H, it would be something like benzene? But benzene has 6 H (C6H6), which is a liquid? Benzene is a liquid, but it does decolorize bromine via addition (but in reality, benzene doesn't easily do so; it undergoes substitution). Hmm, but the problem states that Y's components do not decolorize bromine. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water (since it doesn't undergo addition easily). \n\nWait, benzene (C6H6) is a possibility. Let's see:\n\nIf X has a diene (C6H8) and an alkyne (C6H10), their total H is 18. \n\nIn the disproportionation reaction, the diene might form benzene (losing 2 H) and the alkyne forms cyclohexane (gaining 2 H). \n\nSo:\n\nC6H8 (diene) \u2192 C6H6 (benzene) \u2192 losing 2 H.\n\nC6H10 (alkyne) \u2192 C6H12 (cyclohexane) \u2192 gaining 2 H. \n\nTotal H remains 18 (8+10 =18 \u2192 6+12=18). \n\nThis balances. \n\nThen, Y is a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Both are saturated (benzene is aromatic, doesn't have double bonds, so bromine won't decolorize). \n\nHydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane (adding 6 H), and cyclohexane remains. So the product is only cyclohexane (Z). That fits. \n\nSo this scenario works. \n\nThen, the two components in X are C6H8 (a diene) and C6H10 (an alkyne or cycloalkene). The total H in X would be 8 +10 =18. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 18. \n\nAlso, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. The diene would need to be non-conjugated. For example, 1,4-hexadiene (two isolated double bonds) would be acceptable. The alkyne (like cyclohexyne or hexyne) also doesn't have conjugated bonds. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) 18.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X, which consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**: \n   - Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which corresponds to a formula of C\u2086H\u2081\u2082 (calculated as 12/84 = 1/7). This matches cyclohexane, a saturated cycloalkane that does not decolorize bromine and does not react further with hydrogen.\n\n2. **Determine Components of Mixture X**:\n   - Mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form Y (containing Z and another saturated compound). Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields only Z.\n   - The components of X must hydrogenate to Z. Possible candidates are a diene (C\u2086H\u2088) and an alkyne (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080). \n   - Disproportionation converts the diene to benzene (C\u2086H\u2086) and the alkyne to cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082). This balances hydrogen (8 + 10 = 18 in X; 6 + 12 = 18 in Y).\n\n3. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - The diene (e.g., 1,4-hexadiene) and alkyne (e.g., hexyne or cyclohexyne) have no conjugated bonds, satisfying the problem's condition.\n   - The total hydrogen in X is 8 (from diene) + 10 (from alkyne) = 18.\n\n**Answer: B**",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, and we need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance is a reducing agent, like an alkene or alkyne, which can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So maybe the liquids in X are alkenes or alkynes. Since they are in an equimolar mixture and they can decolorize bromine, that's a clue.\n\nThen, when treated with platinum and heated, they form mixture Y through disproportionation. Disproportionation typically involves a substance acting both as an oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, maybe an alkene converting into different products where one is oxidized and another reduced? Wait, but platinum is a catalyst here. Wait, platinum is often used in hydrogenation, but here the reaction is heating with platinum leading to disproportionation. Hmm.\n\nThe products Y are two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So those must be saturated (no double bonds) or perhaps different structures that can't react with bromine. Also, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane). \n\nAdditionally, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. That's important because conjugated dienes, for example, have conjugated double bonds, so if X doesn't have those, maybe they are isolated dienes or alkynes?\n\nLet me start by figuring out what hydrocarbon Z is. Since Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, let's calculate its formula. \n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so the mass fraction of carbon would be 85.72%. Let me denote the formula as CnHm. The molar mass of H is 1, and C is 12. Let me set up the ratio:\n\nHydrogen mass / (Carbon mass + Hydrogen mass) = 0.1428\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of C atoms as n and H as m. Then:\n\n(m * 1) / (12n + m * 1) = 0.1428\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nm = 0.1428 * (12n + m)\n\nm = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428m\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\n\nDivide both sides by 0.8572:\n\nm = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n \u2248 2n\n\nHmm, so m \u2248 2n. Since the formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. Wait, so that would mean the hydrogen count is 2n+2. But according to this calculation, m is approximately 2n, so maybe there's a slight discrepancy. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, let me do it more precisely. Let me write the equation again:\n\n(m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nCross-multiplying: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)\n\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n \u2192 0.8572m = 1.7136n \u2192 m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n \n\nCalculating that: 1.7136 divided by 0.8572. Let me compute this:\n\n1.7136 / 0.8572 \u2248 2.0 (since 0.8572 * 2 = 1.7144). Oh, so actually it's approximately exactly 2. So m \u2248 2n. So the ratio is H is twice the number of C atoms. \n\nWait, for an alkane, H is 2n + 2. So that would give H = 2n + 2. So 2n + 2 \u2248 2n? That can't be. Wait, unless n is large, but maybe the error is in the calculation. Wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation is exact. Let me try with exact fractions. Let me see, 14.28% is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 is ~14.2857%). Let's assume that the mass fraction of H is exactly 1/7. Then, the mass of H is 1/7 of the total mass. \n\nLet the formula be CnHm. \n\nSo (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7 \u2192 cross multiply: 7m = 12n + m \u2192 6m = 12n \u2192 m = 2n. \n\nAh! So exactly, m = 2n. Therefore the molecular formula must be CnH2n. So that's an alkene (since alkanes have 2n+2 H, alkynes have 2n-2, but alkenes have 2n). Wait, wait, an alkene is CnH2n. So Z is an alkene? But wait, the problem says that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z, which doesn't react further. Wait, but if Z is an alkene, then hydrogenation would add more H. Wait, the problem says that hydrogenation of mixture Y (which includes Z) gives Z, but Z itself doesn't react further. That's a contradiction unless Z is an alkane. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that both mixtures X and Y when hydrogenated under severe conditions give hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be the fully hydrogenated product. So Z is an alkane. But according to the calculation, if H's mass fraction is exactly 1/7, then m=2n, so the formula would be CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the mass fraction. Let's see:\n\nIf Z is an alkane, then its formula is CnH2n+2. Let me plug that into the mass fraction:\n\nH mass fraction = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) \n\nWe set this equal to 14.28%, which is 1/7. \n\nSo:\n\n(2n +2)/(14n +2) = 1/7 \n\nCross-multiplying: 7*(2n +2) = 1*(14n +2)\n\n14n +14 = 14n +2 \n\nSubtract 14n from both sides: 14 = 2 \u2192 which is impossible. \n\nHmm, so that can't be. So maybe Z isn't an alkane. Wait, but the problem says that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z. So maybe Z is the product of full hydrogenation. Wait, but if Z is a constituent of Y, then Y contains Z. Wait, the problem says \"a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y\". So Y is a mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z. \n\nWait, but if Z is an alkane, then the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to Z as well. Since when you hydrogenate Y, you get only Z, that implies that the other component in Y also hydrogenates to Z. So the two components in Y must be different compounds that both hydrogenate to Z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Z is an alkene. Let's try again with Z being an alkene (so formula CnH2n). Let's plug into the mass fraction:\n\nH mass fraction is (2n)/(12n +2n) = 2n/(14n) = 1/7 \u224814.28%, which matches exactly. \n\nAh! So that works. So Z must be an alkene. But the problem states that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it doesn't react further. Wait, but an alkene would hydrogenate further to an alkane. So this is confusing. Wait, maybe \"severe conditions\" here means that even if it's an alkene, it's being hydrogenated to the alkane? But the problem says that Z is the product, and that Z does not react further. So maybe Z is indeed the alkane. But according to the calculation, the mass fraction would not give 14.28% for an alkane. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in assuming the formula. Let me re-calculate with Z being an alkane. Let me try with an alkane formula CnH2n+2. Let's suppose the mass fraction is 14.28%, so H/(C+H) = 1/7. Let me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the molecular formula as CnH2n+2.\n\nTotal mass: 12n + (2n +2) =14n +2.\n\nH mass is (2n+2), so:\n\n(2n+2)/(14n +2) =1/7\n\nMultiply both sides by (14n+2)*7:\n\n7*(2n +2) =14n +2\n\n14n +14 =14n +2 \u2192 14 =2 \u2192 no solution. So impossible. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. So maybe Z is not an alkane. Let me think again. The problem says Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it must be saturated. Because unsaturated would react. Wait, but if it's an alkane, then it can't react with hydrogen. So that's correct. But then the mass fraction calculation must be wrong? Or perhaps the problem states the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, so maybe the calculation must lead to an alkane?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using approximate values. Let me try with an alkane. Let me see for a possible alkane where H's mass fraction is close to 14.28%.\n\nLet me try with hexane: C6H14.\n\nH mass is 14*1=14. C: 6*12=72. Total mass is 86.\n\nH% is (14/86)*100 \u224816.28% \u2192 higher than 14.28.\n\nPentane: C5H12 \u2192 H is 12/(60+12)=12/72=16.67%.\n\nButane: 5.33% H? Wait no, C4H10: H is 10/(58)\u224817.24%.\n\nWait, that's even higher. Wait, propane: 8/(30 +8)=8/38\u224821.05%. Methane: 4/16=25%. Hmm, all alkanes have higher H percentages. \n\nWait, maybe it's an alkene? Let's try hexene, C6H12. H is 12/(72+12)=12/84\u224814.2857%. Exactly 1/7! So 14.2857%, which is approximately 14.28%. So that's the exact value. So Z must be hexene (C6H12). \n\nWait, but then when hydrogenated, hexene would become hexane (C6H14). But the problem states that hydrogenation of mixture Y (which contains Z) gives only Z. Wait, that's a problem. Because if Z is hexene, then hydrogenation would convert it into hexane, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So that contradicts unless Z is the product. Wait, the wording is: \"Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y...\"\n\nAh! So Z is a constituent of Y, and when you hydrogenate Y, you get Z. Wait, but if Y contains Z, which is hexene, then hydrogenating Y would produce hexane from the other component, but Z (hexene) would become hexane as well. But the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, so that's not possible unless the other component in Y also hydrogenates to Z. \n\nWait, maybe the other component in Y is a different alkene that hydrogenates to the same Z. For instance, if Y has two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same alkane, then when you hydrogenate Y, you get only the alkane. But the problem says Z is a constituent of Y. So if Z is the alkane, then Y would have the alkane and another compound that hydrogenates to the alkane, so when you hydrogenate Y, you get the alkane (Z) from both components, so the product is just Z. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nSuppose Z is the alkane (C6H14), which has H% as follows: H is 14/(86)*100\u224816.28%. But that doesn't match the given 14.28%. So maybe my previous thought is wrong. Wait, but the problem says Z has a H mass fraction of exactly 14.28%, which matches the hexene (C6H12). Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate for hexene:\n\nHexene is C6H12. Total mass: 6*12 +12 =72+12=84. H mass is 12. So 12/84 = 0.142857... which is exactly 14.2857%, so the given 14.28% is an approximation. So Z must be hexene. But then, when you hydrogenate Y (which contains Z), you should get the hydrogenated form of the other component in Y. Wait, but the problem says hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So that suggests that Z is the product, not a reactant. That can't be if Z is hexene. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Z is the product of hydrogenation, so it must be an alkane. Let me see if there's an alkane where H% is 14.28% but with some rounding. Let me try butane? No, as before, butane's H% is ~17.24%. Wait, maybe a larger alkane? Let's see for heptane: C7H16. H is 16/(100) (since 7*12=84 +16=100) \u2192 16/100=16% \u2192 still higher. Octane: C8H18 \u2192 H is 18/(120) = 15% \u2192 closer. Hmm, 15% vs 14.28%. Maybe the problem is considering an even larger alkane. Let me try C8H18 (octane): H is 18/(12*8 +18) =18/102\u224817.65%? Wait, no, 8*12=96 +18=114. 18/114\u224815.79%.\n\nHmm, not matching. Wait, maybe it's a cycloalkane? Let's see cyclohexane: C6H12 \u2192 same as hexene. Wait, cyclohexane is an alkane (saturated), so H% would be 12/(72 +12)=12/84=14.28%. Exactly! So cyclohexane (C6H12) is an alkane? Wait no, cyclohexane is a cycloalkane, which is indeed saturated. Its formula is C6H12, same as hexene. Wait, but cyclohexane is an alkane? No, alkanes are acyclic. But cyclohexane is a cycloalkane with the formula C6H12. Its hydrogen content is the same as hexene but it's saturated, so it won't react with bromine. So that fits. \n\nAh! So Z must be cyclohexane. Then, its formula is C6H12, which has a hydrogen mass fraction of exactly 14.28%. That matches the given data. And cyclohexane doesn't react with bromine water (since it's saturated). Also, when hydrogenated, it doesn't react further. \n\nSo that makes sense. Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nNow, the problem states that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Since Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y, the other component in Y must be another saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Wait, but since it's already saturated, hydrogenation wouldn't change it. So perhaps the other component in Y is another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. But since Y is formed via disproportionation of X, let's think about what the original mixture X could be.\n\nThe reaction is X (two liquids, which decolorize bromine) \u2192 Y (two liquids, including cyclohexane) via disproportionation with platinum when heated. \n\nDisproportionation usually involves a species acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in some cases, alkenes can undergo disproportionation. Wait, maybe the reaction involves converting an alkene into cyclohexane and something else? But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original mixture X consists of two different alkenes, which upon heating with platinum (maybe a catalyst for some rearrangement?), disproportionate into cyclohexane and another compound. \n\nWait, let me think about possible reactions. One common reaction involving alkenes and platinum might be isomerization or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes undergo a reaction where one is hydrogenated (reduction) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidation?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the reaction is disproportionation, perhaps one molecule of the alkene is oxidized (losing H?) and another is reduced (gaining H?), but since it's in the same mixture, maybe they form different products. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where they form cyclohexane and another compound. Let me think of possible alkenes that can form cyclohexane. For instance, if the alkenes are 1-hexene and another, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting materials are two different cycloalkenes? Like cyclohexene and something else? Wait, but cyclohexene would decolorize bromine. If they are in mixture X, and upon disproportionation (heating with Pt), they form cyclohexane and another product.\n\nWait, if X has two different cycloalkenes, say cyclohexene and another cycloalkene, then when they disproportionate, maybe one becomes cyclohexane (reduction) and another becomes something else. But the problem states that the products Y are two liquids that don't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are such that when they react, one becomes cyclohexane and another becomes another saturated compound. Let me think of the possibility that the two alkenes in X are 1-hexene and another isomer that, when they disproportionate, form cyclohexane and maybe another compound. Wait, perhaps via a Diels-Alder type reaction? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components of X are the same but in different conformations? No, equimolar mixture implies two different compounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting mixture X consists of two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, two different alkenes whose hydrogenation products are cyclohexane. Then, when they undergo disproportionation (maybe via some reaction where one is hydrogenated and another dehydrogenated?), but that's unclear.\n\nWait, the key here is that the disproportionation reaction leads to Y, which contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound. The other compound in Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane as well. Since when you hydrogenate Y, you get only Z (cyclohexane). \n\nSo the other component in Y must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Let's think of what that could be. Since cyclohexane is already saturated, the other compound must have a double bond or triple bond. Wait, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. Wait, but if it's saturated, then hydrogenation would not change it. Hmm, this is a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the other component in Y is a different saturated compound that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. That can't be, because saturated compounds don't react with hydrogen. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think again. Let me start over with the process:\n\nX (two alkenes) \u2192 upon heating with Pt (disproportionation) \u2192 Y (two liquids, one is Z=cyclohexane, the other is something else). \n\nHydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. So the other component in Y must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But since Y's components don't decolorize bromine (so they are saturated), that suggests that the other component is also a saturated compound. But if it's saturated, hydrogenation won't change it. Therefore, the only way this works is if the other component in Y is cyclohexane itself. But then Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and something else that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but that's impossible unless the other is unsaturated. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the other component in Y is saturated. The problem says that Y's liquids do not decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated (no double/triple bonds). Therefore, the other component must be a saturated compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Since it's already saturated, that can't happen. Therefore, maybe the other component is a different saturated compound which is actually the same as cyclohexane? But then Y would be a mixture of two same substances, which contradicts equimolar.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe problem states that the original mixture X has two liquids with no conjugated multiple bonds. So they are either isolated dienes, alkynes, or single double bonds. \n\nIf the products Y are two saturated liquids (since they don't decolorize bromine), then the reaction must be converting the unsaturated bonds into saturated ones. But since it's a disproportionation, perhaps one of the molecules loses a double bond (becomes more saturated) and the other gains a double bond (but that would mean it's less saturated?), but that contradicts because Y's components are saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is such that one molecule becomes more saturated (like going from alkene to alkane) and the other becomes a cycloalkane or something else. Wait, but both products in Y must be saturated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting materials are two different alkenes which, upon heating with platinum, undergo a rearrangement and hydrogen transfer. For example, maybe one becomes cyclohexane and another becomes something else, like another cycloalkane?\n\nWait, suppose the two alkenes in X are both hexenes but different isomers. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene. Upon heating with platinum, maybe they undergo a reaction where one forms cyclohexane and another forms another compound. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is similar to the Prins reaction or some cycloaddition? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are undergoing a Diels-Alder type reaction but in reverse? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total hydrogens in X. The question asks for the total H in the two liquids of X. Since Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y. \n\nLet me consider that hydrogenation of X (which is two alkenes) gives cyclohexane. Since hydrogenation of an alkene adds two H's across the double bond. Let's suppose that each alkene in X has one double bond. \n\nSuppose each alkene in X has the formula CnH2n. When hydrogenated, they become CnH2n+2. Since both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), that suggests that each alkene must be C6H10. Because adding two H's would give C6H12. \n\nWait, yes! If each alkene in X is a hexene (C6H12?), no. Wait, wait, let me think again. Wait, alkene formula is CnH2n. So if the hydrogenation product is C6H12 (cyclohexane), then the original must have been C6H10 (since adding 2 H's gives C6H12). But C6H10 would be an alkene (since C6H12 is alkane). Wait, no. Wait, CnH2n is alkene. So if the product is C6H12, then the original must have been C6H10 (since adding 2 H's gives C6H12). So each alkene in X would have to be C6H10, which would have one double bond (since C6H12 is the alkane, so subtracting two H's gives the alkene). \n\nWait, but C6H10 can also be a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene is C6H10) or an alkyne (since alkynes are CnH2n-2, so C6H10 would be a di-alkene or an alkyne with two triple bonds? Not sure). Wait, C6H10 could be a cycloalkene (like cyclohexene, which is C6H10), or an alkyne with one triple bond (since C6H10 would have 2n-2 H for alkyne: 2*6 -2=10. So yes, C6H10 can be an alkyne, like 1-hexyne (C6H10). \n\nWait, so the two components in X could be cyclohexene and another compound (maybe another alkyne or another diene?), but the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. \n\nAlternatively, the two components of X are two different alkenes (each C6H10) that don't have conjugated bonds. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene (isolated double bonds) or cyclohexene and another alkene. \n\nIf both are alkenes (each C6H10), then the total H in X would be 2*(10) =20 H, but the options don't have 20. Wait, options are 16,18,22,12. Hmm, so perhaps they are not both alkenes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one is an alkyne and the other is an alkene. Let me think. Suppose one is an alkyne (C6H10) and the other is an alkene (C6H12?), but no. Wait, alkynes have formula CnH2n-2. So for C6H10, 2n-2 =10 \u2192 2n=12 \u2192 n=6. So C6H10 is indeed an alkyne (like hexyne) or a cycloalkene. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two components are two different alkenes (each C6H10), so each has one double bond. Their total H would be 10 +10 =20, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two components are a diene and an alkyne? Let me see. Suppose one is a diene (so C6H10? Wait, a diene would have two double bonds, so formula is CnH2n-2. So for a diene in C6: 2n-2 = 2*6 -2*2? Wait, no. Let me compute for a diene: each double bond reduces H by 2. So one double bond gives C6H12-2= C6H10. Two double bonds would be C6H8. So a diene would have two double bonds, so formula C6H8. \n\nIf one component is a diene (C6H8) and another is an alkyne (C6H10), then total H is 8+10=18, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, if the two components are both dienes (each C6H8), total H would be 16 (8+8), which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two are a diene and a triene? But then even less H. \n\nThe problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So if they are dienes, they can't be conjugated. So for example, 1,3-pentadiene is conjugated, but 1,4-pentadiene is not. But in hexene, a diene could be like 1,5-hexadiene (isolated double bonds). \n\nSo if both are dienes (each C6H8), then total H is 16 (8+8), which is option A. But how does that fit into the disproportionation?\n\nWait, the reaction is that X (two liquids, maybe dienes) undergoes disproportionation to form Y (two liquids, including cyclohexane). \n\nLet me think of a possible disproportionation. For example, if you have two dienes (each C6H8) undergoing a reaction where one becomes cyclohexane (C6H12) and another becomes something else. \n\nWait, the total H in the reactants (X) would be 8+8=16. The products Y would have total H as 12 (for cyclohexane) plus the other component. Let me see:\n\nSuppose each diene (C6H8) can undergo a reaction where one loses a double bond (becomes more saturated, adding 4 H?), but that may not be. Alternatively, the reaction could be such that one molecule of diene becomes cyclohexane (adding 4 H, since C6H8 \u2192 C6H12 requires adding 4 H) and the other diene loses 4 H to become something else. Wait, but that would require a disproportionation where one gains H and another loses H. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one diene undergoes cyclization to form cyclohexene (which would then be part of Y?), but then Y's components must be saturated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two dienes (each C6H8) disproportionate into cyclohexane (C6H12) and another compound. Let's see the H balance. \n\nThe total H in X is 16. The product Y has two molecules. Let\u2019s say cyclohexane (12 H) plus another compound Y2. The total H in Y must equal the H in X (since it's a disproportionation reaction, not adding H from outside). Wait, but the reaction is with platinum when heated, maybe without H2? Not sure. \n\nWait, the problem states the reaction is \"treated with platinum when heated\", but it's not clear if H2 is present. Wait, the hydrogenation part is a separate step. The disproportionation reaction might not involve H2. \n\nAssuming that the total H is conserved (since no H is added or removed in the disproportionation), then:\n\nTotal H in X (16) must equal total H in Y (12 + H in the other product). So the other product must have 4 H. \n\nBut that's hard to imagine. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces two products where one is cyclohexane and another is something else with 4 H. But 4 H would be like CH4 or something, but that's not a liquid. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think again about the hydrogenation step. Both mixtures X and Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane). \n\nSo each component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, if X is two different alkenes, each hydrogenating to cyclohexane, then each must be a C6H10 (since adding 2 H gives C6H12). \n\nThus, each alkene in X has 10 H. So two of them would total 20 H. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alkynes. An alkyne (C6H10) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (adding 2 H per triple bond). Since an alkyne has one triple bond, adding two H's would make it an alkene, but full hydrogenation would require adding four H's (since triple bond becomes single: C\u2261C becomes C-C, adding 2 H's per bond? Wait, a triple bond requires adding two H2 molecules (4 H atoms) to become a single bond. So an alkyne (C6H10) would need to add 4 H to become cyclohexane. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nAn alkyne, say hexyne (C6H10). To hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12), you need to add 2 H's? Wait, no. Wait, the formula of hexyne is C6H10. Adding two H's would give C6H12 (an alkene?), but to get to the alkane, you need to add four H's. Wait, the formula for an alkane is C6H14. Wait, this is confusing. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nAlkynes have formula CnH2n-2. So for hexyne (n=6), it's C6H10. \n\nHydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane requires adding two H2 molecules (four H atoms) across the triple bond. So:\n\nC6H10 \u2192 C6H14 (alkane) requires adding 4 H. \n\nBut the problem states that when hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z (cyclohexane, which is C6H12). Wait, that's not an alkane. Wait, cyclohexane is a cycloalkane (C6H12), which is an alkane formula? No, cyclohexane has the same formula as an alkene (since it's a 6-membered ring, formula is C6H12). Wait, but cyclohexane is a saturated cycloalkane. Its formula is indeed C6H12. So an alkyne (C6H10) would need to add two H2 (four H atoms) to become cyclohexane? Let me see:\n\nC6H10 + 2 H2 \u2192 C6H14 (the alkane hexane). But that's not cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkyne is in a ring? \n\nWait, maybe the alkyne is in a cyclic form, like cyclohexyne (which is a cycloalkyne). But cyclohexyne would have the formula C6H10 as well. If you hydrogenate cyclohexyne, you would get cyclohexane (C6H12). So that would work. \n\nSo if one component of X is cyclohexyne (C6H10), then hydrogenating it would give cyclohexane (C6H12). \n\nAlternatively, if the other component is another unsaturated compound that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane. \n\nSuppose mixture X has two different compounds that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Let's say cyclohexyne and another compound, like 1-hexyne (linear alkyne). Both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane and hexane respectively. Wait, no. Wait, 1-hexyne would hydrogenate to hexane (C6H14), which is different from cyclohexane. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to approach this systematically. \n\nGiven that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), and that when you hydrogenate Y (which contains Z) you only get Z, then the other component in Y must also hydrogenate to Z. Since Y's components are saturated, the only way is that the other component is Z itself. But then Y would be a mixture of Z and something else that is already Z, which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the other component in Y is another cycloalkane that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. For example, maybe methylcyclopentane? No, that would hydrogenate to itself. \n\nWait, perhaps the other component in Y is a different cycloalkene? But then Y's components would decolorize bromine. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should focus on the total hydrogen in X. Let's see the options: 16,18,22,12.\n\nIf X has two molecules each with 8 H, total 16 (option A). For example, two dienes (each C6H8). Then when they disproportionate, they form cyclohexane (12 H) and another compound with 4 H (but that's impossible). Alternatively, maybe the other product is a different diene? No, because Y's components must not decolorize bromine. \n\nAlternatively, if the two components in X are each C6H10 (alkenes or alkynes), then total H is 20, which is not an option. \n\nWait, what if the two components are a diene and an alkyne? Let's see:\n\nSuppose one is a diene (C6H8) and the other is an alkyne (C6H10). Total H = 8+10=18 (option B). \n\nThen, when they disproportionate, perhaps the diene becomes cyclohexane (adding 4 H: C6H8 \u2192 C6H12), and the alkyne becomes something else. But where does the H come from? The alkyne would lose H? \n\nAlternatively, in the disproportionation reaction, one molecule gains H (becoming more saturated) and the other loses H (becoming less saturated?), but that contradicts since Y must be saturated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkyne becomes cyclohexane (adding 2 H), but then the diene would need to become another product. \n\nWait, let's think of the total H in X (18) must equal the H in Y (which has two products). Y contains cyclohexane (12 H) and another compound. Let's say the other compound has 6 H. 12+6=18. So that works. \n\nWhat's a saturated compound with C6 and 6 H? Wait, cyclohexane has 12 H. To have 6 H, it would be something like benzene? But benzene has 6 H (C6H6), which is a liquid? Benzene is a liquid, but it does decolorize bromine via addition (but in reality, benzene doesn't easily do so; it undergoes substitution). Hmm, but the problem states that Y's components do not decolorize bromine. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water (since it doesn't undergo addition easily). \n\nWait, benzene (C6H6) is a possibility. Let's see:\n\nIf X has a diene (C6H8) and an alkyne (C6H10), their total H is 18. \n\nIn the disproportionation reaction, the diene might form benzene (losing 2 H) and the alkyne forms cyclohexane (gaining 2 H). \n\nSo:\n\nC6H8 (diene) \u2192 C6H6 (benzene) \u2192 losing 2 H.\n\nC6H10 (alkyne) \u2192 C6H12 (cyclohexane) \u2192 gaining 2 H. \n\nTotal H remains 18 (8+10 =18 \u2192 6+12=18). \n\nThis balances. \n\nThen, Y is a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. Both are saturated (benzene is aromatic, doesn't have double bonds, so bromine won't decolorize). \n\nHydrogenation of Y would convert benzene to cyclohexane (adding 6 H), and cyclohexane remains. So the product is only cyclohexane (Z). That fits. \n\nSo this scenario works. \n\nThen, the two components in X are C6H8 (a diene) and C6H10 (an alkyne or cycloalkene). The total H in X would be 8 +10 =18. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 18. \n\nAlso, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. The diene would need to be non-conjugated. For example, 1,4-hexadiene (two isolated double bonds) would be acceptable. The alkyne (like cyclohexyne or hexyne) also doesn't have conjugated bonds. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) 18.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X, which consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**: \n   - Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which corresponds to a formula of C\u2086H\u2081\u2082 (calculated as 12/84 = 1/7). This matches cyclohexane, a saturated cycloalkane that does not decolorize bromine and does not react further with hydrogen.\n\n2. **Determine Components of Mixture X**:\n   - Mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form Y (containing Z and another saturated compound). Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields only Z.\n   - The components of X must hydrogenate to Z. Possible candidates are a diene (C\u2086H\u2088) and an alkyne (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080). \n   - Disproportionation converts the diene to benzene (C\u2086H\u2086) and the alkyne to cyclohexane (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082). This balances hydrogen (8 + 10 = 18 in X; 6 + 12 = 18 in Y).\n\n3. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - The diene (e.g., 1,4-hexadiene) and alkyne (e.g., hexyne or cyclohexyne) have no conjugated bonds, satisfying the problem's condition.\n   - The total hydrogen in X is 8 (from diene) + 10 (from alkyne) = 18.\n\n**Answer: B**",
