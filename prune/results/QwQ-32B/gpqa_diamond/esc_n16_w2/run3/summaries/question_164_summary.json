      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about comparing the masses of two binary star systems based on their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Hmm, I remember that in binary systems, the masses of the stars can be determined using Kepler's laws and the observed orbital period and radial velocities. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates these quantities. Kepler's third law for binary systems states that the sum of the masses of the two stars is proportional to the cube of the orbital period divided by the square of the semi-major axis. But since we're dealing with radial velocities, maybe there's another formula that uses the velocities directly.\n\nOh right, the formula involving the radial velocity amplitudes. The key equation here is probably the one that relates the masses to the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think. The formula is something like (M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = (P * (K1^3 + K2^3)) / (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) )... Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a binary system, the masses of the two stars can be found using their radial velocity amplitudes. The ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because the more massive star moves slower, so if one has a smaller velocity amplitude, it's more massive. \n\nBut the question is asking for the total mass of each system. Let me get this straight. The total mass M_total = M1 + M2. To find this, we can use Kepler's third law, which in the case of binary stars is given by (M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = ( (a1 + a2)^3 ) / (P^2) ), but since a1 + a2 is the semi-major axis of the orbit divided by some factor... Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward version when considering the radial velocity data.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that combines the radial velocity amplitudes, the period, and the masses. Let me recall that the mass function is involved here. The mass function f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (P * K1^3 )/(2\u03c0 G) ), but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the combined mass can be found using the formula involving the sum of the velocity amplitudes. Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a binary system, the masses are related to their velocities through the equation M1 v1 = M2 v2, since they orbit around the common center of mass. So, M1/M2 = v2/v1. \n\nAh, right. So the masses are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes. So in system 1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. Therefore, if I let M1 = 0.5*M2, then total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5*M2. Alternatively, maybe I should write both masses in terms of one variable. Let me set variables properly.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses of the two stars. Their velocities (radial velocity amplitudes) are K1a = 10 km/s and K1b = 5 km/s. \n\nSince they orbit each other, M1a * K1a = M1b * K1b. Wait, is that correct? Wait, the product of mass and velocity should be equal for both stars because they orbit the center of mass. So M1a * v1a = M1b * v1b. But the velocities here are the radial velocity amplitudes. So yes, that equation holds. \n\nSo rearranged, M1a/M1b = v1b / v1a = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 * M1b. \n\nTherefore, total mass of system 1 is M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b. \n\nSimilarly, for system 2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. Let their masses be M2a and M2b. \n\nM2a * 15 = M2b * 10 \u2192 M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b. \n\nTotal mass of system 2 is M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b. \n\nBut now, how do I relate the total masses between the two systems? Because I need to find M_total1 / M_total2. \n\nWait, but I also need to consider the orbital periods. Because the masses depend on the period as per Kepler's third law. \n\nHmm, right, the velocity amplitudes and the period are related through the orbital parameters. The formula that connects all these would involve the period and the masses. \n\nThe key equation here is probably the one derived from Kepler's third law for binary stars. The formula is:\n\n(M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = ( (a1 + a2)^3 ) / (P^2) )\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the version that relates the velocity amplitudes with the period and masses. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 G / P) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^{2/3} a )^{1/ something}... Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the mass function. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: The total mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using the formula involving the orbital period and the semi-major axis. But since we don't have the distance or the actual semi-major axis, but instead have the radial velocity amplitudes, perhaps we can relate them through the following.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is related to the orbital velocity. The orbital velocity v is related to the gravitational interaction. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v sin i), where v is the actual orbital velocity component along the line of sight. But since we are dealing with the amplitudes, which are maximum velocities, perhaps K = v sin i. \n\nBut since the stars are in a binary system, their orbital velocities are related to their masses and the separation. \n\nAlternatively, the velocities of the two stars are related to their masses and the orbital period. The formula for the velocity of each star is given by v = (2\u03c0 a sin i / P) * (M_other / (M_total))^{1/3} ), but I might be mixing variables here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the formula for the mass function, which is:\n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (P K1^3) / (2\u03c0 G) )\n\nBut if we can assume that the inclination angle i is the same for both systems (which we can't, but perhaps the question expects us to neglect the sin i term, assuming edge-on orbits or that the sini terms cancel out when taking the ratio), then maybe we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the ratio of the total masses of the two systems, perhaps the inclination angle cancels out in the ratio. \n\nLet me consider that the total mass M_total = M1 + M2. To find the ratio M_total1 / M_total2, we can use the equations derived from the velocities and periods.\n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nThe mass of the system (M_total) can be related to the orbital period P and the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 via the formula:\n\n(M_total) = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / ( 2 G \u03c0 ) )^(something). Wait, perhaps another way.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for circular orbits, the centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity. For each star:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0 r1 / P\n\nv2 = 2\u03c0 r2 / P\n\nAnd since r1 + r2 = a (the semi-major axis), and M1 r1 = M2 r2 (from center of mass), so r1/r2 = M2/M1. \n\nThe gravitational force is G M1 M2 / a\u00b2 = M1 v1\u00b2 / r1 = M2 v2\u00b2 / r2.\n\nSo combining these, we can get expressions for the masses. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses and period. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K of a star in a binary system is:\n\nK = (v sin i) \n\nwhere v is the actual orbital speed. \n\nThe orbital speed v is given by v = 2\u03c0 a / P, where a is the semi-major axis. \n\nBut the semi-major axis a is related to the masses via Kepler's third law: (M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / G \n\nSo a\u00b3 = ( G (M_total) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, a = [ G (M_total) P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting back into v:\n\nv = 2\u03c0 / P * [ G (M_total) P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify that:\n\nv = 2\u03c0 / P * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the cube root:\n\n(G M_total P\u00b2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nTaking the cube root gives [G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)]^(1/3) \n\nSo v = 2\u03c0 / P * [ G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify the exponents:\n\nLet me write the cube root as exponent 1/3:\n\n= 2\u03c0 / P * (G M_total)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe P terms: (P^2)^{1/3} is P^(2/3), so when multiplied by 1/P, that's P^(2/3 -1) = P^(-1/3). \n\nThe constants: 2\u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nLet me compute constants:\n\n(4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = 4^{1/3} \u03c0^(2/3)\n\nSo 2\u03c0 divided by that is 2\u03c0 / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) = 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's try to find an expression for K in terms of M_total and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each star, their velocities are related to their masses and the total mass. \n\nFrom the earlier equations, M1 v1 = M2 v2. So v1/v2 = M2/M1.\n\nLet me denote the velocities as K1 and K2 (since those are the observed radial velocity amplitudes). So K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) M2. \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + K2/K1) = M2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 )\n\nBut I need to relate this to the orbital period. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\n(M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nBut a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. The semi-major axis a is the sum of the individual semi-major axes a1 and a2. But since a1/a2 = M2/M1 (from center of mass), so a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total. \n\nWait, perhaps instead of dealing with a, we can use the velocities. \n\nThe total mass can also be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period. Let me think of the velocity of each star. \n\nThe orbital speed of each star is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P and v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P. \n\nBut since a1 + a2 = a (the total semi-major axis), and a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a. \n\nThus, v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nThe total mass M_total = M1 + M2 \n\nFrom Kepler's third law: \n\n(M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \u2192 a\u00b3 = (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstitute this back into v1:\n\nv1 = (2\u03c0/P) * (M2/(M_total)) * [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify that term:\n\nThe term [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 ) can be written as (G M_total)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3)\n\nSo putting back:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total)^{1/3} (P^2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe P terms: (P^2)^{1/3} / P = P^{2/3} / P^1 = P^{-1/3}\n\nThe constants: 2 \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nThe M terms: (M2 / M_total) * (M_total)^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}\n\nSo putting together:\n\nv1 = [2 \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ] * (M2) * M_total^{-2/3} * (G)^{1/3} * P^{-1/3} \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should consider that the velocities are related to the mass function. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total mass can be found via the formula:\n\nK1^3 / (K2^3) = (M2^3)/(M1^3)\n\nWait, earlier we had that M1/M2 = K2/K1. So (M1/M2)^3 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (M1^3)/(M2^3) = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (M1^3) = (M2^3)(K2/K1)^3 \u2192 which might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula that allows the total mass to be expressed in terms of the two velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me look for such a relationship.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Let me consider that for each system, the total mass M_total is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by something involving the period. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function. The mass function for a star in a binary system is f(m) = (M_secondary^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_primary + M_secondary)^2 )\n\nBut since we have two stars, each with their own mass function. However, the problem states that the periods are the same for both systems (but different between systems), so maybe we can take the ratio of the mass functions between the two systems. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to use the formula that the total mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by the period squared, all over some constants, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the formula for the velocity of each star. \n\nThe velocity of each star is related to their mass and the total mass. Let me denote for system 1:\n\nLet\u2019s use the fact that the velocity of each star is proportional to the other star's mass. \n\nThe velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. \n\nSo for system 1:\n\nM1a / M1b = K1b / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTotal mass system 1: M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, system 2:\n\nM2a / M2b = K2b / K2a = 10/15 \u2248 0.666\u2026 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass system 2: M2_total = M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, the problem is to find M1_total / M2_total. But I can\u2019t compute this ratio yet because M1b and M2b are different variables. I need another relation between them, which probably comes from the orbital periods. \n\nAh, right. The orbital period is related to the masses and the separation. Since we have different periods for the two systems (2 years and 1 year), we can use Kepler's third law to relate the masses and periods. \n\nKepler's third law states that (M_total) * P^2 = (a^3) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G), where a is the semi-major axis. But since we don't have a, we need to relate the velocities. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of each star is related to the orbital period and the separation. The velocity of a star in a circular orbit is v = 2\u03c0a/(P). Since the separation between the two stars is a = a1 + a2. \n\nBut from the center of mass, a1/a2 = M2/M1. So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSo the velocity of star 1 (with mass M1) is v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * a1 \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * a2 \n\nThen, v1 / v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 which matches the earlier relation. \n\nBut how to relate velocity and period to mass?\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the velocity in terms of the total mass. \n\nLet me recall that for a circular orbit, the orbital speed v is given by v = sqrt( G (M_total) / a ), where a is the distance from the star to the center of mass? Wait, no. Wait, the orbital speed of each star is related to the total mass and the separation between them. \n\nThe total separation between the two stars is a_total = a1 + a2. \n\nThe orbital speed of star 1 is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSimilarly for star 2: v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThe gravitational force between them is G M1 M2 / a_total\u00b2 = M1 v1\u00b2 / a1 \n\nSo substituting v1:\n\nG M1 M2 / a_total\u00b2 = M1 ( (2\u03c0 a1 / P )^2 ) / a1 \n\nSimplify:\n\nG M2 / a_total\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1\u00b2 ) / (P\u00b2 a1 )\n\n\u2192 G M2 / a_total\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1 / P\u00b2 \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a_total \n\nSo substituting a1 into the equation:\n\nG M2 / a_total\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( M2/(M1 + M2) a_total ) / P\u00b2 \n\nMultiply both sides by a_total\u00b2:\n\nG M2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( M2/(M1 + M2) a_total^3 ) / P\u00b2 \n\nCancel M2 from both sides (assuming M2 \u22600):\n\nG = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( a_total^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2) P\u00b2 )\n\nRearranged:\n\n(M1 + M2) P\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total^3 / G \n\nWhich is Kepler's third law. \n\nHmm. So this brings us back to Kepler's third law. But how to relate this to the velocities?\n\nLet me see. From the velocities, v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a_total \n\nThus, v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) a_total \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * ( M1/(M_total) ) a_total \n\nLet me express a_total in terms of Kepler's third law. From Kepler's law:\n\na_total^3 = (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a_total = [ (G M_total P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3 }\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for v1:\n\nv1 = [ 2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ M2 / M_total ] * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nLet me separate the exponents:\n\nThe term (G M_total P\u00b2)^{1/3} can be written as G^{1/3} M_total^{1/3} P^{2/3}\n\nSo putting back:\n\nv1 = [2 \u03c0 / P ] * (M2 / M_total) * [ G^{1/3} M_total^{1/3} P^{2/3} ] / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3} )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nThe M_total terms: (M2 / M_total) * M_total^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}\n\nThe P terms: (1/P) * P^{2/3} = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}\n\nThe constants: 2 \u03c0 divided by 4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3} \n\nLet me compute constants first:\n\n2 / 4^{1/3} = 2 / (2^{2/3}) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^{1/3}\n\n\u03c0 / \u03c0^{2/3} = \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nThus, the constants together give 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nPutting all together:\n\nv1 = 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} * M2 * M_total^{-2/3} * G^{1/3} * P^{-1/3} \n\nHmm. Let me factor out the constants:\n\nThe constants can be written as (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} \n\nWait, 2^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3} * G^{1/3} = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3}\n\nSo:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * M2 * M_total^{-2/3} * P^{-1/3}\n\nRearranged:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M2 / M_total^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSimilarly, the same approach for v2 would give:\n\nv2 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1 / M_total^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nNow, since we have both v1 and v2 for each system, perhaps we can take the ratio of v1 and v2 for each system and relate it to the mass ratio.\n\nBut let's consider for each system:\n\nLet me write the expressions for v1 and v2 for system 1 and system 2.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nv1a = 10 km/s, v1b =5 km/s \n\nSimilarly for system 2, v2a =15, v2b=10.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the amplitudes are given as for each system:\n\nIn system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5. \n\nIn system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10. \n\nSo, for each system, the velocities are given. Let me write equations for each system.\n\nStarting with system 1:\n\nLet me write equations for both stars in system 1. \n\nFor star 1a (with velocity 10 km/s):\n\nv1a = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1b / M_total1^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nSimilarly, for star 1b (velocity 5 km/s):\n\nv1b = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1a / M_total1^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nWe can take the ratio of these two equations:\n\nv1a / v1b = (M1b / M1a )\n\nBut earlier, we found that M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a \u2192 M1a = (v1b / v1a) * M1b \u2192 which checks out. \n\nSo that's consistent with our earlier ratio. \n\nBut to get the total mass, let's try to express M_total in terms of the velocities and period.\n\nLet me cube both equations for v1a and v1b, then add them?\n\nWait, maybe let's cube each equation and then add them. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me cube the equation for v1a:\n\nv1a^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * (M1b^3 / M_total1^2 ) * P1^{-1}\n\nSimilarly, v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M1a^3 / M_total1^2 ) * P1^{-1}\n\nAdding them together:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1) * ( M1b^3 + M1a^3 ) / M_total1^2 \n\nHmm, but M1a and M1b are related. Since M1a = (K1b/K1a) M1b = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b \n\nSo M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 M1a^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 = (1/8) M1b^3 \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (1/8 +1 ) M1b^3 = (9/8) M1b^3 \n\nThe total mass M_total1 = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M_total1 = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 \n\nSo substituting M1b = (2/3) M_total1 into the numerator:\n\nM1a^3 + M1b^3 = (9/8) ( (2/3 M_total1 )^3 ) \n\nWait, let me compute M1b^3:\n\nM1b = (2/3) M_total1 \u2192 M1b^3 = (8/27) M_total1^3 \n\nSo M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (1/8 +1) * ( (2/3 M_total1)^3 ) \n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. \n\nWait, the numerator in the sum v1a^3 + v1b^3 is (M1a^3 + M1b^3). \n\nWe have M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 so M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 + M1b^3 = (0.125 +1) M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nThen, substituting M1b = (2/3) M_total1 (since M_total1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 ), so:\n\nM1b^3 = (2/3)^3 M_total1^3 \u2192 8/27 M_total1^3 \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = 1.125 * (8/27) M_total1^3 \n\n1.125 is 9/8, so 9/8 * 8/27 = 9/27 = 1/3 \u2192 so 1/3 M_total1^3 \n\nTherefore, the numerator is (1/3) M_total1^3 \n\nSo putting back into the equation for v1a^3 + v1b^3:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1 ) * ( (1/3 M_total1^3 ) ) / M_total1^2 \n\nSimplify denominator M_total1^2: \n\nSo (1/3 M_total1^3 ) / M_total1^2 = (1/3) M_total1 \n\nThus:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1 ) * (1/3 M_total1 )\n\nRearranged:\n\nM_total1 = 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSimilarly, for system 2:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2 ) * ( (M2a^3 + M2b^3 ) / M_total2^2 )\n\nFollowing similar steps for system 2:\n\nM2a = (K2b/K2a)*M2b = (10/15)*M2b = (2/3) M2b \n\nThus, M2a^3 = (8/27) M2b^3 \n\nTotal mass M_total2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nSo M2b = (3/5) M_total2 \n\nThen, M2a^3 + M2b^3 = (8/27 M2b^3) + M2b^3 = (8/27 + 27/27) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nExpressed in terms of M_total2:\n\nM2b = 3/5 M_total2 \u2192 M2b^3 = (27/125) M_total2^3 \n\nSo M2a^3 + M2b^3 = 35/27 * (27/125) M_total2^3 = (35/125) M_total2^3 = (7/25) M_total2^3 \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. \n\nWait, M2a^3 + M2b^3 is ( (2/3 M2b)^3 + M2b^3 ) = (8/27 +1) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nThen substituting M2b = (3/5) M_total2 \u2192 M2b^3 = (3/5)^3 M_total2^3 = 27/125 M_total2^3 \n\nSo 35/27 * (27/125) = 35/125 = 7/25 \u2192 yes, so numerator is 7/25 M_total2^3 \n\nSo putting back into the equation:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 \n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 = (7/25) M_total2 \n\nThus:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\n\u2192 M_total2 = (25/(7)) * (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nNow, the key is to take the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2.\n\nLet me write:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = [ 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 / (2 \u03c0 G ) ] / [ (25/7) (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 / (2 \u03c0 G) ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 G terms cancel out. \n\nSo:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = [ 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 ] / [ (25/7) (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= (3 * 7 / 25 ) * (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) / (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) * ( P1 / P2 )\n\n= (21 / 25 ) * [ (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) / (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) ] * ( P1 / P2 )\n\nNow plug in the numbers. \n\nFirst compute v1a^3 + v1b^3 for system 1: \n\nv1a =10 km/s, v1b=5 km/s \u2192 their cubes are 1000 and 125 \u2192 sum is 1125 \n\nSimilarly for system 2: v2a=15, v2b=10 \u2192 3375 + 1000 = 4375 \n\nSo (1125)/(4375) = 1125/4375 \n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 25 \u2192 45/175 \u2192 divide by 5 \u2192 9/35 \n\nSo that fraction is 9/35 \n\nThe P1/P2 ratio is 2 years / 1 year = 2 \n\nPutting all together:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = (21/25) * (9/35) * 2 \n\nCompute step by step:\n\n21/25 * 9/35 = (21*9)/(25*35) \n\n21 and 35 have a common factor of 7 \u2192 21=3*7, 35=5*7 \u2192 so 3/5 * 9/ (25/7?) Wait let me compute:\n\n21 divided by 35 is 3/5. So:\n\n21/35 = 3/5, so (21/25)*(9/35) = (3/5)*(9/25) \u2192 27/(125) \n\nWait, no, let me do it properly:\n\n21 *9 = 189 \n\n25 *35 = 875 \n\nSo 189/875 \u2192 then multiplied by 2:\n\n189/875 *2 = 378/875 \n\nSimplify that fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n378 \u00f77 = 54 \n\n875 \u00f77 = 125 \n\nSo 54/125 \u2192 0.432 \n\nSo approximately 0.432. \n\nThe question asks by what factor is system 1 more massive than system 2. So the ratio is ~0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or B (0.6). \n\nHmm, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6. \n\n0.432 is closer to 0.4. \n\nWait but let me check the calculations again because I might have messed up a step.\n\nLet me re-calculate the ratio step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = (21/25) * (9/35) * 2 \n\n21/25 * 9/35 = (21*9)/(25*35) \n\n21*9 = 189 \n\n25*35 = 875 \n\nSo 189/875. Multiply by 2 gives 378/875. \n\n378 divided by 875: \n\nLet me compute 378 \u00f7 875. \n\nWell, 378 \u00f7 875 = 0.432. \n\nYes. \n\nSo 0.432 is approximately 0.4, so option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the M2a^3 + M2b^3 correctly. \n\nWait for system 2:\n\nM2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nSo M2a^3 = (8/27) M2b^3 \n\nM2a^3 + M2b^3 = (8/27 + 1) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nThen when substituting M2b = (3/5) M_total2, so M2b^3 = (3/5)^3 M_total2^3 = 27/125 M_total2^3 \n\nThus, M2a^3 + M2b^3 = (35/27)*(27/125) M_total2^3 = (35/125) M_total2^3 = 7/25 M_total2^3 \n\nWait, but in the equation for system 2, the numerator in the equation for v2a^3 + v2b^3 is (M2a^3 + M2b^3) = (7/25) M_total2^3 \n\nSo the equation was:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 \n\nWhich simplifies to (7/25 M_total2 ) * (2 \u03c0 G / P2 )\n\nTherefore, when solving for M_total2:\n\nM_total2 = (25/7) * (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) * P2 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThen the ratio:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = [3 (v1a^3 +v1b^3) P1 / ... ] divided by [ (25/7)(v2a^3 +v2b^3) P2 / ... ]\n\nSo the 25/7 is in the denominator of the second term, so when you invert and multiply, it becomes multiplying by 7/25. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the ratio is ~0.43, so the closest option is A) ~0.4. \n\nTherefore the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula somewhere. Let me check the steps again. \n\nWait, when I derived the expression for M_total1, I had:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1) * (1/3 M_total1 )\n\nSo solving for M_total1 gives:\n\nM_total1 = 3 (v1a^3 +v1b^3) * P1 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSimilarly for M_total2: \n\nM_total2 = (25/7) (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, no. Wait the equation for system 2 was:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nM_total2 = (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2 * 25/(7 * 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nStarting from:\n\nv2a^3 +v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\nSo multiply both sides by P2/(2 \u03c0 G):\n\n(v2a^3 +v2b^3 ) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G) = 7/25 M_total2 \n\nThen multiply both sides by 25/7:\n\n(25/7)(v2a^3 + ... ) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G) = M_total2 \n\nYes, so M_total2 = (25/7) * (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThus, the ratio is indeed as calculated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass functions. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe mass of the system (M_total) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P ) / ( 2.79 * 10^{-5} ) \n\nWait, but this might be a formula I'm misremembering. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula derived earlier, the total mass is proportional to (v1^3 + v2^3) * P. \n\nWait, in the equations above, for system 1:\n\nM_total1 = 3*(v1a\u00b3 + v1b\u00b3)*P1/(2\u03c0G) \n\nSimilarly for system 2, M_total2 = (25/7)*(v2a\u00b3 +v2b\u00b3)*P2/(2\u03c0G)\n\nThus, the ratio M1/M2 is [3*(1125)*2 ] / [ (25/7)*(4375)*1 ]\n\nWait, perhaps plugging numbers directly without the G terms (since they cancel):\n\nYes, the ratio is (3*(10\u00b3 +5\u00b3)*2 ) / ( (25/7)*(15\u00b3 +10\u00b3)*1 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst compute numerator terms:\n\n10^3 = 1000, 5^3=125 \u2192 sum is 1125 \n\nMultiply by 3 and by 2 (P1=2):\n\n3 * 1125 *2 = 6750 \n\nDenominator terms:\n\n15^3=3375, 10^3=1000 \u2192 sum is 4375 \n\nMultiply by (25/7) and P2=1:\n\n(25/7)*4375 *1 = (25 *4375)/7 \n\nCalculate 4375 /7: 4375 \u00f77 = 625 (since 7*625 = 4375)\n\nSo denominator becomes 25 *625 = 15625 \n\nThus the ratio is 6750 /15625 \n\nCalculate this division:\n\n6750 \u00f715625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750/25 = 270; 15625/25 = 625 \n\n270 /625 = 0.432 \n\nSame result as before. \n\nSo the ratio is ~0.432, which is approximately 0.4. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\n\nB) ~ 0.6\n\nC) ~ 1.2\n\nD) ~ 0.7\n\n0.43 is closer to 0.4 (option A) than 0.6. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made an error in assuming that the inclination angle i is the same for both systems. \n\nThe formula I used assumes that sin^3 i is the same for both systems. Because in the equations, when we derived M_total, we had terms with sin i in them. Wait, wait a second! Oh no! I think I forgot the sin^3 i term. \n\nOh no! That's a critical mistake. \n\nLooking back at the equations, the original formula for v1 had a sin i term because the observed velocity is K = v sin i. \n\nWait, in my previous derivation, I assumed that K = v, but actually K = v sin i. \n\nSo all the previous calculations missed the sin^3 i term. \n\nOh no, this changes everything. \n\nThis means that the total mass is actually proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P / sin^3 i. \n\nBut since we don't know the inclination angle i for either system, unless the question assumes that both systems have the same inclination (e.g., edge-on, so sin i =1), then the ratio would be as calculated. \n\nThe problem statement doesn't mention anything about the inclination angle, so perhaps we are to assume that the systems are edge-on (sin i =1), or that the ratio of the masses is independent of sin i because it cancels out in the ratio. \n\nWait, in the ratio of the masses, since both systems would have the same sin^3 i term (assuming same inclination), but since we don't know their inclinations, maybe the question expects us to neglect the sin i term. \n\nThe question says \"Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\" So perhaps the question assumes that the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i =1. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be formulated such that the mass ratio can be found without considering the inclination, because the inclination cancels out in the ratio. \n\nWait, let me re-express the ratio calculation including sin^3 i. \n\nIn the equations, the total mass for each system is:\n\nM_total1 = [3 (K1a^3 + K1b^3) P1 ] / ( 2 \u03c0 G sin^3 i1 )\n\nSimilarly for system 2: \n\nM_total2 = [ (25/7) (K2a^3 + K2b^3) P2 ] / ( 2 \u03c0 G sin^3 i2 )\n\nThus the ratio is:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = [3 (K1 terms) P1 / sin^3 i1 ] / [ (25/7) (K2 terms) P2 / sin^3 i2 ]\n\n= (21/25) * [ (K1 terms)/(K2 terms) ] * (P1/P2) * [ sin^3 i2 / sin^3 i1 ]\n\nUnless sin i1 = sin i2, the ratio depends on the inclination. \n\nSince the problem does not provide information about the inclination angles, we must assume that they are the same, or that the question ignores this term (i.e., assumes edge-on orbits where sin i =1 for both). \n\nGiven that the question is from an exam, it's likely that we can assume sin i =1 for both systems, so the ratio is as calculated (~0.43), so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the equations. \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nAnother approach using the mass ratio formula:\n\nThe mass of each star can be found via the formula involving their velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nThe formula for the mass of each star in a binary system is:\n\nM1 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G) * ( (K2 * P / (2 \u03c0))\u00b2 * a ) / something... Hmm, perhaps better to use the formula:\n\nThe masses can be calculated using:\n\nM1 = (K2^3 P) / (2.79 * 10^{-5}) \n\nWait, this formula comes from rearranging Kepler's third law for radial velocity amplitudes. \n\nWait, I recall that the mass function f(m) = (M sin^3 i)/( (1 + q)^2 ) where q = M2/M1, but I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, there's a standard formula for the mass of a star in a binary system: \n\nIf you have the velocity amplitude K, the mass of the other star is given by: \n\nM = (K^3 P) / (2.79 * 10^{-5}) \n\nBut this assumes that the mass of the other star is negligible, which isn't the case here. \n\nAlternatively, for a two-body system, the total mass can be related to the velocities and period via the formula:\n\n(M_total) = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / (2.79e-5) \n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the exact formula. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula derived earlier, but with the sin i terms:\n\nM_total = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / ( 2.79e-5 * sin^3 i )\n\nBut since we can't know sin i, perhaps the question assumes edge-on (sin i=1). \n\nAssuming sin i =1, then the ratio is as calculated ~0.43 \u2192 answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me try a different method. \n\nLet me use the formula for the mass of a binary system. \n\nThe mass of the system is given by:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2.79e-5 * sin^3 i )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the velocity amplitudes in terms of the masses and period is:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * ( M2 / (M_total)^{2/3} ) * ( P^{-1/3} )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * ( M1 / (M_total)^{2/3} ) * ( P^{-1/3} )\n\nThus, \n\nK1/K2 = M2/M1 \n\nWhich we already have. \n\nNow, let me cube both sides of the equations for K1 and K2 and add them:\n\nK1^3 + K2^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * ( M2^3 + M1^3 ) / ( M_total^{2} ) * P^{-1} \n\nThus,\n\nM_total^2 = ( M1^3 + M2^3 ) / ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^{-1} * (2 \u03c0 G)^{-1} ) \n\nWait, solving for M_total:\n\nM_total^2 = ( (M1^3 + M2^3) * 2 \u03c0 G ) / ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P )\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. \n\nAlternatively, rearrange for M_total:\n\nM_total = [ ( M1^3 + M2^3 ) * 2 \u03c0 G * P ] / ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * M_total^2 ) \n\nWait, this seems messy. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between M1 and M2. \n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nM1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nM_total1 = 1.5 M1b \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 + M1b^3 = (0.125 +1 ) M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nThen, substituting into the equation for K1a^3 + K1b^3:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * ( M1b^3 + 0.125 M1b^3 ) / ( (1.5 M1b)^2 ) * P1^{-1} \n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, K1^3 + K2^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M2^3 + M1^3) / M_total^2 * P^{-1} \n\nSo for system 1:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M1b^3 + M1a^3) / (M_total1)^2 * P1^{-1} \n\nBut M1a^3 + M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nM_total1 = 1.5 M1b \n\nThus, denominator (M_total1)^2 = (2.25) M1b^2 \n\nSo:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (1.125 M1b^3) / (2.25 M1b^2) ) * P1^{-1} \n\nSimplify:\n\n1.125 / 2.25 = 0.5 \n\nSo this becomes (2 \u03c0 G) * 0.5 M1b * P1^{-1} \n\nThus:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = ( \u03c0 G ) * M1b / P1 \n\nBut M_total1 = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 \n\nSubstituting:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = ( \u03c0 G ) * (2/3 M_total1 ) / P1 \n\nRearranged:\n\nM_total1 = (3 (K1a^3 + K1b^3) P1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. \n\nThus, the previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A) ~0.4. \n\nBut wait, the options given include B) 0.6. Did I miscalculate the numerical value? \n\nLet me recalculate the ratio with the numbers again carefully:\n\nFor system1:\n\nK1a =10, K1b=5 \u2192 sum of cubes: 1000+125=1125 \n\nP1 =2 \n\nFor system2:\n\nK2a=15, K2b=10 \u2192 sum of cubes: 3375 +1000=4375 \n\nP2 =1 \n\nRatio M1/M2 = (3 * 1125 *2 ) / ( (25/7) *4375 *1 )\n\nCompute numerator: 3*1125=3375 \u2192 *2=6750 \n\nDenominator: (25/7)*4375 = 25/7 *4375 \n\n4375 divided by 7 is 625 \u2192 25*625 = 15625 \n\nThus, 6750 /15625 = 0.432 \n\nSo 0.432 is approximately 0.4. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is option A. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option B (0.6)? Maybe I made a mistake in the mass functions. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the formulas for M_total1 and M_total2. \n\nWait in system2, the coefficient was 25/7. Let me recheck that:\n\nFor system2:\n\nWe had M_total2 = (25/7)*(v2a\u00b3 +v2b^3)*P2/(2\u03c0G) \n\nThe 25/7 comes from the fact that in system2, the numerator term was (7/25) M_total2^3, so when solving for M_total2, you have to multiply by 25/7. \n\nYes, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass function for each system is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the mass ratio for system2. \n\nWait, for system2, the mass ratio M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTherefore, the total mass is M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \u2192 correct. \n\nThus the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A) ~0.4. \n\nBut let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) ~0.4\n\nB) ~0.6\n\nC) ~1.2\n\nD) ~0.7\n\n0.43 is closest to A. So the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is option A. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about comparing the masses of two binary star systems based on their orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. Hmm, I remember that in binary systems, the masses of the stars can be determined using Kepler's laws and the observed orbital period and radial velocities. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates these quantities. Kepler's third law for binary systems states that the sum of the masses of the two stars is proportional to the cube of the orbital period divided by the square of the semi-major axis. But since we're dealing with radial velocities, maybe there's another formula that uses the velocities directly.\n\nOh right, the formula involving the radial velocity amplitudes. The key equation here is probably the one that relates the masses to the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me think. The formula is something like (M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = (P * (K1^3 + K2^3)) / (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3) )... Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that for a binary system, the masses of the two stars can be found using their radial velocity amplitudes. The ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because the more massive star moves slower, so if one has a smaller velocity amplitude, it's more massive. \n\nBut the question is asking for the total mass of each system. Let me get this straight. The total mass M_total = M1 + M2. To find this, we can use Kepler's third law, which in the case of binary stars is given by (M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = ( (a1 + a2)^3 ) / (P^2) ), but since a1 + a2 is the semi-major axis of the orbit divided by some factor... Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward version when considering the radial velocity data.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that combines the radial velocity amplitudes, the period, and the masses. Let me recall that the mass function is involved here. The mass function f(m) = (M2^3 sin^3i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (P * K1^3 )/(2\u03c0 G) ), but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the combined mass can be found using the formula involving the sum of the velocity amplitudes. Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a binary system, the masses are related to their velocities through the equation M1 v1 = M2 v2, since they orbit around the common center of mass. So, M1/M2 = v2/v1. \n\nAh, right. So the masses are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes. So in system 1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. Therefore, if I let M1 = 0.5*M2, then total mass M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5*M2. Alternatively, maybe I should write both masses in terms of one variable. Let me set variables properly.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nLet M1a and M1b be the masses of the two stars. Their velocities (radial velocity amplitudes) are K1a = 10 km/s and K1b = 5 km/s. \n\nSince they orbit each other, M1a * K1a = M1b * K1b. Wait, is that correct? Wait, the product of mass and velocity should be equal for both stars because they orbit the center of mass. So M1a * v1a = M1b * v1b. But the velocities here are the radial velocity amplitudes. So yes, that equation holds. \n\nSo rearranged, M1a/M1b = v1b / v1a = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 * M1b. \n\nTherefore, total mass of system 1 is M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b. \n\nSimilarly, for system 2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. Let their masses be M2a and M2b. \n\nM2a * 15 = M2b * 10 \u2192 M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b. \n\nTotal mass of system 2 is M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b. \n\nBut now, how do I relate the total masses between the two systems? Because I need to find M_total1 / M_total2. \n\nWait, but I also need to consider the orbital periods. Because the masses depend on the period as per Kepler's third law. \n\nHmm, right, the velocity amplitudes and the period are related through the orbital parameters. The formula that connects all these would involve the period and the masses. \n\nThe key equation here is probably the one derived from Kepler's third law for binary stars. The formula is:\n\n(M1 + M2) * sin^3 i = ( (a1 + a2)^3 ) / (P^2) )\n\nBut maybe it's better to use the version that relates the velocity amplitudes with the period and masses. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by:\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 G / P) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^{2/3} a )^{1/ something}... Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the mass function. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: The total mass of the system (M_total = M1 + M2) can be found using the formula involving the orbital period and the semi-major axis. But since we don't have the distance or the actual semi-major axis, but instead have the radial velocity amplitudes, perhaps we can relate them through the following.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is related to the orbital velocity. The orbital velocity v is related to the gravitational interaction. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v sin i), where v is the actual orbital velocity component along the line of sight. But since we are dealing with the amplitudes, which are maximum velocities, perhaps K = v sin i. \n\nBut since the stars are in a binary system, their orbital velocities are related to their masses and the separation. \n\nAlternatively, the velocities of the two stars are related to their masses and the orbital period. The formula for the velocity of each star is given by v = (2\u03c0 a sin i / P) * (M_other / (M_total))^{1/3} ), but I might be mixing variables here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the formula for the mass function, which is:\n\nf(m) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (P K1^3) / (2\u03c0 G) )\n\nBut if we can assume that the inclination angle i is the same for both systems (which we can't, but perhaps the question expects us to neglect the sin i term, assuming edge-on orbits or that the sini terms cancel out when taking the ratio), then maybe we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the ratio of the total masses of the two systems, perhaps the inclination angle cancels out in the ratio. \n\nLet me consider that the total mass M_total = M1 + M2. To find the ratio M_total1 / M_total2, we can use the equations derived from the velocities and periods.\n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nThe mass of the system (M_total) can be related to the orbital period P and the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 via the formula:\n\n(M_total) = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / ( 2 G \u03c0 ) )^(something). Wait, perhaps another way.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for circular orbits, the centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity. For each star:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0 r1 / P\n\nv2 = 2\u03c0 r2 / P\n\nAnd since r1 + r2 = a (the semi-major axis), and M1 r1 = M2 r2 (from center of mass), so r1/r2 = M2/M1. \n\nThe gravitational force is G M1 M2 / a\u00b2 = M1 v1\u00b2 / r1 = M2 v2\u00b2 / r2.\n\nSo combining these, we can get expressions for the masses. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses and period. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K of a star in a binary system is:\n\nK = (v sin i) \n\nwhere v is the actual orbital speed. \n\nThe orbital speed v is given by v = 2\u03c0 a / P, where a is the semi-major axis. \n\nBut the semi-major axis a is related to the masses via Kepler's third law: (M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3) / G \n\nSo a\u00b3 = ( G (M_total) P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, a = [ G (M_total) P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting back into v:\n\nv = 2\u03c0 / P * [ G (M_total) P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify that:\n\nv = 2\u03c0 / P * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the cube root:\n\n(G M_total P\u00b2) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) \n\nTaking the cube root gives [G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)]^(1/3) \n\nSo v = 2\u03c0 / P * [ G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify the exponents:\n\nLet me write the cube root as exponent 1/3:\n\n= 2\u03c0 / P * (G M_total)^{1/3} (P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe P terms: (P^2)^{1/3} is P^(2/3), so when multiplied by 1/P, that's P^(2/3 -1) = P^(-1/3). \n\nThe constants: 2\u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nLet me compute constants:\n\n(4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} = 4^{1/3} \u03c0^(2/3)\n\nSo 2\u03c0 divided by that is 2\u03c0 / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3}) ) = 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = 2 / 4^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's try to find an expression for K in terms of M_total and P.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each star, their velocities are related to their masses and the total mass. \n\nFrom the earlier equations, M1 v1 = M2 v2. So v1/v2 = M2/M1.\n\nLet me denote the velocities as K1 and K2 (since those are the observed radial velocity amplitudes). So K1/K2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M1 = (K2/K1) M2. \n\nTotal mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + K2/K1) = M2 ( (K1 + K2)/K1 )\n\nBut I need to relate this to the orbital period. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\n(M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \n\nBut a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. The semi-major axis a is the sum of the individual semi-major axes a1 and a2. But since a1/a2 = M2/M1 (from center of mass), so a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total. \n\nWait, perhaps instead of dealing with a, we can use the velocities. \n\nThe total mass can also be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period. Let me think of the velocity of each star. \n\nThe orbital speed of each star is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P and v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P. \n\nBut since a1 + a2 = a (the total semi-major axis), and a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a. \n\nThus, v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M1/(M1 + M2)) a \n\nThe total mass M_total = M1 + M2 \n\nFrom Kepler's third law: \n\n(M_total) P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/G \u2192 a\u00b3 = (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a = [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstitute this back into v1:\n\nv1 = (2\u03c0/P) * (M2/(M_total)) * [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me simplify that term:\n\nThe term [ (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 ) can be written as (G M_total)^(1/3) (P\u00b2)^(1/3) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^(1/3)\n\nSo putting back:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total)^{1/3} (P^2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe P terms: (P^2)^{1/3} / P = P^{2/3} / P^1 = P^{-1/3}\n\nThe constants: 2 \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} \n\nThe M terms: (M2 / M_total) * (M_total)^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}\n\nSo putting together:\n\nv1 = [2 \u03c0 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3} ] * (M2) * M_total^{-2/3} * (G)^{1/3} * P^{-1/3} \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should consider that the velocities are related to the mass function. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total mass can be found via the formula:\n\nK1^3 / (K2^3) = (M2^3)/(M1^3)\n\nWait, earlier we had that M1/M2 = K2/K1. So (M1/M2)^3 = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (M1^3)/(M2^3) = (K2/K1)^3 \u2192 (M1^3) = (M2^3)(K2/K1)^3 \u2192 which might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a formula that allows the total mass to be expressed in terms of the two velocity amplitudes and the period. Let me look for such a relationship.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Let me consider that for each system, the total mass M_total is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by something involving the period. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function. The mass function for a star in a binary system is f(m) = (M_secondary^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_primary + M_secondary)^2 )\n\nBut since we have two stars, each with their own mass function. However, the problem states that the periods are the same for both systems (but different between systems), so maybe we can take the ratio of the mass functions between the two systems. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to use the formula that the total mass is proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) multiplied by the period squared, all over some constants, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the formula for the velocity of each star. \n\nThe velocity of each star is related to their mass and the total mass. Let me denote for system 1:\n\nLet\u2019s use the fact that the velocity of each star is proportional to the other star's mass. \n\nThe velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. \n\nSo for system 1:\n\nM1a / M1b = K1b / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nTotal mass system 1: M1_total = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \n\nSimilarly, system 2:\n\nM2a / M2b = K2b / K2a = 10/15 \u2248 0.666\u2026 \u2192 M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTotal mass system 2: M2_total = M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nNow, the problem is to find M1_total / M2_total. But I can\u2019t compute this ratio yet because M1b and M2b are different variables. I need another relation between them, which probably comes from the orbital periods. \n\nAh, right. The orbital period is related to the masses and the separation. Since we have different periods for the two systems (2 years and 1 year), we can use Kepler's third law to relate the masses and periods. \n\nKepler's third law states that (M_total) * P^2 = (a^3) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G), where a is the semi-major axis. But since we don't have a, we need to relate the velocities. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of each star is related to the orbital period and the separation. The velocity of a star in a circular orbit is v = 2\u03c0a/(P). Since the separation between the two stars is a = a1 + a2. \n\nBut from the center of mass, a1/a2 = M2/M1. So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a \n\nSo the velocity of star 1 (with mass M1) is v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * a1 \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * a2 \n\nThen, v1 / v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 which matches the earlier relation. \n\nBut how to relate velocity and period to mass?\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the velocity in terms of the total mass. \n\nLet me recall that for a circular orbit, the orbital speed v is given by v = sqrt( G (M_total) / a ), where a is the distance from the star to the center of mass? Wait, no. Wait, the orbital speed of each star is related to the total mass and the separation between them. \n\nThe total separation between the two stars is a_total = a1 + a2. \n\nThe orbital speed of star 1 is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSimilarly for star 2: v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThe gravitational force between them is G M1 M2 / a_total\u00b2 = M1 v1\u00b2 / a1 \n\nSo substituting v1:\n\nG M1 M2 / a_total\u00b2 = M1 ( (2\u03c0 a1 / P )^2 ) / a1 \n\nSimplify:\n\nG M2 / a_total\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1\u00b2 ) / (P\u00b2 a1 )\n\n\u2192 G M2 / a_total\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 a1 / P\u00b2 \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a_total \n\nSo substituting a1 into the equation:\n\nG M2 / a_total\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( M2/(M1 + M2) a_total ) / P\u00b2 \n\nMultiply both sides by a_total\u00b2:\n\nG M2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( M2/(M1 + M2) a_total^3 ) / P\u00b2 \n\nCancel M2 from both sides (assuming M2 \u22600):\n\nG = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 ( a_total^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2) P\u00b2 )\n\nRearranged:\n\n(M1 + M2) P\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_total^3 / G \n\nWhich is Kepler's third law. \n\nHmm. So this brings us back to Kepler's third law. But how to relate this to the velocities?\n\nLet me see. From the velocities, v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nBut a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a_total \n\nThus, v1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * ( M2/(M_total) ) a_total \n\nSimilarly, v2 = 2\u03c0/(P) * ( M1/(M_total) ) a_total \n\nLet me express a_total in terms of Kepler's third law. From Kepler's law:\n\na_total^3 = (G M_total P\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSo a_total = [ (G M_total P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^{1/3 }\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for v1:\n\nv1 = [ 2 \u03c0 / P ] * [ M2 / M_total ] * [ (G M_total P\u00b2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (M2 / M_total) * (G M_total P\u00b2)^{1/3} / (4 \u03c0\u00b2)^{1/3}\n\nLet me separate the exponents:\n\nThe term (G M_total P\u00b2)^{1/3} can be written as G^{1/3} M_total^{1/3} P^{2/3}\n\nSo putting back:\n\nv1 = [2 \u03c0 / P ] * (M2 / M_total) * [ G^{1/3} M_total^{1/3} P^{2/3} ] / (4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3} )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nThe M_total terms: (M2 / M_total) * M_total^{1/3} = M2 * M_total^{-2/3}\n\nThe P terms: (1/P) * P^{2/3} = P^{-1 + 2/3} = P^{-1/3}\n\nThe constants: 2 \u03c0 divided by 4^{1/3} \u03c0^{2/3} \n\nLet me compute constants first:\n\n2 / 4^{1/3} = 2 / (2^{2/3}) ) = 2^{1 - 2/3} = 2^{1/3}\n\n\u03c0 / \u03c0^{2/3} = \u03c0^{1 - 2/3} = \u03c0^{1/3}\n\nThus, the constants together give 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} \n\nPutting all together:\n\nv1 = 2^{1/3} \u03c0^{1/3} * M2 * M_total^{-2/3} * G^{1/3} * P^{-1/3} \n\nHmm. Let me factor out the constants:\n\nThe constants can be written as (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} \n\nWait, 2^{1/3} * \u03c0^{1/3} * G^{1/3} = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3}\n\nSo:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * M2 * M_total^{-2/3} * P^{-1/3}\n\nRearranged:\n\nv1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M2 / M_total^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nSimilarly, the same approach for v2 would give:\n\nv2 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1 / M_total^{2/3}) * P^{-1/3}\n\nNow, since we have both v1 and v2 for each system, perhaps we can take the ratio of v1 and v2 for each system and relate it to the mass ratio.\n\nBut let's consider for each system:\n\nLet me write the expressions for v1 and v2 for system 1 and system 2.\n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nv1a = 10 km/s, v1b =5 km/s \n\nSimilarly for system 2, v2a =15, v2b=10.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the amplitudes are given as for each system:\n\nIn system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes 10 and 5. \n\nIn system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10. \n\nSo, for each system, the velocities are given. Let me write equations for each system.\n\nStarting with system 1:\n\nLet me write equations for both stars in system 1. \n\nFor star 1a (with velocity 10 km/s):\n\nv1a = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1b / M_total1^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nSimilarly, for star 1b (velocity 5 km/s):\n\nv1b = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * (M1a / M_total1^{2/3}) * P1^{-1/3}\n\nWe can take the ratio of these two equations:\n\nv1a / v1b = (M1b / M1a )\n\nBut earlier, we found that M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a \u2192 M1a = (v1b / v1a) * M1b \u2192 which checks out. \n\nSo that's consistent with our earlier ratio. \n\nBut to get the total mass, let's try to express M_total in terms of the velocities and period.\n\nLet me cube both equations for v1a and v1b, then add them?\n\nWait, maybe let's cube each equation and then add them. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me cube the equation for v1a:\n\nv1a^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * (M1b^3 / M_total1^2 ) * P1^{-1}\n\nSimilarly, v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M1a^3 / M_total1^2 ) * P1^{-1}\n\nAdding them together:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1) * ( M1b^3 + M1a^3 ) / M_total1^2 \n\nHmm, but M1a and M1b are related. Since M1a = (K1b/K1a) M1b = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b \n\nSo M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 M1a^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 = (1/8) M1b^3 \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (1/8 +1 ) M1b^3 = (9/8) M1b^3 \n\nThe total mass M_total1 = M1a + M1b = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M_total1 = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 \n\nSo substituting M1b = (2/3) M_total1 into the numerator:\n\nM1a^3 + M1b^3 = (9/8) ( (2/3 M_total1 )^3 ) \n\nWait, let me compute M1b^3:\n\nM1b = (2/3) M_total1 \u2192 M1b^3 = (8/27) M_total1^3 \n\nSo M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (1/8 +1) * ( (2/3 M_total1)^3 ) \n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. \n\nWait, the numerator in the sum v1a^3 + v1b^3 is (M1a^3 + M1b^3). \n\nWe have M1a = 0.5 M1b \u2192 so M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 + M1b^3 = (0.125 +1) M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nThen, substituting M1b = (2/3) M_total1 (since M_total1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 ), so:\n\nM1b^3 = (2/3)^3 M_total1^3 \u2192 8/27 M_total1^3 \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = 1.125 * (8/27) M_total1^3 \n\n1.125 is 9/8, so 9/8 * 8/27 = 9/27 = 1/3 \u2192 so 1/3 M_total1^3 \n\nTherefore, the numerator is (1/3) M_total1^3 \n\nSo putting back into the equation for v1a^3 + v1b^3:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1 ) * ( (1/3 M_total1^3 ) ) / M_total1^2 \n\nSimplify denominator M_total1^2: \n\nSo (1/3 M_total1^3 ) / M_total1^2 = (1/3) M_total1 \n\nThus:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1 ) * (1/3 M_total1 )\n\nRearranged:\n\nM_total1 = 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSimilarly, for system 2:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2 ) * ( (M2a^3 + M2b^3 ) / M_total2^2 )\n\nFollowing similar steps for system 2:\n\nM2a = (K2b/K2a)*M2b = (10/15)*M2b = (2/3) M2b \n\nThus, M2a^3 = (8/27) M2b^3 \n\nTotal mass M_total2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 +1) M2b = (5/3) M2b \n\nSo M2b = (3/5) M_total2 \n\nThen, M2a^3 + M2b^3 = (8/27 M2b^3) + M2b^3 = (8/27 + 27/27) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nExpressed in terms of M_total2:\n\nM2b = 3/5 M_total2 \u2192 M2b^3 = (27/125) M_total2^3 \n\nSo M2a^3 + M2b^3 = 35/27 * (27/125) M_total2^3 = (35/125) M_total2^3 = (7/25) M_total2^3 \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. \n\nWait, M2a^3 + M2b^3 is ( (2/3 M2b)^3 + M2b^3 ) = (8/27 +1) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nThen substituting M2b = (3/5) M_total2 \u2192 M2b^3 = (3/5)^3 M_total2^3 = 27/125 M_total2^3 \n\nSo 35/27 * (27/125) = 35/125 = 7/25 \u2192 yes, so numerator is 7/25 M_total2^3 \n\nSo putting back into the equation:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 \n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 = (7/25) M_total2 \n\nThus:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\n\u2192 M_total2 = (25/(7)) * (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nNow, the key is to take the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2.\n\nLet me write:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = [ 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 / (2 \u03c0 G ) ] / [ (25/7) (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 / (2 \u03c0 G) ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 G terms cancel out. \n\nSo:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = [ 3 (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) P1 ] / [ (25/7) (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) P2 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= (3 * 7 / 25 ) * (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) / (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) * ( P1 / P2 )\n\n= (21 / 25 ) * [ (v1a^3 + v1b^3 ) / (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) ] * ( P1 / P2 )\n\nNow plug in the numbers. \n\nFirst compute v1a^3 + v1b^3 for system 1: \n\nv1a =10 km/s, v1b=5 km/s \u2192 their cubes are 1000 and 125 \u2192 sum is 1125 \n\nSimilarly for system 2: v2a=15, v2b=10 \u2192 3375 + 1000 = 4375 \n\nSo (1125)/(4375) = 1125/4375 \n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 25 \u2192 45/175 \u2192 divide by 5 \u2192 9/35 \n\nSo that fraction is 9/35 \n\nThe P1/P2 ratio is 2 years / 1 year = 2 \n\nPutting all together:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = (21/25) * (9/35) * 2 \n\nCompute step by step:\n\n21/25 * 9/35 = (21*9)/(25*35) \n\n21 and 35 have a common factor of 7 \u2192 21=3*7, 35=5*7 \u2192 so 3/5 * 9/ (25/7?) Wait let me compute:\n\n21 divided by 35 is 3/5. So:\n\n21/35 = 3/5, so (21/25)*(9/35) = (3/5)*(9/25) \u2192 27/(125) \n\nWait, no, let me do it properly:\n\n21 *9 = 189 \n\n25 *35 = 875 \n\nSo 189/875 \u2192 then multiplied by 2:\n\n189/875 *2 = 378/875 \n\nSimplify that fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n378 \u00f77 = 54 \n\n875 \u00f77 = 125 \n\nSo 54/125 \u2192 0.432 \n\nSo approximately 0.432. \n\nThe question asks by what factor is system 1 more massive than system 2. So the ratio is ~0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or B (0.6). \n\nHmm, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6. \n\n0.432 is closer to 0.4. \n\nWait but let me check the calculations again because I might have messed up a step.\n\nLet me re-calculate the ratio step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression:\n\nM_total1 / M_total2 = (21/25) * (9/35) * 2 \n\n21/25 * 9/35 = (21*9)/(25*35) \n\n21*9 = 189 \n\n25*35 = 875 \n\nSo 189/875. Multiply by 2 gives 378/875. \n\n378 divided by 875: \n\nLet me compute 378 \u00f7 875. \n\nWell, 378 \u00f7 875 = 0.432. \n\nYes. \n\nSo 0.432 is approximately 0.4, so option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the M2a^3 + M2b^3 correctly. \n\nWait for system 2:\n\nM2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nSo M2a^3 = (8/27) M2b^3 \n\nM2a^3 + M2b^3 = (8/27 + 1) M2b^3 = (35/27) M2b^3 \n\nThen when substituting M2b = (3/5) M_total2, so M2b^3 = (3/5)^3 M_total2^3 = 27/125 M_total2^3 \n\nThus, M2a^3 + M2b^3 = (35/27)*(27/125) M_total2^3 = (35/125) M_total2^3 = 7/25 M_total2^3 \n\nWait, but in the equation for system 2, the numerator in the equation for v2a^3 + v2b^3 is (M2a^3 + M2b^3) = (7/25) M_total2^3 \n\nSo the equation was:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2^3 ) / M_total2^2 \n\nWhich simplifies to (7/25 M_total2 ) * (2 \u03c0 G / P2 )\n\nTherefore, when solving for M_total2:\n\nM_total2 = (25/7) * (v2a^3 + v2b^3 ) * P2 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThen the ratio:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = [3 (v1a^3 +v1b^3) P1 / ... ] divided by [ (25/7)(v2a^3 +v2b^3) P2 / ... ]\n\nSo the 25/7 is in the denominator of the second term, so when you invert and multiply, it becomes multiplying by 7/25. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the ratio is ~0.43, so the closest option is A) ~0.4. \n\nTherefore the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula somewhere. Let me check the steps again. \n\nWait, when I derived the expression for M_total1, I had:\n\nv1a^3 + v1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P1) * (1/3 M_total1 )\n\nSo solving for M_total1 gives:\n\nM_total1 = 3 (v1a^3 +v1b^3) * P1 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSimilarly for M_total2: \n\nM_total2 = (25/7) (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2 / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, no. Wait the equation for system 2 was:\n\nv2a^3 + v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nM_total2 = (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2 * 25/(7 * 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nStarting from:\n\nv2a^3 +v2b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G / P2) * (7/25 M_total2 )\n\nSo multiply both sides by P2/(2 \u03c0 G):\n\n(v2a^3 +v2b^3 ) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G) = 7/25 M_total2 \n\nThen multiply both sides by 25/7:\n\n(25/7)(v2a^3 + ... ) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G) = M_total2 \n\nYes, so M_total2 = (25/7) * (v2a^3 +v2b^3) * P2/(2 \u03c0 G )\n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nThus, the ratio is indeed as calculated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass functions. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe mass of the system (M_total) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P ) / ( 2.79 * 10^{-5} ) \n\nWait, but this might be a formula I'm misremembering. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula derived earlier, the total mass is proportional to (v1^3 + v2^3) * P. \n\nWait, in the equations above, for system 1:\n\nM_total1 = 3*(v1a\u00b3 + v1b\u00b3)*P1/(2\u03c0G) \n\nSimilarly for system 2, M_total2 = (25/7)*(v2a\u00b3 +v2b\u00b3)*P2/(2\u03c0G)\n\nThus, the ratio M1/M2 is [3*(1125)*2 ] / [ (25/7)*(4375)*1 ]\n\nWait, perhaps plugging numbers directly without the G terms (since they cancel):\n\nYes, the ratio is (3*(10\u00b3 +5\u00b3)*2 ) / ( (25/7)*(15\u00b3 +10\u00b3)*1 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst compute numerator terms:\n\n10^3 = 1000, 5^3=125 \u2192 sum is 1125 \n\nMultiply by 3 and by 2 (P1=2):\n\n3 * 1125 *2 = 6750 \n\nDenominator terms:\n\n15^3=3375, 10^3=1000 \u2192 sum is 4375 \n\nMultiply by (25/7) and P2=1:\n\n(25/7)*4375 *1 = (25 *4375)/7 \n\nCalculate 4375 /7: 4375 \u00f77 = 625 (since 7*625 = 4375)\n\nSo denominator becomes 25 *625 = 15625 \n\nThus the ratio is 6750 /15625 \n\nCalculate this division:\n\n6750 \u00f715625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750/25 = 270; 15625/25 = 625 \n\n270 /625 = 0.432 \n\nSame result as before. \n\nSo the ratio is ~0.432, which is approximately 0.4. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA) ~ 0.4\n\nB) ~ 0.6\n\nC) ~ 1.2\n\nD) ~ 0.7\n\n0.43 is closer to 0.4 (option A) than 0.6. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made an error in assuming that the inclination angle i is the same for both systems. \n\nThe formula I used assumes that sin^3 i is the same for both systems. Because in the equations, when we derived M_total, we had terms with sin i in them. Wait, wait a second! Oh no! I think I forgot the sin^3 i term. \n\nOh no! That's a critical mistake. \n\nLooking back at the equations, the original formula for v1 had a sin i term because the observed velocity is K = v sin i. \n\nWait, in my previous derivation, I assumed that K = v, but actually K = v sin i. \n\nSo all the previous calculations missed the sin^3 i term. \n\nOh no, this changes everything. \n\nThis means that the total mass is actually proportional to (K1^3 + K2^3) * P / sin^3 i. \n\nBut since we don't know the inclination angle i for either system, unless the question assumes that both systems have the same inclination (e.g., edge-on, so sin i =1), then the ratio would be as calculated. \n\nThe problem statement doesn't mention anything about the inclination angle, so perhaps we are to assume that the systems are edge-on (sin i =1), or that the ratio of the masses is independent of sin i because it cancels out in the ratio. \n\nWait, in the ratio of the masses, since both systems would have the same sin^3 i term (assuming same inclination), but since we don't know their inclinations, maybe the question expects us to neglect the sin i term. \n\nThe question says \"Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\" So perhaps the question assumes that the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i =1. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be formulated such that the mass ratio can be found without considering the inclination, because the inclination cancels out in the ratio. \n\nWait, let me re-express the ratio calculation including sin^3 i. \n\nIn the equations, the total mass for each system is:\n\nM_total1 = [3 (K1a^3 + K1b^3) P1 ] / ( 2 \u03c0 G sin^3 i1 )\n\nSimilarly for system 2: \n\nM_total2 = [ (25/7) (K2a^3 + K2b^3) P2 ] / ( 2 \u03c0 G sin^3 i2 )\n\nThus the ratio is:\n\nM_total1/M_total2 = [3 (K1 terms) P1 / sin^3 i1 ] / [ (25/7) (K2 terms) P2 / sin^3 i2 ]\n\n= (21/25) * [ (K1 terms)/(K2 terms) ] * (P1/P2) * [ sin^3 i2 / sin^3 i1 ]\n\nUnless sin i1 = sin i2, the ratio depends on the inclination. \n\nSince the problem does not provide information about the inclination angles, we must assume that they are the same, or that the question ignores this term (i.e., assumes edge-on orbits where sin i =1 for both). \n\nGiven that the question is from an exam, it's likely that we can assume sin i =1 for both systems, so the ratio is as calculated (~0.43), so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the equations. \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nAnother approach using the mass ratio formula:\n\nThe mass of each star can be found via the formula involving their velocity amplitudes and the period. \n\nThe formula for the mass of each star in a binary system is:\n\nM1 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / G) * ( (K2 * P / (2 \u03c0))\u00b2 * a ) / something... Hmm, perhaps better to use the formula:\n\nThe masses can be calculated using:\n\nM1 = (K2^3 P) / (2.79 * 10^{-5}) \n\nWait, this formula comes from rearranging Kepler's third law for radial velocity amplitudes. \n\nWait, I recall that the mass function f(m) = (M sin^3 i)/( (1 + q)^2 ) where q = M2/M1, but I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, there's a standard formula for the mass of a star in a binary system: \n\nIf you have the velocity amplitude K, the mass of the other star is given by: \n\nM = (K^3 P) / (2.79 * 10^{-5}) \n\nBut this assumes that the mass of the other star is negligible, which isn't the case here. \n\nAlternatively, for a two-body system, the total mass can be related to the velocities and period via the formula:\n\n(M_total) = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / (2.79e-5) \n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the exact formula. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula derived earlier, but with the sin i terms:\n\nM_total = ( K1^3 + K2^3 ) * P / ( 2.79e-5 * sin^3 i )\n\nBut since we can't know sin i, perhaps the question assumes edge-on (sin i=1). \n\nAssuming sin i =1, then the ratio is as calculated ~0.43 \u2192 answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me try a different method. \n\nLet me use the formula for the mass of a binary system. \n\nThe mass of the system is given by:\n\nM_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2.79e-5 * sin^3 i )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the velocity amplitudes in terms of the masses and period is:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * ( M2 / (M_total)^{2/3} ) * ( P^{-1/3} )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nK2 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1/3} * ( M1 / (M_total)^{2/3} ) * ( P^{-1/3} )\n\nThus, \n\nK1/K2 = M2/M1 \n\nWhich we already have. \n\nNow, let me cube both sides of the equations for K1 and K2 and add them:\n\nK1^3 + K2^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * ( M2^3 + M1^3 ) / ( M_total^{2} ) * P^{-1} \n\nThus,\n\nM_total^2 = ( M1^3 + M2^3 ) / ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P^{-1} * (2 \u03c0 G)^{-1} ) \n\nWait, solving for M_total:\n\nM_total^2 = ( (M1^3 + M2^3) * 2 \u03c0 G ) / ( (K1^3 + K2^3) * P )\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. \n\nAlternatively, rearrange for M_total:\n\nM_total = [ ( M1^3 + M2^3 ) * 2 \u03c0 G * P ] / ( (K1^3 + K2^3 ) * M_total^2 ) \n\nWait, this seems messy. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between M1 and M2. \n\nLet me denote for system 1:\n\nM1a = 0.5 M1b \n\nM_total1 = 1.5 M1b \n\nThus, M1a^3 + M1b^3 = (0.5)^3 M1b^3 + M1b^3 = (0.125 +1 ) M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nThen, substituting into the equation for K1a^3 + K1b^3:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G)^{1} * ( M1b^3 + 0.125 M1b^3 ) / ( (1.5 M1b)^2 ) * P1^{-1} \n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, K1^3 + K2^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M2^3 + M1^3) / M_total^2 * P^{-1} \n\nSo for system 1:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (M1b^3 + M1a^3) / (M_total1)^2 * P1^{-1} \n\nBut M1a^3 + M1b^3 = 1.125 M1b^3 \n\nM_total1 = 1.5 M1b \n\nThus, denominator (M_total1)^2 = (2.25) M1b^2 \n\nSo:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = (2 \u03c0 G) * (1.125 M1b^3) / (2.25 M1b^2) ) * P1^{-1} \n\nSimplify:\n\n1.125 / 2.25 = 0.5 \n\nSo this becomes (2 \u03c0 G) * 0.5 M1b * P1^{-1} \n\nThus:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = ( \u03c0 G ) * M1b / P1 \n\nBut M_total1 = 1.5 M1b \u2192 M1b = (2/3) M_total1 \n\nSubstituting:\n\nK1a^3 + K1b^3 = ( \u03c0 G ) * (2/3 M_total1 ) / P1 \n\nRearranged:\n\nM_total1 = (3 (K1a^3 + K1b^3) P1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. \n\nThus, the previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A) ~0.4. \n\nBut wait, the options given include B) 0.6. Did I miscalculate the numerical value? \n\nLet me recalculate the ratio with the numbers again carefully:\n\nFor system1:\n\nK1a =10, K1b=5 \u2192 sum of cubes: 1000+125=1125 \n\nP1 =2 \n\nFor system2:\n\nK2a=15, K2b=10 \u2192 sum of cubes: 3375 +1000=4375 \n\nP2 =1 \n\nRatio M1/M2 = (3 * 1125 *2 ) / ( (25/7) *4375 *1 )\n\nCompute numerator: 3*1125=3375 \u2192 *2=6750 \n\nDenominator: (25/7)*4375 = 25/7 *4375 \n\n4375 divided by 7 is 625 \u2192 25*625 = 15625 \n\nThus, 6750 /15625 = 0.432 \n\nSo 0.432 is approximately 0.4. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is option A. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option B (0.6)? Maybe I made a mistake in the mass functions. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the formulas for M_total1 and M_total2. \n\nWait in system2, the coefficient was 25/7. Let me recheck that:\n\nFor system2:\n\nWe had M_total2 = (25/7)*(v2a\u00b3 +v2b^3)*P2/(2\u03c0G) \n\nThe 25/7 comes from the fact that in system2, the numerator term was (7/25) M_total2^3, so when solving for M_total2, you have to multiply by 25/7. \n\nYes, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass function for each system is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the mass ratio for system2. \n\nWait, for system2, the mass ratio M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a = (2/3) M2b \n\nTherefore, the total mass is M2a + M2b = (5/3) M2b \u2192 correct. \n\nThus the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A) ~0.4. \n\nBut let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) ~0.4\n\nB) ~0.6\n\nC) ~1.2\n\nD) ~0.7\n\n0.43 is closest to A. So the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is option A. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n\n\nTo determine the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, we start by using the relationship between the radial velocity amplitudes and the masses of the stars. The masses of the stars are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes. \n\nFor system_1:\n- The velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n- The mass ratio \\( \\frac{M_{1a}}{M_{1b}} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \\).\n- Total mass \\( M_{\\text{total1}} = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 1.5 M_{1b} \\).\n\nFor system_2:\n- The velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n- The mass ratio \\( \\frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n- Total mass \\( M_{\\text{total2}} = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = \\frac{5}{3} M_{2b} \\).\n\nNext, we use Kepler's third law and the relationship between velocity amplitudes, periods, and masses. The total mass of each system can be expressed in terms of their velocity amplitudes and periods. \n\nFor system_1:\n- The sum of the cubes of the velocity amplitudes is \\(10^3 + 5^3 = 1125\\).\n- Using the formula derived from Kepler's third law: \n  \\[\n  M_{\\text{total1}} \\propto \\frac{(10^3 + 5^3) \\cdot 2}{1}\n  \\]\n\nFor system_2:\n- The sum of the cubes of the velocity amplitudes is \\(15^3 + 10^3 = 4375\\).\n- Using the same formula:\n  \\[\n  M_{\\text{total2}} \\propto \\frac{(15^3 + 10^3) \\cdot 1}{1}\n  \\]\n\nThe ratio of the total masses is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\frac{M_{\\text{total1}}}{M_{\\text{total2}}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1125 \\cdot 2}{\\frac{25}{7} \\cdot 4375 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{6750}{15625} \\approx 0.432\n\\]\n\nThis ratio is closest to 0.4. \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Let's start by recalling what I know about binary stars and their properties.\n\nThe question mentions that both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 and 1 years respectively. The periods between primary eclipses are given, which I think corresponds to their orbital periods. Then there's the radial velocity (RV) data. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars. I need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2.\n\nI remember that in a binary system, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars and their orbital period. The formula from the Kepler's third law comes into play here. Wait, right, the formula involving the masses and the period. Let me think. \n\nThe formula for the masses in a binary system is derived from Kepler's laws. The key equation is something like (M1 + M2) * sin^3i / (1 + m)^2 = (P * K^3) / (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3)}... Wait, maybe I should approach it more systematically.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K for each star is given by K = (v1) = (2\u03c0 a1 sin i)/(P), where a1 is the semi-major axis of the first star's orbit, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle. But since both stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are related to their masses. The masses are inversely proportional to their respective velocities (since m1 a1 = m2 a2). \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function, which relates the radial velocity amplitude and the period to the mass. The mass function is f(m) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) (sin i)^-3, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the total mass can be found using Kepler's third law: (M1 + M2) = (a1 + a2)^3 / (G P\u00b2) * (2\u03c0)^2? Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard form of Kepler's third law for a binary system is (M1 + M2) = (a1 + a2)^3 * (2\u03c0 / P)^2 / (G). But since a1 + a2 is the semi-major axis of the orbit (since each star orbits the center of mass, their distances add up to the total separation), so a = a1 + a2. Let me denote a as the total separation. So, the formula becomes (M1 + M2) = (a^3)/(G P\u00b2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2). Wait, yes, the standard form is (M1 + M2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2). But since we don't know a, maybe we can relate the radial velocities to the masses?\n\nAlternatively, the relation between the radial velocity amplitudes and the masses. Since the two stars orbit each other, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. Because the product of mass and velocity should be the same for each star (since m1*v1 = m2*v2, assuming they orbit around the same center of mass and their velocities are along the line of sight). Wait, that might be the key point here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's say that the two stars have masses M1 and M2. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass. So if one has a higher velocity, it's because the other star is more massive. So, for system 1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 =5 km/s. So, 10/5 = M2/M1 \u2192 2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = 2 M1. Therefore, the total mass of system 1 is M1 + M2 = 3 M1.\n\nSimilarly, for system 2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10. So 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1. So M2 = (3/2) M1. Therefore, total mass is M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1. \n\nWait, but here's a problem: I called the stars in each system as M1 and M2, but the system's total mass is the sum of the two. However, for each system, the M1 and M2 are different. Let me clarify variables.\n\nLet me denote for system 1: masses are M_A and M_B. Their velocities K_A and K_B are 10 and 5. So K_A/K_B = M_B/M_A = 10/5 = 2 \u2192 M_B = 2 M_A. Total mass of system 1 is M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A.\n\nFor system 2: stars have masses m_C and m_D. Their velocities K_C and K_D are 15 and 10. So K_C/K_D = m_D/m_C = 15/10 = 3/2 \u2192 m_D = (3/2)m_C. Total mass is m_C + (3/2)m_C = (5/2)m_C.\n\nNow, to find the mass ratio of system1 to system2, (3 M_A)/( (5/2)m_C ) = (6/5)(M_A/m_C). Wait, but how do I relate M_A and m_C? Because I don't know their individual masses yet. Hmm, so maybe I need another equation here. \n\nAh, right! The orbital period comes into play here. Because the radial velocities and the period are related through Kepler's third law. The velocities are related to the orbital speed, which depends on the mass and period.\n\nThe orbital speed of each star can be related to their Keplerian velocities. The formula for the orbital velocity v is sqrt(G(M)/r), but in terms of the orbital period and separation, v = 2\u03c0r/(P). But since the separation is a = a1 + a2, and the velocities are related to their masses.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass and period. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K of a star in a binary system is given by:\n\nK = (v sin i) \n\nwhere v is the actual orbital velocity, and i is the inclination angle (which we can't measure directly, but since both systems are eclipsing, they must be edge-on, so sin i = 1? Or at least the inclination is the same for both systems? Wait, the problem doesn't specify if the inclination angles are the same. Hmm, but the question says to consider the mass of the system as the sum of the masses. So maybe the inclination is accounted for? Wait, perhaps in the problem's context, since they are eclipsing binaries, we can assume that the orbital plane is edge-on, so sin i = 1. Because otherwise, we can't get the actual masses, only the minimum masses. But since the question is asking for the actual mass ratio, maybe we can assume that the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Let me proceed with that assumption because otherwise, the problem can't be solved without knowing the inclination. Since the question gives the period as the eclipse period, which is the orbital period, so perhaps that's okay.\n\nSo, proceeding with sin i =1.\n\nNow, the radial velocity amplitude K for each star is related to their orbital speed. The orbital speed v of each star is 2\u03c0a/(P), where a is the semi-major axis. But the ratio of their velocities is related to their masses. Since the two stars orbit the center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v1/v2 = M2/M1. \n\nBut also, the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are equal to their orbital velocities (since sin i =1). Therefore, K1/K2 = M2/M1. Which is what I had before. \n\nSo the total mass of each system can also be related via Kepler's third law. Let's recall that for a binary system, the total mass is (a^3)/(G (P/(2\u03c0))^2 ), but perhaps more usefully, the formula involving the velocity.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that combines Kepler's third law and the velocity relation. Let me think. The total mass M = M1 + M2. \n\nThe radial velocity of each star is K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P) and K2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 / P). Since a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/M1) a2. The total separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 ). \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total mass in terms of K1, K2, and the period. \n\nLet me try to derive the necessary formula. \n\nLet me denote M = M1 + M2. \n\nWe have K1 = (v1) = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 / P )\n\nWe also know that a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 a1 = (M2/M1) a2. \n\nAlso, a1 + a2 = a_total = (a1 + a2) \n\nBut from the above, a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 )\n\nSo, the total separation a = (M/(M1)) a2 \n\nBut maybe this is getting too tangled. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe key equation that relates the velocities and the masses with the period is derived from combining Kepler's third law and the velocity ratio.\n\nLet me recall that the mass function is given by:\n\nf(m) = (K * sin^3 i) * P^2 / (2 \u03c0 G) ) \n\nBut since sin i = 1, then f(m) = (K * P^2)/(2\u03c0 G) )^(1/3) ? Wait, maybe I need to get the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\nM = (a^3) / (G (P/(2\u03c0))^2 )\n\nBut we can also express a in terms of the velocities. Let me see.\n\nThe velocity of star 1 is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSimilarly, velocity of star 2 is v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P \n\nBut since the stars orbit around the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \n\nSo, a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nSo, a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThe total separation is a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 ) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 )\n\nSo, a2 = a * M1/(M) \n\nSimilarly, a1 = a * M2/(M )\n\nNow, substituting into v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 \n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (a M2/M )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a^3 = G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \u2192 a = [ G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for v1:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * [ (G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * M2/M ) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe simplifying:\n\nLet me cube both sides. Alternatively, perhaps there is a simpler formula.\n\nAlternatively, combining the two equations:\n\nThe mass of the system M = M1 + M2 can be expressed in terms of the velocities K1 and K2 and the period.\n\nSince K1 = v1 = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nAnd M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 M1 a1 = M2 (a - a1 )\n\nSo M1 a1 = M2 a - M2 a1 \u2192 a1 (M1 + M2 ) = M2 a \u2192 a1 = (M2 / M) a \n\nSo, substituting back into K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * (M2/M ) a \n\nSimilarly, K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P = (2 \u03c0/P) (M1/M ) a \n\nNow, let's square both equations and add?\n\nAlternatively, let me express a in terms of M and P from Kepler's third law. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\na^3 = ( G M P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) \u2192 a = [ G M P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging this into the expression for K1:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * ( M2 / M ) * [ G M P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\nLet me write the term with exponents:\n\nThe a term is proportional to (M P^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * ( M2 / M ) * ( G^(1/3) (M P^2)^(1/3) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) )\n\nSimplify constants:\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\nLet me factor out the constants:\n\nThe constants part is (2 \u03c0 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 )\n\nThe M terms:\n\n(M2 / M ) * (M^(1/3) P^(2/3) )\n\nThe P terms:\n\n( P^(-1) ) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )\n\nPutting together the M terms:\n\nM2 / M * M^(1/3 ) = M2 * M^(-2/3 )\n\nSo, overall, K1 = [ (2 \u03c0 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) ) ] * M2 * M^(-2/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the ratio of the masses between the two systems.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the total mass for each system using the formula:\n\n(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 * K2 * P^2) / (2 \u03c0 G) )^(3/5) ?\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to recall that for a spectroscopic binary, the masses can be related to the velocities and period through the formula:\n\n(M1 + M2) sin^3 i = (K1^3 P^2 (2\u03c0)^2 )/(G) * (M2^3)/(M1 + M2)^2 )\n\nWait, perhaps this is too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since in the problem, both systems are eclipsing, so sin i =1, so we can get the actual masses, not just minimum masses.\n\nWe can use the formula that combines the two stars' radial velocities and the period to find the total mass.\n\nLet me think of the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocities.\n\nWe have:\n\nK1 = (v1) = (2\u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2 / P )\n\nAlso, from the center of mass condition, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 (M1/M2) = (a2/a1 )\n\nLet me denote the mass ratio q = M1/M2 \u2192 then a1/a2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \u2192 a1 = a2/q.\n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + 1/q ) = a2 ( (q +1)/q )\n\nThus, a2 = a * q/(q +1 )\n\nSubstituting into a1 = a2/q \u2192 a1 = a/(q+1 )\n\nNow, substitute into K1 and K2.\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P \u2192 a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nBut also, a1 = a/(q+1 ) and a2 = a q/(q +1 )\n\nSo, a/(q+1 ) = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nand a q/(q +1 ) = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nDividing these two equations:\n\n( a/(q+1 ) ) / ( a q/(q+1 )) ) = ( K1 P/(2\u03c0) ) / ( K2 P/(2\u03c0) )\n\nSimplifying left side: 1/q = K1/K2 \u2192 K1/K2 = 1/q \u2192 q = K2/K1 \n\nWhich gives the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1. Which matches what I had before. \n\nSo, the mass ratio of the two stars in a system is q = K2/K1. \n\nNow, the total mass of the system can be found via Kepler's third law. Let me recall that:\n\nThe total mass M = M1 + M2 = (M2)(1 + q ), since q = M1/M2 \u2192 M1 = q M2 \u2192 M_total = M2 (1 + q )\n\nAlternatively, since M = M1 + M2, and from the mass ratio q = M1/M2, so M = M2 (1 + q ), so M2 = M/(1 + q ), and M1 = q M/(1 + q )\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law, which states that (M) = (a^3)/(G P^2) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut we need to express a in terms of the velocities. Let me see.\n\nWe can also use the relation between the velocities and the separation. \n\nWe have a1 + a2 = a. From before, a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 ), and a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 ). So, a = (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 )\n\nWait, that's a key point. \n\nWait, because a1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P * (P/(2\u03c0 )) \u2192 no, actually, K1 = v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 rearranged, a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total separation a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSo substituting into Kepler's third law:\n\nM = ( a^3 ) / ( G P\u00b2 ) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSubstituting a:\n\nM = [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 ) )^3 ] / ( G P\u00b2 ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\n( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/( (2\u03c0)^3 ) \n\nDivided by (G P\u00b2 ), so:\n\n[ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 ) ] / ( G P\u00b2 ) = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (2\u03c0)^3 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSo,\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the constants step by step.\n\nThe term after substituting a:\n\nM = [ ( (K1+K2)P/(2\u03c0) )^3 / ( G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSo, expanding:\n\nNumerator of the first fraction: (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 \n\nDenominator: G P\u00b2 \n\nSo overall: [ (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P\u00b2 ) ) ] *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nThe P terms: P^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThe constants: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) \n\n(2 \u03c0)^3 is 8 \u03c0^3, so 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0^3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0 ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, altogether:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Wait no, sorry:\n\nWait, the entire expression after substitution is:\n\n[ ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 ) ) / ( G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWhich is:\n\n[ (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nP^3 / P\u00b2 = P^1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1+K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2\u03c0)^3 is 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total mass is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the constants after multiplying: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total expression is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, no, sorry, perhaps better to recompute step by step:\n\nThe numerator after substitution: (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 \n\nDivided by (G P^2) gives (K1+K2)^3 P / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 gives:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * (K1+K2)^3 P / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4/( (2)^3 ) = 4/8 = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nSo overall: 0.5 * (1/\u03c0) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait no, sorry. Wait, 4 divided by (2)^3 is 4/8 = 0.5. Then \u03c0\u00b2 divided by \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0. So the constants multiply to (0.5) * (1/\u03c0) ) = 1/(2\u03c0). \n\nThus:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 P ) / ( (2 \u03c0 G ) ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait, no, the total expression becomes:\n\nM = [ (K1+K2)^3 * P / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 G ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me write all terms:\n\nThe numerator terms:\n\n(K1+K2)^3 * P^3 * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nThe denominator terms:\n\n(2 \u03c0)^3 * G * P^2 \n\nSo simplifying:\n\nNumerator: (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nDenominator: 8 \u03c0^3 * G * P^2 \n\nCancel P terms: P^3 / P^2 = P \n\nCancel \u03c0 terms: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / 8 \u03c0^3 = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 8 \u03c0^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 )) / ( G P^2 ) ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P^2 ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( (8 \u03c0^3) G ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0^3 G )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/8 = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2/\u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nSo:\n\n= 0.5 * (K1+K2)^3 * P / ( \u03c0 G )\n\nThus, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1 / (2 \u03c0 ))? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, let me just accept that the total mass can be written as:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Not sure. Maybe I need to look for a formula that directly relates the total mass to K1, K2, and P. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the total mass can be expressed as:\n\nM = ( (K1 * K2 * P^2) ) / ( G ) * (something) \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between K1 and K2 and the mass ratio.\n\nWait, let me think of the total mass in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nWe know that q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me denote q = K2/K1 \n\nSo, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + q )\n\nWe also know that from the center of mass, the separation a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2 )) * a \n\nSimilarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2 )) * a \n\nBut the velocities are K1 = v1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \n\nand K2 = v2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThus, K1/K2 = a1/a2 = (M2/(M)) / (M1/(M )) ) = M2/M1 = 1/q \u2192 which matches earlier.\n\nNow, let me express the total mass using Kepler's third law. \n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = (M2 a)/M + (M1 a)/M ) = a \n\nSo, a is the total separation. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nBut also, K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 a1 = K1 P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = K2 P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2 ) P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSubstitute this into the Kepler equation:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2 ) P/(2 \u03c0 ) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand the cube:\n\n[ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) ]\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ) * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0\u00b3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThus,\n\n0.5 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 P / G \n\nThus,\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, that's the formula! So finally, the total mass M is equal to ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) divided by ( 2 \u03c0 G ). \n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Let me verify:\n\nYes, after simplifying all terms, the formula comes out as:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, but where did the \u03c0 go? Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive that step:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) )\n\nBreaking down:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2 \u03c0)^3 is 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nMultiply by (K1 + K2)^3 and P^3/P\u00b2 gives (K1+K2)^3 P \n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/( \u03c0 ))? Wait, no, the 1/(2 \u03c0 ) multiplied by (K1+K2)^3 P gives:\n\nWait, no, sorry:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/( (2 \u03c0)^3 )\n\n= 4/( (2)^3 ) * \u03c0\u00b2/( \u03c0^3 ) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / P\u00b2 * 1/G \n\nWhich is:\n\n4/8 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / G \n\nThus, 0.5 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 P / G \u2192 \n\nSo M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0^2 G ) \n\nWait, now I'm confused because different steps give different exponents on \u03c0. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try once more.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nThe term from Kepler's third law: (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2 )\n\nThe a\u00b3 term is [ ( (K1+K2) P / (2 \u03c0 ) ) ]^3 \n\nSo expanding that:\n\na\u00b3 = (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / (2 \u03c0 )^3 \n\nSo substituting into Kepler's equation:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0 )^3 ) )\n\nNow, multiply all constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2 \u03c0 )^3 \u2192 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) \u2192 4/(8 \u03c0 ) \u2192 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nMultiply by P^3 / P\u00b2 \u2192 P \n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = (1/(2 \u03c0 )) * (K1+K2)^3 * P / G \n\nWait, so the final formula is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, but the units? Hmm, but perhaps the exact constants aren't important because when we take the ratio of the masses between the two systems, the constants (like G and \u03c0) will cancel out. \n\nAh! That's the key. Since we are comparing the masses of the two systems, the ratio will depend only on the given quantities (K1, K2, P) and not on G or \u03c0. \n\nSo let's denote M1 as the total mass of system_1, and M2 as the total mass of system_2. \n\nThen, \n\nM1 / M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 G terms cancel out, so:\n\nM1/M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) ]\n\nWhere K1a and K1b are the RV amplitudes for system_1 (10 and 5 km/s), and K2a and K2b are for system_2 (15 and 10). \n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nFor system_1: K1a + K1b = 10 +5 =15 km/s \n\nP1 = 2 years \n\nSystem_2: K2a + K2b =15 +10 =25 km/s \n\nP2 =1 year \n\nSo,\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n15^3 is 3375, 25^3 is 15625 \n\nSo,\n\n(3375 *2 ) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 / 15625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750 \u00f725 = 270 \n\n15625 \u00f725 = 625 \n\n270 /625 = 0.432 \n\nHmm, that's approximately 0.432. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.4 and B ~0.6. So closest to 0.4, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. \n\n15^3 = 3375, yes. 25^3 is 25*25=625, 625*25=15,625. \n\nSo 3375 *2 is 6750 \n\n6750 divided by 15,625. \n\nLet me compute 15,625 \u00d7 0.4 = 6,250 \n\n6750 -6250 = 500 \n\nSo 0.4 + (500/15625) \u2192 500/15625 = 0.032 \n\nTotal 0.432, which is approximately 0.43. The options are 0.4, 0.6, 1.2, 0.7. \n\nHmm, 0.43 is closest to 0.4 (option A) or maybe 0.4 is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me think again: did I mix up the systems? The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is ~0.4 times as massive as system_2? Wait no, wait the question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if M1/M2 is 0.43, then system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. But the options include A ~0.4 which would mean system1 is 0.4 times system2's mass. But the question is asking for the factor by which system1 is more massive than system2, so if it's 0.4, that would mean system1 is less massive, so the answer would be 0.4? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula. \n\nWait, the formula was M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, so the mass is proportional to (K_total)^3 * P. \n\nSo for system 1, K_total is 15, P=2. \n\nSystem2: K_total=25, P=1. \n\nThus, M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1 ) \n\nYes, which is (3375 *2)/(15625 *1) = 6750/15625 \u22480.432 \n\nSo, system1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system2. So the question is asking \"by what factor is system1 more massive than system2?\" \n\nBut if the ratio is less than 1, then system1 is less massive. So the answer would be 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4). \n\nWait, but the options are: \n\nA) ~0.4 \n\nB) ~0.6 \n\nC) ~1.2 \n\nD) ~0.7 \n\nSo the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. The question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2. \n\nYes, so if M1 is 0.43 times M2, then the answer is ~0.4, so option A. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe I had a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the derivation of the formula. Let me see.\n\nWait, the formula for M was derived as M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check with dimensional analysis. \n\nThe units of (K + K)^3 * P would be (km/s)^3 * years. \n\nBut mass should have units of kg. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is missing some constants. But since we are taking the ratio between the two systems, the constants (G, \u03c0) will cancel, so the ratio is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used the mass function. Wait, let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet me consider the mass of each system using the formula for the mass function. \n\nThe mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P sin^3 i ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut since sin i =1, then f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G )\n\nBut the mass function gives the mass of one star in terms of the other. For example, for star 1, f(m) = M2^3 sin^3 i/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nWait, the mass function for star 1 is f(m1) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nSimilarly for star 2. \n\nBut since we don't know which star's velocity is which, but in the problem, the two velocities are given for each system. \n\nAlternatively, the total mass can be found by combining the two mass functions. \n\nAlternatively, since we know the mass ratio from the velocities, maybe I can compute the total mass for each system. \n\nFor system 1: \n\nMass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1 =0.5 M2 \n\nTotal mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2 \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, M_total = (a^3)/(G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nBut again, a is related to the velocities. \n\nAlternatively, since we have the mass ratio and the total mass formula involving K's and P, perhaps I can proceed as follows:\n\nUsing the formula I derived earlier, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nAssuming that formula is correct, then the ratio M1/M2 is indeed (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) \u22480.432 \u2192 ~0.4. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of an example with known values. \n\nSuppose a system where K1 = K2 (so the stars have equal masses). Then their masses would be equal, so M1 = M2. \n\nThe total mass would then be 2 M. \n\nUsing the formula, M_total = ( (K + K)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is ( (2K)^3 * P ) / ... \n\nBut if they are equal masses, then the mass ratio q =1. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law, M_total = (a^3)/(G P^2 )*4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWhere a = a1 +a2. Since masses are equal, a1 =a2, so a = 2 a1 \n\nAlso, the velocity K = v = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSo a1 = K P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = 2 * K P/(2 \u03c0 ) = K P/ \u03c0 \n\nPlugging into Kepler's formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K P / \u03c0 )^3 ) / ( G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( K^3 P^3 / \u03c0^3 ) / ( G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( \u03c0^3 G ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= 4 K^3 P / ( \u03c0 G ) \n\nCompare to the previous formula: \n\nMy derived formula gave M = ( (2K)^3 * P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is (8 K^3 P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P / ( \u03c0 G ), which matches the direct calculation. \n\nThus, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 *2 )/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625 )= 6750/15625 \u22480.432 \n\nSo the answer is approximately 0.4, so option A. \n\nWait, but the options have ~0.4 as option A. So the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check again the question: the problem says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the ratio is ~0.43, then system1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system2. So the factor is 0.43, so the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in adding the K's? \n\nWait system_1's K1 and K2 are 10 and 5. Sum is 15. \n\nSystem_2's K1 and K2 are 15 and 10. Sum is 25. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation is right. So answer A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves comparing the total masses of two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about binary star systems and their masses. Hmm, I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Let's start by recalling what I know about binary stars and their properties.\n\nThe question mentions that both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 and 1 years respectively. The periods between primary eclipses are given, which I think corresponds to their orbital periods. Then there's the radial velocity (RV) data. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars. I need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to system_2.\n\nI remember that in a binary system, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars and their orbital period. The formula from the Kepler's third law comes into play here. Wait, right, the formula involving the masses and the period. Let me think. \n\nThe formula for the masses in a binary system is derived from Kepler's laws. The key equation is something like (M1 + M2) * sin^3i / (1 + m)^2 = (P * K^3) / (2\u03c0 G)^(1/3)}... Wait, maybe I should approach it more systematically.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K for each star is given by K = (v1) = (2\u03c0 a1 sin i)/(P), where a1 is the semi-major axis of the first star's orbit, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle. But since both stars orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are related to their masses. The masses are inversely proportional to their respective velocities (since m1 a1 = m2 a2). \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the mass function, which relates the radial velocity amplitude and the period to the mass. The mass function is f(m) = (K2^3 P)/(2\u03c0 G) (sin i)^-3, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the total mass can be found using Kepler's third law: (M1 + M2) = (a1 + a2)^3 / (G P\u00b2) * (2\u03c0)^2? Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard form of Kepler's third law for a binary system is (M1 + M2) = (a1 + a2)^3 * (2\u03c0 / P)^2 / (G). But since a1 + a2 is the semi-major axis of the orbit (since each star orbits the center of mass, their distances add up to the total separation), so a = a1 + a2. Let me denote a as the total separation. So, the formula becomes (M1 + M2) = (a^3)/(G P\u00b2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2). Wait, yes, the standard form is (M1 + M2) = (4\u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2). But since we don't know a, maybe we can relate the radial velocities to the masses?\n\nAlternatively, the relation between the radial velocity amplitudes and the masses. Since the two stars orbit each other, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. Because the product of mass and velocity should be the same for each star (since m1*v1 = m2*v2, assuming they orbit around the same center of mass and their velocities are along the line of sight). Wait, that might be the key point here.\n\nLet me think again. Let's say that the two stars have masses M1 and M2. The radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass. So if one has a higher velocity, it's because the other star is more massive. So, for system 1, K1 = 10 km/s and K2 =5 km/s. So, 10/5 = M2/M1 \u2192 2 = M2/M1 \u2192 M2 = 2 M1. Therefore, the total mass of system 1 is M1 + M2 = 3 M1.\n\nSimilarly, for system 2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10. So 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1. So M2 = (3/2) M1. Therefore, total mass is M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1. \n\nWait, but here's a problem: I called the stars in each system as M1 and M2, but the system's total mass is the sum of the two. However, for each system, the M1 and M2 are different. Let me clarify variables.\n\nLet me denote for system 1: masses are M_A and M_B. Their velocities K_A and K_B are 10 and 5. So K_A/K_B = M_B/M_A = 10/5 = 2 \u2192 M_B = 2 M_A. Total mass of system 1 is M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A.\n\nFor system 2: stars have masses m_C and m_D. Their velocities K_C and K_D are 15 and 10. So K_C/K_D = m_D/m_C = 15/10 = 3/2 \u2192 m_D = (3/2)m_C. Total mass is m_C + (3/2)m_C = (5/2)m_C.\n\nNow, to find the mass ratio of system1 to system2, (3 M_A)/( (5/2)m_C ) = (6/5)(M_A/m_C). Wait, but how do I relate M_A and m_C? Because I don't know their individual masses yet. Hmm, so maybe I need another equation here. \n\nAh, right! The orbital period comes into play here. Because the radial velocities and the period are related through Kepler's third law. The velocities are related to the orbital speed, which depends on the mass and period.\n\nThe orbital speed of each star can be related to their Keplerian velocities. The formula for the orbital velocity v is sqrt(G(M)/r), but in terms of the orbital period and separation, v = 2\u03c0r/(P). But since the separation is a = a1 + a2, and the velocities are related to their masses.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude K to the mass and period. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K of a star in a binary system is given by:\n\nK = (v sin i) \n\nwhere v is the actual orbital velocity, and i is the inclination angle (which we can't measure directly, but since both systems are eclipsing, they must be edge-on, so sin i = 1? Or at least the inclination is the same for both systems? Wait, the problem doesn't specify if the inclination angles are the same. Hmm, but the question says to consider the mass of the system as the sum of the masses. So maybe the inclination is accounted for? Wait, perhaps in the problem's context, since they are eclipsing binaries, we can assume that the orbital plane is edge-on, so sin i = 1. Because otherwise, we can't get the actual masses, only the minimum masses. But since the question is asking for the actual mass ratio, maybe we can assume that the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Let me proceed with that assumption because otherwise, the problem can't be solved without knowing the inclination. Since the question gives the period as the eclipse period, which is the orbital period, so perhaps that's okay.\n\nSo, proceeding with sin i =1.\n\nNow, the radial velocity amplitude K for each star is related to their orbital speed. The orbital speed v of each star is 2\u03c0a/(P), where a is the semi-major axis. But the ratio of their velocities is related to their masses. Since the two stars orbit the center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v1/v2 = M2/M1. \n\nBut also, the radial velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are equal to their orbital velocities (since sin i =1). Therefore, K1/K2 = M2/M1. Which is what I had before. \n\nSo the total mass of each system can also be related via Kepler's third law. Let's recall that for a binary system, the total mass is (a^3)/(G (P/(2\u03c0))^2 ), but perhaps more usefully, the formula involving the velocity.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula that combines Kepler's third law and the velocity relation. Let me think. The total mass M = M1 + M2. \n\nThe radial velocity of each star is K1 = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P) and K2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 / P). Since a1/a2 = M2/M1, so a1 = (M2/M1) a2. The total separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 ). \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total mass in terms of K1, K2, and the period. \n\nLet me try to derive the necessary formula. \n\nLet me denote M = M1 + M2. \n\nWe have K1 = (v1) = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2 \u03c0 a2 / P )\n\nWe also know that a1/a2 = M2/M1 \u2192 a1 = (M2/M1) a2. \n\nAlso, a1 + a2 = a_total = (a1 + a2) \n\nBut from the above, a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 )\n\nSo, the total separation a = (M/(M1)) a2 \n\nBut maybe this is getting too tangled. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe key equation that relates the velocities and the masses with the period is derived from combining Kepler's third law and the velocity ratio.\n\nLet me recall that the mass function is given by:\n\nf(m) = (K * sin^3 i) * P^2 / (2 \u03c0 G) ) \n\nBut since sin i = 1, then f(m) = (K * P^2)/(2\u03c0 G) )^(1/3) ? Wait, maybe I need to get the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law:\n\nM = (a^3) / (G (P/(2\u03c0))^2 )\n\nBut we can also express a in terms of the velocities. Let me see.\n\nThe velocity of star 1 is v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSimilarly, velocity of star 2 is v2 = 2\u03c0 a2 / P \n\nBut since the stars orbit around the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \n\nSo, a1/a2 = M2/M1 \n\nSo, a1 = (M2/M1) a2 \n\nThe total separation is a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1 ) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/M1 )\n\nSo, a2 = a * M1/(M) \n\nSimilarly, a1 = a * M2/(M )\n\nNow, substituting into v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 \n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * (a M2/M )\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, a^3 = G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) \u2192 a = [ G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for v1:\n\nv1 = 2\u03c0/(P) * [ (G M P\u00b2/(4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * M2/M ) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe simplifying:\n\nLet me cube both sides. Alternatively, perhaps there is a simpler formula.\n\nAlternatively, combining the two equations:\n\nThe mass of the system M = M1 + M2 can be expressed in terms of the velocities K1 and K2 and the period.\n\nSince K1 = v1 = (2 \u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nAnd M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 M1 a1 = M2 (a - a1 )\n\nSo M1 a1 = M2 a - M2 a1 \u2192 a1 (M1 + M2 ) = M2 a \u2192 a1 = (M2 / M) a \n\nSo, substituting back into K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 K1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * (M2/M ) a \n\nSimilarly, K2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P = (2 \u03c0/P) (M1/M ) a \n\nNow, let's square both equations and add?\n\nAlternatively, let me express a in terms of M and P from Kepler's third law. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\na^3 = ( G M P^2 )/(4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) \u2192 a = [ G M P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging this into the expression for K1:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P ) * ( M2 / M ) * [ G M P^2 / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\nLet me write the term with exponents:\n\nThe a term is proportional to (M P^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nK1 = (2 \u03c0 / P) * ( M2 / M ) * ( G^(1/3) (M P^2)^(1/3) ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) )\n\nSimplify constants:\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 divided by (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me rearrange the terms:\n\nLet me factor out the constants:\n\nThe constants part is (2 \u03c0 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 )\n\nThe M terms:\n\n(M2 / M ) * (M^(1/3) P^(2/3) )\n\nThe P terms:\n\n( P^(-1) ) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )\n\nPutting together the M terms:\n\nM2 / M * M^(1/3 ) = M2 * M^(-2/3 )\n\nSo, overall, K1 = [ (2 \u03c0 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) ) ] * M2 * M^(-2/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the ratio of the masses between the two systems.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the total mass for each system using the formula:\n\n(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 * K2 * P^2) / (2 \u03c0 G) )^(3/5) ?\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to recall that for a spectroscopic binary, the masses can be related to the velocities and period through the formula:\n\n(M1 + M2) sin^3 i = (K1^3 P^2 (2\u03c0)^2 )/(G) * (M2^3)/(M1 + M2)^2 )\n\nWait, perhaps this is too complicated. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since in the problem, both systems are eclipsing, so sin i =1, so we can get the actual masses, not just minimum masses.\n\nWe can use the formula that combines the two stars' radial velocities and the period to find the total mass.\n\nLet me think of the formula for the total mass in terms of the velocities.\n\nWe have:\n\nK1 = (v1) = (2\u03c0 a1 / P )\n\nSimilarly, K2 = (2\u03c0 a2 / P )\n\nAlso, from the center of mass condition, M1 a1 = M2 a2 \u2192 (M1/M2) = (a2/a1 )\n\nLet me denote the mass ratio q = M1/M2 \u2192 then a1/a2 = M2/M1 = 1/q \u2192 a1 = a2/q.\n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = a2 (1 + 1/q ) = a2 ( (q +1)/q )\n\nThus, a2 = a * q/(q +1 )\n\nSubstituting into a1 = a2/q \u2192 a1 = a/(q+1 )\n\nNow, substitute into K1 and K2.\n\nK1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P \u2192 a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nBut also, a1 = a/(q+1 ) and a2 = a q/(q +1 )\n\nSo, a/(q+1 ) = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nand a q/(q +1 ) = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nDividing these two equations:\n\n( a/(q+1 ) ) / ( a q/(q+1 )) ) = ( K1 P/(2\u03c0) ) / ( K2 P/(2\u03c0) )\n\nSimplifying left side: 1/q = K1/K2 \u2192 K1/K2 = 1/q \u2192 q = K2/K1 \n\nWhich gives the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1. Which matches what I had before. \n\nSo, the mass ratio of the two stars in a system is q = K2/K1. \n\nNow, the total mass of the system can be found via Kepler's third law. Let me recall that:\n\nThe total mass M = M1 + M2 = (M2)(1 + q ), since q = M1/M2 \u2192 M1 = q M2 \u2192 M_total = M2 (1 + q )\n\nAlternatively, since M = M1 + M2, and from the mass ratio q = M1/M2, so M = M2 (1 + q ), so M2 = M/(1 + q ), and M1 = q M/(1 + q )\n\nNow, using Kepler's third law, which states that (M) = (a^3)/(G P^2) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut we need to express a in terms of the velocities. Let me see.\n\nWe can also use the relation between the velocities and the separation. \n\nWe have a1 + a2 = a. From before, a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 ), and a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 ). So, a = (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 )\n\nWait, that's a key point. \n\nWait, because a1 = (2\u03c0 a1)/P * (P/(2\u03c0 )) \u2192 no, actually, K1 = v1 = 2\u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 rearranged, a1 = (K1 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (K2 P)/(2\u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total separation a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 )\n\nSo substituting into Kepler's third law:\n\nM = ( a^3 ) / ( G P\u00b2 ) * (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nSubstituting a:\n\nM = [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2\u03c0 ) )^3 ] / ( G P\u00b2 ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\n( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/( (2\u03c0)^3 ) \n\nDivided by (G P\u00b2 ), so:\n\n[ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 ) ] / ( G P\u00b2 ) = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (2\u03c0)^3 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSo,\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the constants step by step.\n\nThe term after substituting a:\n\nM = [ ( (K1+K2)P/(2\u03c0) )^3 / ( G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSo, expanding:\n\nNumerator of the first fraction: (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 \n\nDenominator: G P\u00b2 \n\nSo overall: [ (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P\u00b2 ) ) ] *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nThe P terms: P^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThe constants: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) \n\n(2 \u03c0)^3 is 8 \u03c0^3, so 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0^3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0 ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, altogether:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Wait no, sorry:\n\nWait, the entire expression after substitution is:\n\n[ ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 ) ) / ( G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWhich is:\n\n[ (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P\u00b2 ) ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nP^3 / P\u00b2 = P^1 \n\nSo:\n\n( (K1+K2)^3 P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2\u03c0)^3 is 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total mass is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the constants after multiplying: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, the total expression is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, no, sorry, perhaps better to recompute step by step:\n\nThe numerator after substitution: (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / (2\u03c0)^3 \n\nDivided by (G P^2) gives (K1+K2)^3 P / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 gives:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 * (K1+K2)^3 P / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G )\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4/( (2)^3 ) = 4/8 = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nSo overall: 0.5 * (1/\u03c0) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait no, sorry. Wait, 4 divided by (2)^3 is 4/8 = 0.5. Then \u03c0\u00b2 divided by \u03c0^3 is 1/\u03c0. So the constants multiply to (0.5) * (1/\u03c0) ) = 1/(2\u03c0). \n\nThus:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 P ) / ( (2 \u03c0 G ) ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 ))? Wait, no, the total expression becomes:\n\nM = [ (K1+K2)^3 * P / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 G ) ] * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me write all terms:\n\nThe numerator terms:\n\n(K1+K2)^3 * P^3 * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nThe denominator terms:\n\n(2 \u03c0)^3 * G * P^2 \n\nSo simplifying:\n\nNumerator: (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nDenominator: 8 \u03c0^3 * G * P^2 \n\nCancel P terms: P^3 / P^2 = P \n\nCancel \u03c0 terms: 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / 8 \u03c0^3 = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 8 \u03c0^3 G ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\nM = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / ( (2\u03c0)^3 )) / ( G P^2 ) ) * 4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G P^2 ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( (2\u03c0)^3 G ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( (8 \u03c0^3) G ) ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0^3 G )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n4/8 = 0.5, \u03c0\u00b2/\u03c0^3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nSo:\n\n= 0.5 * (K1+K2)^3 * P / ( \u03c0 G )\n\nThus, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1 / (2 \u03c0 ))? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, let me just accept that the total mass can be written as:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/(2 \u03c0 )) ? Not sure. Maybe I need to look for a formula that directly relates the total mass to K1, K2, and P. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the total mass can be expressed as:\n\nM = ( (K1 * K2 * P^2) ) / ( G ) * (something) \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation between K1 and K2 and the mass ratio.\n\nWait, let me think of the total mass in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nWe know that q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 \n\nLet me denote q = K2/K1 \n\nSo, M1 = q M2 \n\nTotal mass M = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + q )\n\nWe also know that from the center of mass, the separation a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2 )) * a \n\nSimilarly, a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2 )) * a \n\nBut the velocities are K1 = v1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \n\nand K2 = v2 = 2 \u03c0 a2 / P \n\nThus, K1/K2 = a1/a2 = (M2/(M)) / (M1/(M )) ) = M2/M1 = 1/q \u2192 which matches earlier.\n\nNow, let me express the total mass using Kepler's third law. \n\nThe total separation a = a1 + a2 = (M2 a)/M + (M1 a)/M ) = a \n\nSo, a is the total separation. \n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a^3 )/( G P\u00b2 )\n\nBut also, K1 = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \u2192 a1 = K1 P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSimilarly, a2 = K2 P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2 ) P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nSubstitute this into the Kepler equation:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * [ ( (K1 + K2 ) P/(2 \u03c0 ) )^3 ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, expand the cube:\n\n[ (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) ]\n\nMultiply by 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ):\n\nSo,\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G P\u00b2 ) * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n4/(8) = 0.5 \n\n\u03c0\u00b2 / \u03c0\u00b3 = 1/\u03c0 \n\nP^3 / P\u00b2 = P \n\nThus,\n\n0.5 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 P / G \n\nThus,\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, that's the formula! So finally, the total mass M is equal to ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) divided by ( 2 \u03c0 G ). \n\nWait, that seems to be the case. Let me verify:\n\nYes, after simplifying all terms, the formula comes out as:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, but where did the \u03c0 go? Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive that step:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0)^3 ) )\n\nBreaking down:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2 \u03c0)^3 is 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) = (4)/(8 \u03c0) ) = 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nMultiply by (K1 + K2)^3 and P^3/P\u00b2 gives (K1+K2)^3 P \n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) * (1/( \u03c0 ))? Wait, no, the 1/(2 \u03c0 ) multiplied by (K1+K2)^3 P gives:\n\nWait, no, sorry:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2/(G P\u00b2 ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 )/( (2 \u03c0)^3 )\n\n= 4/( (2)^3 ) * \u03c0\u00b2/( \u03c0^3 ) * (K1 + K2)^3 * P^3 / P\u00b2 * 1/G \n\nWhich is:\n\n4/8 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 * P / G \n\nThus, 0.5 * 1/\u03c0 * (K1 + K2)^3 P / G \u2192 \n\nSo M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0^2 G ) \n\nWait, now I'm confused because different steps give different exponents on \u03c0. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try once more.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nThe term from Kepler's third law: (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G P\u00b2 )\n\nThe a\u00b3 term is [ ( (K1+K2) P / (2 \u03c0 ) ) ]^3 \n\nSo expanding that:\n\na\u00b3 = (K1+K2)^3 P^3 / (2 \u03c0 )^3 \n\nSo substituting into Kepler's equation:\n\nM = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G P\u00b2 )) * ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 \u03c0 )^3 ) )\n\nNow, multiply all constants:\n\n4 \u03c0\u00b2 divided by (2 \u03c0 )^3 \u2192 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (8 \u03c0\u00b3 ) \u2192 4/(8 \u03c0 ) \u2192 1/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nMultiply by P^3 / P\u00b2 \u2192 P \n\nThus, overall:\n\nM = (1/(2 \u03c0 )) * (K1+K2)^3 * P / G \n\nWait, so the final formula is:\n\nM = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWait, but the units? Hmm, but perhaps the exact constants aren't important because when we take the ratio of the masses between the two systems, the constants (like G and \u03c0) will cancel out. \n\nAh! That's the key. Since we are comparing the masses of the two systems, the ratio will depend only on the given quantities (K1, K2, P) and not on G or \u03c0. \n\nSo let's denote M1 as the total mass of system_1, and M2 as the total mass of system_2. \n\nThen, \n\nM1 / M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) ] / [ ( (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 G terms cancel out, so:\n\nM1/M2 = [ ( (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ) ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ) ]\n\nWhere K1a and K1b are the RV amplitudes for system_1 (10 and 5 km/s), and K2a and K2b are for system_2 (15 and 10). \n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nFor system_1: K1a + K1b = 10 +5 =15 km/s \n\nP1 = 2 years \n\nSystem_2: K2a + K2b =15 +10 =25 km/s \n\nP2 =1 year \n\nSo,\n\nM1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n15^3 is 3375, 25^3 is 15625 \n\nSo,\n\n(3375 *2 ) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 / 15625 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: \n\n6750 \u00f725 = 270 \n\n15625 \u00f725 = 625 \n\n270 /625 = 0.432 \n\nHmm, that's approximately 0.432. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is ~0.4 and B ~0.6. So closest to 0.4, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. \n\n15^3 = 3375, yes. 25^3 is 25*25=625, 625*25=15,625. \n\nSo 3375 *2 is 6750 \n\n6750 divided by 15,625. \n\nLet me compute 15,625 \u00d7 0.4 = 6,250 \n\n6750 -6250 = 500 \n\nSo 0.4 + (500/15625) \u2192 500/15625 = 0.032 \n\nTotal 0.432, which is approximately 0.43. The options are 0.4, 0.6, 1.2, 0.7. \n\nHmm, 0.43 is closest to 0.4 (option A) or maybe 0.4 is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me think again: did I mix up the systems? The question asks \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2 = 0.432. So system_1 is ~0.4 times as massive as system_2? Wait no, wait the question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if M1/M2 is 0.43, then system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. But the options include A ~0.4 which would mean system1 is 0.4 times system2's mass. But the question is asking for the factor by which system1 is more massive than system2, so if it's 0.4, that would mean system1 is less massive, so the answer would be 0.4? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula. \n\nWait, the formula was M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, so the mass is proportional to (K_total)^3 * P. \n\nSo for system 1, K_total is 15, P=2. \n\nSystem2: K_total=25, P=1. \n\nThus, M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2)/(25^3 *1 ) \n\nYes, which is (3375 *2)/(15625 *1) = 6750/15625 \u22480.432 \n\nSo, system1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system2. So the question is asking \"by what factor is system1 more massive than system2?\" \n\nBut if the ratio is less than 1, then system1 is less massive. So the answer would be 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4). \n\nWait, but the options are: \n\nA) ~0.4 \n\nB) ~0.6 \n\nC) ~1.2 \n\nD) ~0.7 \n\nSo the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. The question says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So M1/M2. \n\nYes, so if M1 is 0.43 times M2, then the answer is ~0.4, so option A. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe I had a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the derivation of the formula. Let me see.\n\nWait, the formula for M was derived as M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 \u03c0 G )\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me check with dimensional analysis. \n\nThe units of (K + K)^3 * P would be (km/s)^3 * years. \n\nBut mass should have units of kg. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is missing some constants. But since we are taking the ratio between the two systems, the constants (G, \u03c0) will cancel, so the ratio is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used the mass function. Wait, let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet me consider the mass of each system using the formula for the mass function. \n\nThe mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P sin^3 i ) / (2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nBut since sin i =1, then f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2 \u03c0 G )\n\nBut the mass function gives the mass of one star in terms of the other. For example, for star 1, f(m) = M2^3 sin^3 i/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nWait, the mass function for star 1 is f(m1) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) \n\nSimilarly for star 2. \n\nBut since we don't know which star's velocity is which, but in the problem, the two velocities are given for each system. \n\nAlternatively, the total mass can be found by combining the two mass functions. \n\nAlternatively, since we know the mass ratio from the velocities, maybe I can compute the total mass for each system. \n\nFor system 1: \n\nMass ratio q = M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 \u2192 M1 =0.5 M2 \n\nTotal mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2 \n\nFrom Kepler's third law, M_total = (a^3)/(G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nBut again, a is related to the velocities. \n\nAlternatively, since we have the mass ratio and the total mass formula involving K's and P, perhaps I can proceed as follows:\n\nUsing the formula I derived earlier, M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G )\n\nAssuming that formula is correct, then the ratio M1/M2 is indeed (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) \u22480.432 \u2192 ~0.4. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of an example with known values. \n\nSuppose a system where K1 = K2 (so the stars have equal masses). Then their masses would be equal, so M1 = M2. \n\nThe total mass would then be 2 M. \n\nUsing the formula, M_total = ( (K + K)^3 * P ) / ( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is ( (2K)^3 * P ) / ... \n\nBut if they are equal masses, then the mass ratio q =1. \n\nUsing Kepler's third law, M_total = (a^3)/(G P^2 )*4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\nWhere a = a1 +a2. Since masses are equal, a1 =a2, so a = 2 a1 \n\nAlso, the velocity K = v = 2 \u03c0 a1 / P \n\nSo a1 = K P/(2 \u03c0 )\n\nThus, a = 2 * K P/(2 \u03c0 ) = K P/ \u03c0 \n\nPlugging into Kepler's formula:\n\nM_total = ( (K P / \u03c0 )^3 ) / ( G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( K^3 P^3 / \u03c0^3 ) / ( G P^2 ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= ( K^3 P )/( \u03c0^3 G ) *4 \u03c0\u00b2 \n\n= 4 K^3 P / ( \u03c0 G ) \n\nCompare to the previous formula: \n\nMy derived formula gave M = ( (2K)^3 * P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) \n\nWhich is (8 K^3 P )/( 2 \u03c0 G ) = 4 K^3 P / ( \u03c0 G ), which matches the direct calculation. \n\nThus, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is indeed (15^3 *2 )/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/(15625 )= 6750/15625 \u22480.432 \n\nSo the answer is approximately 0.4, so option A. \n\nWait, but the options have ~0.4 as option A. So the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check again the question: the problem says \"by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?\" So if the ratio is ~0.43, then system1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system2. So the factor is 0.43, so the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in adding the K's? \n\nWait system_1's K1 and K2 are 10 and 5. Sum is 15. \n\nSystem_2's K1 and K2 are 15 and 10. Sum is 25. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation is right. So answer A.\n\n\nThe problem involves comparing the total masses of two binary star systems using their orbital periods and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Radial Velocity Ratio and Mass Relationship**: The ratio of the RV amplitudes \\( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\) for each system gives the inverse ratio of their masses. For system_1, \\( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\), so \\( \\frac{M_{B}}{M_{A}} = 2 \\). Thus, the total mass of system_1 is \\( M_A + 2M_A = 3M_A \\). For system_2, \\( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\), so \\( \\frac{M_D}{M_C} = 1.5 \\), giving a total mass of \\( M_C + 1.5M_C = 2.5M_C \\).\n\n2. **Kepler's Third Law and Mass Formula**: The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 P}{2\\pi G}\n   \\]\n   where \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) are the RV amplitudes, and \\( P \\) is the orbital period. Since \\( G \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are constants, the ratio of masses depends only on the given parameters.\n\n3. **Mass Ratio Calculation**:\n   - For system_1: \\( K_1 + K_2 = 15 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( P = 2 \\, \\text{years} \\).\n   - For system_2: \\( K_1 + K_2 = 25 \\, \\text{km/s} \\), \\( P = 1 \\, \\text{year} \\).\n\n   The mass ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{(15^3 \\cdot 2)}{(25^3 \\cdot 1)} = \\frac{6750}{15625} \\approx 0.432\n   \\]\n\nThis ratio is closest to 0.4, so the answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
