      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the probability of a nucleus decaying over a certain time period, given that it hasn't decayed yet. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The key thing here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process, right? That means the probability of decay in the next time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. Wait, so maybe the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability? But I need to confirm that.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Let me think. The general formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. We can use the given information to find \u03bb first. \n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Rearranging that gives e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Let's see, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 would be a bit lower. Maybe around -0.38? Let me compute more accurately. Let me recall that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100). Wait, maybe easier to use calculator-like steps. Let's see, e^-0.38 is about e^-0.3 is ~0.7408, e^-0.4 is ~0.6703. Oh, wait, so if e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. Wait, the equation was e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Let me think again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68). Let me recall that ln(0.68) = ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate it numerically. Let me see:\n\nLet me use the Taylor series or just approximate values. Let me think:\n\nWe know that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. Let me check with a calculator approach:\n\nSuppose e^0.385 \u2248 1.468, so e^-0.385 \u2248 1/1.468 \u2248 0.681, which is close to 0.68. So that's about right. So ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. Therefore, \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the question is: after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes, so total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it survived 50 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next time interval, given that it hasn't decayed yet, depends only on the duration, not the time already passed. So the probability of decaying between time t and t + \u0394t, given that it hasn't decayed until t, is the same as the probability of decaying in the first \u0394t interval. So in this case, the 50 minutes already passed don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes from now, given that it hasn't decayed up to now (the 50 minutes are in the past). So the total time considered here is 150 minutes. Wait, but the original given data was for 100 minutes. So we need to compute P(150), but using the same \u03bb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that it will decay between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200). So the total time since the start would be 200 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*200), so the probability it has decayed by then is 1 - e^(-200\u03bb). But since it's already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-200\u03bb)] divided by the probability it survived 50 minutes, which is e^(-50\u03bb). Wait, no. Wait, the conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it survived until 50 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 divided by the probability it survived until 50. But actually, the conditional probability is (P(decayed by 200) - P(decayed by 50)) divided by P(survived until 50). Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe conditional probability that the decay occurs between time t1 and t2 given that it has not decayed before t1 is equal to the probability that the decay occurs in [t1, t2], given that it's still alive at t1. Since the process is memoryless, this is the same as the probability that the decay occurs within (t2 - t1) time starting from 0. So the probability is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*(t2 - t1)). \n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nThe probability that the decay happens between t1 and t2 is P(t2) - P(t1). The conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed by t1 is [P(t2) - P(t1)] / (1 - P(t1)). But since P(t) = 1 - e^{-\u03bbt}, then:\n\n[P(t2) - P(t1)] / (1 - P(t1)) = [ (1 - e^{-\u03bb t2}) - (1 - e^{-\u03bb t1}) ] / e^{-\u03bb t1} \n\nSimplify numerator: (e^{-\u03bb t1} - e^{-\u03bb t2}) / e^{-\u03bb t1} \n\n= [e^{-\u03bb t1}(1 - e^{-\u03bb(t2 - t1)})] / e^{-\u03bb t1} \n\n= 1 - e^{-\u03bb (t2 - t1)} \n\nSo that's the same as the probability of decay in the interval (t2 - t1) starting from time zero. So the memoryless property holds. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has survived for 50 minutes, is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So I can compute that as 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability over the next 150 minutes, which is exactly 150 minutes from now. So that's the correct approach.\n\nSo first, we need to compute \u03bb from the given data. \n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32. \n\nSo:\n\nP(100) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*100} = 0.32 \n\n=> e^{-100\u03bb} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \n\nTake natural log:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \n\n=> \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \n\nAs above, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566, so \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is P(150) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}\n\nLet's compute that exponent:\n\n\u03bb*150 = (0.0038566) * 150 \u2248 0.5785 \n\nSo e^{-0.5785} \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Since 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's compute more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 0.5785:\n\nLet me think of 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.\n\nCompute e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065\n\ne^-0.0785 \u2248 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 - ...? Maybe approximate:\n\nAlternatively, let me use calculator steps. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute the exact value via the relation.\n\nWait, since we have \u03bb = (ln(0.68)/-100), then \u03bb*150 = (150/100)*ln(1/0.68). Because:\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me write \u03bb as (ln(1/0.68))/100. Because ln(0.68) = - ln(1/0.68). So \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb *150 = (150/100)* ln(1/0.68) \n\nSo, exponent is (1.5)*ln(1/0.68) \n\nWhich is ln( (1/0.68)^1.5 )\n\nThus, e^{-\u03bb*150} = 1 / ( (1/0.68)^1.5 ) = (0.68)^1.5 \n\nWait, that's a neat way to compute it without approximating \u03bb.\n\nSo let me try that approach. Let's see:\n\nCompute e^{-\u03bb*150} = (0.68)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5 \n\nBecause:\n\nWe had e^{-\u03bb*100} = 0.68, so e^{-\u03bb*t} = (0.68)^(t/100)\n\nTherefore, for t=150, that's 0.68^(1.5). \n\nSo 0.68^1.5. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.68 squared is 0.4624. The square root of 0.4624 is sqrt(0.4624) = approx 0.68 (since sqrt(0.4624) is 0.68, but that's the square). Wait, sqrt(0.4624) is 0.68, but here we have 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). \n\nAh yes, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5.\n\nCompute sqrt(0.68). Let me see: sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.68) is a bit more. Let's compute it numerically.\n\n0.824^2 = 0.824*0.824 = (0.8 + 0.024)^2 = 0.64 + 2*0.8*0.024 + 0.024\u00b2 = 0.64 + 0.0384 + 0.000576 = 0.678976. Oh, that's very close to 0.68. So sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nThus, 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 * 0.8246. Let's calculate that:\n\n0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544\n\n0.68 * 0.0246 = approx 0.68 * 0.02 = 0.0136 and 0.68*0.0046=0.003128 \u2192 total 0.016728\n\nAdding to 0.544 gives 0.544 + 0.016728 \u2248 0.5607. \n\nSo 0.68^1.5 \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, e^{-\u03bb*150} \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, the probability of decaying in 150 minutes is 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%. \n\nLooking at the options, that's closest to 44%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the math correctly. Let me re-calculate the 0.68^1.5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation steps. Let me recompute sqrt(0.68):\n\nWe had 0.824 squared is ~0.6789, so sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246 as before. \n\nThen 0.68 multiplied by 0.8246: \n\n0.68 * 0.8246 = (0.6 * 0.8246) + (0.08 * 0.8246)\n\n0.6 * 0.8246 = 0.49476\n\n0.08 * 0.8246 = 0.065968\n\nAdding these gives 0.49476 + 0.065968 = 0.560728. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, so about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%, option A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes\". Since 50 minutes have already passed, the next 150 minutes would bring the total to 200 minutes. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in the first 150 minutes, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to compute the half-life. Wait, but maybe that's more complicated. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, using the given data: the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability is 68%. \n\nThe survival probability after t minutes is e^{-\u03bbt} = (0.68)^{t/100}. Because every 100 minutes, it's multiplied by 0.68. \n\nTherefore, after 150 minutes (the time we are considering now), the survival probability would be (0.68)^{1.5} \u2248 0.5607 as above. So the decay probability is 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 43.9%, so answer A is 44%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 44%.\n",

Let's compute it numerically.\n\n0.824^2 = 0.824*0.824 = (0.8 + 0.024)^2 = 0.64 + 2*0.8*0.024 + 0.024\u00b2 = 0.64 + 0.0384 + 0.000576 = 0.678976. Oh, that's very close to 0.68. So sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nThus, 0.68 * 0.8246 \u2248 0.68 * 0.8246. Let's calculate that:\n\n0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544\n\n0.68 * 0.0246 = approx 0.68 * 0.02 = 0.0136 and 0.68*0.0046=0.003128 \u2192 total 0.016728\n\nAdding to 0.544 gives 0.544 + 0.016728 \u2248 0.5607. \n\nSo 0.68^1.5 \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, e^{-\u03bb*150} \u2248 0.5607. \n\nTherefore, the probability of decaying in 150 minutes is 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is about 43.93%. \n\nLooking at the options, that's closest to 44%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the math correctly. Let me re-calculate the 0.68^1.5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation steps. Let me recompute sqrt(0.68):\n\nWe had 0.824 squared is ~0.6789, so sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246 as before. \n\nThen 0.68 multiplied by 0.8246: \n\n0.68 * 0.8246 = (0.6 * 0.8246) + (0.08 * 0.8246)\n\n0.6 * 0.8246 = 0.49476\n\n0.08 * 0.8246 = 0.065968\n\nAdding these gives 0.49476 + 0.065968 = 0.560728. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, so about 43.9%, which rounds to 44%, option A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes\". Since 50 minutes have already passed, the next 150 minutes would bring the total to 200 minutes. But the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in the first 150 minutes, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to compute the half-life. Wait, but maybe that's more complicated. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, using the given data: the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability is 68%. \n\nThe survival probability after t minutes is e^{-\u03bbt} = (0.68)^{t/100}. Because every 100 minutes, it's multiplied by 0.68. \n\nTherefore, after 150 minutes (the time we are considering now), the survival probability would be (0.68)^{1.5} \u2248 0.5607 as above. So the decay probability is 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 43.9%, so answer A is 44%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 44%.\n\n\nThe decay process is memoryless, so the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on that duration. Given a 32% decay probability over 100 minutes, we calculate the decay constant \u03bb using \\( e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68 \\), giving \\( \\lambda = -\\ln(0.68)/100 \\). The probability of decay in 150 minutes is \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} \\). Substituting \\( \\lambda \\), this becomes \\( 1 - (0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 \\), or ~44%.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about radioactive decay. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The probability of decay is constant over time, so the decay process is memoryless. Wait, that's important. The memoryless property means that the probability of decay in the next time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. But wait, the question gives a specific decay probability over 100 minutes. Let me think.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. But since it's memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 100 minutes from any given point should be the same, regardless of how long it's already been around. Wait, but here they want the probability over 150 minutes starting from now, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring. Hmm, maybe I need to find the decay constant first?\n\nLet me recall the formula for radioactive decay. The probability of decay by time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So they tell us that P(100) = 0.32. Let me plug that into the equation to solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Rearranging that gives e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). Therefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Let me see, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567. Since 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7, maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me check with calculator steps. Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let's see:\n\nThe natural logarithm of 0.68: Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me remember that ln(1 - x) \u2248 -x - x\u00b2/2 - ... for small x, but 0.32 is the difference from 1 here. Alternatively, perhaps I can just use approximate value. Let's see, perhaps better to note that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100). ln(68) is ln(64 +4) which is ln(64*(1 +4/64)) = ln64 + ln(1.0625). ln64 is 4.1589 (since ln(2^6)=6 ln2 \u22486*0.693=4.158), and ln(1.0625) is approximately 0.0606. So ln68 \u22484.1589 +0.0606\u22484.2195. ln100 is 4.6052 (since ln(10^2)=2 ln10\u22482*2.3026\u22484.6052). So ln(68/100)=4.2195 -4.6052\u2248-0.3857. So \u03bb \u2248 -(-0.3857)/100 \u22480.003857 per minute. Let me note that \u03bb \u22480.003857 min\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a newly observed atom decays within 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, the problem says that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. The memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in t minutes. Therefore, the time already elapsed (50 minutes) doesn't affect the future probability. So the probability is P(150). But we need to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed up to 50 minutes and then decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 +150=200). Wait, perhaps another way. Let me think again. The total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but since we know it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the conditional probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it didn't decay before 50. The formula for conditional probability here is P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). \n\nAlternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes is equal to 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me compute that. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03bb again. Let me confirm the value. Since \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100. Since e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68, so \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100. Wait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38. So yes, about 0.0038 per minute.\n\nSo, compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute \u03bb*150 first. 0.003857 * 150 \u2248 0.5785. So exponent is -0.5785. e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me think of 0.5785. Let's use the Taylor series or approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using calculator-like steps:\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) was approximately -0.3857, so \u03bb is 0.003857 per minute. \n\nSo 150 minutes: 150 * 0.003857 \u2248 0.57855.\n\nSo e^-0.57855. Let me compute that. Let me note that ln(0.56) is about? Wait, perhaps better to recall that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.57 is e^-0.5 * e^-0.07 \u22480.6065 * (1 -0.07 + 0.00245) \u2248 approx 0.6065 *0.93245 \u2248 0.6065*0.93 \u22480.564. Hmm, 0.57 is 0.5 +0.07. Alternatively, perhaps exact value:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use that e^-0.57855. Let me see:\n\nWe can use that e^-0.57855 = 1 / e^0.57855. Let's compute e^0.57855. Let me see:\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.57 is e^0.5 * e^0.07. e^0.07 \u2248 1 +0.07 +0.07\u00b2/2 +0.07\u00b3/6 \u2248 1.07 +0.00245 +0.000343 \u22481.072793. So 1.64872 * 1.072793 \u2248 let's calculate that:\n\n1.64872 *1 =1.64872; 1.64872 *0.07 =0.11541; 1.64872 *0.002793 \u2248 ~0.0046. So total approx 1.64872 +0.11541 =1.76413 +0.0046 \u22481.7687. So e^0.57 \u22481.7687, so e^-0.57 \u22480.565.\n\nNow for 0.57855, which is 0.57 +0.00855. So e^0.57855 = e^0.57 * e^0.00855. e^0.00855 \u22481 +0.00855 + (0.00855)^2/2 \u22481.00855 +0.0000365\u22481.0085865. So multiplying by the previous 1.7687 gives 1.7687 *1.0085865 \u22481.7687 +1.7687*0.0085865. Let's compute 1.7687 *0.0085865 \u22480.01523. So total \u22481.7839. Therefore e^0.57855\u22481.7839. Therefore e^-0.57855\u22481/1.7839\u22480.5605. \n\nSo 1 - e^-0.57855 \u22481 -0.5605 =0.4395, so about 44%? That would be option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the steps correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach the problem is to use the given 32% in 100 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of surviving t time is e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability of surviving 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68, so e^(-\u03bb*100) =0.68. \n\nNow, after 50 minutes, the survival probability so far is e^(-\u03bb*50). The question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it has survived 50 minutes. The conditional probability is [1 - survival(50+150)] / survival(50). Because the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] minus the part before 50? Wait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays between time 50 and 200 (which is 150 minutes from now) is equal to the survival up to 50, then decay between 50-200. But since we are given that it survived up to 50, the conditional probability is [Probability(decayed between 50 and 200)] / Probability(survived up to 50).\n\nThe numerator is survival(50)*(1 - survival(150)), since after surviving 50, the chance to decay in the next 150 is 1 - survival(150). Wait, yes. Because survival(50) * [1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}] is the probability of surviving 50 then decaying in the next 150. So the conditional probability is [survival(50)*(1 - e^{-\u03bb*150})] / survival(50) ) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}. Which brings us back to the same as before. So the answer is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start. So that's why the answer is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nSo let's compute that again. Let's see:\n\nWe know that e^{-\u03bb*100} =0.68, so e^{-\u03bb*150} = (e^{-\u03bb*100})^{1.5} =0.68^(3/2). Let me compute that. \n\n0.68^(1.5) = sqrt(0.68^3). Let's compute 0.68^3 first. 0.68*0.68=0.4624, then *0.68 again: 0.4624 *0.68. Let's compute that:\n\n0.4 *0.68 =0.272, 0.0624*0.68 =0.042432. So total 0.272 +0.042432 =0.314432. So 0.68^3 is ~0.314432. The square root of that is sqrt(0.314432). Let me see, sqrt(0.3144). Since 0.56 squared is 0.3136, so sqrt(0.3144) is approximately 0.5607. Therefore, e^{-\u03bb*150} \u22480.5607. Therefore, 1 - that is ~0.4393, so ~43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects another approach. Wait, but let me check if there's another way someone might approach it incorrectly.\n\nSuppose someone thought that the decay probability is linear, which it's not. But if they did, they might think that since 32% decay in 100 minutes, then per minute it's 0.32/100, so in 150 minutes it would be 0.32*(150/100) = 0.48, so 48%, which is D. But that's wrong because the decay is exponential, not linear. So that's a possible mistake. But the correct approach is using the exponential model.\n\nAnother check: Let's see, the half-life formula. Let me see what the half-life would be. Let me compute the half-life T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. Since \u03bb is ln(1/0.68)/100 \u22480.003857 per minute. So T1/2 \u22480.6931 /0.003857 \u2248180 minutes? Let me compute 0.6931 divided by 0.003857. Let's see, 0.003857 * 180 \u22480.694, so yes, that gives T1/2 \u2248180 minutes. So the half-life is about 180 minutes. \n\nSo, after 150 minutes, which is less than a half-life, the decay probability would be less than 50%, so 44% makes sense. If it were exactly a half-life (180 min), the probability would be 50%, so 150 is 5/6 of that, so less than 50%, so 44% is plausible.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using the half-life. Since T1/2=180 minutes, then the decay constant \u03bb= ln2/180 \u22480.00385 min\u207b\u00b9, which matches the earlier calculation. \n\nThen, the probability of decay in t minutes is 1 - e^{-\u03bb t} = 1 - 2^{-t/180}. \n\nSo for 150 minutes: 1 - 2^{-150/180} =1 - 2^{-5/6}. Let me compute 2^{5/6}. Since 2^(1/2)=1.414, 2^(1/3)=1.26, so 5/6 is 0.833. Let me see, 2^(5/6) is e^( (5/6)*ln2 ) \u2248 e^(5/6 *0.693) \u2248 e^(0.5775) \u22481.781. So 1/1.781 \u22480.561, so 1-0.561\u22480.439, so 43.9%, which again gives 44%, so A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A) 44%.\n",

So, that's the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes.

Wait, but here they want the probability over 150 minutes starting from now, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring. Hmm, maybe I need to find the decay constant first?\n\nLet me recall the formula for radioactive decay. The probability of decay by time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. So they tell us that P(100) = 0.32. Let me plug that into the equation to solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). Rearranging that gives e^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). Therefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me calculate that. Let me see, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.7) is around -0.3567. Since 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7, maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me check with calculator steps. Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let's see:\n\nThe natural logarithm of 0.68: Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me remember that ln(1 - x) \u2248 -x - x\u00b2/2 - ... for small x, but 0.32 is the difference from 1 here. Alternatively, perhaps I can just use approximate value. Let's see, perhaps better to note that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100). ln(68) is ln(64 +4) which is ln(64*(1 +4/64)) = ln64 + ln(1.0625). ln64 is 4.1589 (since ln(2^6)=6 ln2 \u22486*0.693=4.158), and ln(1.0625) is approximately 0.0606. So ln68 \u22484.1589 +0.0606\u22484.2195. ln100 is 4.6052 (since ln(10^2)=2 ln10\u22482*2.3026\u22484.6052). So ln(68/100)=4.2195 -4.6052\u2248-0.3857. So \u03bb \u2248 -(-0.3857)/100 \u22480.003857 per minute. Let me note that \u03bb \u22480.003857 min\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a newly observed atom decays within 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, the problem says that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. The memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in t minutes. Therefore, the time already elapsed (50 minutes) doesn't affect the future probability. So the probability is P(150). But we need to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed up to 50 minutes and then decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 +150=200). Wait, perhaps another way. Let me think again. The total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but since we know it hasn't decayed in the first 50, the conditional probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it didn't decay before 50. The formula for conditional probability here is P(decay between 50 and 200 | no decay before 50) = [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(no decay before 50). \n\nAlternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes is equal to 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me compute that. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u03bb again. Let me confirm the value. Since \u03bb = ln(1/0.68)/100. Since e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68, so \u03bb = (ln(1/0.68))/100. Wait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) \u2248 0.38. So yes, about 0.0038 per minute.\n\nSo, compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute \u03bb*150 first. 0.003857 * 150 \u2248 0.5785. So exponent is -0.5785. e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me think of 0.5785. Let's use the Taylor series or approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using calculator-like steps:\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) was approximately -0.3857, so \u03bb is 0.003857 per minute. \n\nSo 150 minutes: 150 * 0.003857 \u2248 0.57855.\n\nSo e^-0.57855. Let me compute that. Let me note that ln(0.56) is about? Wait, perhaps better to recall that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065, e^-0.57 is e^-0.5 * e^-0.07 \u22480.6065 * (1 -0.07 + 0.00245) \u2248 approx 0.6065 *0.93245 \u2248 0.6065*0.93 \u22480.564. Hmm, 0.57 is 0.5 +0.07. Alternatively, perhaps exact value:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use that e^-0.57855. Let me see:\n\nWe can use that e^-0.57855 = 1 / e^0.57855. Let's compute e^0.57855. Let me see:\n\ne^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.57 is e^0.5 * e^0.07. e^0.07 \u2248 1 +0.07 +0.07\u00b2/2 +0.07\u00b3/6 \u2248 1.07 +0.00245 +0.000343 \u22481.072793. So 1.64872 * 1.072793 \u2248 let's calculate that:\n\n1.64872 *1 =1.64872; 1.64872 *0.07 =0.11541; 1.64872 *0.002793 \u2248 ~0.0046. So total approx 1.64872 +0.11541 =1.76413 +0.0046 \u22481.7687. So e^0.57 \u22481.7687, so e^-0.57 \u22480.565.\n\nNow for 0.57855, which is 0.57 +0.00855. So e^0.57855 = e^0.57 * e^0.00855. e^0.00855 \u22481 +0.00855 + (0.00855)^2/2 \u22481.00855 +0.0000365\u22481.0085865. So multiplying by the previous 1.7687 gives 1.7687 *1.0085865 \u22481.7687 +1.7687*0.0085865. Let's compute 1.7687 *0.0085865 \u22480.01523. So total \u22481.7839. Therefore e^0.57855\u22481.7839. Therefore e^-0.57855\u22481/1.7839\u22480.5605. \n\nSo 1 - e^-0.57855 \u22481 -0.5605 =0.4395, so about 44%? That would be option A) 44%.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the steps correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach the problem is to use the given 32% in 100 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of surviving t time is e^(-\u03bbt). So the probability of surviving 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68, so e^(-\u03bb*100) =0.68. \n\nNow, after 50 minutes, the survival probability so far is e^(-\u03bb*50). The question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it has survived 50 minutes. The conditional probability is [1 - survival(50+150)] / survival(50). Because the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] minus the part before 50? Wait, no. Wait, the probability that it decays between time 50 and 200 (which is 150 minutes from now) is equal to the survival up to 50, then decay between 50-200. But since we are given that it survived up to 50, the conditional probability is [Probability(decayed between 50 and 200)] / Probability(survived up to 50).\n\nThe numerator is survival(50)*(1 - survival(150)), since after surviving 50, the chance to decay in the next 150 is 1 - survival(150). Wait, yes. Because survival(50) * [1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}] is the probability of surviving 50 then decaying in the next 150. So the conditional probability is [survival(50)*(1 - e^{-\u03bb*150})] / survival(50) ) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}. Which brings us back to the same as before. So the answer is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nAlternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start. So that's why the answer is 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}.\n\nSo let's compute that again. Let's see:\n\nWe know that e^{-\u03bb*100} =0.68, so e^{-\u03bb*150} = (e^{-\u03bb*100})^{1.5} =0.68^(3/2). Let me compute that. \n\n0.68^(1.5) = sqrt(0.68^3). Let's compute 0.68^3 first. 0.68*0.68=0.4624, then *0.68 again: 0.4624 *0.68. Let's compute that:\n\n0.4 *0.68 =0.272, 0.0624*0.68 =0.042432. So total 0.272 +0.042432 =0.314432. So 0.68^3 is ~0.314432. The square root of that is sqrt(0.314432). Let me see, sqrt(0.3144). Since 0.56 squared is 0.3136, so sqrt(0.3144) is approximately 0.5607. Therefore, e^{-\u03bb*150} \u22480.5607. Therefore, 1 - that is ~0.4393, so ~43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects another approach. Wait, but let me check if there's another way someone might approach it incorrectly.\n\nSuppose someone thought that the decay probability is linear, which it's not. But if they did, they might think that since 32% decay in 100 minutes, then per minute it's 0.32/100, so in 150 minutes it would be 0.32*(150/100) = 0.48, so 48%, which is D. But that's wrong because the decay is exponential, not linear. So that's a possible mistake. But the correct approach is using the exponential model.\n\nAnother check: Let's see, the half-life formula. Let me see what the half-life would be. Let me compute the half-life T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. Since \u03bb is ln(1/0.68)/100 \u22480.003857 per minute. So T1/2 \u22480.6931 /0.003857 \u2248180 minutes? Let me compute 0.6931 divided by 0.003857. Let's see, 0.003857 * 180 \u22480.694, so yes, that gives T1/2 \u2248180 minutes. So the half-life is about 180 minutes. \n\nSo, after 150 minutes, which is less than a half-life, the decay probability would be less than 50%, so 44% makes sense. If it were exactly a half-life (180 min), the probability would be 50%, so 150 is 5/6 of that, so less than 50%, so 44% is plausible.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using the half-life. Since T1/2=180 minutes, then the decay constant \u03bb= ln2/180 \u22480.00385 min\u207b\u00b9, which matches the earlier calculation. \n\nThen, the probability of decay in t minutes is 1 - e^{-\u03bb t} = 1 - 2^{-t/180}. \n\nSo for 150 minutes: 1 - 2^{-150/180} =1 - 2^{-5/6}. Let me compute 2^{5/6}. Since 2^(1/2)=1.414, 2^(1/3)=1.26, so 5/6 is 0.833. Let me see, 2^(5/6) is e^( (5/6)*ln2 ) \u2248 e^(5/6 *0.693) \u2248 e^(0.5775) \u22481.781. So 1/1.781 \u22480.561, so 1-0.561\u22480.439, so 43.9%, which again gives 44%, so A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A) 44%.\n\n\nThe decay probability of an atom is modeled by an exponential distribution, which is memoryless. Given that the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \u03bb. \n\nWe know the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\\[\n0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} \\implies e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\approx 0.003857 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \u03bb:\n\\[\nP(150) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 1 - 0.5607 \\approx 0.4393 \\, \\text{(or 44\\%)}.\n\\]\n\nThe memoryless property ensures this calculation holds regardless of prior survival time. The closest option is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
