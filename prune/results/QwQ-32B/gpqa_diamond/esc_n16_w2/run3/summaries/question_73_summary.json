      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asking for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in special relativity, you can't just add them directly like in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c\u00b2). Wait, right, because of the Lorentz transformations. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, their relative speed should be calculated using that formula. Let me plug in the numbers here.\n\nThe astronauts have velocities 0.6c and 0.5c. Let me see which one is considered the reference frame. Since the problem says \"relative speed,\" I think it's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. Let's say astronaut A is the one with 2m mass moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B (3m) at 0.5c. But actually, the question doesn't specify which one's frame, but maybe it's the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference divided by 1 minus (product over c squared). Let me compute that.\n\nSo v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2] \n\nThe numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.6*0.5)c\u00b2 /c\u00b2 = 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. \n\nSo v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D's first part. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So options B is 0.1c, which is wrong. A's 1.1c is impossible because nothing can go faster than c. So B and D are possible for the first part.\n\nNow the second part is total energy of the system. The total energy of each astronaut is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But in relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc\u00b2. So for each astronaut, we need to compute gamma for their respective speeds, multiply by their mass, and then add them together.\n\nLet me compute each gamma:\n\nFor the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):\n\ngamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. \n\nSo energy1 = gamma1 * (2m)c\u00b2 = 1.25 * 2m c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut (mass 3m, 0.5c):\n\ngamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let's compute sqrt(0.75). sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660. So 1/0.866 \u2248 1.1547. \n\nSo gamma2 is approximately 1.1547. \n\nEnergy2 = gamma2 * 3m c\u00b2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3 m c\u00b2 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2. \n\nAdding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. That's approximately 5.96 m c\u00b2. \n\nLooking at the options, that matches option C's second value (5.96 mc\u00b2). \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc\u00b2. Option D has 5 mc\u00b2. So the correct answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the gamma calculations?\n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma2 precisely. \n\nFor 0.5c, v/c = 0.5. So (v/c)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is exactly sqrt(3)/2, so 1 over that is 2/sqrt(3) \u2248 1.1547. So that's correct. \n\nSo 1.1547 *3 is indeed approximately 3.464, and adding 2.5 gives 5.964. So 5.96 when rounded. \n\nTherefore the correct answer should be option C. \n\nLooking back at the options, option B has E=4.96 which is way too low. Option D's 5 is exactly 2.5+2.5, but that would be if both gammas were 1, but they are moving, so their energies are higher. So yes, C is correct. \n\nSo the answer is C.\n",

Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at v1 = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v2 = 0.5c. Since they're in the same direction, from B's frame of reference, what would be A's speed? That's the relative velocity. The formula for transforming velocities between frames is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the observer's frame). Here, if we consider astronaut B's frame, then v would be 0.5c, and the velocity of astronaut A in the original frame is 0.6c. So plugging into the formula:\n\nu' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c\u00b2) \n\nCalculating numerator: 0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.3 c\u00b2)/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nSo u' = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.142857c. That's approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed would be around 0.14c. So looking at the options, that would be either C or D. The options C and D both have v_rel = 0.14c. So the next part is figuring out the total energy.\n\nTotal energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, so the total would be the sum of their individual energies. The energy for each is gamma times mass times c squared. So for each astronaut, compute gamma, multiply by their mass, then add them together.\n\nFirst astronaut has mass 2m moving at 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So for v = 0.6c, the term v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * mass * c\u00b2. So for the first astronaut, that's 1.25 * 2m * c\u00b2 = 2.5 m c\u00b2.\n\nSecond astronaut has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. Let's compute gamma here. v = 0.5c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2/sqrt(3) \u2248 1.1547. So energy is gamma * 3m * c\u00b2. Let's compute that: 1.1547 * 3 \u2248 3.464 m c\u00b2. \n\nAdding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 \u2248 5.964 m c\u00b2. Rounding that, it's approximately 5.96 mc\u00b2. \n\nLooking at the options, option C has v_rel 0.14c and E = 5.96 mc\u00b2. Option D has the same v_rel but E=5mc\u00b2, which is less. So the correct energy is 5.96, so the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made an error in gamma for the second astronaut. Let me recalculate that.\n\nSecond astronaut: v = 0.5c. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). \n\nsqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (\u221a3)/2 \u2248 0.8660. \n\nSo 1 divided by that is 2/\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547. That's correct. So 3m times that gamma gives 3*(1.1547) \u2248 3.464. \n\nAdding to 2.5 gives 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So yes, that's correct.

The relative velocity was 0.14c, so the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let astronaut B (moving at 0.5c) be the reference frame. The relative velocity \\( u' \\) of astronaut A (0.6c) in B's frame is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nu' = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.1428c \\approx 0.14c.\n\\]\n\nNext, compute the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by \\( \\gamma m c^2 \\).\n\nFor astronaut A (mass \\(2m\\), speed \\(0.6c\\)):\n\\[\n\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25,\n\\]\nso their energy is \\(1.25 \\times 2m \\times c^2 = 2.5mc^2\\).\n\nFor astronaut B (mass \\(3m\\), speed \\(0.5c\\)):\n\\[\n\\gamma_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547,\n\\]\nso their energy is \\(1.1547 \\times 3m \\times c^2 \\approx 3.464mc^2\\).\n\nAdding these energies gives:\n\\[\n2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \\approx 5.964mc^2 \\approx 5.96mc^2.\n\\]\n\nThe correct option with \\(v_{\\text{rel}} = 0.14c\\) and \\(E = 5.96mc^2\\) is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
