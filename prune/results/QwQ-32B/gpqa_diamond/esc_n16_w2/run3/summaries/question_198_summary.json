      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions forming complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the stability constants (\u03b2 values) mean. The stability constants here are given for different complexes. The problem states the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because usually, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but here \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22 and \u03b24 is lower. Wait, maybe I need to check the order again. Oh, maybe \u03b24 is for a four ligand complex, but the \u03b2 values might not be in order. Let me think. The question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I assume is the Co(SCN)2^+ species. Wait, but maybe the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The \u03b2 values correspond to each step. Wait, actually, stability constants (\u03b2) for complexes are given as \u03b2_n for the formation of the nth complex. For example, \u03b21 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- \u21cc Co(SCN)^+, \u03b22 is for Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- \u21cc Co(SCN)2^0, and so on. Wait, but the charges might vary here. Let me confirm. \n\nThe problem states that the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, so that's the one with two SCN^- ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 in the solution. \n\nThe given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M (so total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M), and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The total SCN- concentration is given, but since it's involved in complexation, we might have to consider the free SCN- concentration. However, the problem might be assuming that the SCN- concentration is in excess, but I can't be sure yet. \n\nThe approach here is to calculate the distribution of the various cobalt species using the stability constants. The stability constant \u03b2 for each complex is given by \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). \n\nThe total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = c(Co) = 0.01 M. \n\nBut since the problem gives the \u03b2 values for each step, maybe we can use the formula for the distribution coefficients. The distribution coefficient for each species is given by \u03b2n * [SCN-]^n divided by the sum over all \u03b2m * [SCN-]^m. \n\nAlternatively, the fraction of each species is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4). Wait, actually, the denominator is the sum of all \u03b2 terms multiplied by [SCN]^n for each n. \n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the distribution of complexes. The total concentration of the metal is the sum of all species:\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]\n\nBut using the stability constants, each complex can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN-]:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 [Co^2+] [SCN]^1\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4\n\nTherefore, substituting all into the total concentration equation:\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] ( 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo, solving for [Co^2+], we get:\n\n[Co^2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nOnce we have [Co^2+], we can compute each complex's concentration. But since the question is about the fraction of Co(SCN)2, which is the second complex, that would be [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co). \n\nCalculating the fraction for Co(SCN)2:\n\nFraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 [Co^2+]) / c(Co)\n\nBut since [Co^2+] = c(Co)/D, where D is the denominator (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + ...), then substituting:\n\nFraction = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 * (c(Co)/D )) / c(Co) ) = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 ) / D \n\nSo the fraction is just \u03b22 [SCN]^2 divided by the sum of all \u03b2 terms multiplied by [SCN]^n plus 1. \n\nTherefore, the denominator D is 1 + \u03b21[SCN] + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4. \n\nPlugging in the given values: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nLet me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst, compute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm0 = 1\n\nTerm1 = \u03b21 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm2 = \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nTerm3 = \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\nTerm4 = \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo D \u2248 2.3646\n\nNow, the numerator for the fraction of Co(SCN)2 is \u03b22 [SCN]^2, which is 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 (which is exactly the Term2). \n\nWait, so the fraction is Term2 / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating that: 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute that. \n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so approximately 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So that would be D. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here because the answer D is 16.9%, which matches my calculation. However, the question says the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, which is Co(SCN)2. But let me double-check the calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the \u03b2 values? The problem states the stability constants as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. That's a bit odd because usually \u03b2 increases with more ligands, but maybe in this case, the stability decreases beyond a certain point. But perhaps that's correct as per the problem statement. \n\nWait, let me recheck the terms again. \n\nTerm1 is \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 *0.1 =0.9\n\nTerm2 is \u03b22 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01 =0.4\n\nTerm3 is 63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063\n\nTerm4 is 16*(0.1)^4=0.0016\n\nTotal D =1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = indeed 2.3646. \n\nThe fraction for Co(SCN)2 is Term2/D =0.4 /2.3646\u22480.1691 or 16.9%, which is option D. But the options include D as 16.9%, so that would be the answer. But wait, maybe the question refers to a different complex? Wait, the blue complex. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)2^+? Or maybe it's a different charge? Wait, perhaps the cobalt(II) ion. Let me think about the charges. \n\nCobalt(II) is Co^2+. When it forms complexes with SCN^-, which is a monodentate ligand, each SCN^- adds a charge. Let's see: \n\nThe first complex would be Co(SCN)^+ (since Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)^+ )\n\nSecond: Co(SCN)2^0 (neutral)\n\nThird: Co(SCN)3^- \n\nFourth: Co(SCN)4^2- \n\nSo the dithiocyanato complex would be the second one, which is neutral. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)2. So the calculation I did should be correct. \n\nWait, but the problem states the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, so 0.01 M. The SCN- is 0.1 M. The denominator D is around 2.3646. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me confirm. \n\nThe fraction is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) / D. Because [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n. The total cobalt is [Co^2+]*(D) = c(Co). So [Co^2+] = c(Co)/D. \n\nThen, [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2_n * (c(Co)/D) * [SCN]^n. \n\nTherefore, the fraction is [Co(SCN)n]/c(Co) = (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n / D). So that's correct. \n\nSo for n=2, it's 40*(0.1)^2 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691 \u2192 16.9%, which is D. \n\nHmm. But the options include D as 16.9%. So why is the option B 25.6%? Maybe I did something wrong here. Wait, perhaps I misread the \u03b2 values. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, so the third complex (three ligands) has a higher \u03b2 than the fourth. So \u03b23 is higher than \u03b24. So when calculating the terms, Term3 is 63*(0.1)^3 = 0.063, and Term4 is 16*(0.1)^4 = 0.0016. So adding them all, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a different complex? Like maybe the trithiocyanato is the blue one? Wait, the question specifies the dithiocyanato (which is two SCN^- ligands), so it's the second complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D. Let me recalculate D:\n\n1 + 0.9 (term1) = 1.9. \n\nThen adding term2 (0.4): 1.9 +0.4 =2.3. \n\nThen term3 (0.063): 2.3 +0.063 =2.363. \n\nThen term4 (0.0016): 2.363 +0.0016 =2.3646. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives D \u22482.3646. \n\nSo 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nBut why is the option A 42.3% so high? Maybe I made an error in the formula. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using log stability constants instead of the actual \u03b2 values? But the question says \"stability constants\" so they should be the \u03b2 values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but when forming complexes, the free SCN- concentration is lower. Wait, but in the formula, [SCN-] is the total SCN- concentration? Or is it the free? Wait, no. Wait, the formula uses the free SCN- concentration. Wait, that's a crucial point I might have messed up. \n\nWait, hold on. This is a common point of confusion. The stability constant \u03b2_n is defined using the free concentrations of the metal and ligand. Therefore, the formula for the denominator D uses the free [SCN-], not the total. \n\nOh no! That's a big mistake here. I assumed that [SCN-] is the total concentration, but actually, the formula requires the free [SCN-], which is different. \n\nOh my, so this complicates things. Because the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but part of it is consumed in the complexes. Therefore, the free [SCN-] is less than 0.1 M. \n\nSo my previous calculation is wrong because I used 0.1 M for [SCN-], but that's the total concentration, not the free. Therefore, I need to set up equations with variables for the free [Co^2+] and free [SCN-]. \n\nThis complicates things. Let me try to approach this again properly. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let [Co^2+] = x. \n\nThe free [SCN-] = y. \n\nTotal cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so:\n\nx + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = 0.01 \n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M:\n\ny + [Co(SCN)] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] +4[Co(SCN)4] =0.1 \n\nBut each complex can be expressed in terms of x and y using the stability constants:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 x y \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y^2 \n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 x y^3 \n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 x y^4 \n\nSo substituting these into the total cobalt equation:\n\nx + \u03b21 x y + \u03b22 x y^2 + \u03b23 x y^3 + \u03b24 x y^4 = 0.01 \n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y^2 + \u03b23 y^3 + \u03b24 y^4 ] = 0.01 \n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate equation:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y^2 + 3 \u03b23 x y^3 +4 \u03b24 x y^4 =0.1 \n\nFactor out x and y where possible:\n\ny + x y [ \u03b21 + 2 \u03b22 y + 3 \u03b23 y^2 +4 \u03b24 y^3 ] =0.1 \n\nThis system of equations is quite complicated. But perhaps there's an assumption that can be made here. \n\nGiven that the total Co concentration is 0.01 M and SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher. So maybe the SCN- is in large excess, so that the free [SCN-] is approximately equal to 0.1 M? But that would be the initial assumption I made, but in that case, the answer comes out as D (16.9%), but maybe the correct answer is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the initial assumption (using total SCN- concentration as [SCN-] in the \u03b2 expressions), but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the cumulative formation constants instead of the stepwise ones. Wait, but the problem states stability constants \u03b21, \u03b22 etc. which are the cumulative stability constants. Wait, no, actually, sometimes \u03b2 can refer to stepwise or cumulative. Wait, let me confirm. \n\nStability constants can be defined in two ways: stepwise (K1, K2, etc.) or cumulative (\u03b21, \u03b22). The cumulative \u03b2n is the product of the stepwise K's up to n. \n\nThe problem says the stability constants \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b22 is the cumulative stability constant for the second complex, so \u03b22 = K1*K2. \n\nWait, but in any case, the formula for the distribution is the same as I used before, except that [SCN-] must be the free concentration. \n\nHmm, so this seems like a system of equations that is difficult to solve without approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- is close to the total concentration because the Co concentration is low. Let's see, the total Co is 0.01 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So the ratio is 1:10. So maybe the amount of SCN- consumed in complexes is small. Let's check that. \n\nIf we proceed with the initial assumption that y \u22480.1 M, then the answer would be D. But let's see how much SCN- is consumed. \n\nThe total SCN- consumed is (total in complexes) = 0.1 - y. \n\nIf y \u22480.1, then the consumed SCN- would be negligible. Let me compute the total SCN- consumed using the initial approach. \n\nFrom the first equation: \n\nx = 0.01 / D, where D is 2.3646, so x \u2248 0.01 /2.3646 \u22480.00423 M. \n\nThen the SCN- in complexes would be: \n\nTotal SCN- in complexes = \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y^2 + 3 \u03b23 x y^3 +4 \u03b24 x y^4 \n\nPlugging in the values with y=0.1:\n\n= 9*(0.00423)*(0.1) + 2*40*(0.00423)*(0.1)^2 + 3*63*(0.00423)*(0.1)^3 +4*16*(0.00423)*(0.1)^4 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 9 *0.00423 *0.1 = 9 *0.000423 \u22480.003807 \n\nSecond term: 2*40=80; 80 *0.00423 *0.01 =80*0.0000423 \u22480.003384 \n\nThird term: 3*63=189; 189 *0.00423 *0.001 =189*0.00000423\u22480.000798 \n\nFourth term:4*16=64; 64*0.00423 *0.0001=64*0.000000423\u22480.0000267 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n0.003807 +0.003384 \u22480.007191 \n\n+0.000798 \u22480.007989 \n\n+0.0000267 \u22480.008016 \n\nSo total SCN- consumed is ~0.008 M. The total SCN- was 0.1 M, so free y = 0.1 -0.008 \u22480.092 M. \n\nHmm, so the free SCN- is about 0.092 instead of 0.1. That's a difference of ~8%, which might affect the result. \n\nTherefore, the initial approximation may not be accurate enough. \n\nSo, to get a better approximation, let's do an iterative calculation. \n\nFirst approximation: y1 =0.1. \n\nCompute x1 = 0.01 / D1, where D1 =1 +9*(0.1)+40*(0.01)+63*(0.001)+16*(0.0001) = same as before, 2.3646. \n\nx1 \u22480.01 /2.3646 \u22480.00423. \n\nThen, compute the consumed SCN- as above, which was ~0.008, so free y2 =0.1 -0.008=0.092. \n\nNow, compute D2 with y=0.092:\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 y =9 *0.092 =0.828 \n\nTerm2: \u03b22 y\u00b2 =40*(0.092)^2. Let's compute 0.092 squared: ~0.008464. So 40*0.008464 \u22480.3386 \n\nTerm3: \u03b23 y^3 =63*(0.092)^3. 0.092^3 \u22480.092*0.008464\u22480.000778. 63*0.000778\u22480.0491 \n\nTerm4: \u03b24 y^4 =16*(0.092)^4. 0.092^4\u2248 (0.092^2)^2 =0.008464^2\u22480.0000716. 16*0.0000716\u22480.001146 \n\nNow, sum all terms with D2:\n\nD2 =1 +0.828 +0.3386 +0.0491 +0.001146 \u2248 \n\n1+0.828=1.828 \n\n+0.3386=2.1666 \n\n+0.0491=2.2157 \n\n+0.001146\u22482.2168 \n\nSo D2\u22482.2168 \n\nThen x2 =0.01 /2.2168\u22480.004513 M \n\nNow, compute the consumed SCN- with x2 and y=0.092. \n\nTotal consumed SCN- is:\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 x y =9 *0.004513 *0.092 \u22489 *0.000416\u22480.003744 \n\nTerm2: 2\u03b22 x y\u00b2 =2*40*(0.004513)*(0.092)^2 \n\nFirst, compute (0.092)^2\u22480.008464 \n\nThen, 40*0.004513*0.008464 \u224840*0.0000383 \u22480.001532. Multiply by 2: 0.003064 \n\nTerm3:3\u03b23 x y\u00b3=3*63*(0.004513)*(0.092)^3 \n\nCompute (0.092)^3\u22480.000778 \n\n63*0.004513*0.000778 \u224863*0.00000351 \u22480.000222. Multiply by 3: ~0.000666 \n\nTerm4:4\u03b24 x y^4=4*16*(0.004513)*(0.092)^4 \n\n(0.092)^4\u22480.0000716 \n\n16*0.004513*0.0000716\u224816*0.000000323\u22480.00000517.

So the free SCN- is approximately 0.0925 M. \n\nNow, let's compute D with y=0.0925 (which is about 0.0925). \n\nWait, D3 was already computed as 2.2257. So using this, the x is 0.004495. \n\nNow, to compute the fraction of Co(SCN)2: \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2 \n\n\u03b22=40, x\u22480.004495, y\u00b2\u22480.008556 \n\nSo 40 *0.004495 *0.008556 \u224840*(0.0000385)\u22480.00154 M \n\nTotal cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00154 /0.01 =0.154 \u219215.4%. \n\nHmm, that's lower than the previous 16.9% but closer to 15%. But the options don't have 15.4%. Wait, perhaps I need to do more iterations? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the initial approximation, which gave 16.9%, which is option D. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative calculation. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation of [Co(SCN)2] with x=0.004495 and y=0.0925. \n\n\u03b22 is 40, so:\n\n\u03b22 x y\u00b2 =40 *0.004495 * (0.0925)^2 \n\nFirst, (0.0925)^2 is 0.008556. \n\nMultiply that by 0.004495: 0.008556 *0.004495 \u22480.0000385 \n\nThen multiply by 40: 0.0000385 *40 =0.00154. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 0.00154 M. \n\nTotal is 0.01 M, so 0.00154/0.01 =0.154 \u219215.4%. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. Wait the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. \n\nHmm, maybe my iterative approach is missing something? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Wait, the fraction is [Co(SCN)2]/c(Co). \n\nBut [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2. \n\nWith x = c(Co)/D, so substituting:\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/D) * y\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 y\u00b2 / D) \n\nWait, that's the same as before, but with D being the denominator which includes terms with the free y. \n\nWait, in the iterative approach, we have D =1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074 \n\nSo the fraction for Co(SCN)2 is (\u03b22 y\u00b2 ) / D \n\nIn our case, with y=0.0925 and D\u22482.2257, then: \n\n\u03b22 y\u00b2 =40*(0.0925)^2 \u224840*0.008556\u22480.342 \n\nDivide by D=2.2257: 0.342 /2.2257\u22480.1537 \u2192 ~15.4%. \n\nHmm, which is still not matching the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that the total concentration of SCN- is the same as free, so the initial calculation. The problem states that [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Maybe in the problem statement, that [SCN-] is the free concentration. But that's unlikely, as usually the given concentration is total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the first approximation (with y=0.1), and the answer is D (16.9%). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the iterative approach. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's try to use the first approximation (y=0.1):\n\nD was 2.3646 \n\nThe fraction for Co(SCN)2 would be (\u03b22 y\u00b2)/D = (40*(0.01))/2.3646 =0.4/2.3646\u22480.169 (16.9%). \n\nThe options do have D as 16.9%, so maybe the question expects us to use the total SCN- as the free concentration, even though strictly speaking that's an approximation. Since the problem might be designed to use that approach. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo in the \u03b2 values? Or perhaps I misread them. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem states the stability constants as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nWait, perhaps \u03b24 is 160 instead of 16? Then the term4 would be 160*(0.1)^4=0.016, but that's just speculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \u03b2 values are given as log \u03b2? Wait, no, the problem says stability constants, so they are in the normal units. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the order of the complexes. Like the dithiocyanato is the third one? Wait, the question says dithiocyanato is two ligands. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the blue complex is Co(SCN)4^2-? No, that's a different color. The blue complex is probably the neutral one (Co(SCN)2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula where the \u03b2 are the stepwise constants instead of cumulative? Let me think. \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise K, \u03b22 the second, etc., then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. But the problem states \"stability constants \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40...\", so likely they are cumulative. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative calculation's D. Let me recompute D with y=0.0925. \n\nTerm1: \u03b21 y =9 *0.0925=0.8325 \n\nTerm2: \u03b22 y\u00b2=40*(0.0925)^2 =40*0.008556=0.34224 \n\nTerm3: \u03b23 y^3=63*(0.0925)^3. Let me compute (0.0925)^3: \n\n0.0925 *0.0925 =0.008556, then *0.0925 \u22480.000791. 63*0.000791\u22480.0498. \n\nTerm4: \u03b24 y^4=16*(0.0925)^4. \n\n(0.0925)^4= (0.008556)*(0.0925)^2 \u22480.008556 *0.008556\u22480.0000732? Wait, no. Wait (0.0925)^4 is (0.0925)^2 squared. So (0.008556)^2 =0.0000732. \n\nThus, \u03b24 term:16 *0.0000732\u22480.001171 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n1 +0.8325 =1.8325 \n\n+0.34224 =2.1747 \n\n+0.0498 =2.2245 \n\n+0.001171 \u22482.2257 \n\nYes, correct. \n\nSo the denominator D is indeed ~2.2257 with y=0.0925. \n\nThe fraction is (40*(0.0925)^2)/2.2257 \n\nCalculate numerator:40*(0.008556)=0.3422 \n\n0.3422 /2.2257 \u22480.1537 \u219215.37%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach where they assume that the complex with the highest \u03b2 is dominant? Let's see. \n\nThe \u03b2 values are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nThe highest \u03b2 is \u03b23=63 for the third complex. \n\nSo maybe the third complex is the most abundant, but the question is about the second. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where they use \u03b2 as stepwise constants? \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise (K1), \u03b22 the second (K2), etc., then the cumulative \u03b2 would be: \n\n\u03b21 = K1 \n\n\u03b22 = K1*K2 \n\n\u03b23=K1*K2*K3 \n\n\u03b24=K1*K2*K3*K4 \n\nBut in this case, the given \u03b23 is 63, which would be K1*K2*K3. \n\nBut if the problem's \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. \n\nWait, but the question says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" \n\nThe wording suggests that \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc., so they are cumulative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the total ligand concentration in the denominator, even if it's not correct? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the first approximation, so the answer is D. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 16.9%, which is what I get with the first approximation. The iterative approach gives a lower value, but maybe the question expects the first method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative approach. Let me try another way. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, so even if some is consumed, the amount is small. Let's see the first approximation gives 16.9%, which is option D, and that's one of the choices. The other options are higher, so perhaps the question assumes that the free [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nTherefore, considering that the problem might expect using the total [SCN-], the answer is D)16.9%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation of the iterative approach. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the first approximation, the fraction was 16.9%. \n\nIn the iterative approach, after two iterations, it's 15.4%. The options don't have that, so perhaps the question expects the initial calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the formula with total [SCN] in the denominator. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but since the options include D as 16.9%, which matches the first calculation, that must be the intended answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D)16.9%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions forming complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the stability constants (\u03b2 values) mean. The stability constants here are given for different complexes. The problem states the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because usually, the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but here \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22 and \u03b24 is lower. Wait, maybe I need to check the order again. Oh, maybe \u03b24 is for a four ligand complex, but the \u03b2 values might not be in order. Let me think. The question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I assume is the Co(SCN)2^+ species. Wait, but maybe the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The \u03b2 values correspond to each step. Wait, actually, stability constants (\u03b2) for complexes are given as \u03b2_n for the formation of the nth complex. For example, \u03b21 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- \u21cc Co(SCN)^+, \u03b22 is for Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- \u21cc Co(SCN)2^0, and so on. Wait, but the charges might vary here. Let me confirm. \n\nThe problem states that the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, so that's the one with two SCN^- ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)2 in the solution. \n\nThe given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M (so total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M), and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The total SCN- concentration is given, but since it's involved in complexation, we might have to consider the free SCN- concentration. However, the problem might be assuming that the SCN- concentration is in excess, but I can't be sure yet. \n\nThe approach here is to calculate the distribution of the various cobalt species using the stability constants. The stability constant \u03b2 for each complex is given by \u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). \n\nThe total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = c(Co) = 0.01 M. \n\nBut since the problem gives the \u03b2 values for each step, maybe we can use the formula for the distribution coefficients. The distribution coefficient for each species is given by \u03b2n * [SCN-]^n divided by the sum over all \u03b2m * [SCN-]^m. \n\nAlternatively, the fraction of each species is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4). Wait, actually, the denominator is the sum of all \u03b2 terms multiplied by [SCN]^n for each n. \n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the distribution of complexes. The total concentration of the metal is the sum of all species:\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]\n\nBut using the stability constants, each complex can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN-]:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 [Co^2+] [SCN]^1\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4\n\nTherefore, substituting all into the total concentration equation:\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] ( 1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nSo, solving for [Co^2+], we get:\n\n[Co^2+] = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + \u03b22 [SCN]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN]^4 )\n\nOnce we have [Co^2+], we can compute each complex's concentration. But since the question is about the fraction of Co(SCN)2, which is the second complex, that would be [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co). \n\nCalculating the fraction for Co(SCN)2:\n\nFraction = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 [Co^2+]) / c(Co)\n\nBut since [Co^2+] = c(Co)/D, where D is the denominator (1 + \u03b21 [SCN] + ...), then substituting:\n\nFraction = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 * (c(Co)/D )) / c(Co) ) = (\u03b22 [SCN]^2 ) / D \n\nSo the fraction is just \u03b22 [SCN]^2 divided by the sum of all \u03b2 terms multiplied by [SCN]^n plus 1. \n\nTherefore, the denominator D is 1 + \u03b21[SCN] + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4. \n\nPlugging in the given values: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nLet me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst, compute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm0 = 1\n\nTerm1 = \u03b21 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm2 = \u03b22 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nTerm3 = \u03b23 * [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\nTerm4 = \u03b24 * [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 +0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo D \u2248 2.3646\n\nNow, the numerator for the fraction of Co(SCN)2 is \u03b22 [SCN]^2, which is 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 (which is exactly the Term2). \n\nWait, so the fraction is Term2 / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating that: 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute that. \n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so approximately 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So that would be D. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here because the answer D is 16.9%, which matches my calculation. However, the question says the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, which is Co(SCN)2. But let me double-check the calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the \u03b2 values? The problem states the stability constants as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b24 is 16, which is lower than \u03b23. That's a bit odd because usually \u03b2 increases with more ligands, but maybe in this case, the stability decreases beyond a certain point. But perhaps that's correct as per the problem statement. \n\nWait, let me recheck the terms again. \n\nTerm1 is \u03b21 * [SCN] =9 *0.1 =0.9\n\nTerm2 is \u03b22 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01 =0.4\n\nTerm3 is 63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063\n\nTerm4 is 16*(0.1)^4=0.0016\n\nTotal D =1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016 = indeed 2.3646. \n\nThe fraction for Co(SCN)2 is Term2/D =0.4 /2.3646\u22480.1691 or 16.9%, which is option D. But the options include D as 16.9%, so that would be the answer. But wait, maybe the question refers to a different complex? Wait, the blue complex. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)2^+? Or maybe it's a different charge? Wait, perhaps the cobalt(II) ion. Let me think about the charges. \n\nCobalt(II) is Co^2+. When it forms complexes with SCN^-, which is a monodentate ligand, each SCN^- adds a charge. Let's see: \n\nThe first complex would be Co(SCN)^+ (since Co^2+ + SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)^+ )\n\nSecond: Co(SCN)2^0 (neutral)\n\nThird: Co(SCN)3^- \n\nFourth: Co(SCN)4^2- \n\nSo the dithiocyanato complex would be the second one, which is neutral. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)2. So the calculation I did should be correct. \n\nWait, but the problem states the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, so 0.01 M. The SCN- is 0.1 M. The denominator D is around 2.3646. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me confirm. \n\nThe fraction is (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n ) / D. Because [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n. The total cobalt is [Co^2+]*(D) = c(Co). So [Co^2+] = c(Co)/D. \n\nThen, [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2_n * (c(Co)/D) * [SCN]^n. \n\nTherefore, the fraction is [Co(SCN)n]/c(Co) = (\u03b2_n [SCN]^n / D). So that's correct. \n\nSo for n=2, it's 40*(0.1)^2 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691 \u2192 16.9%, which is D. \n\nHmm. But the options include D as 16.9%. So why is the option B 25.6%? Maybe I did something wrong here. Wait, perhaps I misread the \u03b2 values. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, so the third complex (three ligands) has a higher \u03b2 than the fourth. So \u03b23 is higher than \u03b24. So when calculating the terms, Term3 is 63*(0.1)^3 = 0.063, and Term4 is 16*(0.1)^4 = 0.0016. So adding them all, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to a different complex? Like maybe the trithiocyanato is the blue one? Wait, the question specifies the dithiocyanato (which is two SCN^- ligands), so it's the second complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D. Let me recalculate D:\n\n1 + 0.9 (term1) = 1.9. \n\nThen adding term2 (0.4): 1.9 +0.4 =2.3. \n\nThen term3 (0.063): 2.3 +0.063 =2.363. \n\nThen term4 (0.0016): 2.363 +0.0016 =2.3646. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives D \u22482.3646. \n\nSo 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nBut why is the option A 42.3% so high? Maybe I made an error in the formula. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using log stability constants instead of the actual \u03b2 values? But the question says \"stability constants\" so they should be the \u03b2 values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but when forming complexes, the free SCN- concentration is lower. Wait, but in the formula, [SCN-] is the total SCN- concentration? Or is it the free? Wait, no. Wait, the formula uses the free SCN- concentration. Wait, that's a crucial point I might have messed up. \n\nWait, hold on. This is a common point of confusion. The stability constant \u03b2_n is defined using the free concentrations of the metal and ligand. Therefore, the formula for the denominator D uses the free [SCN-], not the total. \n\nOh no! That's a big mistake here. I assumed that [SCN-] is the total concentration, but actually, the formula requires the free [SCN-], which is different. \n\nOh my, so this complicates things. Because the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but part of it is consumed in the complexes. Therefore, the free [SCN-] is less than 0.1 M. \n\nSo my previous calculation is wrong because I used 0.1 M for [SCN-], but that's the total concentration, not the free. Therefore, I need to set up equations with variables for the free [Co^2+] and free [SCN-]. \n\nThis complicates things. Let me try to approach this again properly. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let [Co^2+] = x. \n\nThe free [SCN-] = y. \n\nTotal cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so:\n\nx + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = 0.01 \n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M:\n\ny + [Co(SCN)] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] +4[Co(SCN)4] =0.1 \n\nBut each complex can be expressed in terms of x and y using the stability constants:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 x y \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y^2 \n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 x y^3 \n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 x y^4 \n\nSo substituting these into the total cobalt equation:\n\nx + \u03b21 x y + \u03b22 x y^2 + \u03b23 x y^3 + \u03b24 x y^4 = 0.01 \n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y^2 + \u03b23 y^3 + \u03b24 y^4 ] = 0.01 \n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate equation:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y^2 + 3 \u03b23 x y^3 +4 \u03b24 x y^4 =0.1 \n\nFactor out x and y where possible:\n\ny + x y [ \u03b21 + 2 \u03b22 y + 3 \u03b23 y^2 +4 \u03b24 y^3 ] =0.1 \n\nThis system of equations is quite complicated. But perhaps there's an assumption that can be made here. \n\nGiven that the total Co concentration is 0.01 M and SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher. So maybe the SCN- is in large excess, so that the free [SCN-] is approximately equal to 0.1 M? But that would be the initial assumption I made, but in that case, the answer comes out as D (16.9%), but maybe the correct answer is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the initial assumption (using total SCN- concentration as [SCN-] in the \u03b2 expressions), but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the cumulative formation constants instead of the stepwise ones. Wait, but the problem states stability constants \u03b21, \u03b22 etc. which are the cumulative stability constants. Wait, no, actually, sometimes \u03b2 can refer to stepwise or cumulative. Wait, let me confirm. \n\nStability constants can be defined in two ways: stepwise (K1, K2, etc.) or cumulative (\u03b21, \u03b22). The cumulative \u03b2n is the product of the stepwise K's up to n. \n\nThe problem says the stability constants \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b22 is the cumulative stability constant for the second complex, so \u03b22 = K1*K2. \n\nWait, but in any case, the formula for the distribution is the same as I used before, except that [SCN-] must be the free concentration. \n\nHmm, so this seems like a system of equations that is difficult to solve without approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- is close to the total concentration because the Co concentration is low. Let's see, the total Co is 0.01 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So the ratio is 1:10. So maybe the amount of SCN- consumed in complexes is small. Let's check that. \n\nIf we proceed with the initial assumption that y \u22480.1 M, then the answer would be D. But let's see how much SCN- is consumed. \n\nThe total SCN- consumed is (total in complexes) = 0.1 - y. \n\nIf y \u22480.1, then the consumed SCN- would be negligible. Let me compute the total SCN- consumed using the initial approach. \n\nFrom the first equation: \n\nx = 0.01 / D, where D is 2.3646, so x \u2248 0.01 /2.3646 \u22480.00423 M. \n\nThen the SCN- in complexes would be: \n\nTotal SCN- in complexes = \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y^2 + 3 \u03b23 x y^3 +4 \u03b24 x y^4 \n\nPlugging in the values with y=0.1:\n\n= 9*(0.00423)*(0.1) + 2*40*(0.00423)*(0.1)^2 + 3*63*(0.00423)*(0.1)^3 +4*16*(0.00423)*(0.1)^4 \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 9 *0.00423 *0.1 = 9 *0.000423 \u22480.003807 \n\nSecond term: 2*40=80; 80 *0.00423 *0.01 =80*0.0000423 \u22480.003384 \n\nThird term: 3*63=189; 189 *0.00423 *0.001 =189*0.00000423\u22480.000798 \n\nFourth term:4*16=64; 64*0.00423 *0.0001=64*0.000000423\u22480.0000267 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n0.003807 +0.003384 \u22480.007191 \n\n+0.000798 \u22480.007989 \n\n+0.0000267 \u22480.008016 \n\nSo total SCN- consumed is ~0.008 M. The total SCN- was 0.1 M, so free y = 0.1 -0.008 \u22480.092 M. \n\nHmm, so the free SCN- is about 0.092 instead of 0.1. That's a difference of ~8%, which might affect the result. \n\nTherefore, the initial approximation may not be accurate enough. \n\nSo, to get a better approximation, let's do an iterative calculation. \n\nFirst approximation: y1 =0.1. \n\nCompute x1 = 0.01 / D1, where D1 =1 +9*(0.1)+40*(0.01)+63*(0.001)+16*(0.0001) = same as before, 2.3646. \n\nx1 \u22480.01 /2.3646 \u22480.00423. \n\nThen, compute the consumed SCN- as above, which was ~0.008, so free y2 =0.1 -0.008=0.092. \n\nNow, compute D2 with y=0.092:\n\nCompute each term:\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 y =9 *0.092 =0.828 \n\nTerm2: \u03b22 y\u00b2 =40*(0.092)^2. Let's compute 0.092 squared: ~0.008464. So 40*0.008464 \u22480.3386 \n\nTerm3: \u03b23 y^3 =63*(0.092)^3. 0.092^3 \u22480.092*0.008464\u22480.000778. 63*0.000778\u22480.0491 \n\nTerm4: \u03b24 y^4 =16*(0.092)^4. 0.092^4\u2248 (0.092^2)^2 =0.008464^2\u22480.0000716. 16*0.0000716\u22480.001146 \n\nNow, sum all terms with D2:\n\nD2 =1 +0.828 +0.3386 +0.0491 +0.001146 \u2248 \n\n1+0.828=1.828 \n\n+0.3386=2.1666 \n\n+0.0491=2.2157 \n\n+0.001146\u22482.2168 \n\nSo D2\u22482.2168 \n\nThen x2 =0.01 /2.2168\u22480.004513 M \n\nNow, compute the consumed SCN- with x2 and y=0.092. \n\nTotal consumed SCN- is:\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 x y =9 *0.004513 *0.092 \u22489 *0.000416\u22480.003744 \n\nTerm2: 2\u03b22 x y\u00b2 =2*40*(0.004513)*(0.092)^2 \n\nFirst, compute (0.092)^2\u22480.008464 \n\nThen, 40*0.004513*0.008464 \u224840*0.0000383 \u22480.001532. Multiply by 2: 0.003064 \n\nTerm3:3\u03b23 x y\u00b3=3*63*(0.004513)*(0.092)^3 \n\nCompute (0.092)^3\u22480.000778 \n\n63*0.004513*0.000778 \u224863*0.00000351 \u22480.000222.

Multiply by 4: ~0.0000207 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n0.003744 +0.003064 =0.006808 \n\n+0.000666 =0.007474 \n\n+0.0000207\u22480.007495 \n\nTotal consumed SCN- is ~0.0075 M \n\nThus, free y3 =0.1 -0.0075 =0.0925 \n\nWait, but this is a bit confusing. Let me see, the previous y was 0.092, and now with x2, we get consumed SCN- as 0.0075, so y3 =0.1 -0.0075=0.0925. \n\nHmm, this is converging. Let's compute D with y=0.0925. \n\nCompute D3:\n\nTerm1: \u03b21 y =9*0.0925\u22480.8325 \n\nTerm2: \u03b22 y\u00b2=40*(0.0925)^2 \n\n0.0925 squared is ~0.008556. 40*0.008556\u22480.3422 \n\nTerm3: \u03b23 y^3=63*(0.0925)^3 \n\n0.0925^3\u22480.0925*0.008556\u22480.000791. 63*0.000791\u22480.0498 \n\nTerm4: \u03b24 y^4=16*(0.0925)^4 \n\n0.0925^4\u2248(0.008556)^2\u22480.0000732. 16*0.0000732\u22480.00117 \n\nSo D3 =1 +0.8325 +0.3422 +0.0498 +0.00117 \u2248 \n\n1+0.8325=1.8325 \n\n+0.3422=2.1747 \n\n+0.0498=2.2245 \n\n+0.00117\u22482.2257 \n\nThen x3 =0.01 /2.2257\u22480.004495 \n\nNow compute consumed SCN- with x3 and y=0.0925. \n\nTerm1: \u03b21 x y =9*(0.004495)*(0.0925) \u22489*0.000416\u22480.003744 \n\nTerm2: 2\u03b22 x y\u00b2 =2*40*(0.004495)*(0.0925)^2 \n\nCompute 0.0925\u00b2=0.008556. \n\n40*0.004495*0.008556 \u224840*(0.0000385)\u22480.00154.

So the free SCN- is approximately 0.0925 M. \n\nNow, let's compute D with y=0.0925 (which is about 0.0925). \n\nWait, D3 was already computed as 2.2257. So using this, the x is 0.004495. \n\nNow, to compute the fraction of Co(SCN)2: \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2 \n\n\u03b22=40, x\u22480.004495, y\u00b2\u22480.008556 \n\nSo 40 *0.004495 *0.008556 \u224840*(0.0000385)\u22480.00154 M \n\nTotal cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.00154 /0.01 =0.154 \u219215.4%. \n\nHmm, that's lower than the previous 16.9% but closer to 15%. But the options don't have 15.4%. Wait, perhaps I need to do more iterations? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the initial approximation, which gave 16.9%, which is option D. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative calculation. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation of [Co(SCN)2] with x=0.004495 and y=0.0925. \n\n\u03b22 is 40, so:\n\n\u03b22 x y\u00b2 =40 *0.004495 * (0.0925)^2 \n\nFirst, (0.0925)^2 is 0.008556. \n\nMultiply that by 0.004495: 0.008556 *0.004495 \u22480.0000385 \n\nThen multiply by 40: 0.0000385 *40 =0.00154. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 0.00154 M. \n\nTotal is 0.01 M, so 0.00154/0.01 =0.154 \u219215.4%. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. Wait the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. \n\nHmm, maybe my iterative approach is missing something? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Wait, the fraction is [Co(SCN)2]/c(Co). \n\nBut [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2. \n\nWith x = c(Co)/D, so substituting:\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/D) * y\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 y\u00b2 / D) \n\nWait, that's the same as before, but with D being the denominator which includes terms with the free y. \n\nWait, in the iterative approach, we have D =1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074 \n\nSo the fraction for Co(SCN)2 is (\u03b22 y\u00b2 ) / D \n\nIn our case, with y=0.0925 and D\u22482.2257, then: \n\n\u03b22 y\u00b2 =40*(0.0925)^2 \u224840*0.008556\u22480.342 \n\nDivide by D=2.2257: 0.342 /2.2257\u22480.1537 \u2192 ~15.4%. \n\nHmm, which is still not matching the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that the total concentration of SCN- is the same as free, so the initial calculation. The problem states that [SCN-] is 0.1 M. Maybe in the problem statement, that [SCN-] is the free concentration. But that's unlikely, as usually the given concentration is total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the first approximation (with y=0.1), and the answer is D (16.9%). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the iterative approach. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's try to use the first approximation (y=0.1):\n\nD was 2.3646 \n\nThe fraction for Co(SCN)2 would be (\u03b22 y\u00b2)/D = (40*(0.01))/2.3646 =0.4/2.3646\u22480.169 (16.9%). \n\nThe options do have D as 16.9%, so maybe the question expects us to use the total SCN- as the free concentration, even though strictly speaking that's an approximation. Since the problem might be designed to use that approach. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo in the \u03b2 values? Or perhaps I misread them. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem states the stability constants as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nWait, perhaps \u03b24 is 160 instead of 16? Then the term4 would be 160*(0.1)^4=0.016, but that's just speculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \u03b2 values are given as log \u03b2? Wait, no, the problem says stability constants, so they are in the normal units. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the order of the complexes. Like the dithiocyanato is the third one? Wait, the question says dithiocyanato is two ligands. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the blue complex is Co(SCN)4^2-? No, that's a different color. The blue complex is probably the neutral one (Co(SCN)2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula where the \u03b2 are the stepwise constants instead of cumulative? Let me think. \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise K, \u03b22 the second, etc., then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. But the problem states \"stability constants \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40...\", so likely they are cumulative. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative calculation's D. Let me recompute D with y=0.0925. \n\nTerm1: \u03b21 y =9 *0.0925=0.8325 \n\nTerm2: \u03b22 y\u00b2=40*(0.0925)^2 =40*0.008556=0.34224 \n\nTerm3: \u03b23 y^3=63*(0.0925)^3. Let me compute (0.0925)^3: \n\n0.0925 *0.0925 =0.008556, then *0.0925 \u22480.000791. 63*0.000791\u22480.0498. \n\nTerm4: \u03b24 y^4=16*(0.0925)^4. \n\n(0.0925)^4= (0.008556)*(0.0925)^2 \u22480.008556 *0.008556\u22480.0000732? Wait, no. Wait (0.0925)^4 is (0.0925)^2 squared. So (0.008556)^2 =0.0000732. \n\nThus, \u03b24 term:16 *0.0000732\u22480.001171 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n1 +0.8325 =1.8325 \n\n+0.34224 =2.1747 \n\n+0.0498 =2.2245 \n\n+0.001171 \u22482.2257 \n\nYes, correct. \n\nSo the denominator D is indeed ~2.2257 with y=0.0925. \n\nThe fraction is (40*(0.0925)^2)/2.2257 \n\nCalculate numerator:40*(0.008556)=0.3422 \n\n0.3422 /2.2257 \u22480.1537 \u219215.37%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach where they assume that the complex with the highest \u03b2 is dominant? Let's see. \n\nThe \u03b2 values are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nThe highest \u03b2 is \u03b23=63 for the third complex. \n\nSo maybe the third complex is the most abundant, but the question is about the second. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where they use \u03b2 as stepwise constants? \n\nIf \u03b21 is the first stepwise (K1), \u03b22 the second (K2), etc., then the cumulative \u03b2 would be: \n\n\u03b21 = K1 \n\n\u03b22 = K1*K2 \n\n\u03b23=K1*K2*K3 \n\n\u03b24=K1*K2*K3*K4 \n\nBut in this case, the given \u03b23 is 63, which would be K1*K2*K3. \n\nBut if the problem's \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. \n\nWait, but the question says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" \n\nThe wording suggests that \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc., so they are cumulative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses the total ligand concentration in the denominator, even if it's not correct? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the first approximation, so the answer is D. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 16.9%, which is what I get with the first approximation. The iterative approach gives a lower value, but maybe the question expects the first method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iterative approach. Let me try another way. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, so even if some is consumed, the amount is small. Let's see the first approximation gives 16.9%, which is option D, and that's one of the choices. The other options are higher, so perhaps the question assumes that the free [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nTherefore, considering that the problem might expect using the total [SCN-], the answer is D)16.9%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation of the iterative approach. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the first approximation, the fraction was 16.9%. \n\nIn the iterative approach, after two iterations, it's 15.4%. The options don't have that, so perhaps the question expects the initial calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the formula with total [SCN] in the denominator. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but since the options include D as 16.9%, which matches the first calculation, that must be the intended answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D)16.9%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and concentrations given (c(Co) = 10\u207b\u00b2 M, [SCN\u207b] = 0.1 M). \n\nThe fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of Co(SCN)_n} = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\\sum_{m=0}^4 \\beta_m [\\text{SCN}^-]^m}\n\\]\nwhere the denominator \\(D = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nD &= 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 \\\\\n&= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \\\\\n&= 2.3646\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe numerator for Co(SCN)\u2082 (n=2) is:\n\\[\n\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n\\]\nThus, the fraction is:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.1691 \\quad \\text{(16.9%)}\n\\]\nConsidering possible approximations and the given options, the closest answer is **D) 16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions forming complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The given concentrations are Co(II) at 1e-2 M and SCN- at 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Hmm, right. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) are involved in the formation of complexes. The formula for the species distribution would involve these \u03b2 values and the concentrations. The complexes here are probably Co(SCN)n^2\u2212 where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions, so that's the dithiocyanato complex, which would be Co(SCN)2^2\u2212. So I need to find the fraction of that species among all the cobalt species present.\n\nThe general approach here is to calculate the distribution of the cobalt species using the stability constants. The species present are Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2^2\u2212, Co(SCN)3^\u2212, and Co(SCN)4^2\u2212. Since \u03b2 values are given up to \u03b24, that would correspond to the four different complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands.\n\nThe formula for each species' concentration would involve the \u03b2 values multiplied by the free Co^2+ concentration times [SCN-]^n divided by the total concentration. Wait, actually, the total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all cobalt species concentrations equals that. The formula for each species is:\n\nFor the n-th complex: [Co(SCN)n^2\u2212] = \u03b2n * [Co^2+][SCN-]^n / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nWait, actually, I might need to recall the exact formula for the distribution. The distribution coefficients (\u03b1) for each species are given by:\n\n\u03b1n = (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nBecause the total concentration [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + ... + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212], and each term can be expressed as [Co^2+] multiplied by the respective \u03b2 term times [SCN-]^n. Therefore, [Co^2+] = [Co_total] / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nTherefore, the concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)n^2\u2212] = [Co_total] * \u03b2n [SCN-]^n / D,\n\nwhere D is the denominator 1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i.\n\nSo the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex would be (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / D) * 100%.\n\nWait, because the total is D, so each \u03b1n is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n)/D. So the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/D, then multiplied by 100 to get percentage.\n\nSo first, let me compute D, which is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-]^1 + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4.\n\nGiven the values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN-] is 0.1 M.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nTerm for i=0 (the 1): 1.\n\nTerm for i=1 (\u03b21 * [SCN]^1): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nTerm for i=2 (\u03b22 * [SCN]^2): 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.\n\nTerm for i=3 (\u03b23 * [SCN]^3): 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.\n\nTerm for i=4 (\u03b24 * [SCN]^4): 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.\n\nAdding all these terms together:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 \u2248 2.3646.\n\nSo D \u2248 2.3646.\n\nNow, the numerator for the n=2 species (dithiocyanato) is \u03b22 [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating that: 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute that.\n\n2.3646 divided into 0.4.\n\nWell, 2.3646 * 0.169 \u2248 0.4 (since 2.3646 * 0.17 is about 0.402). Let me do exact division:\n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1692.\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.1692, which is 16.92%. But the options include D)16.9% which is close. Wait, but hold on, the options also have 42.3%, which is much higher. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem states the stability constants \u03b21 to \u03b24. Let me confirm the setup again.\n\nWait, the \u03b2 values are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. The formula for the denominator D is indeed 1 + \u03b21[SCN] + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4. So the calculations for each term:\n\n\u03b21 term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 term: 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 *0.01=0.4\n\n\u03b23 term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 term: 16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding up all terms: 1 + 0.9 is 1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 gives 2.3646. So that's correct.\n\nThe numerator for the n=2 term is \u03b22*(SCN)^2 = 40*0.01=0.4. So 0.4 / 2.3646 is indeed approximately 0.1692, so 16.9%. So that would be option D, 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". But maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the stoichiometry wrong. Let me confirm the charges. The Co(II) ion has a +2 charge. When forming complexes with SCN-, which is -1 each, the charge of each complex:\n\nFor Co(SCN)n^2\u2212, the charge is 2\u2212 + (n*(-1))? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the cobalt is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So the overall charge of the complex would be:\n\nFor Co(SCN)n, the charge would be (2+) + n*(-1) = (2 - n) charge. So for example, when n=1, it's +1, n=2 would be 0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the formula is written as [Co(SCN)n]^m, where m is the charge.\n\nWait, perhaps the complexes are written as Co^(II) with n SCN- ligands, so the charge would be (2+ - n*(\u22121))? So the charge is (2 - (-n))? No, wait, each SCN- is -1, so adding n of them gives total -n. So the overall charge would be (2+ ) + (\u2212n) = (2 - n). So for n=1, the charge is +1, n=2 \u2192 0, n=3 \u2192 -1, n=4 \u2192 -2. So the complexes would have charges +1, 0, -1, -2. But in solution, they would have to be neutral or charged. Hmm, but in solution, they would form with counterions. The problem might be considering the complexes as species in solution, but the exact charge might not matter here since we are only concerned with the distribution.\n\nBut the key point is that the stability constants \u03b2n are given for each complex. The \u03b2 values are defined as the formation constants for the complexes. The general formula for the formation constant \u03b2n is:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^n)\n\nSo the distribution is indeed calculated as I did before. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum over all species, so each species concentration is [Co_total] * (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n)/D, where D is 1 + sum \u03b2i [SCN]^i.\n\nTherefore, the fraction for the n=2 complex is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2)/D. So with the numbers given, that gives 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1692, so ~16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the options include 42.3% as option A, which is much higher. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stability constants given are log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Because sometimes stability constants are reported as log values. But the question states \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So they are given as \u03b2, not log \u03b2. So that can't be the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted the formula. Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula for the concentration of the complex with n SCN- is [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n. The total concentration of cobalt is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + \u03b21[Co^2+][SCN-] + \u03b22[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b24[Co^2+][SCN-]^4.\n\nSo, [Co_total] = [Co^2+] (1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4) \u2192 [Co^2+] = [Co_total]/D, where D is the denominator. Therefore, the concentration of the n=2 complex is \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 [Co_total][SCN-]^2 / D.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/D, since [Co_total] cancels out. So the calculation is correct. Then the answer would be ~16.9%, which is option D. But the options have D as 16.9, so that's the answer. But why is the option A 42.3% so high? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D. Let me recalculate D again step by step:\n\n1 (the first term) is 1.\n\n\u03b21 term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. Total so far: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9.\n\n\u03b22 term: 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4. Adding to previous total: 1.9+0.4 = 2.3.\n\n\u03b23 term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063. Total becomes 2.3 +0.063 = 2.363.\n\n\u03b24 term:16*(0.1)^4 = 16 *0.0001 =0.0016. Adding that: 2.363 +0.0016 = 2.3646. Correct.\n\nSo D is indeed approximately 2.3646. The numerator for n=2 is 0.4. 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%.\n\nHmm. So that must be correct. Then why is the first option so high? Maybe I made a mistake in which complex is blue. The question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". Wait, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is the one with two ligands, but perhaps the blue color corresponds to a different complex?\n\nWait, I need to check what the actual color of Co(II) complexes with SCN- is. Wait, in some cases, the color might depend on the number of ligands. For example, Co(II) with thiocyanate can form complexes that are pink, blue, etc. But according to common knowledge, the hexaaqua cobalt(II) ion is pink, but when SCN- forms complexes, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is blue. Let me see if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the trithiocyanato or tetrathiocyanato?\n\nWait, I think in some references, the Co(II) complexes with SCN- can form different colored complexes. For example, the [Co(SCN)4]^2- complex is reported to be blue, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato (n=2) is the blue one. Wait, perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the dithiocyanato as n=2, but maybe my calculation is correct, so the answer would be D. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the \u03b2 values. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe problem states the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. These are the \u03b2 values for the complexes with n=1 to 4 SCN- ligands. So the \u03b2 for the dithiocyanato (n=2) is 40. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm. Then why the discrepancy with the options? Let me see the options again:\n\nA)42.3% \n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nHmm. So according to my calculation, D is correct. But maybe I made an error in the setup?\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the stability constants given are log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? For example, if \u03b21 was log \u03b2=9, then \u03b21 would be 1e9, which is way too big. That can't be. The problem states \"stability constants \u03b21=9\", so they are given as \u03b2, not log \u03b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is using the cumulative stability constants? Wait, no. The \u03b2 values here are the stepwise or overall stability constants? Wait, stability constants can be either stepwise (each subsequent ligand) or cumulative (the overall for n ligands). The question says \"stability constants\", which usually refers to the overall (cumulative) stability constants. So \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for forming the complex with n ligands. So my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the order of the \u03b2 values. Wait, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So \u03b21 is for n=1, \u03b22 for n=2, etc. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the total concentration is 1e-2 M for Co, but the formula uses [Co_total], so in the calculation of the fractions, the actual concentrations are proportional to the terms (\u03b2n [SCN]^n)/D, so the fractions don't depend on [Co_total], which cancels out. So my calculation is correct.\n\nHmm. Then the answer must be D, 16.9%. But the options have that as D, so that's the correct answer. Maybe I was overcomplicating, but the math seems to check out. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute all the fractions and see if they add to 100%.\n\nCompute each term's fraction:\n\nn=0 (free Co^2+): (1)/D = 1/2.3646 \u2248 0.423, so 42.3%.\n\nn=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.380 \u2192 38.0%.\n\nn=2: 0.4 \u2192 16.9%.\n\nn=3:0.063 /2.3646\u22480.0266 \u2192 ~2.66%.\n\nn=4:0.0016/2.3646 \u22480.000676 \u2192 ~0.0676%.\n\nAdding all these fractions: 42.3 + 38.0 \u224880.3, plus 16.9 gives 97.2, plus ~2.66 gives 99.86, plus 0.0676 gives ~99.93. Close enough, considering rounding. So the fractions are:\n\nFree Co^2+: ~42.3% (option A is 42.3%), which would be the first option. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (n=2), which is 16.9%, so D. But the free Co^2+ is the highest at ~42%, which is option A. But the question isn't asking for the free ion, but the dithiocyanato complex. So the answer is D. So that must be correct.\n\nWait, but why is the free cobalt so high? Because when [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but the \u03b2 values are small. For example, \u03b21=9, so the first complex has a \u03b2 of 9. The concentration of SCN- is 0.1. The term \u03b21*[SCN] is 0.9, which is added to 1. So the first complex (n=1) is 0.9/(~2.36) so ~38%, and free is ~42%, so together they are the majority. The n=2 is only ~16.9%.\n\nHmm.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate ions forming complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The given concentrations are Co(II) at 1e-2 M and SCN- at 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. Hmm, right. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that stability constants (\u03b2) are involved in the formation of complexes. The formula for the species distribution would involve these \u03b2 values and the concentrations. The complexes here are probably Co(SCN)n^2\u2212 where n is the number of SCN- ligands. The blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions, so that's the dithiocyanato complex, which would be Co(SCN)2^2\u2212. So I need to find the fraction of that species among all the cobalt species present.\n\nThe general approach here is to calculate the distribution of the cobalt species using the stability constants. The species present are Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)2^2\u2212, Co(SCN)3^\u2212, and Co(SCN)4^2\u2212. Since \u03b2 values are given up to \u03b24, that would correspond to the four different complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands.\n\nThe formula for each species' concentration would involve the \u03b2 values multiplied by the free Co^2+ concentration times [SCN-]^n divided by the total concentration. Wait, actually, the total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all cobalt species concentrations equals that. The formula for each species is:\n\nFor the n-th complex: [Co(SCN)n^2\u2212] = \u03b2n * [Co^2+][SCN-]^n / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nWait, actually, I might need to recall the exact formula for the distribution. The distribution coefficients (\u03b1) for each species are given by:\n\n\u03b1n = (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nBecause the total concentration [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + ... + [Co(SCN)4^2\u2212], and each term can be expressed as [Co^2+] multiplied by the respective \u03b2 term times [SCN-]^n. Therefore, [Co^2+] = [Co_total] / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i )\n\nTherefore, the concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)n^2\u2212] = [Co_total] * \u03b2n [SCN-]^n / D,\n\nwhere D is the denominator 1 + sum_{i=1}^4 \u03b2i [SCN-]^i.\n\nSo the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex would be (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / D) * 100%.\n\nWait, because the total is D, so each \u03b1n is (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n)/D. So the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/D, then multiplied by 100 to get percentage.\n\nSo first, let me compute D, which is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-]^1 + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4.\n\nGiven the values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\n[SCN-] is 0.1 M.\n\nSo let's compute each term:\n\nTerm for i=0 (the 1): 1.\n\nTerm for i=1 (\u03b21 * [SCN]^1): 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nTerm for i=2 (\u03b22 * [SCN]^2): 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.\n\nTerm for i=3 (\u03b23 * [SCN]^3): 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.\n\nTerm for i=4 (\u03b24 * [SCN]^4): 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.\n\nAdding all these terms together:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 \u2248 2.3646.\n\nSo D \u2248 2.3646.\n\nNow, the numerator for the n=2 species (dithiocyanato) is \u03b22 [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating that: 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute that.\n\n2.3646 divided into 0.4.\n\nWell, 2.3646 * 0.169 \u2248 0.4 (since 2.3646 * 0.17 is about 0.402). Let me do exact division:\n\n0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1692.\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.1692, which is 16.92%. But the options include D)16.9% which is close. Wait, but hold on, the options also have 42.3%, which is much higher. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem states the stability constants \u03b21 to \u03b24. Let me confirm the setup again.\n\nWait, the \u03b2 values are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. The formula for the denominator D is indeed 1 + \u03b21[SCN] + \u03b22[SCN]^2 + \u03b23[SCN]^3 + \u03b24[SCN]^4. So the calculations for each term:\n\n\u03b21 term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n\u03b22 term: 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 *0.01=0.4\n\n\u03b23 term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001=0.063\n\n\u03b24 term: 16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016\n\nAdding up all terms: 1 + 0.9 is 1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 gives 2.3646. So that's correct.\n\nThe numerator for the n=2 term is \u03b22*(SCN)^2 = 40*0.01=0.4. So 0.4 / 2.3646 is indeed approximately 0.1692, so 16.9%. So that would be option D, 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". But maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the stoichiometry wrong. Let me confirm the charges. The Co(II) ion has a +2 charge. When forming complexes with SCN-, which is -1 each, the charge of each complex:\n\nFor Co(SCN)n^2\u2212, the charge is 2\u2212 + (n*(-1))? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the cobalt is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So the overall charge of the complex would be:\n\nFor Co(SCN)n, the charge would be (2+) + n*(-1) = (2 - n) charge. So for example, when n=1, it's +1, n=2 would be 0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the formula is written as [Co(SCN)n]^m, where m is the charge.\n\nWait, perhaps the complexes are written as Co^(II) with n SCN- ligands, so the charge would be (2+ - n*(\u22121))? So the charge is (2 - (-n))? No, wait, each SCN- is -1, so adding n of them gives total -n. So the overall charge would be (2+ ) + (\u2212n) = (2 - n). So for n=1, the charge is +1, n=2 \u2192 0, n=3 \u2192 -1, n=4 \u2192 -2. So the complexes would have charges +1, 0, -1, -2. But in solution, they would have to be neutral or charged. Hmm, but in solution, they would form with counterions. The problem might be considering the complexes as species in solution, but the exact charge might not matter here since we are only concerned with the distribution.\n\nBut the key point is that the stability constants \u03b2n are given for each complex. The \u03b2 values are defined as the formation constants for the complexes. The general formula for the formation constant \u03b2n is:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^n)\n\nSo the distribution is indeed calculated as I did before. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum over all species, so each species concentration is [Co_total] * (\u03b2n [SCN-]^n)/D, where D is 1 + sum \u03b2i [SCN]^i.\n\nTherefore, the fraction for the n=2 complex is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2)/D. So with the numbers given, that gives 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1692, so ~16.9%, which is option D. But wait, the options include 42.3% as option A, which is much higher. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stability constants given are log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Because sometimes stability constants are reported as log values. But the question states \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So they are given as \u03b2, not log \u03b2. So that can't be the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted the formula. Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula for the concentration of the complex with n SCN- is [Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n. The total concentration of cobalt is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + \u03b21[Co^2+][SCN-] + \u03b22[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b24[Co^2+][SCN-]^4.\n\nSo, [Co_total] = [Co^2+] (1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4) \u2192 [Co^2+] = [Co_total]/D, where D is the denominator. Therefore, the concentration of the n=2 complex is \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 [Co_total][SCN-]^2 / D.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/D, since [Co_total] cancels out. So the calculation is correct. Then the answer would be ~16.9%, which is option D. But the options have D as 16.9, so that's the answer. But why is the option A 42.3% so high? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of D. Let me recalculate D again step by step:\n\n1 (the first term) is 1.\n\n\u03b21 term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9. Total so far: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9.\n\n\u03b22 term: 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4. Adding to previous total: 1.9+0.4 = 2.3.\n\n\u03b23 term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063. Total becomes 2.3 +0.063 = 2.363.\n\n\u03b24 term:16*(0.1)^4 = 16 *0.0001 =0.0016. Adding that: 2.363 +0.0016 = 2.3646. Correct.\n\nSo D is indeed approximately 2.3646. The numerator for n=2 is 0.4. 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, so 16.9%.\n\nHmm. So that must be correct. Then why is the first option so high? Maybe I made a mistake in which complex is blue. The question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". Wait, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is the one with two ligands, but perhaps the blue color corresponds to a different complex?\n\nWait, I need to check what the actual color of Co(II) complexes with SCN- is. Wait, in some cases, the color might depend on the number of ligands. For example, Co(II) with thiocyanate can form complexes that are pink, blue, etc. But according to common knowledge, the hexaaqua cobalt(II) ion is pink, but when SCN- forms complexes, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is blue. Let me see if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the trithiocyanato or tetrathiocyanato?\n\nWait, I think in some references, the Co(II) complexes with SCN- can form different colored complexes. For example, the [Co(SCN)4]^2- complex is reported to be blue, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato (n=2) is the blue one. Wait, perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the dithiocyanato as n=2, but maybe my calculation is correct, so the answer would be D. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the \u03b2 values. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe problem states the stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. These are the \u03b2 values for the complexes with n=1 to 4 SCN- ligands. So the \u03b2 for the dithiocyanato (n=2) is 40. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nHmm. Then why the discrepancy with the options? Let me see the options again:\n\nA)42.3% \n\nB)25.6%\n\nC)38.1%\n\nD)16.9%\n\nHmm. So according to my calculation, D is correct. But maybe I made an error in the setup?\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the stability constants given are log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? For example, if \u03b21 was log \u03b2=9, then \u03b21 would be 1e9, which is way too big. That can't be. The problem states \"stability constants \u03b21=9\", so they are given as \u03b2, not log \u03b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is using the cumulative stability constants? Wait, no. The \u03b2 values here are the stepwise or overall stability constants? Wait, stability constants can be either stepwise (each subsequent ligand) or cumulative (the overall for n ligands). The question says \"stability constants\", which usually refers to the overall (cumulative) stability constants. So \u03b2n is the overall stability constant for forming the complex with n ligands. So my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the order of the \u03b2 values. Wait, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So \u03b21 is for n=1, \u03b22 for n=2, etc. So that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the total concentration is 1e-2 M for Co, but the formula uses [Co_total], so in the calculation of the fractions, the actual concentrations are proportional to the terms (\u03b2n [SCN]^n)/D, so the fractions don't depend on [Co_total], which cancels out. So my calculation is correct.\n\nHmm. Then the answer must be D, 16.9%. But the options have that as D, so that's the correct answer. Maybe I was overcomplicating, but the math seems to check out. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute all the fractions and see if they add to 100%.\n\nCompute each term's fraction:\n\nn=0 (free Co^2+): (1)/D = 1/2.3646 \u2248 0.423, so 42.3%.\n\nn=1: 0.9 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.380 \u2192 38.0%.\n\nn=2: 0.4 \u2192 16.9%.\n\nn=3:0.063 /2.3646\u22480.0266 \u2192 ~2.66%.\n\nn=4:0.0016/2.3646 \u22480.000676 \u2192 ~0.0676%.\n\nAdding all these fractions: 42.3 + 38.0 \u224880.3, plus 16.9 gives 97.2, plus ~2.66 gives 99.86, plus 0.0676 gives ~99.93. Close enough, considering rounding. So the fractions are:\n\nFree Co^2+: ~42.3% (option A is 42.3%), which would be the first option. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (n=2), which is 16.9%, so D. But the free Co^2+ is the highest at ~42%, which is option A. But the question isn't asking for the free ion, but the dithiocyanato complex. So the answer is D. So that must be correct.\n\nWait, but why is the free cobalt so high? Because when [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but the \u03b2 values are small. For example, \u03b21=9, so the first complex has a \u03b2 of 9. The concentration of SCN- is 0.1. The term \u03b21*[SCN] is 0.9, which is added to 1. So the first complex (n=1) is 0.9/(~2.36) so ~38%, and free is ~42%, so together they are the majority. The n=2 is only ~16.9%.\n\nHmm. So according to the calculations, the correct answer is D)16.9%. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u207b) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and the concentrations [Co\u00b2\u207a] = 10\u207b\u00b2 M and [SCN\u207b] = 0.1 M. The distribution of species is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of species } n = \\frac{\\beta_n [\\text{SCN}^-]^n}{D}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( D = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\beta_i [\\text{SCN}^-]^i \\).\n\n**Calculating \\( D \\):**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nD &= 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 \\\\\n&= 1 + (9 \\times 0.1) + (40 \\times 0.1^2) + (63 \\times 0.1^3) + (16 \\times 0.1^4) \\\\\n&= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \\\\\n&= 2.3646\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the fraction for \\( n = 2 \\):**\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \\frac{40 \\times 0.01}{2.3646} \\approx \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.1692 \\ (16.92\\%)\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately **16.9%**, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
