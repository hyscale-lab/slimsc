      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each energy level n is E_n = (n\u00b2)E, where E is the base energy as given here. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each state can have a maximum of two particles (because spin can be +1/2 or -1/2).\n\nSo, with four particles, I need to fill the lowest energy states available, considering the exclusion principle. Let me start by listing the energy levels and how many particles can go into each. \n\nThe first energy level is n=1. Since each n has two possible spin states, that can hold two particles. Then n=2 would be next. The energy for n=2 is (2\u00b2)E =4E, but wait, actually, each n's energy is n squared times E. Wait, actually, the base E here is already the first energy level's value. Wait, the problem defines E as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), which is exactly E_1 for the particle in a box. So E_1 = E, E_2 =4E, E_3=9E, and so on. \n\nSo for four particles, let's see:\n\nStart with n=1: can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold another 2. That fills up four particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, but the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. \n\nSo each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two of them give 2E. The two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2*4E =8E. So total ground state energy would be 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, each single-particle state can hold two particles (same n but different spins). So for the ground state (lowest energy configuration), the four particles will occupy the lowest two energy levels each filled to maximum.\n\nSo n=1 can have two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 also can have two particles (spin up and down). So the total energy is (1\u00b2E)*2 (for n=1, two particles) plus (2\u00b2E)*2 (for n=2, two particles). Wait, no, wait. Wait, each particle in a state n contributes E_n. So each of the two particles in n=1 contribute E each. So 2*E. The two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2*4E =8E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E. Hmm. But the options don't have 10E as the first one. Wait, option C's first is 4E, which can't be. Wait, looking at the options again: A) 30E, 39E, 50E; B)4E, 10E,50E; C)4E,10E,15E; D)10E,15E,18E. So according to my calculation, the ground state energy would be 10E, so maybe the answer would have 10E as the first entry, so D is an option. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up. Let me think again. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible energy states. Since there are four particles, each n level can have two particles (since spin 1/2 allows two per n). So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +2\u00b2) * E? Wait, no. Wait, each particle's energy is n\u00b2E. So two particles in n=1 contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) =2E. Two in n=2 contribute 2*(2\u00b2E)=8E. Total is 10E. So the ground state is 10E, so looking at the options, D starts with 10E. But let me check the other options. Let me see the other states.\n\nThe first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available state. Since the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2, the next available state is n=3. But wait, can we promote one from n=2 to n=3? Because the ground state is filled up to n=2. So the first excited state would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but which way? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to the next available state, which is n=3, but since there are two particles in n=2, after moving one, you have one in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can have two particles. Wait, no, the first excited state would be the state with the least possible energy higher than the ground state. So the minimal change would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Because moving to n=3 gives the smallest increase in energy.\n\nSo the energy of that excited state would be: The original ground state energy was 10E. The new configuration would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + (2\u00b2E) + (3\u00b2E). Let's compute that: 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state would be 15E. Then the next excited state would be moving another particle. Let's see. The next step would be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3) or moving one from n=2 to n=4. Which gives a lower energy?\n\nWait, moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3 would give two in n=3, so the energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + 0 (since both n=2 particles are now moved) no, wait, no. Wait, original n=2 had two particles. If we move both to n=3, then the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E+18E=20E. Alternatively, moving one to n=3 and another to n=4 would give 2*(1\u00b2E) + (2\u00b2E) + (3\u00b2E) + (4\u00b2E)? Wait no, maybe that's a higher energy.\n\nAlternatively, the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited state would be when both particles from n=2 are moved to n=3, so the energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E? Or perhaps there's another possibility where moving one to n=3 and another to n=3, making two in n=3. So that's 2E + 0 (since n=2 has none left) but wait, the original was two in n=2, moving both to n=3. So then the total energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But that might not be the next excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, and another to n=3, making two in n=3. So total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 0 (since n=2 has none now?) Wait, no, the two particles from n=2 are now in n=3. So 2*9E, so total 20E. But maybe another configuration gives a lower energy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 15E), the next step is moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so total energy 2E + 0 (since n=2 now has none) + 2*9E = 20E). Alternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. Then the energy would be 2E + (2\u00b2E) (no, wait, no, because one is moved, so n=2 has 1 left?), wait this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.\n\nWait, the ground state has two particles in n=1, two in n=2. The first excited state must have one particle promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The energy is 2*1\u00b2E + 1*2\u00b2E + 1*3\u00b2E = 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's the first excited state. \n\nThen the second excited state would be the next possible configuration with the next lowest energy. The next step could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. The total energy would be 2*1\u00b2E + 0 + 2*3\u00b2E = 2E + 18E=20E. Alternatively, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3. Let's see which gives a lower energy. \n\nIf we instead move the second particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3, then the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 0 +9E +16E= 2E +25E =27E, which is higher than 20E. So the lower energy is moving both to n=3. So the second excited state would be 20E. But looking at the options, D's second excited state is 15E and 18E. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait another possibility: the first excited state is 15E (as before), then the second excited state could be moving one particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would be a higher energy. Let me see. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=3, but wait, n=1 can only hold two particles. Since they are already both filled, you can't move one from n=1 unless you have an empty spot. Wait, no, the particles in n=1 are already filled. So you can't move a particle from n=1 unless you remove one, but you can't have less than two in n=1 because that would lower the energy. Wait, no, actually, the first excited state is the first state above ground. So the next step after the first excited state (15E) would be the next possible configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3, and another to n=3, giving two in n=3, so total energy as 20E. But looking at the options given, the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at option D: D) 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here is 18E. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made an error in considering the configuration. Let me think again. Perhaps after the first excited state (15E), the next is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4? But that would give a higher energy. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. \n\nWait another approach: the ground state is n1 (twice) and n2 (twice). The first excited state is moving one from n2 to n3. The second excited state could be moving another from n2 to n3 (so two in n3, leading to 20E) or moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4, leading to higher energy. But perhaps there's another possibility where one of the particles in n1 is promoted? But n1 is already filled. Wait, no, you can't promote from n1 because you can't have less than two there. Wait, maybe the first excited state could have a different configuration. Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving from n2 to n3, but maybe splitting the n2 particles into higher levels?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, and the other stays. So that gives 15E. The second excited state would be when the other n2 particle is also promoted to n3, making two in n3, so energy 2E (n1) + 0 (n2) + 2*9E (n3) = 2E + 18E = 20E. But this isn't in any of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here is 18E. How would that happen? Let me think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving both to n3, you move one to n3 and one to n4. Then the total energy would be 2E (n1) + 0 (n2) +9E +16E = 27E, which is higher than 18E. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 (15E), and the second excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 and another to n4, but that gives 27E. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is not moving a particle from n2 to n3, but maybe there's another way. Wait, could there be a configuration where the particles are arranged differently? Like, maybe one particle in n3 and one in n1? But no, n1 is already filled with two. Maybe the first excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3, and another n1 particle moves to n3? But that would require taking a particle out of n1, which is already filled. Since you can't have less than two in n1, that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n1 and one in n2? But that would have higher energy. Because n1 can hold two, so putting a third there isn't possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again the ground state. Wait, four particles. Since each n can hold two, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold four particles. So the ground state is exactly those two levels filled. So the total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +2\u00b2)*E. Wait, each particle's energy is n\u00b2E. So each of the two in n=1 contribute 1E each, so 2E. The two in n=2 contribute 4E each, so 8E. Total 10E. So ground state is 10E. That's correct. \n\nFirst excited state: move one from n=2 to n=3. So now, in n=2, there is 1 particle (since we had two, now one left). The total energy would be: \n\nn=1 (two particles: 2E), n=2 (one particle:4E), n=3 (one particle:9E). Total is 2+4+9 =15E. So first excited state is 15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) =2E + 18E =20E. But that's not in any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another to n=4? Which gives 2E (n1) + (2\u00b2E from n2 remaining?) No, if we move one to n3 and one to n4, then n2 has 0. So total energy would be 2E (n1) + 9E (n3) +16E (n4) =27E. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving both to n3, we move one to n3 and one stays. Wait, that would be the first excited state again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't moving from n=2 to n=3, but maybe moving one from n=1 to a higher level? But that would increase the energy more. Let's see. Suppose we take one particle from n=1 (which is already filled) but that's not allowed because you can't have less than two in n=1. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the question. The particles are spin-1/2, so each energy level n can have two particles (spin up and down). So in the ground state, n=1 has two, n=2 has two, totaling four. The first excited state must have one particle promoted from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). That gives the first excited state energy as 15E, which matches option D's first excited. \n\nThe second excited state would be the next possible configuration. The next possible would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has 0, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) =2E + 18E =20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=4 instead? Then the energy would be 2E + (remaining 1 in n2 gives 4E) + 16E (n4). So total would be 2+4+16=22E. Still not in the options. \n\nWait, looking at option D, the second excited is 18E. How would that happen? Let me think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving both to n=3, you have one in n=3 and one in n=2? Wait, that would be the first excited state again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in considering the configuration. Let me think again. The ground state is n1(2), n2(2). First excited: n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). Energy 15E. The second excited could be when you have n1(2), n3(2), and n2(0). Which gives 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe another configuration where one is in n3 and one in n4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is not moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require taking a particle out of n=1, which can't be done since you can't have less than two there. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider that the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. Wait, but n=1 can only have two particles, so removing one would leave one there, but that would be lower energy? No, you can't have less than two. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state isn't the minimal one. Wait, no, the first excited state must be the lowest energy above the ground. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the total energy. Let me recalculate the second excited state as 20E, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option C is 4E, 10E, 15E. Wait, 4E is way too low. Option A's first is 30E which is way higher. Option B's first is 4E, which can't be. So maybe my approach is wrong?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total energy as the sum of individual particle energies, but maybe I'm missing something about the spin. Wait, no, spin doesn't contribute to the energy here. The energy is purely from the spatial part. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the particles are distinguishable? But no, the question says they're identical. So they must obey the exclusion principle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of each state as the total energy divided by the number of particles? But that doesn't make sense. The question says \"calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system\". So the total energy of the system. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's look at option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). How would 18E come about?\n\nSuppose after the first excited state (15E), the next step is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But that's impossible because n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4. Let me see: moving one from n=2 to n=4. So configuration: n1(2), n2(1), n4(1). Total energy: 2E +4E +16E =22E. Not 18E.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: perhaps the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But that can't be done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial ground state calculation. Let me think again. The ground state has four particles. The lowest energy configuration would be the first two energy levels each filled with two particles. So that's n=1 (two), n=2 (two). So energy is (2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2) * E = (2 + 8)E =10E. That's correct. \n\nThe first excited state must be the next possible configuration. That's moving one from n=2 to n=3. So energy is 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 =2+4+9=15E. \n\nThen the second excited state would be moving another from n=2 to n=3, so now n=2 has 0, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*(1)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2+18=20E. But none of the options have 20E. \n\nHmm. Let me check option D again. D's second excited is 18E. 18E would be if the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (one), and n=2 (one) plus another? Wait, no. Wait, 18E is 18E = (sum of n\u00b2 terms)*E. Let's see:\n\nIf the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one), that's 15E. To get 18E, maybe the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (zero), n=3 (two), but that's 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4? Let's see: 2*(1)^2 + 0 + 9 + 16 = 2+9+16=27. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4? So configuration: n1(2), n2(0), n3(1), n4(1). Total energy: 2E + 9E +16E =27E. \n\nHmm, none of these give 18E. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a configuration where the particles are arranged in a different way. Let me think of other possibilities. For four particles, perhaps the second excited state could be when one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to a higher level, but that's impossible because you can't have less than two in n=1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. So then n2 has 1 left. The total energy would be 2*(1)^2 + (1)^2*4 + (1)^2*16 + (1)^2*9? Wait no, let me recalculate. \n\nWait, after moving one from n=2 to n=4, the configuration would be: n1 has two, n2 has one (since started with two and moved one to n=4), n4 has one. So the total energy is 2*1\u00b2 + 1*2\u00b2 +1*4\u00b2 =2 +4 +16 =22E. \n\nHmm. Still not 18E. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2. Wait, but that's already counted in the first excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering different arrangements where the particles are in higher states but with some other combination. Let me think of the possible energy levels. Let's list possible total energies for four particles:\n\nGround: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E (as before).\n\nSecond excited: maybe moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3? So that gives 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have one particle in n=3 and another in n=2 (but that's the first excited again). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. Or maybe I'm missing something else. \n\nWait, perhaps the particles are bosons instead of fermions? But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. \n\nWait, let me check option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. The first is 4E. That would be if all four particles are in n=1. But that's impossible because n=1 can only hold two. So that can't be. \n\nOption B has first as 4E, which also impossible. \n\nOption D's ground state is 10E, first 15E, second 18E. How to get 18E?\n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a configuration where three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3? Let's see: n=2 can hold two, so three would require another level. Wait, three particles in n=2 would violate the exclusion principle. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1? No, that's the same as previous. \n\nWait, 18E. Let's see what n's would add up to 18E. Let me think of possible combinations of four particles:\n\nSuppose the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). That's 15E (the first excited). \n\nAnother configuration could be n=1 (two), n=3 (two). That's 20E. \n\nAnother configuration: n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=4 (one). Total is 2+4+16=22E. \n\nAlternatively, n=2 (two), n=3 (two). The energy would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a configuration where one particle is in n=4 and three in lower levels. \n\nWait, what if the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (to get 15E), then the next step is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total 20E), but that's not 18E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a lower energy configuration. Wait, what if the first excited state is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving one from n=1 to n=3? But that would require removing a particle from n=1, which you can't do. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, and the second excited state is when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3 (so two in n=3) but that gives 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=4? But that's higher. \n\nWait, perhaps the question has a different arrangement. Let me think of the possible energy levels for four particles. \n\nWait, perhaps the ground state is different. Wait, maybe the four particles can't all be in n=1 and n=2? Let me think again. \n\nEach energy level n can have two particles. So n=1 can have two, n=2 two, which is four total. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows for higher multiplicities but I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the energy levels are counted differently. The energy for a particle in level n is n\u00b2E, so the total energy is the sum over all particles of their individual energies. \n\nHmm. Let me try to see the options again. \n\nLooking at option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second). How would 18E come about?\n\n18E = total energy. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the configuration has:\n\nn=1 (two particles): 2E,\n\nn=3 (two particles): 2*9E =18E. Total is 2E+18E=20E. Not 18E.\n\nWait, perhaps n=1 (one?), but that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one), and another particle somewhere else? But that would require five particles. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state has three particles in n=2 and one in n=3? But n=2 can only hold two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question's options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for the second excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that gives a higher energy. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is different. Suppose the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to n=3? But that requires reducing n=1 to one, which is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would give a higher energy than 15E. \n\nWait, I'm really stuck here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E, 10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nThe ground state must be 10E, so D is the only one with 10E first. Then the first excited is 15E, which matches. The second excited is 18E. How can that be? \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3, but that's two in n=3, giving 20E. Not 18. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=1 to n=2? Wait, but n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the particles are arranged such that three are in n=2 and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two. So that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and three in n=3? Again, n=3 can only have two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that the particles are in different combinations. Let me think of the possible total energies. \n\nThe ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. The next possible would be when you have one in n=2 and two in n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). Wait, that would have five particles? No, total four. Wait, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That's four. That's the first excited. \n\nWait, another configuration for four particles: n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Total energy 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nAlternatively, n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=4 (one). Total energy 2+4+16=22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, that's the same as the first excited. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a configuration where the particles are in n=1 (two), n=3 (one), and n=2 (one), which is the first excited. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4 and another stays. \n\nWait, I'm not getting 18E. Maybe the question has an error, or perhaps I'm missing something obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy levels are additive differently. Let me think again. The energy for each particle is n\u00b2E. So the total is sum over all particles of n_i\u00b2E. \n\nLet me consider another possibility: what if the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that's the first excited. \n\nWait, let's think of the possible energy sums. To get 18E, the sum of n_i squared must be 18. Let's see:\n\nPossible combinations for four particles:\n\nWe need four numbers (each n_i is an integer >=1), each n_i can be used up to twice (since two particles per n), and the sum of their squares is 18. \n\nLet me see:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Two in n=1 (sum 2), two in n=2 (sum 8). Total 10 (ground).\n\nFirst excited: two in 1 (2), one in 2 (4), one in 3 (9). Total 15. \n\nSecond excited: two in 1 (2), zero in 2, two in 3 (18). Total 20. \n\nAlternatively, another combination to get 18:\n\nSuppose one in n=1 (1), three in n=2 (but n=2 can only have two). Not possible. \n\nHow about two in n=2 (sum 8), and two in n=3 (sum 18). Total 26. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, one in n=1 (1), two in n=2 (8), and one in n=3 (9). Total 1+8+9=18? Wait, that's 18. But that's four particles?\n\nWait, one in n=1, two in n=2 (total three particles), plus one in n=3: total four. Yes. \n\nWait, so the configuration would be:\n\nn=1 has one particle (but that's only one, but n=1 can hold two. Wait, but you can't have less than two in n=1? No, wait, the ground state requires filling lower levels first. \n\nWait, if you have one in n=1, that leaves one spot open, but you can't have particles in higher levels without filling lower ones first. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake I made earlier. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that you fill the lowest available states first. So you can't have a configuration where n=1 has one particle and n=2 has two, and n=3 has one, because that would mean leaving a lower energy state (n=1's second slot) unfilled. \n\nSo that configuration is invalid because you must fill lower energy states first. \n\nTherefore, the only valid configurations are those where all lower energy states are filled as much as possible before filling higher ones. \n\nSo, for example, to get a configuration that sums to 18E, you can't have one in n=1 and two in n=2 and one in n=3 because that leaves a hole in n=1. \n\nSo the only way to get 18 is if the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Which gives 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That gives 2E +4E +16E =22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=2 (four each) and two in n=3 (nine each). But that would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) = 8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles can have different spins but not following exclusion? But no, spin-1/2 are fermions, must obey exclusion. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. The only way to get 18E as in option D's second excited is if there's a configuration where the sum of squares is 18. Let me see:\n\nSuppose two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and two particles in n=0? No, n starts at 1. \n\nWait, maybe one particle in n=3 (9), two in n=2 (4 each), and one in n=1 (1). That would be 9+8+1 =18. But the configuration would be n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). But this requires leaving the second spot in n=1 empty, which is not allowed. Because you can't have a particle in a higher level (like n=2 or 3) without filling the lower level's available spots first. \n\nSo that configuration is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, the only valid configurations are those that fill the lower levels first. \n\nTherefore, the second excited state must be 20E, but since that's not an option, maybe the correct answer is D, and I made a mistake in considering that the second excited state is 20E. But the options have 18E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial steps. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait, option D's second excited is 18E. How could that be? \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but that would require taking a particle from n=1, which can't be done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that requires leaving a spot in n=1, which is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are in different spin states but not requiring the exclusion principle? But that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the energy formula. The question says E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2) which is exactly the energy of the first level (n=1). So the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, so the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Total energy is 2+4+9+16 = 31E. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles from n=2 are promoted to n=3 and n=4? So one in n=3 and one in n=4. That gives energy 2+ (0 in n2) +9+16= 2+25=27E. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really not seeing how to get 18E. Maybe the correct answer is D, and there's a configuration I'm missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that's the same as the first excited. \n\nWait, maybe the question counts the first excited as moving one from n=1 to n=3, but that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the correct answer is D, which is 10E, 15E, 18E, even if I can't see the 18E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have three particles in n=3 and one in n=2? But n=3 can only hold two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you have one in n=1 (two), one in n=2 (1), and two in n=3 (but that would require three particles in n=3 which can only hold two). \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The options given are D:10E,15E,18E. Since the first two are correct, and maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that would sum to 2+4+9+9? No, no. \n\nWait, two in n=3 would be 2*9=18, plus the two in n=1 (2) gives total 20. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the energy of each particle as (n\u00b2 + spin) but spin doesn't contribute. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy of the system as the difference from the ground state. But no, the question says to calculate the energies. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that option D has the first two correct, and the third is 18E which I can't see how it's possible, but maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and three in n=3? But that would require three particles in n=3 which is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the options, D is the only one that has the first two energies correct (10 and 15). The third is 18E. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking it's 20E. Perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4, but the total energy would be 2E (n1) + (1*4E from n2) +9E (n3) +16E (n4) =2+4+9+16=31E. No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. I think I have to go with option D as the best possible answer given the information, even if I can't see exactly how to get 18E. Maybe there's an error in my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=3 (1), and n=2 (1), which is the first excited. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited is 15E, the second is when another particle is promoted to n=3, so two in n=3 and none in n=2. So total energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E. But the option D has 18E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that when you have two particles in n=3, you can have them in different spin states but the energy is still the same. So the total energy is still 2*(3\u00b2)E for the two in n=3. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not counting the total energy correctly. Let me check the problem statement again. \n\nThe question says \"Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E.\" \n\nSo the total energy of the system is the sum of the individual particles' energies. \n\nSo the ground state is 10E. \n\nFirst excited is 15E. \n\nThe next state would be when you move the second particle from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=3, none in n=2. So energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(3)^2 E = 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nBut option D has 18E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are in different states but not following the exclusion principle. For example, allowing three particles in n=2. But that's impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options, the only possible answer that starts with 10 and 15 is D. Maybe the second excited state is 18E, but I can't see how. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me recheck:\n\nGround state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 \u2192 total energy 2*(1\u00b2) + 2*(2\u00b2) = 2+8=10E. \n\nFirst excited: move one from n=2 to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) =2+4+9=15E. \n\nSecond excited: move the other particle from n=2 to n=3. Now n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Total energy 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2+18=20E. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe options don't have 20E. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that the second excited state is when you move one particle from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy is 2+4+16=22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the first excited state is when one particle is moved to n=3 and another to n=2. But that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the answer is D, even though I can't see the 18E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the ground state. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. The total energy for four particles in the lowest possible states:\n\nThe first two levels (n=1 and n=2) each have two particles. Total energy is 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 2+8=10E. \n\nThe first excited state must have the next highest energy. The next configuration would be one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. Energy is 2+4+9=15E. \n\nThe next excited state would be promoting another from n=2 to n=3, giving two in n=3. Energy 2+18=20E. \n\nIf the options don't have that, maybe the question is considering different particle counts. \n\nWait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So they're fermions. So the configuration must obey the Pauli principle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, so the energy is 2+4+9+16=2+ (4 is from remaining n=2?) Wait, no, moving two particles from n=2 to n=3 and n=4. \n\nWait, moving one to n=3 and one to n=4 would give n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Total energy: 2+0+9+16=27E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3. But you can't do that because you can't have one particle in n=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that I can't find a configuration that gives 18E, and the only option with the first two correct is D, I'll have to choose that. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the second excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=2 and two in n=3. Wait, but that would mean the first excited is 15E, then next is 2*(2\u00b2) + 2*(3\u00b2) = 8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, but that's the 20E case. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the answer must be D, even though I can't see how to get 18E. Maybe the question had a different approach. \n\nWait, another possibility: the energies are for the system's total energy divided by the number of particles? But that would change the values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the energy per particle, but the problem says \"energies of the ground state, first excited state\", which are total energies. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the energy formula. The energy is E_n = (n\u00b2)E. So the first excited state is 15E (correct), and the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=3 and another to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with option D as the most plausible, even if I can't see the 18E. Maybe there's an error in my reasoning. \n\nSo the answer is D: 10E,15E,18E. But how?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but with the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). The total energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) =2+4+9+16=31E. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when you have three particles in n=2 and one in n=1. But that would require three in n=2 which can't happen. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have one particle in n=4 and three in n=2. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given that I can't find another configuration that gives 18E, but the first two are correct in option D, I think I have to choose D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well, we consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which restricts two particles per energy level (n). \n\n**Ground State**: The lowest energy configuration fills the lowest levels first. The first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) each hold two particles. The total energy is calculated as:\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E\\)\n- Two particles in n=2: \\(2 \\times (2^2 E) = 8E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 8E = 10E\\)\n\n**First Excited State**: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3:\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2E\\)\n- One particle in n=2: \\(1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E\\)\n- One particle in n=3: \\(1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\\)\n\n**Second Excited State**: Promote the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 (now two particles in n=3):\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2E\\)\n- Two particles in n=3: \\(2 \\times (3^2 E) = 18E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 18E = 20E\\). However, this is not an option. \n\nRe-evaluating possible configurations, the closest match to the options is **D**, which lists the second excited state as 18E. This might arise from a different configuration or a calculation oversight, but **D** is the only option with valid first two values (10E and 15E).\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A to D. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each energy level n is E_n = (n\u00b2)E, where E is the base energy as given here. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each state can have a maximum of two particles (because spin can be +1/2 or -1/2).\n\nSo, with four particles, I need to fill the lowest energy states available, considering the exclusion principle. Let me start by listing the energy levels and how many particles can go into each. \n\nThe first energy level is n=1. Since each n has two possible spin states, that can hold two particles. Then n=2 would be next. The energy for n=2 is (2\u00b2)E =4E, but wait, actually, each n's energy is n squared times E. Wait, actually, the base E here is already the first energy level's value. Wait, the problem defines E as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), which is exactly E_1 for the particle in a box. So E_1 = E, E_2 =4E, E_3=9E, and so on. \n\nSo for four particles, let's see:\n\nStart with n=1: can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold another 2. That fills up four particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, but the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. \n\nSo each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two of them give 2E. The two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2*4E =8E. So total ground state energy would be 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, each single-particle state can hold two particles (same n but different spins). So for the ground state (lowest energy configuration), the four particles will occupy the lowest two energy levels each filled to maximum.\n\nSo n=1 can have two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 also can have two particles (spin up and down). So the total energy is (1\u00b2E)*2 (for n=1, two particles) plus (2\u00b2E)*2 (for n=2, two particles). Wait, no, wait. Wait, each particle in a state n contributes E_n. So each of the two particles in n=1 contribute E each. So 2*E. The two in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2*4E =8E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E. Hmm. But the options don't have 10E as the first one. Wait, option C's first is 4E, which can't be. Wait, looking at the options again: A) 30E, 39E, 50E; B)4E, 10E,50E; C)4E,10E,15E; D)10E,15E,18E. So according to my calculation, the ground state energy would be 10E, so maybe the answer would have 10E as the first entry, so D is an option. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up. Let me think again. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible energy states. Since there are four particles, each n level can have two particles (since spin 1/2 allows two per n). So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +2\u00b2) * E? Wait, no. Wait, each particle's energy is n\u00b2E. So two particles in n=1 contribute 2*(1\u00b2E) =2E. Two in n=2 contribute 2*(2\u00b2E)=8E. Total is 10E. So the ground state is 10E, so looking at the options, D starts with 10E. But let me check the other options. Let me see the other states.\n\nThe first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available state. Since the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2, the next available state is n=3. But wait, can we promote one from n=2 to n=3? Because the ground state is filled up to n=2. So the first excited state would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but which way? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to the next available state, which is n=3, but since there are two particles in n=2, after moving one, you have one in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can have two particles. Wait, no, the first excited state would be the state with the least possible energy higher than the ground state. So the minimal change would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Because moving to n=3 gives the smallest increase in energy.\n\nSo the energy of that excited state would be: The original ground state energy was 10E. The new configuration would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + (2\u00b2E) + (3\u00b2E). Let's compute that: 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state would be 15E. Then the next excited state would be moving another particle. Let's see. The next step would be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3) or moving one from n=2 to n=4. Which gives a lower energy?\n\nWait, moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3 would give two in n=3, so the energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + 0 (since both n=2 particles are now moved) no, wait, no. Wait, original n=2 had two particles. If we move both to n=3, then the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E+18E=20E. Alternatively, moving one to n=3 and another to n=4 would give 2*(1\u00b2E) + (2\u00b2E) + (3\u00b2E) + (4\u00b2E)? Wait no, maybe that's a higher energy.\n\nAlternatively, the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited state would be when both particles from n=2 are moved to n=3, so the energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E? Or perhaps there's another possibility where moving one to n=3 and another to n=3, making two in n=3. So that's 2E + 0 (since n=2 has none left) but wait, the original was two in n=2, moving both to n=3. So then the total energy would be 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But that might not be the next excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is moved to n=3, and another to n=3, making two in n=3. So total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 0 (since n=2 has none now?) Wait, no, the two particles from n=2 are now in n=3. So 2*9E, so total 20E. But maybe another configuration gives a lower energy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 15E), the next step is moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so total energy 2E + 0 (since n=2 now has none) + 2*9E = 20E). Alternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. Then the energy would be 2E + (2\u00b2E) (no, wait, no, because one is moved, so n=2 has 1 left?), wait this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.\n\nWait, the ground state has two particles in n=1, two in n=2. The first excited state must have one particle promoted from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The energy is 2*1\u00b2E + 1*2\u00b2E + 1*3\u00b2E = 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's the first excited state. \n\nThen the second excited state would be the next possible configuration with the next lowest energy. The next step could be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. The total energy would be 2*1\u00b2E + 0 + 2*3\u00b2E = 2E + 18E=20E. Alternatively, promoting one particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3. Let's see which gives a lower energy. \n\nIf we instead move the second particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3, then the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 0 +9E +16E= 2E +25E =27E, which is higher than 20E. So the lower energy is moving both to n=3. So the second excited state would be 20E. But looking at the options, D's second excited state is 15E and 18E. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait another possibility: the first excited state is 15E (as before), then the second excited state could be moving one particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would be a higher energy. Let me see. If you move a particle from n=1 to n=3, but wait, n=1 can only hold two particles. Since they are already both filled, you can't move one from n=1 unless you have an empty spot. Wait, no, the particles in n=1 are already filled. So you can't move a particle from n=1 unless you remove one, but you can't have less than two in n=1 because that would lower the energy. Wait, no, actually, the first excited state is the first state above ground. So the next step after the first excited state (15E) would be the next possible configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3, and another to n=3, giving two in n=3, so total energy as 20E. But looking at the options given, the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at option D: D) 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here is 18E. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made an error in considering the configuration. Let me think again. Perhaps after the first excited state (15E), the next is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4? But that would give a higher energy. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. \n\nWait another approach: the ground state is n1 (twice) and n2 (twice). The first excited state is moving one from n2 to n3. The second excited state could be moving another from n2 to n3 (so two in n3, leading to 20E) or moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n4, leading to higher energy. But perhaps there's another possibility where one of the particles in n1 is promoted? But n1 is already filled. Wait, no, you can't promote from n1 because you can't have less than two there. Wait, maybe the first excited state could have a different configuration. Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving from n2 to n3, but maybe splitting the n2 particles into higher levels?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n2 is promoted to n3, and the other stays. So that gives 15E. The second excited state would be when the other n2 particle is also promoted to n3, making two in n3, so energy 2E (n1) + 0 (n2) + 2*9E (n3) = 2E + 18E = 20E. But this isn't in any of the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here is 18E. How would that happen? Let me think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving both to n3, you move one to n3 and one to n4. Then the total energy would be 2E (n1) + 0 (n2) +9E +16E = 27E, which is higher than 18E. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 (15E), and the second excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 and another to n4, but that gives 27E. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is not moving a particle from n2 to n3, but maybe there's another way. Wait, could there be a configuration where the particles are arranged differently? Like, maybe one particle in n3 and one in n1? But no, n1 is already filled with two. Maybe the first excited state is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3, and another n1 particle moves to n3? But that would require taking a particle out of n1, which is already filled. Since you can't have less than two in n1, that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when you have three particles in n1 and one in n2? But that would have higher energy. Because n1 can hold two, so putting a third there isn't possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again the ground state. Wait, four particles. Since each n can hold two, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold four particles. So the ground state is exactly those two levels filled. So the total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +2\u00b2)*E. Wait, each particle's energy is n\u00b2E. So each of the two in n=1 contribute 1E each, so 2E. The two in n=2 contribute 4E each, so 8E. Total 10E. So ground state is 10E. That's correct. \n\nFirst excited state: move one from n=2 to n=3. So now, in n=2, there is 1 particle (since we had two, now one left). The total energy would be: \n\nn=1 (two particles: 2E), n=2 (one particle:4E), n=3 (one particle:9E). Total is 2+4+9 =15E. So first excited state is 15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) =2E + 18E =20E. But that's not in any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another to n=4? Which gives 2E (n1) + (2\u00b2E from n2 remaining?) No, if we move one to n3 and one to n4, then n2 has 0. So total energy would be 2E (n1) + 9E (n3) +16E (n4) =27E. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where instead of moving both to n3, we move one to n3 and one stays. Wait, that would be the first excited state again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't moving from n=2 to n=3, but maybe moving one from n=1 to a higher level? But that would increase the energy more. Let's see. Suppose we take one particle from n=1 (which is already filled) but that's not allowed because you can't have less than two in n=1. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the question. The particles are spin-1/2, so each energy level n can have two particles (spin up and down). So in the ground state, n=1 has two, n=2 has two, totaling four. The first excited state must have one particle promoted from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). That gives the first excited state energy as 15E, which matches option D's first excited. \n\nThe second excited state would be the next possible configuration. The next possible would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has 0, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(3\u00b2E) =2E + 18E =20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=4 instead? Then the energy would be 2E + (remaining 1 in n2 gives 4E) + 16E (n4). So total would be 2+4+16=22E. Still not in the options. \n\nWait, looking at option D, the second excited is 18E. How would that happen? Let me think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving both to n=3, you have one in n=3 and one in n=2? Wait, that would be the first excited state again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in considering the configuration. Let me think again. The ground state is n1(2), n2(2). First excited: n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). Energy 15E. The second excited could be when you have n1(2), n3(2), and n2(0). Which gives 2E + 2*(9E) =20E. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe another configuration where one is in n3 and one in n4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is not moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require taking a particle out of n=1, which can't be done since you can't have less than two there. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to consider that the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. Wait, but n=1 can only have two particles, so removing one would leave one there, but that would be lower energy? No, you can't have less than two. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state isn't the minimal one. Wait, no, the first excited state must be the lowest energy above the ground. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the total energy. Let me recalculate the second excited state as 20E, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option C is 4E, 10E, 15E. Wait, 4E is way too low. Option A's first is 30E which is way higher. Option B's first is 4E, which can't be. So maybe my approach is wrong?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total energy as the sum of individual particle energies, but maybe I'm missing something about the spin. Wait, no, spin doesn't contribute to the energy here. The energy is purely from the spatial part. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the particles are distinguishable? But no, the question says they're identical. So they must obey the exclusion principle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of each state as the total energy divided by the number of particles? But that doesn't make sense. The question says \"calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system\". So the total energy of the system. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's look at option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). How would 18E come about?\n\nSuppose after the first excited state (15E), the next step is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But that's impossible because n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4. Let me see: moving one from n=2 to n=4. So configuration: n1(2), n2(1), n4(1). Total energy: 2E +4E +16E =22E. Not 18E.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: perhaps the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But that can't be done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial ground state calculation. Let me think again. The ground state has four particles. The lowest energy configuration would be the first two energy levels each filled with two particles. So that's n=1 (two), n=2 (two). So energy is (2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2) * E = (2 + 8)E =10E. That's correct. \n\nThe first excited state must be the next possible configuration. That's moving one from n=2 to n=3. So energy is 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 =2+4+9=15E. \n\nThen the second excited state would be moving another from n=2 to n=3, so now n=2 has 0, n=3 has two. So energy is 2*(1)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2+18=20E. But none of the options have 20E. \n\nHmm. Let me check option D again. D's second excited is 18E. 18E would be if the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (one), and n=2 (one) plus another? Wait, no. Wait, 18E is 18E = (sum of n\u00b2 terms)*E. Let's see:\n\nIf the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), and n=3 (one), that's 15E. To get 18E, maybe the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (zero), n=3 (two), but that's 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4? Let's see: 2*(1)^2 + 0 + 9 + 16 = 2+9+16=27. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4? So configuration: n1(2), n2(0), n3(1), n4(1). Total energy: 2E + 9E +16E =27E. \n\nHmm, none of these give 18E. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a configuration where the particles are arranged in a different way. Let me think of other possibilities. For four particles, perhaps the second excited state could be when one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to a higher level, but that's impossible because you can't have less than two in n=1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. So then n2 has 1 left. The total energy would be 2*(1)^2 + (1)^2*4 + (1)^2*16 + (1)^2*9? Wait no, let me recalculate. \n\nWait, after moving one from n=2 to n=4, the configuration would be: n1 has two, n2 has one (since started with two and moved one to n=4), n4 has one. So the total energy is 2*1\u00b2 + 1*2\u00b2 +1*4\u00b2 =2 +4 +16 =22E. \n\nHmm. Still not 18E. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2. Wait, but that's already counted in the first excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering different arrangements where the particles are in higher states but with some other combination. Let me think of the possible energy levels. Let's list possible total energies for four particles:\n\nGround: 10E.\n\nFirst excited: 15E (as before).\n\nSecond excited: maybe moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3? So that gives 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have one particle in n=3 and another in n=2 (but that's the first excited again). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. Or maybe I'm missing something else. \n\nWait, perhaps the particles are bosons instead of fermions? But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. \n\nWait, let me check option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. The first is 4E. That would be if all four particles are in n=1. But that's impossible because n=1 can only hold two. So that can't be. \n\nOption B has first as 4E, which also impossible. \n\nOption D's ground state is 10E, first 15E, second 18E. How to get 18E?\n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? But n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a configuration where three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3? Let's see: n=2 can hold two, so three would require another level. Wait, three particles in n=2 would violate the exclusion principle. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1? No, that's the same as previous. \n\nWait, 18E. Let's see what n's would add up to 18E. Let me think of possible combinations of four particles:\n\nSuppose the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). That's 15E (the first excited). \n\nAnother configuration could be n=1 (two), n=3 (two). That's 20E. \n\nAnother configuration: n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=4 (one). Total is 2+4+16=22E. \n\nAlternatively, n=2 (two), n=3 (two). The energy would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a configuration where one particle is in n=4 and three in lower levels. \n\nWait, what if the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (to get 15E), then the next step is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total 20E), but that's not 18E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a lower energy configuration. Wait, what if the first excited state is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is moving one from n=1 to n=3? But that would require removing a particle from n=1, which you can't do. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, and the second excited state is when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3 (so two in n=3) but that gives 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=4? But that's higher. \n\nWait, perhaps the question has a different arrangement. Let me think of the possible energy levels for four particles. \n\nWait, perhaps the ground state is different. Wait, maybe the four particles can't all be in n=1 and n=2? Let me think again. \n\nEach energy level n can have two particles. So n=1 can have two, n=2 two, which is four total. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows for higher multiplicities but I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the energy levels are counted differently. The energy for a particle in level n is n\u00b2E, so the total energy is the sum over all particles of their individual energies. \n\nHmm. Let me try to see the options again. \n\nLooking at option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first), 18E (second). How would 18E come about?\n\n18E = total energy. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the configuration has:\n\nn=1 (two particles): 2E,\n\nn=3 (two particles): 2*9E =18E. Total is 2E+18E=20E. Not 18E.\n\nWait, perhaps n=1 (one?), but that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one), and another particle somewhere else? But that would require five particles. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state has three particles in n=2 and one in n=3? But n=2 can only hold two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question's options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for the second excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that gives a higher energy. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is moving one from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is different. Suppose the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to n=3? But that requires reducing n=1 to one, which is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, but that would give a higher energy than 15E. \n\nWait, I'm really stuck here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E, 10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nThe ground state must be 10E, so D is the only one with 10E first. Then the first excited is 15E, which matches. The second excited is 18E. How can that be? \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3, but that's two in n=3, giving 20E. Not 18. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=1 to n=2? Wait, but n=1 can't have less than two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the particles are arranged such that three are in n=2 and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two. So that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and three in n=3? Again, n=3 can only have two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that the particles are in different combinations. Let me think of the possible total energies. \n\nThe ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. The next possible would be when you have one in n=2 and two in n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). Wait, that would have five particles? No, total four. Wait, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That's four. That's the first excited. \n\nWait, another configuration for four particles: n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Total energy 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nAlternatively, n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=4 (one). Total energy 2+4+16=22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, that's the same as the first excited. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a configuration where the particles are in n=1 (two), n=3 (one), and n=2 (one), which is the first excited. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4 and another stays. \n\nWait, I'm not getting 18E. Maybe the question has an error, or perhaps I'm missing something obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy levels are additive differently. Let me think again. The energy for each particle is n\u00b2E. So the total is sum over all particles of n_i\u00b2E. \n\nLet me consider another possibility: what if the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that's the first excited. \n\nWait, let's think of the possible energy sums. To get 18E, the sum of n_i squared must be 18. Let's see:\n\nPossible combinations for four particles:\n\nWe need four numbers (each n_i is an integer >=1), each n_i can be used up to twice (since two particles per n), and the sum of their squares is 18. \n\nLet me see:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Two in n=1 (sum 2), two in n=2 (sum 8). Total 10 (ground).\n\nFirst excited: two in 1 (2), one in 2 (4), one in 3 (9). Total 15. \n\nSecond excited: two in 1 (2), zero in 2, two in 3 (18). Total 20. \n\nAlternatively, another combination to get 18:\n\nSuppose one in n=1 (1), three in n=2 (but n=2 can only have two). Not possible. \n\nHow about two in n=2 (sum 8), and two in n=3 (sum 18). Total 26. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, one in n=1 (1), two in n=2 (8), and one in n=3 (9). Total 1+8+9=18? Wait, that's 18. But that's four particles?\n\nWait, one in n=1, two in n=2 (total three particles), plus one in n=3: total four. Yes. \n\nWait, so the configuration would be:\n\nn=1 has one particle (but that's only one, but n=1 can hold two. Wait, but you can't have less than two in n=1? No, wait, the ground state requires filling lower levels first. \n\nWait, if you have one in n=1, that leaves one spot open, but you can't have particles in higher levels without filling lower ones first. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake I made earlier. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that you fill the lowest available states first. So you can't have a configuration where n=1 has one particle and n=2 has two, and n=3 has one, because that would mean leaving a lower energy state (n=1's second slot) unfilled. \n\nSo that configuration is invalid because you must fill lower energy states first. \n\nTherefore, the only valid configurations are those where all lower energy states are filled as much as possible before filling higher ones. \n\nSo, for example, to get a configuration that sums to 18E, you can't have one in n=1 and two in n=2 and one in n=3 because that leaves a hole in n=1. \n\nSo the only way to get 18 is if the configuration is n=1 (two), n=3 (two). Which gives 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That gives 2E +4E +16E =22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=2 (four each) and two in n=3 (nine each). But that would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) = 8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles can have different spins but not following exclusion? But no, spin-1/2 are fermions, must obey exclusion. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. The only way to get 18E as in option D's second excited is if there's a configuration where the sum of squares is 18. Let me see:\n\nSuppose two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and two particles in n=0? No, n starts at 1. \n\nWait, maybe one particle in n=3 (9), two in n=2 (4 each), and one in n=1 (1). That would be 9+8+1 =18. But the configuration would be n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). But this requires leaving the second spot in n=1 empty, which is not allowed. Because you can't have a particle in a higher level (like n=2 or 3) without filling the lower level's available spots first. \n\nSo that configuration is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, the only valid configurations are those that fill the lower levels first. \n\nTherefore, the second excited state must be 20E, but since that's not an option, maybe the correct answer is D, and I made a mistake in considering that the second excited state is 20E. But the options have 18E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial steps. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait, option D's second excited is 18E. How could that be? \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but that would require taking a particle from n=1, which can't be done. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that requires leaving a spot in n=1, which is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are in different spin states but not requiring the exclusion principle? But that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the energy formula. The question says E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2) which is exactly the energy of the first level (n=1). So the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, so the configuration is n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Total energy is 2+4+9+16 = 31E. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles from n=2 are promoted to n=3 and n=4? So one in n=3 and one in n=4. That gives energy 2+ (0 in n2) +9+16= 2+25=27E. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really not seeing how to get 18E. Maybe the correct answer is D, and there's a configuration I'm missing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that's the same as the first excited. \n\nWait, maybe the question counts the first excited as moving one from n=1 to n=3, but that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the correct answer is D, which is 10E, 15E, 18E, even if I can't see the 18E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have three particles in n=3 and one in n=2? But n=3 can only hold two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you have one in n=1 (two), one in n=2 (1), and two in n=3 (but that would require three particles in n=3 which can only hold two). \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The options given are D:10E,15E,18E. Since the first two are correct, and maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that would sum to 2+4+9+9? No, no. \n\nWait, two in n=3 would be 2*9=18, plus the two in n=1 (2) gives total 20. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the energy of each particle as (n\u00b2 + spin) but spin doesn't contribute. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy of the system as the difference from the ground state. But no, the question says to calculate the energies. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that option D has the first two correct, and the third is 18E which I can't see how it's possible, but maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and three in n=3? But that would require three particles in n=3 which is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the options, D is the only one that has the first two energies correct (10 and 15). The third is 18E. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking it's 20E. Perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4, but the total energy would be 2E (n1) + (1*4E from n2) +9E (n3) +16E (n4) =2+4+9+16=31E. No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. I think I have to go with option D as the best possible answer given the information, even if I can't see exactly how to get 18E. Maybe there's an error in my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=3 (1), and n=2 (1), which is the first excited. \n\nWait, perhaps the first excited is 15E, the second is when another particle is promoted to n=3, so two in n=3 and none in n=2. So total energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E. But the option D has 18E. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that when you have two particles in n=3, you can have them in different spin states but the energy is still the same. So the total energy is still 2*(3\u00b2)E for the two in n=3. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not counting the total energy correctly. Let me check the problem statement again. \n\nThe question says \"Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E.\" \n\nSo the total energy of the system is the sum of the individual particles' energies. \n\nSo the ground state is 10E. \n\nFirst excited is 15E. \n\nThe next state would be when you move the second particle from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=3, none in n=2. So energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(3)^2 E = 2E + 18E =20E. \n\nBut option D has 18E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are in different states but not following the exclusion principle. For example, allowing three particles in n=2. But that's impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options, the only possible answer that starts with 10 and 15 is D. Maybe the second excited state is 18E, but I can't see how. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first excited state. Let me recheck:\n\nGround state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 \u2192 total energy 2*(1\u00b2) + 2*(2\u00b2) = 2+8=10E. \n\nFirst excited: move one from n=2 to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) =2+4+9=15E. \n\nSecond excited: move the other particle from n=2 to n=3. Now n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Total energy 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2+18=20E. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe options don't have 20E. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that the second excited state is when you move one particle from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy is 2+4+16=22E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the first excited state is when one particle is moved to n=3 and another to n=2. But that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the answer is D, even though I can't see the 18E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the ground state. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. The total energy for four particles in the lowest possible states:\n\nThe first two levels (n=1 and n=2) each have two particles. Total energy is 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 2+8=10E. \n\nThe first excited state must have the next highest energy. The next configuration would be one particle promoted from n=2 to n=3. Energy is 2+4+9=15E. \n\nThe next excited state would be promoting another from n=2 to n=3, giving two in n=3. Energy 2+18=20E. \n\nIf the options don't have that, maybe the question is considering different particle counts. \n\nWait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So they're fermions. So the configuration must obey the Pauli principle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4, so the energy is 2+4+9+16=2+ (4 is from remaining n=2?) Wait, no, moving two particles from n=2 to n=3 and n=4. \n\nWait, moving one to n=3 and one to n=4 would give n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Total energy: 2+0+9+16=27E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3. But you can't do that because you can't have one particle in n=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that I can't find a configuration that gives 18E, and the only option with the first two correct is D, I'll have to choose that. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the second excited state. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=2 and two in n=3. Wait, but that would mean the first excited is 15E, then next is 2*(2\u00b2) + 2*(3\u00b2) = 8+18=26E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, but that's the 20E case. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the answer must be D, even though I can't see how to get 18E. Maybe the question had a different approach. \n\nWait, another possibility: the energies are for the system's total energy divided by the number of particles? But that would change the values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the energy per particle, but the problem says \"energies of the ground state, first excited state\", which are total energies. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the energy formula. The energy is E_n = (n\u00b2)E. So the first excited state is 15E (correct), and the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=3 and another to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with option D as the most plausible, even if I can't see the 18E. Maybe there's an error in my reasoning. \n\nSo the answer is D: 10E,15E,18E. But how?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but with the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). The total energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) =2+4+9+16=31E. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when you have three particles in n=2 and one in n=1. But that would require three in n=2 which can't happen. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is when you have one particle in n=4 and three in n=2. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given that I can't find another configuration that gives 18E, but the first two are correct in option D, I think I have to choose D.\n\n\nTo determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well, we consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which restricts two particles per energy level (n). \n\n**Ground State**: The lowest energy configuration fills the lowest levels first. The first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) each hold two particles. The total energy is calculated as:\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E\\)\n- Two particles in n=2: \\(2 \\times (2^2 E) = 8E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 8E = 10E\\)\n\n**First Excited State**: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3:\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2E\\)\n- One particle in n=2: \\(1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E\\)\n- One particle in n=3: \\(1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\\)\n\n**Second Excited State**: Promote the remaining particle from n=2 to n=3 (now two particles in n=3):\n- Two particles in n=1: \\(2E\\)\n- Two particles in n=3: \\(2 \\times (3^2 E) = 18E\\)\n- Total: \\(2E + 18E = 20E\\). However, this is not an option. \n\nRe-evaluating possible configurations, the closest match to the options is **D**, which lists the second excited state as 18E. This might arise from a different configuration or a calculation oversight, but **D** is the only option with valid first two values (10E and 15E).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A through D, each with different combinations. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2), but here they've defined E as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). Wait, maybe I should check the relationship between the given E and the standard formula. Let me think. Oh right, the standard formula uses h instead of \u0127. Since h = 2\u03c0\u0127, substituting that in:\n\nStandard E_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2). Wait, that would mean that the standard formula is (n\u00b2)/(2) * E. Wait no, let me recalculate that. Let me see:\n\nThe standard energy levels are E_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2). Since h = 2\u03c0\u0127, substituting gives:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2)? Wait, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so that would be (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, no, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so the entire expression would be (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (4/8) \u2192 which is (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2) \u2192 so that's (n\u00b2 / 2) * (\u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) \u2192 but the given E in the question is E = \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So the standard energy levels can be written as E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * E. Wait, no, because (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2))*(1/2) would be (n\u00b2/2) * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) but that's not matching. Let me see again:\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal formula:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2)\n\nBut h is Planck's constant, which is 2\u03c0\u0127. So substituting h = 2\u03c0\u0127 gives:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 ) / (8mL\u00b2) = (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2) / (8mL\u00b2) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2) / (2mL\u00b2) * (4/8) \u2192 the 4/8 reduces to 1/2, so E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) \u2192 but the given E is exactly \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So then E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * E. Wait, so that means each energy level is (n squared over 2) times E. Wait, but that seems off. Let me check with an example. For n=1, the standard energy would be (1)^2 * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2))*(1/2) \u2192 but that would be (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(4mL\u00b2). But according to the given E, which is \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), then the standard E_1 would be (1/2) E. Wait, so maybe I got this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question's E is defined as the energy for n=1? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states: \"E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)\". Wait, that's exactly the standard formula for the first energy level when n=1. Because E_1 = (1)^2 h\u00b2/(8mL\u00b2). Wait, but substituting h = 2\u03c0\u0127, then E_1 = ( (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) = \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2) \u2192 which is exactly the given E. So, in the problem's terms, E is the energy of the first level (n=1). Therefore, the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. Because E_1 is E, E_2 would be (2)^2 E =4E, E_3=9E, etc. Wait, that makes sense. Because if E is defined as the ground state (n=1) energy, then each subsequent level is n squared times that. So the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. Okay, so that part is clear now.\n\nNow, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they're spin-1/2, they are fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each quantum state can hold at most two particles (since spin can be +1/2 or -1/2). So, we need to fill the energy levels with four particles, considering that each n level can have two particles (since each n has two spin states). \n\nThe ground state of the system would be when all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states, respecting the exclusion principle. Let's see:\n\nThe lowest energy states are filled first. The first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles (spin up and down). The next level (n=2) can also hold two particles, so for four particles, we need to fill both n=1 and n=2. Wait, that's four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, no, wait. Wait n=1 can hold two, n=2 holds two, so total four. So the ground state would have particles in n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). Wait but then the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Since E_1 is E (since E is defined as E_1), so E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E. So the total energy would be 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Wait, no. Each particle contributes its own energy. Since two particles are in n=1, each with energy E, so their total contribution is 2E. The two in n=2 each have 4E, so 2*4E =8E. Total is 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E?\n\nWait but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D has 10E as the first entry (ground state), but option C's first entry is 4E. Hmm, so perhaps I made an error here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the total energy. Let me see.\n\nWait, the particles are identical fermions, so the ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with spin up/down), then the next two go into n=2 (also spin up/down). So the total energy is indeed 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E, which would correspond to option D or A or others. Wait, looking at the options: option D is 10E,15E,18E. Option A's first is 30E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each n level can have two particles (since spin can be up or down). So the ground state would have the first two particles in n=1 (each with spin up and down), then the next two in n=2 (each with spin up and down). So total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2) * E? Wait, no, each particle's energy is n\u00b2 E, so for two particles in n=1, their total contribution is 2*(1\u00b2 E) = 2E. The two in n=2 contribute 2*(4E) =8E. So total is 10E, which matches the ground state as 10E. So the first entry in the options must be 10E. Looking at the options, D has 10E as the first entry. But let me check the other options. Option C's first entry is 4E, which would be if only two particles are placed, but since we have four, that can't be right. Option B's first is 4E, which is even less. So maybe D is a candidate. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy levels. Wait, maybe the energy levels are n squared times E, where E is the ground state (n=1). So yes, that's correct. So the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next higher energy level. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nThe ground state has all four particles filled up to n=2. Wait, no, wait, n=1 has two, n=2 has two. The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement where the total energy is higher by the minimal amount. Let's think of how to arrange four particles with minimal energy but higher than the ground state. \n\nThe ground state is n1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n2\u2193. To get the first excited state, perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3? Because the next available higher energy state. Let me see. The total energy would then be 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 1*(2\u00b2 E) + 1*(3\u00b2 E). So that would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3? Wait, but the minimal increase would be moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to n=3. So replacing one of the n=2 particles with n=3. So the energy would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) \u2192 2E + 4E +9E = 15E. So that would be the first excited state energy. Then the second excited state would be moving another particle to higher levels. \n\nAlternatively, another possibility for the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but keeping the other n=2 particle. So the first excited state would be 2E (from n=1) plus 4E (from one n=2) plus 9E (from one n=3) \u2192 total 15E. That's the first excited state. Then the next excited state would be either moving the second n=2 to n=3 as well, making both n=3 (so total energy 2E + 2*9E = 20E?), or moving one to n=3 and another to n=4, but perhaps the minimal step is moving another to n=3? Hmm, wait let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the first excited state could be when the two particles in n=2 are both moved up. But that would be a larger jump. Wait, the minimal energy increase would be moving just one particle. So the first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state could be moving the second n=2 particle to n=3, so total energy would be 2*(1) + 0*(2\u00b2) + 2*(3\u00b2) \u2192 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But that might not be the next state. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving one to n=3 and another to n=4? Let me see. Let's see the possible configurations.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another configuration for the first excited state. For example, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, and another to n=2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state could have one particle in n=3 and one remaining in n=2, but that's what I already considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from n=1 to a higher level, which would actually increase the total energy more. Because moving from n=1 to n=3 would add (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2) E = (9-1)E =8E, whereas moving from n=2 to n=3 adds (9-4)E =5E. So moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller energy increase, so that's better for the first excited state.\n\nSo first excited state is 15E. Then the next excited state would be either moving another n=2 particle to n=3 (so total energy 2E + 0*4E + 2*9E = 20E), or moving one to n=3 and one to n=4 (so 2E +1*4E +1*9E + 1*16E? Wait, but that would require more particles. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we can either:\n\n1. Move another particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The total energy would be 2*(1)E + 2*(9)E = 2 + 18 = 20E.\n\n2. Alternatively, move one from n=2 to n=4. That would give two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E = 22E. But that's a higher energy than 20E, so the minimal next step would be the first option (20E).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=3? Wait, but that would require two particles in n=3, which is allowed since they can have opposite spins. So that would be the case where both n=2 particles are moved to n=3. So that gives the energy as 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different arrangement where the first excited state is moving one to n=3, and the second excited state is moving one to n=3 and another to n=4. Hmm, but that would have a higher energy than 20E, so 20E would be the second excited state. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here would be 18E, which is less than 20E. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but then the second excited state is moving a particle to n=4 instead. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is 15E (as before), and the second excited state is when instead of moving both n=2 particles to n=3, we move one to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps there's another way to arrange the particles to get a lower energy than 20E. Let me think of possible configurations.\n\nAnother possibility: the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3 (total energy 15E). The next excited state could be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3 and another n=2 to n=3? No, but that's the same as moving both. Alternatively, maybe moving one n=2 to n=3 and another to n=4? That would give total energy 2E + (4E from one n=2?), no. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nWait in the first excited state, there are two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the next state would be the next possible configuration. Let's see:\n\nThe next possible configuration with minimal energy would be moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. So now, two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. That gives energy 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 20E. But in the options, 20E isn't listed. Option D's third is 18E. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? Wait, but moving from n=1 to higher would require more energy. For example, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would add (9 -1)E =8E, which would be worse than moving from n=2 to n=3 which gives 5E. So that's not minimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is not moving to n=3 but to n=2? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps there's another arrangement. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial configuration. Let me re-express the system step by step.\n\nGround state:\n\nAll four particles in the lowest possible states. Since each n level can hold two particles (spin up/down), the first two particles go to n=1 (each spin), then the next two go to n=2 (each spin). So the configuration is:\n\nn1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n2\u2193 \u2192 total energy: 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. That's the ground state. So that matches the first part of option D (10E).\n\nFirst excited state: the next possible configuration with minimal energy increase. To do this, we need to promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So now, the configuration is:\n\nn1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n3\u2191 (or any spin). Wait, but the particles are identical, so the exact spin doesn't matter for energy. The total energy would be 2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 2E +4E +9E = 15E. So that's 15E. Which matches the second entry in option D (15E). \n\nNow, the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. The minimal next step would be to promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. But there's only one particle left in n=2 (since we had two before, but now one is moved to n=3). Wait, no, in the first excited state, after moving one from n=2 to n=3, the n=2 has one particle left. So to promote another, we can move that last n=2 particle to n=3. Then the configuration becomes two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. The total energy is 2*(1^2) + 2*(3^2) E \u2192 2E + 18E = 20E. But 20E isn't in any of the options except maybe option A's third term (50E), which is way higher. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, so 18E would be the third. Where does that come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? No, that would be worse. Or maybe moving one particle to n=4 instead?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state isn't moving both n=2 particles to n=3 but instead moving one to n=3 and another to n=4?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter the first excited state (15E), the next possible configuration would be the next minimal energy. Let's see other possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility for the first excited state could be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E. Then the next state could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. But that would give energy 2E + (remaining n=2 has 1 particle, so 4E) plus the one in n=3 (9E) and a new one in n=4 (16E). Wait, but that would require having a particle in n=4, so total energy:\n\n2E (from n=1) + (1 in n=2: 4E) + 1 in n=3 (9E) + 1 in n=4 (16E). But that's four particles. Wait, no, the total particles must still be four. Let me see:\n\nOriginal after first excited: 2 (n1) +1 (n2) +1 (n3) =4. To get the next state, perhaps move one from n=2 to n=4. So then n2 has 0, n4 has 1. Then total energy: 2E +0 +9E +16E = 27E. That's higher than 15E but higher than 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of moving the second n=2 to n=3 (which gives 20E), perhaps moving one to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's another arrangement where two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that would require having three particles above n=1. Wait, but the total particles are four. So 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3 (total 4). That's the first excited. Then the next is moving the n2 to n3 (so two in n3, total 20E) or moving one to n=4 (total 27E). \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E,10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nHmm, so option D's third entry is 18E. How could that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the configuration. Perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is moved to n=3 and another to n=2? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from a lower level?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to a higher level, but that would give a larger energy increase. For example, moving a n=1 particle to n=3. That would add (9-1)E =8E, leading to total energy 10E +8E=18E. Wait, let me see that.\n\nWait, let's think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (to get 15E), maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. That would give a higher energy. Let's see:\n\nOriginal ground state is 10E. If we move one from n=1 to n=3, then the configuration would have one in n=1 (spin up/down?), but since we have four particles, let me think: two particles in n=1, but one is moved. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIn ground state, n1 has two particles (each spin). To move one from n=1 to n=3, you would have one in n=1, one in n=3, and the other two still in n=2. Wait, but that would leave n=2 with two particles. Wait, no. Wait, the initial four are two in n1 and two in n2. To move one from n1 to n3:\n\nThe configuration would be:\n\nn1 has one particle (since one was moved), n2 has two, and n3 has one. So total particles:1+2+1=4. The energy would be (1^2 E)*1 + (2^2 E)*2 + (3^2 E)*1 \u2192 1E + 8E +9E = 18E. \n\nBut that's higher than 15E, so that would not be the first excited state but the second? Wait, but that would be a larger energy increase than moving a n2 to n3. So the first excited state would still be the 15E, and the second excited state could be either 18E (moving a n1 to n3) or 20E (moving the remaining n2 to n3). \n\nAh, so maybe the first excited is 15E, the second excited could be 18E (moving a n1 to n3) which is less than 20E. Because 18E is less than 20E, so that's a lower energy than moving both n2's to n3. So that would be the next possible state.\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nOption D's third is 18E. That would be the case if the second excited state is when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3. But is that allowed? Let's see:\n\nThe ground state has two particles in n=1. To move one to n=3, you need to leave one in n=1. So that would be possible, but why would that be the next excited state?\n\nBecause moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives an energy increase of (9-1)E =8E. Whereas moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives an increase of (9-4)E=5E. So the minimal next step after the first excited (15E) is to move another n2 to n3 (increase of 5E again?), but wait, after the first excited state, the remaining n2 has only one particle left. So moving that one would give the 20E. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would give an increase of 8E over the ground state, but the first excited state is already 15E (increase of 5E from ground). So the difference between ground (10E) and first excited (15E) is 5E. The difference between first excited (15E) and the 18E would be 3E, which is smaller than the 5E step. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the excited states in order of energy. The first excited is the lowest possible energy above ground. The second is the next higher, etc. \n\nSo after the ground state (10E), the next possible is 15E (first excited). The next would be the next lowest energy above 15E. So what's the next possible configuration?\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Move the remaining n=2 particle to n=3 \u2192 total energy 20E.\n\n2. Move one n=1 particle to n=3 \u2192 total energy (1E + 4E (n2) + 9E (n3) + 1E (the other n1?) Wait, no. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait if you move one n=1 to n=3, then:\n\nOriginal ground: 2 in n1, 2 in n2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nAfter moving one from n1 to n3:\n\nn1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Total energy:\n\n1*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 1E + 8E +9E =18E. \n\nYes, that's 18E. That's higher than 15E, but less than 20E. So that would be the second excited state. \n\nAh, so that's possible. So the first excited is 15E, the second is 18E, and the third would be 20E. But in the options, D has 10E,15E,18E. So that matches. The second excited state would be 18E. \n\nSo why is that configuration possible? Because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives a higher energy than moving from n=2 to n=3, but once you've already done the first excited (moving a n2 to n3), the next minimal step is moving a n1 to n3. \n\nWait, but actually, the first excited state is moving a n2 to n3 (15E). The next possible configuration would be either moving the other n2 to n3 (giving 20E) or moving a n1 to n3 (giving 18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state would indeed be 18E. \n\nSo then the ground is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Which is exactly option D. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that configuration is allowed. The four particles would be arranged as follows for the second excited state (18E):\n\nAfter moving one from n1 to n3:\n\nn1 has 1 particle (either spin up or down?), but since spin is 1/2, they can be in different spins. Wait, but you can't have two particles in the same n level with the same spin. Wait, in the initial ground state, n1 has two particles with opposite spins. If you move one of them to n3, then n1 now has one particle (say, spin up), and the other particles are two in n2 (each spin) and one in n3 (spin down, for example). That is allowed. \n\nSo that configuration is valid. So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check other options. Option C says the first is 4E, but that can't be right because four particles need to be in higher states. Option A's first term is 30E, which is way too high. Option B starts with 4E, which would be if only two particles, so no. So D must be correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A through D, each with different combinations. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2), but here they've defined E as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). Wait, maybe I should check the relationship between the given E and the standard formula. Let me think. Oh right, the standard formula uses h instead of \u0127. Since h = 2\u03c0\u0127, substituting that in:\n\nStandard E_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2). Wait, that would mean that the standard formula is (n\u00b2)/(2) * E. Wait no, let me recalculate that. Let me see:\n\nThe standard energy levels are E_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2). Since h = 2\u03c0\u0127, substituting gives:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2)? Wait, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so that would be (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, no, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so the entire expression would be (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (4/8) \u2192 which is (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) * (1/2) \u2192 so that's (n\u00b2 / 2) * (\u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) \u2192 but the given E in the question is E = \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So the standard energy levels can be written as E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * E. Wait, no, because (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2))*(1/2) would be (n\u00b2/2) * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) but that's not matching. Let me see again:\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal formula:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 h\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2)\n\nBut h is Planck's constant, which is 2\u03c0\u0127. So substituting h = 2\u03c0\u0127 gives:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2 (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 ) / (8mL\u00b2) = (n\u00b2 * 4\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2) / (8mL\u00b2) = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2) / (2mL\u00b2) * (4/8) \u2192 the 4/8 reduces to 1/2, so E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)) \u2192 but the given E is exactly \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). So then E_n = (n\u00b2 / 2) * E. Wait, so that means each energy level is (n squared over 2) times E. Wait, but that seems off. Let me check with an example. For n=1, the standard energy would be (1)^2 * (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2))*(1/2) \u2192 but that would be (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(4mL\u00b2). But according to the given E, which is \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), then the standard E_1 would be (1/2) E. Wait, so maybe I got this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question's E is defined as the energy for n=1? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states: \"E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)\". Wait, that's exactly the standard formula for the first energy level when n=1. Because E_1 = (1)^2 h\u00b2/(8mL\u00b2). Wait, but substituting h = 2\u03c0\u0127, then E_1 = ( (2\u03c0\u0127)^2 )/(8mL\u00b2) ) = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(8mL\u00b2) = \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2) \u2192 which is exactly the given E. So, in the problem's terms, E is the energy of the first level (n=1). Therefore, the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. Because E_1 is E, E_2 would be (2)^2 E =4E, E_3=9E, etc. Wait, that makes sense. Because if E is defined as the ground state (n=1) energy, then each subsequent level is n squared times that. So the energy levels are E_n = n\u00b2 E. Okay, so that part is clear now.\n\nNow, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they're spin-1/2, they are fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each quantum state can hold at most two particles (since spin can be +1/2 or -1/2). So, we need to fill the energy levels with four particles, considering that each n level can have two particles (since each n has two spin states). \n\nThe ground state of the system would be when all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states, respecting the exclusion principle. Let's see:\n\nThe lowest energy states are filled first. The first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles (spin up and down). The next level (n=2) can also hold two particles, so for four particles, we need to fill both n=1 and n=2. Wait, that's four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, no, wait. Wait n=1 can hold two, n=2 holds two, so total four. So the ground state would have particles in n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). Wait but then the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Since E_1 is E (since E is defined as E_1), so E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E. So the total energy would be 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Wait, no. Each particle contributes its own energy. Since two particles are in n=1, each with energy E, so their total contribution is 2E. The two in n=2 each have 4E, so 2*4E =8E. Total is 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E?\n\nWait but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D has 10E as the first entry (ground state), but option C's first entry is 4E. Hmm, so perhaps I made an error here. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the total energy. Let me see.\n\nWait, the particles are identical fermions, so the ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with spin up/down), then the next two go into n=2 (also spin up/down). So the total energy is indeed 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E, which would correspond to option D or A or others. Wait, looking at the options: option D is 10E,15E,18E. Option A's first is 30E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each n level can have two particles (since spin can be up or down). So the ground state would have the first two particles in n=1 (each with spin up and down), then the next two in n=2 (each with spin up and down). So total energy is (1\u00b2 +1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2) * E? Wait, no, each particle's energy is n\u00b2 E, so for two particles in n=1, their total contribution is 2*(1\u00b2 E) = 2E. The two in n=2 contribute 2*(4E) =8E. So total is 10E, which matches the ground state as 10E. So the first entry in the options must be 10E. Looking at the options, D has 10E as the first entry. But let me check the other options. Option C's first entry is 4E, which would be if only two particles are placed, but since we have four, that can't be right. Option B's first is 4E, which is even less. So maybe D is a candidate. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy levels. Wait, maybe the energy levels are n squared times E, where E is the ground state (n=1). So yes, that's correct. So the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The first excited state would be when one of the particles is promoted to the next higher energy level. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nThe ground state has all four particles filled up to n=2. Wait, no, wait, n=1 has two, n=2 has two. The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement where the total energy is higher by the minimal amount. Let's think of how to arrange four particles with minimal energy but higher than the ground state. \n\nThe ground state is n1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n2\u2193. To get the first excited state, perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3? Because the next available higher energy state. Let me see. The total energy would then be 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 1*(2\u00b2 E) + 1*(3\u00b2 E). So that would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. Alternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3? Wait, but the minimal increase would be moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to n=3. So replacing one of the n=2 particles with n=3. So the energy would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) \u2192 2E + 4E +9E = 15E. So that would be the first excited state energy. Then the second excited state would be moving another particle to higher levels. \n\nAlternatively, another possibility for the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but keeping the other n=2 particle. So the first excited state would be 2E (from n=1) plus 4E (from one n=2) plus 9E (from one n=3) \u2192 total 15E. That's the first excited state. Then the next excited state would be either moving the second n=2 to n=3 as well, making both n=3 (so total energy 2E + 2*9E = 20E?), or moving one to n=3 and another to n=4, but perhaps the minimal step is moving another to n=3? Hmm, wait let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the first excited state could be when the two particles in n=2 are both moved up. But that would be a larger jump. Wait, the minimal energy increase would be moving just one particle. So the first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state could be moving the second n=2 particle to n=3, so total energy would be 2*(1) + 0*(2\u00b2) + 2*(3\u00b2) \u2192 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But that might not be the next state. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving one to n=3 and another to n=4? Let me see. Let's see the possible configurations.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another configuration for the first excited state. For example, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, and another to n=2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state could have one particle in n=3 and one remaining in n=2, but that's what I already considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from n=1 to a higher level, which would actually increase the total energy more. Because moving from n=1 to n=3 would add (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2) E = (9-1)E =8E, whereas moving from n=2 to n=3 adds (9-4)E =5E. So moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller energy increase, so that's better for the first excited state.\n\nSo first excited state is 15E. Then the next excited state would be either moving another n=2 particle to n=3 (so total energy 2E + 0*4E + 2*9E = 20E), or moving one to n=3 and one to n=4 (so 2E +1*4E +1*9E + 1*16E? Wait, but that would require more particles. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. To get the second excited state, we can either:\n\n1. Move another particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The total energy would be 2*(1)E + 2*(9)E = 2 + 18 = 20E.\n\n2. Alternatively, move one from n=2 to n=4. That would give two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E = 22E. But that's a higher energy than 20E, so the minimal next step would be the first option (20E).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=3? Wait, but that would require two particles in n=3, which is allowed since they can have opposite spins. So that would be the case where both n=2 particles are moved to n=3. So that gives the energy as 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different arrangement where the first excited state is moving one to n=3, and the second excited state is moving one to n=3 and another to n=4. Hmm, but that would have a higher energy than 20E, so 20E would be the second excited state. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 10E, 15E, 18E. The second excited state here would be 18E, which is less than 20E. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but then the second excited state is moving a particle to n=4 instead. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps the first excited state is 15E (as before), and the second excited state is when instead of moving both n=2 particles to n=3, we move one to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps there's another way to arrange the particles to get a lower energy than 20E. Let me think of possible configurations.\n\nAnother possibility: the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3 (total energy 15E). The next excited state could be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3 and another n=2 to n=3? No, but that's the same as moving both. Alternatively, maybe moving one n=2 to n=3 and another to n=4? That would give total energy 2E + (4E from one n=2?), no. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nWait in the first excited state, there are two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the next state would be the next possible configuration. Let's see:\n\nThe next possible configuration with minimal energy would be moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=3. So now, two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. That gives energy 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 20E. But in the options, 20E isn't listed. Option D's third is 18E. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? Wait, but moving from n=1 to higher would require more energy. For example, moving one from n=1 to n=3 would add (9 -1)E =8E, which would be worse than moving from n=2 to n=3 which gives 5E. So that's not minimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is not moving to n=3 but to n=2? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps there's another arrangement. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial configuration. Let me re-express the system step by step.\n\nGround state:\n\nAll four particles in the lowest possible states. Since each n level can hold two particles (spin up/down), the first two particles go to n=1 (each spin), then the next two go to n=2 (each spin). So the configuration is:\n\nn1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n2\u2193 \u2192 total energy: 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. That's the ground state. So that matches the first part of option D (10E).\n\nFirst excited state: the next possible configuration with minimal energy increase. To do this, we need to promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So now, the configuration is:\n\nn1\u2191, n1\u2193, n2\u2191, n3\u2191 (or any spin). Wait, but the particles are identical, so the exact spin doesn't matter for energy. The total energy would be 2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 2E +4E +9E = 15E. So that's 15E. Which matches the second entry in option D (15E). \n\nNow, the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. The minimal next step would be to promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. But there's only one particle left in n=2 (since we had two before, but now one is moved to n=3). Wait, no, in the first excited state, after moving one from n=2 to n=3, the n=2 has one particle left. So to promote another, we can move that last n=2 particle to n=3. Then the configuration becomes two in n=1, none in n=2, two in n=3. The total energy is 2*(1^2) + 2*(3^2) E \u2192 2E + 18E = 20E. But 20E isn't in any of the options except maybe option A's third term (50E), which is way higher. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, so 18E would be the third. Where does that come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited state is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3? No, that would be worse. Or maybe moving one particle to n=4 instead?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the second excited state isn't moving both n=2 particles to n=3 but instead moving one to n=3 and another to n=4?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter the first excited state (15E), the next possible configuration would be the next minimal energy. Let's see other possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility for the first excited state could be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in 15E. Then the next state could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. But that would give energy 2E + (remaining n=2 has 1 particle, so 4E) plus the one in n=3 (9E) and a new one in n=4 (16E). Wait, but that would require having a particle in n=4, so total energy:\n\n2E (from n=1) + (1 in n=2: 4E) + 1 in n=3 (9E) + 1 in n=4 (16E). But that's four particles. Wait, no, the total particles must still be four. Let me see:\n\nOriginal after first excited: 2 (n1) +1 (n2) +1 (n3) =4. To get the next state, perhaps move one from n=2 to n=4. So then n2 has 0, n4 has 1. Then total energy: 2E +0 +9E +16E = 27E. That's higher than 15E but higher than 20E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of moving the second n=2 to n=3 (which gives 20E), perhaps moving one to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's another arrangement where two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that would require having three particles above n=1. Wait, but the total particles are four. So 2 in n1, 1 in n2, 1 in n3 (total 4). That's the first excited. Then the next is moving the n2 to n3 (so two in n3, total 20E) or moving one to n=4 (total 27E). \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 20E. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E,10E,50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nHmm, so option D's third entry is 18E. How could that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the configuration. Perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is moved to n=3 and another to n=2? Wait, but that would require moving a particle from a lower level?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where one of the particles from n=1 is promoted to a higher level, but that would give a larger energy increase. For example, moving a n=1 particle to n=3. That would add (9-1)E =8E, leading to total energy 10E +8E=18E. Wait, let me see that.\n\nWait, let's think of another configuration. Suppose instead of moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (to get 15E), maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. That would give a higher energy. Let's see:\n\nOriginal ground state is 10E. If we move one from n=1 to n=3, then the configuration would have one in n=1 (spin up/down?), but since we have four particles, let me think: two particles in n=1, but one is moved. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIn ground state, n1 has two particles (each spin). To move one from n=1 to n=3, you would have one in n=1, one in n=3, and the other two still in n=2. Wait, but that would leave n=2 with two particles. Wait, no. Wait, the initial four are two in n1 and two in n2. To move one from n1 to n3:\n\nThe configuration would be:\n\nn1 has one particle (since one was moved), n2 has two, and n3 has one. So total particles:1+2+1=4. The energy would be (1^2 E)*1 + (2^2 E)*2 + (3^2 E)*1 \u2192 1E + 8E +9E = 18E. \n\nBut that's higher than 15E, so that would not be the first excited state but the second? Wait, but that would be a larger energy increase than moving a n2 to n3. So the first excited state would still be the 15E, and the second excited state could be either 18E (moving a n1 to n3) or 20E (moving the remaining n2 to n3). \n\nAh, so maybe the first excited is 15E, the second excited could be 18E (moving a n1 to n3) which is less than 20E. Because 18E is less than 20E, so that's a lower energy than moving both n2's to n3. So that would be the next possible state.\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nOption D's third is 18E. That would be the case if the second excited state is when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3. But is that allowed? Let's see:\n\nThe ground state has two particles in n=1. To move one to n=3, you need to leave one in n=1. So that would be possible, but why would that be the next excited state?\n\nBecause moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives an energy increase of (9-1)E =8E. Whereas moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives an increase of (9-4)E=5E. So the minimal next step after the first excited (15E) is to move another n2 to n3 (increase of 5E again?), but wait, after the first excited state, the remaining n2 has only one particle left. So moving that one would give the 20E. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would give an increase of 8E over the ground state, but the first excited state is already 15E (increase of 5E from ground). So the difference between ground (10E) and first excited (15E) is 5E. The difference between first excited (15E) and the 18E would be 3E, which is smaller than the 5E step. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the excited states in order of energy. The first excited is the lowest possible energy above ground. The second is the next higher, etc. \n\nSo after the ground state (10E), the next possible is 15E (first excited). The next would be the next lowest energy above 15E. So what's the next possible configuration?\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Move the remaining n=2 particle to n=3 \u2192 total energy 20E.\n\n2. Move one n=1 particle to n=3 \u2192 total energy (1E + 4E (n2) + 9E (n3) + 1E (the other n1?) Wait, no. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait if you move one n=1 to n=3, then:\n\nOriginal ground: 2 in n1, 2 in n2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nAfter moving one from n1 to n3:\n\nn1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Total energy:\n\n1*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 1E + 8E +9E =18E. \n\nYes, that's 18E. That's higher than 15E, but less than 20E. So that would be the second excited state. \n\nAh, so that's possible. So the first excited is 15E, the second is 18E, and the third would be 20E. But in the options, D has 10E,15E,18E. So that matches. The second excited state would be 18E. \n\nSo why is that configuration possible? Because moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives a higher energy than moving from n=2 to n=3, but once you've already done the first excited (moving a n2 to n3), the next minimal step is moving a n1 to n3. \n\nWait, but actually, the first excited state is moving a n2 to n3 (15E). The next possible configuration would be either moving the other n2 to n3 (giving 20E) or moving a n1 to n3 (giving 18E). Since 18E is lower than 20E, the second excited state would indeed be 18E. \n\nSo then the ground is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Which is exactly option D. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that configuration is allowed. The four particles would be arranged as follows for the second excited state (18E):\n\nAfter moving one from n1 to n3:\n\nn1 has 1 particle (either spin up or down?), but since spin is 1/2, they can be in different spins. Wait, but you can't have two particles in the same n level with the same spin. Wait, in the initial ground state, n1 has two particles with opposite spins. If you move one of them to n3, then n1 now has one particle (say, spin up), and the other particles are two in n2 (each spin) and one in n3 (spin down, for example). That is allowed. \n\nSo that configuration is valid. So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check other options. Option C says the first is 4E, but that can't be right because four particles need to be in higher states. Option A's first term is 30E, which is way too high. Option B starts with 4E, which would be if only two particles, so no. So D must be correct.\n\n\nThe energy levels of a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by \\( E_n = n^2 E \\), where \\( E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} \\). For four identical spin-1/2 fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle requires that each quantum state (defined by \\( n \\) and spin) holds at most two particles. \n\n**Ground State**: The lowest energy configuration fills the lowest available states. The first two particles occupy \\( n=1 \\), and the next two occupy \\( n=2 \\). Total energy is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 1^2 E + 2 \\times 2^2 E = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\\]\n\n**First Excited State**: Promote one particle from \\( n=2 \\) to \\( n=3 \\). The configuration becomes \\( n=1 \\) (2 particles), \\( n=2 \\) (1 particle), and \\( n=3 \\) (1 particle). Total energy:\n\\[\n2 \\times 1^2 E + 1 \\times 2^2 E + 1 \\times 3^2 E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\\]\n\n**Second Excited State**: Promote one particle from \\( n=1 \\) to \\( n=3 \\). The configuration becomes \\( n=1 \\) (1 particle), \\( n=2 \\) (2 particles), and \\( n=3 \\) (1 particle). Total energy:\n\\[\n1 \\times 1^2 E + 2 \\times 2^2 E + 1 \\times 3^2 E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\\]\n\nThe sequence matches option D. \n\nAnswer: D",
