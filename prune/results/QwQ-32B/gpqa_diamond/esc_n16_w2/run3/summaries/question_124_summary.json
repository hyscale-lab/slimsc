      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning they're moving at speeds very close to the speed of light. Their Lorentz factor is given as around 20 on average. Now, it says that one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor would be needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls instead. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's start breaking this down. First, I remember that the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is related to the particle's speed. The higher the Lorentz factor, the closer the particle's speed is to the speed of light. Since these particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are indeed near c. \n\nThe key here is probably about how long the particles live from the perspective of the lab frame. Because these particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime in the lab frame would determine how far they can travel before decaying. The further they can travel, the more likely they'll reach the detector walls. So, if we want more particles (two-thirds instead of one-third) to reach the walls, their Lorentz factor must be increased so that their lifetime in the lab frame is longer, allowing them to travel further.\n\nWait, but how exactly does the Lorentz factor relate to their lifetime? Oh right, the lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper time) is \u03c4\u2080. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime becomes \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080. So the longer the lab frame lifetime, the further the particle can travel before decaying. \n\nThe distance the particle can travel is then v * t, where v is its speed and t is the lab frame lifetime. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, v \u2248 c. So the distance would be approximately c * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). \n\nBut the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the particle needs to travel that distance before decaying. Let me formalize this a bit. Let me denote the proper lifetime as \u03c4\u2080. Then the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance traveled is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Since v \u2248 c, and \u03b3 is large (since ultra-relativistic), but maybe for precise calculation, we can use v = c / sqrt(1 + (1/\u03b3\u00b2)), but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, since \u03b3 is large (like 20), then v \u2248 c (since 1/\u03b3 is small). So approximating v as c might be okay here. Let me check that assumption later.\n\nSo, the distance the particle travels is approximately c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but that would mean that the distance is proportional to \u03b3? Wait, but if v is approaching c, then as \u03b3 increases, v approaches c but the time dilation increases. Hmm, maybe I need to be more precise here. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct formula for velocity in terms of \u03b3 is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Because \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so solving for v gives that expression. So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the lab frame is v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). So substituting:\n\ndistance = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ndistance = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2).\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me factor the sqrt term:\n\nsqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) = sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\ndistance = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 * (sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3) ) \n\nThe \u03b3 cancels out:\n\ndistance = c * \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1).\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) is approximately \u03b3 for large \u03b3. Since when \u03b3 is large, sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 (because the -1 is negligible). So then the distance would be approximately c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3. Wait, but that contradicts the previous step? Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me recast that. Let me try again:\n\ndistance = v * t = [c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2)] * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)\n\n= c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2 )\n\nYes. So sqrt(1 -1/\u03b3\u00b2) is sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) = sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3. So substituting:\n\ndistance = c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 * ( sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3 ) ) = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1).\n\nSo the distance is c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). Wait, but that's different from my first thought. Hmm, so the distance is proportional to sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1), which for large \u03b3 is approximately \u03b3. Because sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 (since \u03b3 is big, like 20). So the distance is roughly proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the distance traveled is proportional to \u03b3. Because sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 for large \u03b3. So the distance scales with \u03b3. So the distance is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nSo, the original problem states that with \u03b3 ~20, one third of the particles reach the detector (radius 30 meters). We need to find the \u03b3 such that two-thirds reach it, so the distance must be doubled? Or maybe not exactly doubled, but the fraction is doubled. Wait, but how exactly does the fraction relate to the distance?\n\nWait, the particles are moving in all directions, but the problem states \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\". Hmm, perhaps the particles are moving in a direction, but maybe the problem is assuming they move straight towards the detector walls? Wait, maybe the particles are created at the center, so they have to travel the radius of the detector (30 m) to hit the walls. So if their lifetime allows them to travel more than 30 meters, they reach the wall. \n\nSo the distance they can travel is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) (from above). Wait, but the exact expression is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think again. The proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. In the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The velocity is v = \u03b2 c, where \u03b2 is v/c. \n\nThe distance the particle travels is D = v * t = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nBut since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2), so \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nSo substituting \u03b2 into D:\n\nD = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWhich simplifies to D = c \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt( \u03b3\u00b2 (1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) ) )\n\n= c \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt( \u03b3\u00b2 - 1 )\n\nYes, same as before. So D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 - 1). \n\nTherefore, the distance is proportional to sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). \n\nSo, if the original \u03b3 is 20, then D_original = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(20\u00b2 -1) \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 *20 (since sqrt(400-1)=sqrt(399)\u224819.975, which is close to 20). \n\nWait, sqrt(20\u00b2 -1) is sqrt(399) \u224819.975, so approx 20. \n\nSo the original distance is ~c \u03c4\u2080 *20. \n\nThe detector is 30 meters in radius, so to reach the walls, the distance D must be at least 30 meters. \n\nSo, the fraction of particles that reach the detector would depend on how many have a D >= 30 m. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\" when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nSo, the average distance they travel is probably related. Wait, but perhaps the particles have a distribution of \u03b3? Or maybe all have the same \u03b3? The problem says \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\", so maybe their \u03b3 is around 20, but there is some spread. But the question is asking for a new \u03b3 that would make two-thirds reach the walls. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, so the distance they can travel is fixed. But then why would one third reach the walls? Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the particles are emitted in random directions. So even if they could travel a distance D, the probability that they reach the wall is proportional to the fraction of their possible paths that reach the wall before decaying. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particles are emitted isotropically from the center, so the chance that a particle reaches the wall would depend on whether the decay occurs before it reaches the wall. \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler: the particles are created at the center, and they move in a straight line. The probability that they reach the wall is the probability that their lifetime in the lab frame is sufficient for them to reach the wall. \n\nAssuming they move in a straight line radially outward, then the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. \n\nSo the condition is that their lifetime in the lab frame times their speed must be at least 30 meters. \n\nSo, D = v * t_lab >= 30 m. \n\nt_lab = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nv = \u03b2 c. \n\nSo D = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30. \n\nSo, rearranged, the condition is \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m. \n\nBut since \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2), so substituting that in:\n\nsqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m \n\nSo sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) * c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m \n\nSimplify sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3 * c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) >= 30 m \n\nSo same as before, D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) >= 30 m. \n\nSo, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its D is >= 30 m. \n\nWait, but the problem states that when \u03b3 is ~20, on average one third reach the walls. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the particles have a distribution of \u03b3, but the question wants us to adjust \u03b3 so that the fraction reaching the walls doubles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that all particles have the same \u03b3, so the distance they can travel is fixed. But then why would only a fraction reach the walls? Unless the direction is random. \n\nAh! Right, that's probably the key. If the particles are emitted in random directions, then even if they can travel a distance D, their path is a straight line in some direction. The probability that they reach the wall is the probability that their path length before decay is greater than or equal to the distance from the center to the wall in that direction. \n\nWait, but the detector is a sphere, so the maximum distance any particle has to travel is 30 meters (the radius). So if a particle is moving in a straight line, the distance from the center to the wall is 30 m. So, if the particle's D (the distance it can travel before decaying) is greater than or equal to 30 m, then it will hit the wall. \n\nWait, but if they are moving in random directions, then actually, the distance they can travel must be at least the distance from the center to the wall along their path. But since the detector is a sphere, any direction's path will have a maximum distance of 30 m (the radius). Wait, no, actually, if you're at the center and go in any direction, the straight path to the wall is exactly 30 m. So the required distance to reach the wall is exactly 30 m, regardless of direction. \n\nAh! So the direction doesn't matter here. Because all paths from the center to the wall are exactly 30 meters. So regardless of direction, the particle must travel 30 m. Therefore, the particle must have a D (distance traveled before decaying) of at least 30 m. \n\nTherefore, the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is the fraction of particles for which D >= 30 m. \n\nAssuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, then D is fixed. So either all particles reach the wall, or none. But the problem says that one third reach the walls when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the \u03b3 is not the same for all particles. Maybe the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 values, and the problem is asking to adjust the average \u03b3 so that a higher fraction have D >=30 m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles have a fixed \u03b3, but their lifetimes have some statistical variation. For instance, if the lifetime in the rest frame is a random variable, then the lab frame lifetime would depend on \u03b3 and that random variable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is oversimplified, and the idea is that the distance D is proportional to \u03b3, so to double the fraction, you need to double the distance? Wait, but the question says one third now, want two thirds. So maybe the distance needed is the same, but the number of particles that can reach it depends on the \u03b3. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the distance they can travel (D) is proportional to \u03b3. So when \u03b3 increases, D increases. \n\nGiven that when \u03b3 is 20, D is such that only 1/3 of them reach. To get 2/3, we need D to be larger so that more particles can reach. \n\nWait, but how exactly does the fraction relate to \u03b3?\n\nSuppose that for each particle, the required distance is 30 m. The distance they can travel is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 - 1). \n\nIf the particles have a fixed \u03c4\u2080, then D increases with \u03b3. \n\nWait, but maybe \u03c4\u2080 is the proper lifetime, which is fixed. \n\nSo, the condition is D >=30 m. \n\nSo D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) must be equal to 30 m for the threshold case. \n\nIf when \u03b3 is 20, then the average D is such that 1/3 of particles have D >=30. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the Lorentz factor is a variable, and the fraction that reach the detector is proportional to the ratio of D to 30 m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles' D is exactly proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, let me think of it as a proportionality. Let's suppose that when \u03b3 doubles, the distance D doubles. \n\nIn the original case, with \u03b3 =20, D is proportional to 20. So the required D is 30 m. The fraction that reach is 1/3, so perhaps the average D is 20*(some factor) which gives that only 1/3 of the particles have D \u226530. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the distance D is directly proportional to the Lorentz factor. So D = k*\u03b3. \n\nIf so, then when \u03b3=20, D=20k. The required D is 30 m, so the fraction of particles with D >=30 would depend on how many have \u03b3 >= (30/k). \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think of it another way. Let's suppose that for each particle, the distance it can travel is proportional to \u03b3. So if D \u221d \u03b3, then to get twice as many particles to reach the wall (i.e., double the fraction), perhaps you need to double the average \u03b3. But the question wants to go from 1/3 to 2/3, which is more than doubling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a simplified model where the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3, so D = v * t = (c) * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). Since at relativistic speeds, v\u2248c. Then D \u2248 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nIn this case, D is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nSo if when \u03b3=20, D = 20 * c \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe required D to reach the detector is 30 m. \n\nSuppose that the actual D must be at least 30 m. \n\nSo, the condition is D = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2265 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that meet this condition would depend on the distribution of \u03b3. \n\nAssuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, then either all or none would reach. But since the problem states that 1/3 reach when \u03b3 is ~20, perhaps the \u03b3 varies, and the question wants us to find the \u03b3 such that two-thirds of the particles have a \u03b3 that allows D \u226530. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is exactly such that their average D is 30 m when \u03b3 is 20, leading to 1/3 of them reaching. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance they can travel is D = \u03b3 * (something). Let me think of it as a proportionality. \n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of the given data. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average distance they can travel is D_avg = c * \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 *20. \n\nBut the required D to reach the wall is 30 m. So, if D_avg = 20 * (c \u03c4\u2080) equals 30 m, then the average would be exactly 30 m. But the problem says only 1/3 reach the wall. So perhaps the average is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a simplified model where D is proportional to \u03b3. So D = k * \u03b3. \n\nThen when \u03b3=20, D=20k. The required D is 30, so the fraction of particles with D >=30 would be the fraction with \u03b3 >=30/k. \n\nIf the particles have a distribution centered around \u03b3=20, then if 1/3 are above some threshold, perhaps the threshold is higher than 20. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is treating the distance as directly proportional to \u03b3, so the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to the ratio of the current \u03b3 to the required \u03b3. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the distance D is proportional to the Lorentz factor. \n\nSo, if initially, with \u03b31 =20, the average D1 allows 1/3 of the particles to reach. To get 2/3, we need to increase D such that the fraction is doubled. Since the fraction is proportional to D, perhaps D needs to be doubled? \n\nWait, but 1/3 to 2/3 is not doubling. The fraction increases by a factor of 2 (since 2/3 is twice 1/3). So if the fraction is proportional to D, then D needs to be doubled. \n\nIf D is proportional to \u03b3, then to double D, we need to double \u03b3. So \u03b3 would be 40. That would give option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is proportional to (D / R), where R is the detector radius. So if the original D was 20 units (arbitrary) and R is 30, then the fraction is (20/30) = 2/3? But the problem states that when \u03b3=20, the fraction is 1/3, so that can't be. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's suppose that the distance D must be equal to 30 m to reach the wall. \n\nThe probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its D is \u226530 m. \n\nAssuming that D is proportional to \u03b3 (because D \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 when \u03b3 is large), then the threshold \u03b3 needed to have D=30 is \u03b3_threshold = 30/(c \u03c4\u2080). \n\nThe particles that have \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3_threshold will reach the wall. \n\nIf the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 centered around some value, say, initially around 20. Suppose that the distribution is such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction above \u03b3_threshold is 1/3. To get a fraction of 2/3, the average \u03b3 must be such that the threshold is lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the average D is 30*(1/3) =10 meters? Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance they can travel is exactly 30*(1/3)=10 meters when \u03b3=20. To get 2/3, the distance needs to be 20 meters? No, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation that the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3. So, the lifetime t = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance D is v*t. \n\nAt relativistic speeds, v \u2248 c, so D \u2248 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector radius is 30 m, so D must be at least 30 m. \n\nSo D = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 30 m. \n\nSolving for \u03b3 gives \u03b3 = 30/(c \u03c4\u2080). \n\nBut if when \u03b3 is 20, the average D is 20*c \u03c4\u2080, and the fraction that have D \u226530 is 1/3. So perhaps the average D is 20*c \u03c4\u2080, so 20*c \u03c4\u2080 must be less than 30 m, but the question says that with \u03b3 ~20, 1/3 reach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the particles have a fixed proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080, and the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSuppose that the required distance is 30 m. \n\nThe condition is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >=30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that satisfy this is the fraction with \u03b3 >= 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 centered around some value. \n\nIf when the center is 20, the fraction above the required \u03b3 is 1/3. To get the fraction to be 2/3, the center must be higher so that the threshold \u03b3 is lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the threshold \u03b3 needed is 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). Let's suppose that the original \u03b3=20 is exactly the threshold, so 20 = 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). Then, when \u03b3=20, the fraction above would be 50%, but the problem says 1/3. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance is proportional to \u03b3, so to triple the fraction (from 1/3 to 1), you need to triple \u03b3. But that's not the question. The question wants to go from 1/3 to 2/3, so perhaps increasing \u03b3 by a factor of sqrt(2), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's think numerically. \n\nSuppose that the distance D is proportional to \u03b3. So D = k * \u03b3. \n\nAt \u03b31=20, D1 = 20k. The required D is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach is the fraction with D >=30, which is the fraction with \u03b3 >= 30/k. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average is 20, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of particles have \u03b3 >= (30/k). \n\nTo get two-thirds, you need the threshold 30/k to be lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the required \u03b3 to reach the detector is 30/k. To have two-thirds of particles above that threshold, the average \u03b3 must be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a straightforward proportion. Since one third reach with \u03b3=20, to get two-thirds, the Lorentz factor must be doubled? But that would be 40, option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is proportional to the Lorentz factor. So, if the fraction is 1/3 when \u03b3 is 20, then to get 2/3, the distance must be double. So \u03b3 must be 40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relation that the lifetime is proportional to \u03b3, so the distance is proportional to \u03b3 (since v is near c). \n\nSo D = v * t \u2248 c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector requires D >=30 m. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average D is 20 c \u03c4\u2080. The fraction of particles with D >=30 is 1/3. \n\nSo, 20 c \u03c4\u2080 must be less than 30, and the threshold is at 30. \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution where their \u03b3 is such that the average is 20, but the distribution is spread out. The number above 30/(c \u03c4\u2080) is 1/3. \n\nTo get twice the fraction (2/3), the threshold \u03b3 needed would be lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where since the distance is proportional to \u03b3, to get twice the number, you need to double the \u03b3. But 1/3 to 2/3 is not double. Wait, the number that reach is proportional to the ratio of the current \u03b3 to the required \u03b3? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, if D is proportional to \u03b3, then the threshold \u03b3 required to reach 30 m is \u03b3_threshold = (30 m)/(k), where k is the proportionality constant. \n\nThe fraction of particles with \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3_threshold would depend on the distribution. \n\nSuppose the particles are emitted with a distribution of \u03b3 such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction above \u03b3_threshold is 1/3. To get a fraction of 2/3, the average \u03b3 must be such that the threshold is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the average D must be such that the average D is now 2/3 * 30 m? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to realize that the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3, so the distance is proportional to \u03b3 (since v is nearly c). \n\nSo, if the original \u03b3 is 20, and the required distance is 30 m, then the fraction reaching is the fraction where \u03b3 >= (30 / (c \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nSuppose that 20 is the average, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of the particles are above the threshold. To make the fraction 2/3, the threshold must be lowered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the Lorentz factor. \n\nWait, the problem says \"one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\" when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nIf the distance is proportional to \u03b3, then the fraction that can reach the detector (distance >=30) is proportional to (\u03b3 / \u03b30), where \u03b30 is the threshold. \n\nWait, perhaps it's linear. For example, if at \u03b3=20, the average distance is 20 units (each unit being c \u03c4\u2080), and the required is 30 units, then only those with \u03b3 \u226530 can reach. So if the average is 20, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of the particles have \u03b3 \u226530, then to get two-thirds, we need the average to be higher so that the threshold is at lower \u03b3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a problem about the average. Suppose that the average distance when \u03b3=20 is 20 units (assuming D = \u03b3 * something). The required distance is 30. The fraction that can reach is (average distance / required distance) ? No, but 20/30 is 2/3, but the problem says 1/3. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe key formula here is that the distance traveled is D = c * \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 (approximating v as c for ultra-relativistic speeds). \n\nThe required D is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the fraction for which D >= 30 m. \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction with \u03b3 >= (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) is 1/3. \n\nTo get two-thirds, the threshold \u03b3 needed must be lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nBut how much lower? \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the threshold \u03b3 needed is 30/(c \u03c4\u2080), then if when \u03b3_avg =20, the fraction above threshold is 1/3, then to get 2/3, the threshold must be at \u03b3 = (2/3)* (original threshold)? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple proportionality. Let's think that the distance is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nAt \u03b3 =20, the average distance is D1 = k*20. \n\nThe required distance is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction that reach is 1/3, so perhaps D1 = (1/3)*30 =10 m? That would mean k*20 =10 \u2192 k=0.5. \n\nThen, to get two-thirds, the average distance needs to be D2 = (2/3)*30 =20 m. \n\nSo D2 =k*\u03b3_new =0.5*\u03b3_new =20 \u2192 \u03b3_new =40. \n\nSo that would give option C. \n\nAh, this seems plausible. \n\nWait, let's see. If the fraction of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the average distance divided by the required distance. \n\nLike, fraction = (average D) / (required D). \n\nSo when average D is 10 m (from \u03b3=20), fraction is 10/30 = 1/3. \n\nTo get 2/3, average D must be 20 m, so \u03b3_new is 40. \n\nThat would make sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be C) 40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction is exactly equal to (average D)/(required D). \n\nIf that's the case, then when average D is 20 *k, required D is 30, then (20k)/30 =1/3 \u2192 k=0.5. \n\nThen to get (\u03b3 *k)/30 = 2/3 \u2192 \u03b3*0.5 =20 \u2192 \u03b3=40. \n\nYes, so that would be the case. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)40.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is proportional to its Lorentz factor (\u03b3) because the lab frame lifetime (\u03b3\u03c4\u2080) and velocity (\u2248c for ultra-relativistic particles) combine to give D \u2248 c\u03b3\u03c4\u2080. When \u03b3 = 20, the average distance traveled is D\u2081 = 20c\u03c4\u2080, and 1/3 of particles reach 30 meters (the detector radius). This implies 20c\u03c4\u2080 = (1/3)(30 m), so c\u03c4\u2080 = 0.5 m. To have two-thirds of particles reach the detector, the average distance must be D\u2082 = (2/3)(30 m) = 20 m. Setting D\u2082 = \u03b3_new * c\u03c4\u2080 = \u03b3_new * 0.5 m = 20 m gives \u03b3_new = 40.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning they're moving at speeds very close to the speed of light. Their Lorentz factor is given as around 20 on average. Now, it says that one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor would be needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls instead. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's start breaking this down. First, I remember that the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is related to the particle's speed. The higher the Lorentz factor, the closer the particle's speed is to the speed of light. Since these particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are indeed near c. \n\nThe key here is probably about how long the particles live from the perspective of the lab frame. Because these particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime in the lab frame would determine how far they can travel before decaying. The further they can travel, the more likely they'll reach the detector walls. So, if we want more particles (two-thirds instead of one-third) to reach the walls, their Lorentz factor must be increased so that their lifetime in the lab frame is longer, allowing them to travel further.\n\nWait, but how exactly does the Lorentz factor relate to their lifetime? Oh right, the lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper time) is \u03c4\u2080. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime becomes \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080. So the longer the lab frame lifetime, the further the particle can travel before decaying. \n\nThe distance the particle can travel is then v * t, where v is its speed and t is the lab frame lifetime. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, v \u2248 c. So the distance would be approximately c * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). \n\nBut the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the particle needs to travel that distance before decaying. Let me formalize this a bit. Let me denote the proper lifetime as \u03c4\u2080. Then the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance traveled is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Since v \u2248 c, and \u03b3 is large (since ultra-relativistic), but maybe for precise calculation, we can use v = c / sqrt(1 + (1/\u03b3\u00b2)), but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, since \u03b3 is large (like 20), then v \u2248 c (since 1/\u03b3 is small). So approximating v as c might be okay here. Let me check that assumption later.\n\nSo, the distance the particle travels is approximately c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but that would mean that the distance is proportional to \u03b3? Wait, but if v is approaching c, then as \u03b3 increases, v approaches c but the time dilation increases. Hmm, maybe I need to be more precise here. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct formula for velocity in terms of \u03b3 is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Because \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so solving for v gives that expression. So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the lab frame is v * t, where t is the lab frame lifetime (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). So substituting:\n\ndistance = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nSimplify that:\n\ndistance = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2).\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me factor the sqrt term:\n\nsqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) = sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\ndistance = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 * (sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3) ) \n\nThe \u03b3 cancels out:\n\ndistance = c * \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1).\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) is approximately \u03b3 for large \u03b3. Since when \u03b3 is large, sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 (because the -1 is negligible). So then the distance would be approximately c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3. Wait, but that contradicts the previous step? Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me recast that. Let me try again:\n\ndistance = v * t = [c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2)] * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)\n\n= c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2 )\n\nYes. So sqrt(1 -1/\u03b3\u00b2) is sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) = sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3. So substituting:\n\ndistance = c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 * ( sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3 ) ) = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1).\n\nSo the distance is c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). Wait, but that's different from my first thought. Hmm, so the distance is proportional to sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1), which for large \u03b3 is approximately \u03b3. Because sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 (since \u03b3 is big, like 20). So the distance is roughly proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the distance traveled is proportional to \u03b3. Because sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 \u03b3 for large \u03b3. So the distance scales with \u03b3. So the distance is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nSo, the original problem states that with \u03b3 ~20, one third of the particles reach the detector (radius 30 meters). We need to find the \u03b3 such that two-thirds reach it, so the distance must be doubled? Or maybe not exactly doubled, but the fraction is doubled. Wait, but how exactly does the fraction relate to the distance?\n\nWait, the particles are moving in all directions, but the problem states \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\". Hmm, perhaps the particles are moving in a direction, but maybe the problem is assuming they move straight towards the detector walls? Wait, maybe the particles are created at the center, so they have to travel the radius of the detector (30 m) to hit the walls. So if their lifetime allows them to travel more than 30 meters, they reach the wall. \n\nSo the distance they can travel is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) (from above). Wait, but the exact expression is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think again. The proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. In the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The velocity is v = \u03b2 c, where \u03b2 is v/c. \n\nThe distance the particle travels is D = v * t = \u03b2 c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nBut since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2), so \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nSo substituting \u03b2 into D:\n\nD = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWhich simplifies to D = c \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt( \u03b3\u00b2 (1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) ) )\n\n= c \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt( \u03b3\u00b2 - 1 )\n\nYes, same as before. So D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 - 1). \n\nTherefore, the distance is proportional to sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1). \n\nSo, if the original \u03b3 is 20, then D_original = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(20\u00b2 -1) \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 *20 (since sqrt(400-1)=sqrt(399)\u224819.975, which is close to 20). \n\nWait, sqrt(20\u00b2 -1) is sqrt(399) \u224819.975, so approx 20. \n\nSo the original distance is ~c \u03c4\u2080 *20. \n\nThe detector is 30 meters in radius, so to reach the walls, the distance D must be at least 30 meters. \n\nSo, the fraction of particles that reach the detector would depend on how many have a D >= 30 m. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\" when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nSo, the average distance they travel is probably related. Wait, but perhaps the particles have a distribution of \u03b3? Or maybe all have the same \u03b3? The problem says \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\", so maybe their \u03b3 is around 20, but there is some spread. But the question is asking for a new \u03b3 that would make two-thirds reach the walls. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, so the distance they can travel is fixed. But then why would one third reach the walls? Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the particles are emitted in random directions. So even if they could travel a distance D, the probability that they reach the wall is proportional to the fraction of their possible paths that reach the wall before decaying. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particles are emitted isotropically from the center, so the chance that a particle reaches the wall would depend on whether the decay occurs before it reaches the wall. \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler: the particles are created at the center, and they move in a straight line. The probability that they reach the wall is the probability that their lifetime in the lab frame is sufficient for them to reach the wall. \n\nAssuming they move in a straight line radially outward, then the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. \n\nSo the condition is that their lifetime in the lab frame times their speed must be at least 30 meters. \n\nSo, D = v * t_lab >= 30 m. \n\nt_lab = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nv = \u03b2 c. \n\nSo D = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30. \n\nSo, rearranged, the condition is \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m. \n\nBut since \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2), so substituting that in:\n\nsqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) * c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m \n\nSo sqrt( (\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3\u00b2 ) * c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >= 30 m \n\nSimplify sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1)/\u03b3 * c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) >= 30 m \n\nSo same as before, D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) >= 30 m. \n\nSo, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its D is >= 30 m. \n\nWait, but the problem states that when \u03b3 is ~20, on average one third reach the walls. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the particles have a distribution of \u03b3, but the question wants us to adjust \u03b3 so that the fraction reaching the walls doubles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that all particles have the same \u03b3, so the distance they can travel is fixed. But then why would only a fraction reach the walls? Unless the direction is random. \n\nAh! Right, that's probably the key. If the particles are emitted in random directions, then even if they can travel a distance D, their path is a straight line in some direction. The probability that they reach the wall is the probability that their path length before decay is greater than or equal to the distance from the center to the wall in that direction. \n\nWait, but the detector is a sphere, so the maximum distance any particle has to travel is 30 meters (the radius). So if a particle is moving in a straight line, the distance from the center to the wall is 30 m. So, if the particle's D (the distance it can travel before decaying) is greater than or equal to 30 m, then it will hit the wall. \n\nWait, but if they are moving in random directions, then actually, the distance they can travel must be at least the distance from the center to the wall along their path. But since the detector is a sphere, any direction's path will have a maximum distance of 30 m (the radius). Wait, no, actually, if you're at the center and go in any direction, the straight path to the wall is exactly 30 m. So the required distance to reach the wall is exactly 30 m, regardless of direction. \n\nAh! So the direction doesn't matter here. Because all paths from the center to the wall are exactly 30 meters. So regardless of direction, the particle must travel 30 m. Therefore, the particle must have a D (distance traveled before decaying) of at least 30 m. \n\nTherefore, the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is the fraction of particles for which D >= 30 m. \n\nAssuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, then D is fixed. So either all particles reach the wall, or none. But the problem says that one third reach the walls when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the \u03b3 is not the same for all particles. Maybe the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 values, and the problem is asking to adjust the average \u03b3 so that a higher fraction have D >=30 m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles have a fixed \u03b3, but their lifetimes have some statistical variation. For instance, if the lifetime in the rest frame is a random variable, then the lab frame lifetime would depend on \u03b3 and that random variable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is oversimplified, and the idea is that the distance D is proportional to \u03b3, so to double the fraction, you need to double the distance? Wait, but the question says one third now, want two thirds. So maybe the distance needed is the same, but the number of particles that can reach it depends on the \u03b3. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the distance they can travel (D) is proportional to \u03b3. So when \u03b3 increases, D increases. \n\nGiven that when \u03b3 is 20, D is such that only 1/3 of them reach. To get 2/3, we need D to be larger so that more particles can reach. \n\nWait, but how exactly does the fraction relate to \u03b3?\n\nSuppose that for each particle, the required distance is 30 m. The distance they can travel is D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 - 1). \n\nIf the particles have a fixed \u03c4\u2080, then D increases with \u03b3. \n\nWait, but maybe \u03c4\u2080 is the proper lifetime, which is fixed. \n\nSo, the condition is D >=30 m. \n\nSo D = c \u03c4\u2080 sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) must be equal to 30 m for the threshold case. \n\nIf when \u03b3 is 20, then the average D is such that 1/3 of particles have D >=30. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the Lorentz factor is a variable, and the fraction that reach the detector is proportional to the ratio of D to 30 m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles' D is exactly proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, let me think of it as a proportionality. Let's suppose that when \u03b3 doubles, the distance D doubles. \n\nIn the original case, with \u03b3 =20, D is proportional to 20. So the required D is 30 m. The fraction that reach is 1/3, so perhaps the average D is 20*(some factor) which gives that only 1/3 of the particles have D \u226530. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the distance D is directly proportional to the Lorentz factor. So D = k*\u03b3. \n\nIf so, then when \u03b3=20, D=20k. The required D is 30 m, so the fraction of particles with D >=30 would depend on how many have \u03b3 >= (30/k). \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think of it another way. Let's suppose that for each particle, the distance it can travel is proportional to \u03b3. So if D \u221d \u03b3, then to get twice as many particles to reach the wall (i.e., double the fraction), perhaps you need to double the average \u03b3. But the question wants to go from 1/3 to 2/3, which is more than doubling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a simplified model where the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3, so D = v * t = (c) * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). Since at relativistic speeds, v\u2248c. Then D \u2248 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nIn this case, D is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nSo if when \u03b3=20, D = 20 * c \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe required D to reach the detector is 30 m. \n\nSuppose that the actual D must be at least 30 m. \n\nSo, the condition is D = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2265 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that meet this condition would depend on the distribution of \u03b3. \n\nAssuming that all particles have the same \u03b3, then either all or none would reach. But since the problem states that 1/3 reach when \u03b3 is ~20, perhaps the \u03b3 varies, and the question wants us to find the \u03b3 such that two-thirds of the particles have a \u03b3 that allows D \u226530. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is exactly such that their average D is 30 m when \u03b3 is 20, leading to 1/3 of them reaching. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance they can travel is D = \u03b3 * (something). Let me think of it as a proportionality. \n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of the given data. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average distance they can travel is D_avg = c * \u03c4\u2080 * sqrt(\u03b3\u00b2 -1) \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 *20. \n\nBut the required D to reach the wall is 30 m. So, if D_avg = 20 * (c \u03c4\u2080) equals 30 m, then the average would be exactly 30 m. But the problem says only 1/3 reach the wall. So perhaps the average is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a simplified model where D is proportional to \u03b3. So D = k * \u03b3. \n\nThen when \u03b3=20, D=20k. The required D is 30, so the fraction of particles with D >=30 would be the fraction with \u03b3 >=30/k. \n\nIf the particles have a distribution centered around \u03b3=20, then if 1/3 are above some threshold, perhaps the threshold is higher than 20. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is treating the distance as directly proportional to \u03b3, so the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to the ratio of the current \u03b3 to the required \u03b3. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the distance D is proportional to the Lorentz factor. \n\nSo, if initially, with \u03b31 =20, the average D1 allows 1/3 of the particles to reach. To get 2/3, we need to increase D such that the fraction is doubled. Since the fraction is proportional to D, perhaps D needs to be doubled? \n\nWait, but 1/3 to 2/3 is not doubling. The fraction increases by a factor of 2 (since 2/3 is twice 1/3). So if the fraction is proportional to D, then D needs to be doubled. \n\nIf D is proportional to \u03b3, then to double D, we need to double \u03b3. So \u03b3 would be 40. That would give option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is proportional to (D / R), where R is the detector radius. So if the original D was 20 units (arbitrary) and R is 30, then the fraction is (20/30) = 2/3? But the problem states that when \u03b3=20, the fraction is 1/3, so that can't be. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Let's suppose that the distance D must be equal to 30 m to reach the wall. \n\nThe probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its D is \u226530 m. \n\nAssuming that D is proportional to \u03b3 (because D \u2248 c \u03c4\u2080 \u03b3 when \u03b3 is large), then the threshold \u03b3 needed to have D=30 is \u03b3_threshold = 30/(c \u03c4\u2080). \n\nThe particles that have \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3_threshold will reach the wall. \n\nIf the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 centered around some value, say, initially around 20. Suppose that the distribution is such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction above \u03b3_threshold is 1/3. To get a fraction of 2/3, the average \u03b3 must be such that the threshold is lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the average D is 30*(1/3) =10 meters? Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance they can travel is exactly 30*(1/3)=10 meters when \u03b3=20. To get 2/3, the distance needs to be 20 meters? No, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation that the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3. So, the lifetime t = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance D is v*t. \n\nAt relativistic speeds, v \u2248 c, so D \u2248 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector radius is 30 m, so D must be at least 30 m. \n\nSo D = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 30 m. \n\nSolving for \u03b3 gives \u03b3 = 30/(c \u03c4\u2080). \n\nBut if when \u03b3 is 20, the average D is 20*c \u03c4\u2080, and the fraction that have D \u226530 is 1/3. So perhaps the average D is 20*c \u03c4\u2080, so 20*c \u03c4\u2080 must be less than 30 m, but the question says that with \u03b3 ~20, 1/3 reach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the particles have a fixed proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080, and the lab frame lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSuppose that the required distance is 30 m. \n\nThe condition is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 >=30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that satisfy this is the fraction with \u03b3 >= 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 centered around some value. \n\nIf when the center is 20, the fraction above the required \u03b3 is 1/3. To get the fraction to be 2/3, the center must be higher so that the threshold \u03b3 is lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the threshold \u03b3 needed is 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). Let's suppose that the original \u03b3=20 is exactly the threshold, so 20 = 30/(v \u03c4\u2080). Then, when \u03b3=20, the fraction above would be 50%, but the problem says 1/3. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance is proportional to \u03b3, so to triple the fraction (from 1/3 to 1), you need to triple \u03b3. But that's not the question. The question wants to go from 1/3 to 2/3, so perhaps increasing \u03b3 by a factor of sqrt(2), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's think numerically. \n\nSuppose that the distance D is proportional to \u03b3. So D = k * \u03b3. \n\nAt \u03b31=20, D1 = 20k. The required D is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach is the fraction with D >=30, which is the fraction with \u03b3 >= 30/k. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average is 20, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of particles have \u03b3 >= (30/k). \n\nTo get two-thirds, you need the threshold 30/k to be lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the required \u03b3 to reach the detector is 30/k. To have two-thirds of particles above that threshold, the average \u03b3 must be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a straightforward proportion. Since one third reach with \u03b3=20, to get two-thirds, the Lorentz factor must be doubled? But that would be 40, option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is proportional to the Lorentz factor. So, if the fraction is 1/3 when \u03b3 is 20, then to get 2/3, the distance must be double. So \u03b3 must be 40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relation that the lifetime is proportional to \u03b3, so the distance is proportional to \u03b3 (since v is near c). \n\nSo D = v * t \u2248 c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector requires D >=30 m. \n\nSuppose that when \u03b3 is 20, the average D is 20 c \u03c4\u2080. The fraction of particles with D >=30 is 1/3. \n\nSo, 20 c \u03c4\u2080 must be less than 30, and the threshold is at 30. \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution where their \u03b3 is such that the average is 20, but the distribution is spread out. The number above 30/(c \u03c4\u2080) is 1/3. \n\nTo get twice the fraction (2/3), the threshold \u03b3 needed would be lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where since the distance is proportional to \u03b3, to get twice the number, you need to double the \u03b3. But 1/3 to 2/3 is not double. Wait, the number that reach is proportional to the ratio of the current \u03b3 to the required \u03b3? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nWait, if D is proportional to \u03b3, then the threshold \u03b3 required to reach 30 m is \u03b3_threshold = (30 m)/(k), where k is the proportionality constant. \n\nThe fraction of particles with \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3_threshold would depend on the distribution. \n\nSuppose the particles are emitted with a distribution of \u03b3 such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction above \u03b3_threshold is 1/3. To get a fraction of 2/3, the average \u03b3 must be such that the threshold is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the average D must be such that the average D is now 2/3 * 30 m? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to realize that the lifetime in the lab frame is proportional to \u03b3, so the distance is proportional to \u03b3 (since v is nearly c). \n\nSo, if the original \u03b3 is 20, and the required distance is 30 m, then the fraction reaching is the fraction where \u03b3 >= (30 / (c \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nSuppose that 20 is the average, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of the particles are above the threshold. To make the fraction 2/3, the threshold must be lowered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the Lorentz factor. \n\nWait, the problem says \"one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\" when \u03b3 is ~20. \n\nIf the distance is proportional to \u03b3, then the fraction that can reach the detector (distance >=30) is proportional to (\u03b3 / \u03b30), where \u03b30 is the threshold. \n\nWait, perhaps it's linear. For example, if at \u03b3=20, the average distance is 20 units (each unit being c \u03c4\u2080), and the required is 30 units, then only those with \u03b3 \u226530 can reach. So if the average is 20, and the distribution is such that 1/3 of the particles have \u03b3 \u226530, then to get two-thirds, we need the average to be higher so that the threshold is at lower \u03b3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a problem about the average. Suppose that the average distance when \u03b3=20 is 20 units (assuming D = \u03b3 * something). The required distance is 30. The fraction that can reach is (average distance / required distance) ? No, but 20/30 is 2/3, but the problem says 1/3. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe key formula here is that the distance traveled is D = c * \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 (approximating v as c for ultra-relativistic speeds). \n\nThe required D is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the fraction for which D >= 30 m. \n\nSuppose that the particles have a distribution of \u03b3 such that when the average \u03b3 is 20, the fraction with \u03b3 >= (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) is 1/3. \n\nTo get two-thirds, the threshold \u03b3 needed must be lower, so that more particles are above it. \n\nBut how much lower? \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the threshold \u03b3 needed is 30/(c \u03c4\u2080), then if when \u03b3_avg =20, the fraction above threshold is 1/3, then to get 2/3, the threshold must be at \u03b3 = (2/3)* (original threshold)? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple proportionality. Let's think that the distance is proportional to \u03b3. \n\nAt \u03b3 =20, the average distance is D1 = k*20. \n\nThe required distance is 30 m. \n\nThe fraction that reach is 1/3, so perhaps D1 = (1/3)*30 =10 m? That would mean k*20 =10 \u2192 k=0.5. \n\nThen, to get two-thirds, the average distance needs to be D2 = (2/3)*30 =20 m. \n\nSo D2 =k*\u03b3_new =0.5*\u03b3_new =20 \u2192 \u03b3_new =40. \n\nSo that would give option C. \n\nAh, this seems plausible. \n\nWait, let's see. If the fraction of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the average distance divided by the required distance. \n\nLike, fraction = (average D) / (required D). \n\nSo when average D is 10 m (from \u03b3=20), fraction is 10/30 = 1/3. \n\nTo get 2/3, average D must be 20 m, so \u03b3_new is 40. \n\nThat would make sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be C) 40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction is exactly equal to (average D)/(required D). \n\nIf that's the case, then when average D is 20 *k, required D is 30, then (20k)/30 =1/3 \u2192 k=0.5. \n\nThen to get (\u03b3 *k)/30 = 2/3 \u2192 \u03b3*0.5 =20 \u2192 \u03b3=40. \n\nYes, so that would be the case. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)40.\n\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is proportional to its Lorentz factor (\u03b3) because the lab frame lifetime (\u03b3\u03c4\u2080) and velocity (\u2248c for ultra-relativistic particles) combine to give D \u2248 c\u03b3\u03c4\u2080. When \u03b3 = 20, the average distance traveled is D\u2081 = 20c\u03c4\u2080, and 1/3 of particles reach 30 meters (the detector radius). This implies 20c\u03c4\u2080 = (1/3)(30 m), so c\u03c4\u2080 = 0.5 m. To have two-thirds of particles reach the detector, the average distance must be D\u2082 = (2/3)(30 m) = 20 m. Setting D\u2082 = \u03b3_new * c\u03c4\u2080 = \u03b3_new * 0.5 m = 20 m gives \u03b3_new = 40.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls instead of one-third as before. The given Lorentz factor is about 20, and the detector has a radius of 30 meters. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is. The Lorentz factor is given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the velocity of the particle and c is the speed of light. Ultra-relativistic particles mean they're moving at speeds very close to c, so their Lorentz factors are large. \n\nThe key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the lifetime of the particles. Since these particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime in the lab frame (detector's frame) would be dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (\u03c4) is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. The dilated lifetime (t) is \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to travel a distance of 30 meters to reach the detector walls. The distance they can travel before decaying is determined by their speed multiplied by their dilated lifetime. So, the maximum distance they can go is v * t = v * \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nBut wait, since they are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately c. So the distance becomes c * \u03b3 * \u03c4. But the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the particles must travel that distance before decaying. \n\nOriginally, with \u03b3 = 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. The question is, what \u03b3 would make two-thirds reach the walls? \n\nHmm, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio between the distance they need to travel (30 meters) and the distance they can travel on average before decaying. \n\nWait, maybe the particles have a fixed proper lifetime. Let's denote the proper lifetime as \u03c4. The dilated lifetime is t = \u03b3 * \u03c4. The distance they can travel in the lab frame is v * t. Since they are ultra-relativistic, v \u2248 c, so distance \u2248 c * \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to cover the radius of the detector, 30 meters, so the condition for a particle to reach the detector is that c * \u03b3 * \u03c4 \u2265 30 meters. \n\nBut particles are moving in all directions? Or are they all moving along the same direction? The problem says \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\", but maybe they're emitted in all directions. Wait, the problem says \"ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\". Maybe their velocities are all about the same, but direction might vary. However, the problem states that on average, one third reach the walls. \n\nHmm, perhaps the particles are moving outward in all directions, but only those that move in a direction towards the detector walls will reach them before decaying. Wait, but if they are produced at the center, then the distance to the wall is always 30 meters, regardless of direction. Wait, that's true. If the detector is a sphere, then every direction from the center is 30 meters to the wall. So the distance each particle needs to travel is exactly 30 meters, but the time they have before decaying is their lifetime in the lab frame, which is \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the particle's speed is v \u2248 c. The time taken to reach the wall would be t_required = distance / speed = 30 m / c. \n\nIf the dilated lifetime (t) is longer than this required time, then the particle will reach the detector. The probability of it decaying before that time is the probability that the lifetime (which is a random variable with an exponential distribution) is less than t_required. \n\nThe proper lifetime \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. The decay follows an exponential distribution: the probability that the particle has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-t/\u03c4). \n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is \u03b3 * \u03c4. The time to reach the detector is t_required = 30 / c. \n\nTherefore, the probability that a particle does NOT decay before reaching the detector is e^(- t_required / (\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nWait, the probability that the particle survives until time t_required is e^(- t_required / (mean lifetime in lab frame)). The mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the survival probability is e^(- (30/c) / (\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nWait, let me check that again. The decay probability is: \n\nThe probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - e^{-t/(\u03b3\u03c4)}. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it survives until time t_required is e^{-t_required/(\u03b3\u03c4)}. \n\nWe want this survival probability to be the fraction of particles that reach the detector. \n\nInitially, with \u03b3 = 20, the survival probability is e^{- (30/c) / (20 \u03c4)}. And this equals 1/3 (since one third reach the walls). \n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that e^{- (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 2/3. \n\nSo set up the equations: \n\nLet me denote t_required = 30/c. \n\nOriginal scenario: \n\ne^{- t_required/(20 \u03c4)} = 1/3 \n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that \n\ne^{- t_required/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 2/3 \n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides for the original equation: \n\n- (t_required)/(20 \u03c4) = ln(1/3) \n\nSimilarly, for the new \u03b3: \n\n- (t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = ln(2/3) \n\nSo, rearrange both equations. \n\nLet me call the first equation (1): \n\n(t_required)/(20 \u03c4) = - ln(1/3) = ln 3 \n\nSecond equation (2): \n\n(t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = - ln(2/3) = ln (3/2) \n\nDivide equation (1) by equation (2): \n\n[(t_required)/(20 \u03c4)] / [(t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4)] = (ln 3) / (ln 3/2) \n\nSimplify the left side: (\u03b3 / 20) \n\nThus: \u03b3 /20 = (ln 3)/(ln (3/2)) \n\nCompute the right-hand side. Let me calculate the natural logs. \n\nln 3 \u2248 1.0986 \n\nln(3/2) = ln 1.5 \u2248 0.4055 \n\nSo (1.0986)/(0.4055) \u2248 2.708 \n\nTherefore, \u03b3 \u2248 20 * 2.708 \u2248 54.16 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 54. Which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. \n\nWait, the ratio of equations (1) and (2): \n\nEquation (1): (t_req)/(20 \u03c4) = ln 3 \n\nEquation (2): (t_req)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = ln(3/2) \n\nSo equation (1)/(equation 2) gives ( (t_req)/(20 \u03c4) ) / ( (t_req)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) ) ) = (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) \n\nSimplify left side: (\u03b3 \u03c4 / 20 \u03c4) * (t_req / t_req) \u2192 \u03b3/(20) \n\nSo \u03b3 = 20 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \n\nYes.

So the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial fraction is 1/3 survival, so that equation was set up as e^{- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 1/3. So solving that gives \u03b31 = (t/( - ln(1/3)*\u03c4 )) \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nLet me rephrase the equations properly. \n\nOriginal case: \n\nSurvival probability P1 = e^{- (t_required)/(\u03b31 \u03c4)} = 1/3 \n\nWe need to find \u03b32 where P2 = e^{- (t_required)/(\u03b32 \u03c4)} = 2/3 \n\nLet me take the ratio of the exponents. \n\nTake the natural log of both equations. \n\nFor the first: \n\nln(P1) = - (t_required)/(\u03b31 \u03c4) \u2192 \n\n- ln(1/3) = (t_required)/(\u03b31 \u03c4) \u2192 \n\nln3 = (t_required)/(\u03b31 \u03c4) \n\nSecond equation: \n\nln(P2) = - (t_required)/(\u03b32 \u03c4) \u2192 \n\nln(2/3) = - (t_required)/(\u03b32 \u03c4) \u2192 \n\nSo rearranged, (t_required)/(\u03b32 \u03c4) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) \n\nSo, from first equation: (t_required)/(\u03c4) = \u03b31 * ln3 \n\nFrom second equation: (t_required)/(\u03c4) = \u03b32 * ln(3/2) \n\nTherefore, setting them equal: \n\n\u03b31 * ln3 = \u03b32 * ln(3/2) \u2192 \n\n\u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) \n\nWhich is exactly what I had before.

So the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made any assumption here. The key assumption is that the decay follows an exponential distribution, so the survival probability is exponential. Also, that the time required to reach the detector is 30 meters divided by the speed. Since they're ultra-relativistic, v \u2248c. \n\nYes, that's right.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls instead of one-third as before. The given Lorentz factor is about 20, and the detector has a radius of 30 meters. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is. The Lorentz factor is given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the velocity of the particle and c is the speed of light. Ultra-relativistic particles mean they're moving at speeds very close to c, so their Lorentz factors are large. \n\nThe key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the lifetime of the particles. Since these particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime in the lab frame (detector's frame) would be dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (\u03c4) is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. The dilated lifetime (t) is \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to travel a distance of 30 meters to reach the detector walls. The distance they can travel before decaying is determined by their speed multiplied by their dilated lifetime. So, the maximum distance they can go is v * t = v * \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nBut wait, since they are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately c. So the distance becomes c * \u03b3 * \u03c4. But the detector's radius is 30 meters, so the particles must travel that distance before decaying. \n\nOriginally, with \u03b3 = 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. The question is, what \u03b3 would make two-thirds reach the walls? \n\nHmm, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio between the distance they need to travel (30 meters) and the distance they can travel on average before decaying. \n\nWait, maybe the particles have a fixed proper lifetime. Let's denote the proper lifetime as \u03c4. The dilated lifetime is t = \u03b3 * \u03c4. The distance they can travel in the lab frame is v * t. Since they are ultra-relativistic, v \u2248 c, so distance \u2248 c * \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to cover the radius of the detector, 30 meters, so the condition for a particle to reach the detector is that c * \u03b3 * \u03c4 \u2265 30 meters. \n\nBut particles are moving in all directions? Or are they all moving along the same direction? The problem says \"highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\", but maybe they're emitted in all directions. Wait, the problem says \"ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\". Maybe their velocities are all about the same, but direction might vary. However, the problem states that on average, one third reach the walls. \n\nHmm, perhaps the particles are moving outward in all directions, but only those that move in a direction towards the detector walls will reach them before decaying. Wait, but if they are produced at the center, then the distance to the wall is always 30 meters, regardless of direction. Wait, that's true. If the detector is a sphere, then every direction from the center is 30 meters to the wall. So the distance each particle needs to travel is exactly 30 meters, but the time they have before decaying is their lifetime in the lab frame, which is \u03b3 * \u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the particle's speed is v \u2248 c. The time taken to reach the wall would be t_required = distance / speed = 30 m / c. \n\nIf the dilated lifetime (t) is longer than this required time, then the particle will reach the detector. The probability of it decaying before that time is the probability that the lifetime (which is a random variable with an exponential distribution) is less than t_required. \n\nThe proper lifetime \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. The decay follows an exponential distribution: the probability that the particle has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-t/\u03c4). \n\nWait, but in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is \u03b3 * \u03c4. The time to reach the detector is t_required = 30 / c. \n\nTherefore, the probability that a particle does NOT decay before reaching the detector is e^(- t_required / (\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nWait, the probability that the particle survives until time t_required is e^(- t_required / (mean lifetime in lab frame)). The mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. So the survival probability is e^(- (30/c) / (\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nWait, let me check that again. The decay probability is: \n\nThe probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - e^{-t/(\u03b3\u03c4)}. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it survives until time t_required is e^{-t_required/(\u03b3\u03c4)}. \n\nWe want this survival probability to be the fraction of particles that reach the detector. \n\nInitially, with \u03b3 = 20, the survival probability is e^{- (30/c) / (20 \u03c4)}. And this equals 1/3 (since one third reach the walls). \n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that e^{- (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 2/3. \n\nSo set up the equations: \n\nLet me denote t_required = 30/c. \n\nOriginal scenario: \n\ne^{- t_required/(20 \u03c4)} = 1/3 \n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that \n\ne^{- t_required/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 2/3 \n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides for the original equation: \n\n- (t_required)/(20 \u03c4) = ln(1/3) \n\nSimilarly, for the new \u03b3: \n\n- (t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = ln(2/3) \n\nSo, rearrange both equations. \n\nLet me call the first equation (1): \n\n(t_required)/(20 \u03c4) = - ln(1/3) = ln 3 \n\nSecond equation (2): \n\n(t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = - ln(2/3) = ln (3/2) \n\nDivide equation (1) by equation (2): \n\n[(t_required)/(20 \u03c4)] / [(t_required)/(\u03b3 \u03c4)] = (ln 3) / (ln 3/2) \n\nSimplify the left side: (\u03b3 / 20) \n\nThus: \u03b3 /20 = (ln 3)/(ln (3/2)) \n\nCompute the right-hand side. Let me calculate the natural logs. \n\nln 3 \u2248 1.0986 \n\nln(3/2) = ln 1.5 \u2248 0.4055 \n\nSo (1.0986)/(0.4055) \u2248 2.708 \n\nTherefore, \u03b3 \u2248 20 * 2.708 \u2248 54.16 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 54. Which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. \n\nWait, the ratio of equations (1) and (2): \n\nEquation (1): (t_req)/(20 \u03c4) = ln 3 \n\nEquation (2): (t_req)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) = ln(3/2) \n\nSo equation (1)/(equation 2) gives ( (t_req)/(20 \u03c4) ) / ( (t_req)/(\u03b3 \u03c4) ) ) = (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) \n\nSimplify left side: (\u03b3 \u03c4 / 20 \u03c4) * (t_req / t_req) \u2192 \u03b3/(20) \n\nSo \u03b3 = 20 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \n\nYes. So plugging in the numbers: \n\nln3 is about 1.0986, ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055 \n\n1.0986 /0.4055 \u2248 2.708 \n\n20 *2.708 \u224854.16, so approximately 54. So the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The initial fraction is 1/3 survival, so that equation was set up as e^{- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4)} = 1/3.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The current setup has particles with a Lorentz factor of about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required so that two thirds reach the walls. The options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) means. The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are very close to the speed of light. \n\nThe key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the lifetime of the particles. Because these particles are fast-decaying, their proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is short. However, from the lab frame (the detector's frame), their lifetime is dilated by \u03b3. So, the longer the lifetime in the lab frame, the farther they can travel before decaying, which would mean more particles reach the detector walls.\n\nThe problem states that currently, with \u03b3 ~20, one third reach the walls. We need to find \u03b3 such that two thirds reach the walls. So the idea is that if the Lorentz factor increases, the lifetime in the lab frame increases, so the particles live longer and can travel farther. Therefore, a higher \u03b3 would mean more particles reach the detector. Wait, but the question is asking for the Lorentz factor needed to have twice as many particles reach the walls. So if one third reach at \u03b3=20, then to get two thirds, we need a higher \u03b3?\n\nWait, but maybe the distance they can travel is proportional to \u03b3? Let me think.\n\nThe proper lifetime of the particle is \u03c4\u2080. The lab frame lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel before decaying is v * \u03c4. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately c. So the distance d = v * \u03c4 = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles start at the center, so they need to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The distance they can travel before decaying must be at least 30 meters for them to reach the wall. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\". So the average distance they travel must be such that when the distance is 30 m, the probability of surviving that distance is 1/3. Hmm, but maybe it's a matter of the mean lifetime and the distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio of the detector radius to the mean distance they can travel. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The mean distance traveled is v * \u03c4 = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Since v is close to c, let's approximate it as c. So mean distance d_avg = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nThe particles are emitted from the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. If the mean distance they can travel is greater than 30 meters, then more particles would reach the wall. Wait, but how does the fraction relate here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction that reaches the detector is determined by the probability that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. \n\nThe time taken to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 m / v. Since v is approximately c (ultra-relativistic), let's use c. So t = 30 / c.\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle's lifetime (\u03c4) is greater than t is e^(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nTherefore, the survival probability P is e^(- (t)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nThe problem states that currently, with \u03b31 = 20, the survival probability is 1/3. We need to find \u03b32 such that the survival probability becomes 2/3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this formula. The decay probability over time is exponential, so the probability that the particle survives for a time t is indeed P = e^(-t/\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. Here, \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So substituting:\n\nP = e^(- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) \n\nGiven that when \u03b3 is 20, P = 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(20 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that 2/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nHmm, but maybe I can relate the two equations. Let me write both equations:\n\nFor \u03b31=20, P1 = 1/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nFor \u03b32, P2 = 2/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nWe can take the ratio or take the logarithm of both equations.\n\nTaking natural log on both sides for the first equation:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nLet me rearrange both equations to solve for (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080):\n\nFrom first equation: (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n\nFrom the second equation: (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo, the ratio of the two equations (second over first) would be:\n\n[ (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ] / [ (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) ] = [ln(3/2)] / [ln(3)]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n( (30/c) / (\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) * ( \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 / (30/c) ) ) = \u03b31 / \u03b32 \n\nThus:\n\n\u03b31 / \u03b32 = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln(3) ]\n\nTherefore, solving for \u03b32:\n\n\u03b32 = \u03b31 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b31 is 20. Let's compute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986 and ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo the ratio is 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.7095.\n\nTherefore, \u03b32 = 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19.\n\nHmm, so approximately 54.19, which is closest to option A) 54. That's one of the choices. Let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the steps again to confirm.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation 1: ln(1/3) = - (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nEquation 2: ln(2/3) = - (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nEquation 1: -ln(1/3) = (30)/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) \u2192 ln(3) = (30)/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nEquation 2: -ln(2/3) = (30)/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) \u2192 ln(3/2) = (30)/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nSo, dividing equation 1 by equation 2 gives:\n\n[ ln(3) ] / [ ln(3/2) ] = [ (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) / (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) ]\n\nThe 30, c, and \u03c4\u2080 terms cancel out, so:\n\nln(3)/ln(3/2) = (\u03b32 / \u03b31 )\n\nWait a second! Wait, that division step. Let me re-express:\n\nLet me write equation1 as A = B1 and equation2 as A' = B2, where A = ln3, B1 = 30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080). Similarly, A' = ln(3/2) = 30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080).\n\nIf I take equation1 divided by equation2: (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) = (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)) / (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)) ) \u2192 (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) = (\u03b32)/(\u03b31) \u2192 so \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3)/(ln(3/2))\n\nAh, I see my mistake earlier. The ratio is (ln3)/(ln(3/2)), not the inverse. So that's different from before. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, in the previous step, when I wrote \u03b31 / \u03b32 = [ln(3/2)]/[ln3], but according to this new analysis, it's:\n\nln3 / ln(3/2) = \u03b32 / \u03b31 \u2192 so \u03b32 = \u03b31*(ln3/ln(3/2))\n\nSo with numbers:\n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)=0.4055 \u2192 1.0986/0.4055 \u2248 2.7095. So 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19. So that's the same as before, so the answer would be A)54.\n\nWait, but I thought I made a mistake here, but the math still gives the same result. Wait, perhaps my initial calculation was correct. Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nSuppose equation1: ln3 = 30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nequation2: ln(3/2) = 30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nSo, if I solve equation1 for (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) = \u03b31 * ln3.\n\nSimilarly, equation2: (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) = \u03b32 * ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore, setting the left sides equal (since they are both equal to 30/(c \u03c4\u2080)):\n\n\u03b31 * ln3 = \u03b32 * ln(3/2)\n\n\u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) \u224820 * 2.709 \u224854.19 \u2192 so A)54 is correct.\n\nHmm, so that would be answer A.\n\nWait, but let me think again if the model is correct. The survival probability is exp(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)), right? So the fraction surviving to reach the wall is P = exp( - (distance/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). Because the time taken is distance/v, and the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So substituting, yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is v * (lifetime), so the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is proportional to \u03b3. So the average distance is proportional to \u03b3. So if the detector radius is fixed, then the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio of the detector radius to the average distance. \n\nWait, but in the exponential model, the average distance is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the average distance is proportional to \u03b3. So, if the detector radius is fixed, then the survival probability is exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). So the survival probability depends on R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). \n\nSo, let me see:\n\nLet me denote R = 30 m, so the time to reach the wall is t = R / v.\n\nThe survival probability is P = exp(- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) = exp( - (R/(v))/( \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 ) )\n\nWait, but \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the mean lifetime in lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the time taken to reach the wall is R/v. The probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than that time is exp(- (R/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nWait, so the survival probability is exp(- (R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) ). Wait, but R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) is (R/(v \u03c4\u2080 )) * (1/\u03b3). Hmm, maybe I need to see if there's another way to think.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel is v * \u03c4. So the average distance is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the detector's radius is 30 m. So the fraction of particles that reach the detector would be the probability that their lifetime is at least enough to reach the detector. Since the lifetime is a random variable with exponential distribution, the probability of surviving until time t is exp(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)), where t is the time taken to reach the detector (30 m / v). \n\nSo, substituting t = R / v:\n\nP = exp( - (R / v) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nWait, but v is the velocity. For ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c, so v is approximately c. So we can write:\n\nP = exp( - (R/(c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) )\n\nWait, but in the previous equations, when I set up the equations, I think I might have messed up the variables. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the survival probability as P = exp( - (distance traveled)/(mean distance traveled) )\n\nThe mean distance traveled is v * mean lifetime (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). So the probability that the distance traveled is greater than R (the detector radius) is exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). \n\nWait, so P = exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nAlternatively, since the particle must travel distance R to reach the detector, the probability it survives that distance is exp( - R/(mean distance) ), where the mean distance is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nTherefore, yes, the formula is P = exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nBut in that case, let me re-express the equations.\n\nLet me denote that the current situation has \u03b31 =20, P1 =1/3. The desired P2=2/3, find \u03b32.\n\nSo:\n\nP1 = exp( - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) = 1/3\n\nP2 = exp( - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) = 2/3\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\nln(P1) = - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nln(P2) = - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nDivide the two equations:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = [ - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 ) ] / [ - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) ] \n\nThe negatives cancel, R/(v \u03c4\u2080) cancels, so:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = (\u03b32)/(\u03b31 )\n\nWait, that's different. Let me check:\n\nWait, the ratio of the equations (equation1 / equation2):\n\n[ ln(P1) ] / [ ln(P2) ] = ( R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )) / ( R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )) )\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n(R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )) divided by (R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )) equals (\u03b32/\u03b31)\n\nSo:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = \u03b32/\u03b31 \u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * ( ln(P1)/ln(P2) )\n\nWait, substituting P1 =1/3 and P2=2/3:\n\nln(1/3)/ln(2/3) = \u03b32/(\u03b31)\n\nCalculating:\n\nln(1/3) = -ln3 \u2248 -1.0986\n\nln(2/3) = ln2 - ln3 \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nSo the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.7095\n\nTherefore, \u03b32 = 20 * 2.7095 \u224854.19 \u2192 same as before. So answer A.\n\nWait, but in this case, the equations were handled differently but arrived at the same result, so that's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the required \u03b3 being proportional to 1 over the argument of the exponent. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the two equations again:\n\nln(1/3) = - ( R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nln(2/3) = - ( R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nLet me solve each equation for R/(v \u03c4\u2080):\n\nFrom first equation:\n\nR/(v \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(1/3) * \u03b31 = ln(3) * \u03b31\n\nSecond equation:\n\nR/(v \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(2/3) * \u03b32 = ln(3/2) * \u03b32\n\nTherefore, setting the two expressions equal (since R/(v \u03c4\u2080) is a constant for the same particle's proper lifetime and detector radius):\n\nln(3)* \u03b31 = ln(3/2)* \u03b32 \u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo this gives the same result. So, the answer should be 54.19, so option A)54. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the number of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the lifetime. Since the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, then the distance they can travel is proportional to \u03b3. Since the detector radius is fixed, the fraction that reaches the detector would depend on \u03b3. \n\nIf initially, with \u03b3=20, 1/3 reach, then to get twice the fraction (2/3), perhaps \u03b3 needs to be scaled by a factor. But this approach might be oversimplified, because the exponential relationship is not linear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a simple proportionality, but given that the exponential model gives 54, which is an option, I think that's the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)54.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor (\u03b3), the detector radius (30 m), and the survival probability of the particles.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The current setup has particles with a Lorentz factor of about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor required so that two thirds reach the walls. The options are given as A to D.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) means. The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), which relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are very close to the speed of light. \n\nThe key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the lifetime of the particles. Because these particles are fast-decaying, their proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is short. However, from the lab frame (the detector's frame), their lifetime is dilated by \u03b3. So, the longer the lifetime in the lab frame, the farther they can travel before decaying, which would mean more particles reach the detector walls.\n\nThe problem states that currently, with \u03b3 ~20, one third reach the walls. We need to find \u03b3 such that two thirds reach the walls. So the idea is that if the Lorentz factor increases, the lifetime in the lab frame increases, so the particles live longer and can travel farther. Therefore, a higher \u03b3 would mean more particles reach the detector. Wait, but the question is asking for the Lorentz factor needed to have twice as many particles reach the walls. So if one third reach at \u03b3=20, then to get two thirds, we need a higher \u03b3?\n\nWait, but maybe the distance they can travel is proportional to \u03b3? Let me think.\n\nThe proper lifetime of the particle is \u03c4\u2080. The lab frame lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel before decaying is v * \u03c4. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately c. So the distance d = v * \u03c4 = c * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles start at the center, so they need to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The distance they can travel before decaying must be at least 30 meters for them to reach the wall. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls\". So the average distance they travel must be such that when the distance is 30 m, the probability of surviving that distance is 1/3. Hmm, but maybe it's a matter of the mean lifetime and the distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio of the detector radius to the mean distance they can travel. Let me think again.\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The mean distance traveled is v * \u03c4 = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Since v is close to c, let's approximate it as c. So mean distance d_avg = c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nThe particles are emitted from the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. If the mean distance they can travel is greater than 30 meters, then more particles would reach the wall. Wait, but how does the fraction relate here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction that reaches the detector is determined by the probability that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. \n\nThe time taken to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 m / v. Since v is approximately c (ultra-relativistic), let's use c. So t = 30 / c.\n\nThe lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle's lifetime (\u03c4) is greater than t is e^(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nTherefore, the survival probability P is e^(- (t)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)). \n\nThe problem states that currently, with \u03b31 = 20, the survival probability is 1/3. We need to find \u03b32 such that the survival probability becomes 2/3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this formula. The decay probability over time is exponential, so the probability that the particle survives for a time t is indeed P = e^(-t/\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the mean lifetime. Here, \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So substituting:\n\nP = e^(- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) \n\nGiven that when \u03b3 is 20, P = 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(20 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nWe need to find \u03b3 such that 2/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nHmm, but maybe I can relate the two equations. Let me write both equations:\n\nFor \u03b31=20, P1 = 1/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nFor \u03b32, P2 = 2/3 = e^(- (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nWe can take the ratio or take the logarithm of both equations.\n\nTaking natural log on both sides for the first equation:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nLet me rearrange both equations to solve for (30/c)/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080):\n\nFrom first equation: (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n\nFrom the second equation: (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo, the ratio of the two equations (second over first) would be:\n\n[ (30/c)/(\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ] / [ (30/c)/(\u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) ] = [ln(3/2)] / [ln(3)]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n( (30/c) / (\u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) * ( \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 / (30/c) ) ) = \u03b31 / \u03b32 \n\nThus:\n\n\u03b31 / \u03b32 = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln(3) ]\n\nTherefore, solving for \u03b32:\n\n\u03b32 = \u03b31 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03b31 is 20. Let's compute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986 and ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055.\n\nSo the ratio is 1.0986 / 0.4055 \u2248 2.7095.\n\nTherefore, \u03b32 = 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19.\n\nHmm, so approximately 54.19, which is closest to option A) 54. That's one of the choices. Let me check the calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the steps again to confirm.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation 1: ln(1/3) = - (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nEquation 2: ln(2/3) = - (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080))\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nEquation 1: -ln(1/3) = (30)/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) \u2192 ln(3) = (30)/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nEquation 2: -ln(2/3) = (30)/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) \u2192 ln(3/2) = (30)/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)\n\nSo, dividing equation 1 by equation 2 gives:\n\n[ ln(3) ] / [ ln(3/2) ] = [ (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) / (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) ]\n\nThe 30, c, and \u03c4\u2080 terms cancel out, so:\n\nln(3)/ln(3/2) = (\u03b32 / \u03b31 )\n\nWait a second! Wait, that division step. Let me re-express:\n\nLet me write equation1 as A = B1 and equation2 as A' = B2, where A = ln3, B1 = 30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080). Similarly, A' = ln(3/2) = 30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080).\n\nIf I take equation1 divided by equation2: (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) = (30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080)) / (30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080)) ) \u2192 (ln3)/(ln(3/2)) = (\u03b32)/(\u03b31) \u2192 so \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3)/(ln(3/2))\n\nAh, I see my mistake earlier. The ratio is (ln3)/(ln(3/2)), not the inverse. So that's different from before. Let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, in the previous step, when I wrote \u03b31 / \u03b32 = [ln(3/2)]/[ln3], but according to this new analysis, it's:\n\nln3 / ln(3/2) = \u03b32 / \u03b31 \u2192 so \u03b32 = \u03b31*(ln3/ln(3/2))\n\nSo with numbers:\n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)=0.4055 \u2192 1.0986/0.4055 \u2248 2.7095. So 20 * 2.7095 \u2248 54.19. So that's the same as before, so the answer would be A)54.\n\nWait, but I thought I made a mistake here, but the math still gives the same result. Wait, perhaps my initial calculation was correct. Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nSuppose equation1: ln3 = 30/(c \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nequation2: ln(3/2) = 30/(c \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nSo, if I solve equation1 for (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) = \u03b31 * ln3.\n\nSimilarly, equation2: (30/(c \u03c4\u2080)) = \u03b32 * ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore, setting the left sides equal (since they are both equal to 30/(c \u03c4\u2080)):\n\n\u03b31 * ln3 = \u03b32 * ln(3/2)\n\n\u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) \u224820 * 2.709 \u224854.19 \u2192 so A)54 is correct.\n\nHmm, so that would be answer A.\n\nWait, but let me think again if the model is correct. The survival probability is exp(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)), right? So the fraction surviving to reach the wall is P = exp( - (distance/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). Because the time taken is distance/v, and the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So substituting, yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is v * (lifetime), so the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is proportional to \u03b3. So the average distance is proportional to \u03b3. So if the detector radius is fixed, then the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio of the detector radius to the average distance. \n\nWait, but in the exponential model, the average distance is v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the average distance is proportional to \u03b3. So, if the detector radius is fixed, then the survival probability is exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). So the survival probability depends on R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). \n\nSo, let me see:\n\nLet me denote R = 30 m, so the time to reach the wall is t = R / v.\n\nThe survival probability is P = exp(- t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) = exp( - (R/(v))/( \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 ) )\n\nWait, but \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the mean lifetime in lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the time taken to reach the wall is R/v. The probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than that time is exp(- (R/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nWait, so the survival probability is exp(- (R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) ). Wait, but R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) is (R/(v \u03c4\u2080 )) * (1/\u03b3). Hmm, maybe I need to see if there's another way to think.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The distance they can travel is v * \u03c4. So the average distance is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the detector's radius is 30 m. So the fraction of particles that reach the detector would be the probability that their lifetime is at least enough to reach the detector. Since the lifetime is a random variable with exponential distribution, the probability of surviving until time t is exp(-t/(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)), where t is the time taken to reach the detector (30 m / v). \n\nSo, substituting t = R / v:\n\nP = exp( - (R / v) / (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nWait, but v is the velocity. For ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c, so v is approximately c. So we can write:\n\nP = exp( - (R/(c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080)) )\n\nWait, but in the previous equations, when I set up the equations, I think I might have messed up the variables. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the survival probability as P = exp( - (distance traveled)/(mean distance traveled) )\n\nThe mean distance traveled is v * mean lifetime (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). So the probability that the distance traveled is greater than R (the detector radius) is exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) ). \n\nWait, so P = exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nAlternatively, since the particle must travel distance R to reach the detector, the probability it survives that distance is exp( - R/(mean distance) ), where the mean distance is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nTherefore, yes, the formula is P = exp( - R/(v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nBut in that case, let me re-express the equations.\n\nLet me denote that the current situation has \u03b31 =20, P1 =1/3. The desired P2=2/3, find \u03b32.\n\nSo:\n\nP1 = exp( - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) ) = 1/3\n\nP2 = exp( - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) = 2/3\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\nln(P1) = - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nln(P2) = - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )\n\nDivide the two equations:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = [ - R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 ) ] / [ - R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) ) ] \n\nThe negatives cancel, R/(v \u03c4\u2080) cancels, so:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = (\u03b32)/(\u03b31 )\n\nWait, that's different. Let me check:\n\nWait, the ratio of the equations (equation1 / equation2):\n\n[ ln(P1) ] / [ ln(P2) ] = ( R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )) / ( R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )) )\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n(R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080 )) divided by (R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080 )) equals (\u03b32/\u03b31)\n\nSo:\n\nln(P1)/ln(P2) = \u03b32/\u03b31 \u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * ( ln(P1)/ln(P2) )\n\nWait, substituting P1 =1/3 and P2=2/3:\n\nln(1/3)/ln(2/3) = \u03b32/(\u03b31)\n\nCalculating:\n\nln(1/3) = -ln3 \u2248 -1.0986\n\nln(2/3) = ln2 - ln3 \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nSo the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.7095\n\nTherefore, \u03b32 = 20 * 2.7095 \u224854.19 \u2192 same as before. So answer A.\n\nWait, but in this case, the equations were handled differently but arrived at the same result, so that's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the required \u03b3 being proportional to 1 over the argument of the exponent. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the two equations again:\n\nln(1/3) = - ( R/(v \u03b31 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nln(2/3) = - ( R/(v \u03b32 \u03c4\u2080) )\n\nLet me solve each equation for R/(v \u03c4\u2080):\n\nFrom first equation:\n\nR/(v \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(1/3) * \u03b31 = ln(3) * \u03b31\n\nSecond equation:\n\nR/(v \u03c4\u2080) = - ln(2/3) * \u03b32 = ln(3/2) * \u03b32\n\nTherefore, setting the two expressions equal (since R/(v \u03c4\u2080) is a constant for the same particle's proper lifetime and detector radius):\n\nln(3)* \u03b31 = ln(3/2)* \u03b32 \u2192 \u03b32 = \u03b31 * (ln3 / ln(3/2)) \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo this gives the same result. So, the answer should be 54.19, so option A)54. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the number of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the lifetime. Since the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, then the distance they can travel is proportional to \u03b3. Since the detector radius is fixed, the fraction that reaches the detector would depend on \u03b3. \n\nIf initially, with \u03b3=20, 1/3 reach, then to get twice the fraction (2/3), perhaps \u03b3 needs to be scaled by a factor. But this approach might be oversimplified, because the exponential relationship is not linear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a simple proportionality, but given that the exponential model gives 54, which is an option, I think that's the way to go. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)54.\n\n\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor (\u03b3), the detector radius (30 m), and the survival probability of the particles. The survival probability \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = \\exp(-R/(v \\gamma \\tau_0)) \\), where \\( R \\) is the detector radius, \\( v \\) is the particle speed (\u2248 \\( c \\)), and \\( \\tau_0 \\) is the proper lifetime. \n\nGiven \\( \\gamma_1 = 20 \\) yields \\( P_1 = 1/3 \\), and we seek \\( \\gamma_2 \\) for \\( P_2 = 2/3 \\):\n\n1. For \\( \\gamma_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\ln(1/3) = -\\frac{R}{v \\gamma_1 \\tau_0} \\implies \\ln(3) = \\frac{R}{v \\gamma_1 \\tau_0}\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\( \\gamma_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\ln(2/3) = -\\frac{R}{v \\gamma_2 \\tau_0} \\implies \\ln(3/2) = \\frac{R}{v \\gamma_2 \\tau_0}\n   \\]\n\nEquating the expressions for \\( R/(v \\tau_0) \\):\n\\[\n\\ln(3) \\cdot \\gamma_1 = \\ln(3/2) \\cdot \\gamma_2 \\implies \\gamma_2 = \\gamma_1 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma_1 = 20 \\), \\( \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986 \\), and \\( \\ln(3/2) \\approx 0.4055 \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 \\approx 20 \\cdot \\frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 54.19\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **A) 54**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required so that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls instead of one-third. The problem states that currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, one third make it. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that ultra-relativistic particles have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation from special relativity. The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is gamma here. The key idea is that the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is \u03b3 times the proper lifetime (\u03c4). So the particles are moving at such high speeds that their decay time is extended, allowing them to travel further before decaying.\n\nThe particles are produced at the center and need to reach the walls. The distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The number that reach the detector depends on how far they can travel before decaying. \n\nLet me think: The average distance a particle travels before decaying (in the lab frame) is the product of its speed and its lifetime. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c. So the distance would be roughly \u03b3 * (c * \u03c4). The proper lifetime \u03c4 is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime \u03c4 is the time it takes to decay in its own rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4, so the distance would be v * \u03b3\u03c4. But for ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c, so that's \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to travel 30 meters. The fraction that reaches the detector would be the fraction of particles whose lifetime in the lab frame is long enough so that they can cover that distance. \n\nAssuming the decay happens randomly, maybe the average distance they travel is the key. The average distance would be the average of v times the lifetime. Since the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4, and v is near c, the average distance is \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nSo the fraction that reaches the detector would depend on how this average distance compares to 30 meters. If the average distance is equal to 30 meters, then on average, half would reach? Wait, maybe the problem is using an average here. Let me see.\n\nWait the problem states that currently, with \u03b3=20, one third reach the detector. So perhaps the average distance traveled is such that when \u03b3 is 20, the average distance is 30 meters multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe the fraction is calculated as (distance traveled)/(radius) when it's greater than or equal to the radius. But perhaps the probability is proportional to the average distance divided by the radius? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number that reach the detector is proportional to the average distance divided by the radius. Let me think again. Let me model this properly. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nThe proper lifetime is \u03c4. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4. The particle's speed is v \u2248 c. The maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is v * t, where t is the lab lifetime. \n\nThe probability that a particle reaches the detector is the probability that its lifetime is at least the time it takes to reach the detector. The time to reach the detector is d / v, where d is the radius (30 m). \n\nSo the condition is: t \u2265 d/(v). \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is t = \u03b3\u03c4. The decay process is exponential, so the probability that the lifetime is greater than some time T is exp(-T/\u03c4'). Wait, actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle lives longer than time T is P(T) = exp(-T/(\u03c4')), where \u03c4' is the mean lifetime in that frame. \n\nWait, in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4. So the probability that the particle's lifetime exceeds the required time (d/v) is exp(- (d/(v)) / (\u03b3\u03c4) ). Because the mean lifetime in the lab is \u03b3\u03c4, so the decay constant is 1/(\u03b3\u03c4). \n\nSo the probability P that the particle reaches the detector is exp(-d/(v \u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nAlternatively, since v is approximately c (since ultra-relativistic), so substituting v = c, then:\n\nP = exp(-d/(c \u03b3 \u03c4)) \n\nThe problem states that when \u03b3=20, this probability is 1/3. \n\nWe need to find \u03b3' such that P becomes 2/3. \n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nFor \u03b3=20: exp(-30/(c * 20 * \u03c4)) = 1/3 \n\nFor \u03b3'=?: exp(-30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4)) = 2/3 \n\nWe need to solve for \u03b3' given that. \n\nLet me take natural logarithm on both sides of the first equation:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4) \n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4) \n\nLet me denote the denominator terms. Let me call the first equation's right side as A = -30/(c *20 * \u03c4), so ln(1/3)=A. \n\nThe second equation's right side is B = -30/(c *\u03b3' * \u03c4) = ln(2/3). \n\nWe can take the ratio of the two equations. Let's see:\n\nLet me write the two equations:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4) \n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4) \n\nLet me divide the second equation by the first equation (equation2 / equation1):\n\n[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = [ -30/(c \u03b3' \u03c4) ] / [ -30/(c 20 \u03c4) ) ]\n\nSimplify the right side: ( (1/(\u03b3')) ) / ( (1/(20)) ) = 20/(\u03b3') \n\nThe left side is ln(2/3)/ln(1/3). Let me compute that numerically. \n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nln(1/3) = -ln(3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nSo the ratio is (-0.4055)/(-1.0986) \u2248 0.369 \n\nSo 0.369 \u2248 20/(\u03b3') \u2192 \u03b3' \u2248 20 / 0.369 \u2248 54.2 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 54.2, which would be option A) 54. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nThe key idea is that the probability is exp(-d/(v \u03b3 \u03c4)). Since v is c, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime. \n\nWait, but perhaps the speed isn't exactly c? But for ultra-relativistic particles, we can approximate v \u2248 c. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is 30 meters. The time needed to reach the detector is t_required = 30 m / v. \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. The probability that the particle lives longer than t_required is exp( - t_required / (\u03b3 \u03c4) ), since the mean lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4. \n\nWait, wait, the decay constant in the lab frame is 1/(\u03b3 \u03c4), so the probability that it lives longer than time T is exp(- T/(\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nSo in that case, T here is the time required to reach the detector, which is (30 m)/v. \n\nThus, substituting:\n\nProbability P = exp( - (30/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4) )\n\nBut since v \u2248 c, that's exp( -30/(c \u03b3 \u03c4) )\n\nSo that's what I had before. \n\nSo when \u03b3 is 20, P is 1/3. \n\nSo taking the equations:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4 )\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4 )\n\nLet me solve for \u03b3'. Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for (30/(c * \u03c4 )):\n\n30/(c * \u03c4 ) = ( - ln(1/3) ) * 20 \n\nBecause from first equation: \n\nln(1/3) = - (30/(c*20*\u03c4 )) \n\nMultiply both sides by -20/(30/(c*\u03c4)), but perhaps better to express as:\n\nLet me denote K = 30/(c * \u03c4). \n\nThen the first equation: ln(1/3) = - K/(20) \n\nSo K = -20 * ln(1/3) \n\nThe second equation: ln(2/3) = - K/(\u03b3') \n\nSo substituting K from first equation into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - [ -20 * ln(1/3) ] / \u03b3'\n\nThus,\n\nln(2/3) = (20 * ln(1/3)) / \u03b3'\n\nSolving for \u03b3':\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)\n\nWait, but ln(1/3) is negative, and ln(2/3) is also negative. So the negatives will cancel. \n\nCalculating the values:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nThus,\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * (-1.0986) / (-0.4055) \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) \u2248 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18 \n\nSo that's approximately 54.18, which rounds to 54. So the answer would be option A. \n\nWait, but the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28. So 54 is an option. But let me check my calculation again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the division:\n\n1.0986 divided by 0.4055. Let me compute that:\n\n0.4055 \u00d7 2.7 = 1.095, which is close to 1.0986. So 1.0986 /0.4055 \u2248 2.709. \n\nYes, so 20 times that is 54.18. So the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the average distance traveled is \u03b3 c \u03c4. The particles need to go 30 meters. The fraction that reaches is the fraction of particles where their lifetime allows them to go at least 30 m. \n\nWait, but maybe the average distance is \u03b3 c \u03c4, and the required distance is 30 m. So if the average is 30, then maybe the fraction is 1/e? Wait, but the problem states that when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach: The average distance traveled is \u03b3 c \u03c4. If the average distance is equal to the radius, then the fraction that reaches would be something. But perhaps the fraction is related to the ratio of the required distance to the average distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is (distance)/(average distance) if it's a linear relationship, but that might not be the case. The exponential distribution's mean is \u03b3 c \u03c4, but the probability that the distance traveled is greater than 30 is exp(-30/(\u03b3 c \u03c4)), which is what I had before. \n\nSo that approach seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the mean free path. The mean free path (average distance) is \u03b3 c \u03c4. So if the average distance is three times the radius, then the fraction that can reach would be higher? Wait, the probability that the distance is greater than 30 is exp(-30/(mean distance)). \n\nSo if the average distance (mean) is \u03bc = \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nThen P( distance > 30 ) = exp(-30 / \u03bc )\n\nSo when gamma is 20, \u03bc = 20 c \u03c4. \n\nSo P = exp( -30/(20 c \u03c4 ) ). Wait, but in that case, the problem says that when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. \n\nWait, but in my previous equations, I considered the mean distance as gamma c tau, so substituting into the probability:\n\nP = exp( -d / (mean distance) ) \n\nSo when gamma is 20, P = exp( -30/(20 c tau * (c tau ?) Wait, no, the mean distance is gamma c tau, so substituting into the equation, P = exp( -30/(gamma c tau) ), which is the same as before. \n\nSo the equations are correct. \n\nThus, the calculation leading to gamma' \u224854 is correct, so the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the distance is 30 meters, so the required time is t_required = 30 / v. \n\nThe lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau. The probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t_required is exp( - (t_required) / (gamma tau) ). \n\nWait, because the decay probability is exponential with mean lifetime gamma tau. \n\nSo the probability is P = exp( - (30/(v)) / (gamma tau) )\n\nSince v is approximately c, then substituting:\n\nP = exp( - (30/(c gamma tau)) )\n\nWait, so the exponent is -30/(c gamma tau). \n\nWait, so when gamma is 20, then exponent is -30/(c *20 * tau). Let's call the denominator term (c * tau) as a constant. Let me call that term K. \n\nWait, but in the equations, the exponent is - (30/(c gamma tau)) = - (30/(gamma)) / (c tau) \n\nWait, but in the problem, the proper lifetime tau is a constant, right? Because the particles are the same type. So tau is fixed. \n\nTherefore, the exponent is proportional to 1/gamma. \n\nSo if when gamma is 20, the exponent is X, then when gamma is gamma', the exponent is X * (20/gamma'). \n\nWait, let me see. Let me denote the exponent for gamma=20 as E1 = -30/(c*20*tau) \n\nThe probability is exp(E1) = 1/3 \n\nFor gamma', E2 = -30/(c*gamma'*tau) \n\nWe want exp(E2) = 2/3 \n\nSo, E2 = ln(2/3) \n\nE1 = ln(1/3) \n\nTherefore, the ratio E2 / E1 = [ -30/(c gamma' tau) ] / [ -30/(c 20 tau) ) ] = (20/gamma') \n\nBut also, E2/E1 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) \n\nThus, 20/gamma' = [ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)] \n\nWait, wait, no, let me do the ratio again:\n\nE2 / E1 = [ (-30/(c gamma' tau)) ] / [ (-30/(c 20 tau) ) ] \n\nThe negatives cancel, 30 cancels, c and tau cancel. So (20)/(gamma') \n\nSo that ratio is 20/gamma'. \n\nThe other ratio is E2/E1 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) \n\nWait, but E2 is ln(2/3) and E1 is ln(1/3), so the ratio of E2 to E1 is [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nWait, no. Wait, E1 is ln(1/3) = the exponent when gamma is 20. \n\nWait, no, E1 is the exponent value, which is equal to ln(P1) where P1 is 1/3. Wait, no, actually, E1 is the exponent such that exp(E1) = 1/3. So E1 = ln(1/3). \n\nSimilarly, E2 = ln(2/3). \n\nThus, the ratio (E2)/(E1) = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nBut from the first ratio: (E2)/(E1) = (20 / gamma') \n\nWait, no, the first ratio is E2/E1 = (20/gamma') \n\nWait, let me re-arrange:\n\nThe first ratio (from the expressions of E2 and E1) is E2 / E1 = (20 / gamma') \n\nThe second ratio (from the values of E2 and E1) is E2/E1 = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nSetting them equal:\n\n20/gamma' = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nTherefore, gamma' = 20 * [ln(1/3)/ln(2/3)] \n\nAh! Wait a second! Here's a mistake I made earlier. \n\nWait, in the previous step, when I set up the equation:\n\nE2/E1 = (20/gamma') \n\nBut E2 is equal to ln(2/3), and E1 is ln(1/3). \n\nWait, no, the exponent E1 is equal to the value that gives exp(E1) = P1, so E1 = ln(P1) = ln(1/3). \n\nSimilarly, E2 = ln(P2) = ln(2/3). \n\nThus, the ratio (E2)/(E1) is [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nBut from the other side, the ratio (E2)/(E1) is (20/gamma'). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the first ratio (from the expressions of E2 and E1 in terms of gamma) is:\n\nE2 = ( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nE1 = ( -30/(c 20 tau) )\n\nThus, E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nSo E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nTherefore, rearranged: gamma' = 20 * (E1 / E2) \n\nWait, substituting E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nE2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nSo solving for gamma': \n\ngamma' = 20 * (E1 / E2) \n\nBut E1 is ln(1/3), E2 is ln(2/3). \n\nSo gamma' = 20 * ( ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) )\n\nAh! Here's the error. Previously I had gamma' = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) \n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation I had written:\n\ngamma' = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3). Wait, but let me compute this correctly. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate with the correct formula. \n\ngamma' = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))\n\nCompute the values:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nThus, the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.709 \n\nSo gamma' = 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18, same as before. \n\nWait, so that still gives the same answer. So the initial calculation was correct. \n\nHmm, so why the confusion? Because in the earlier steps I thought perhaps there was a miscalculation, but the result still comes to 54. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me see the options again. Option A is 54, which matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the average distance. Suppose that the average distance is gamma * c * tau. Then when gamma is 20, the average distance is 20 * c * tau. \n\nThe fraction that reaches the detector might be the fraction of the average distance over the radius? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. The average distance is the mean of the exponential distribution. The probability that the particle travels more than 30 meters is exp(-30/(average distance)), since average distance is the mean. \n\nSo if the average distance is 20 * c * tau, then the probability is exp(-30/(20 c tau)). \n\nWait, but if the average distance is 20 c tau, then the exponent is 30/(average distance) = 30/(20 c tau). \n\nWait, so that term is (30/(average distance)). \n\nSo in the problem, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20 c tau. \n\nThe probability to reach 30 m is exp(-30/(20 c tau)). \n\nWait, but in this case, if the average distance was equal to 30 meters, then the probability would be exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is about 1/3. \n\nAh! Wait, that's interesting. \n\nSuppose that when gamma is 20, the average distance is 30 meters. Then the probability would be exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is approximately 1/3. \n\nSo that matches the problem's statement. \n\nSo in that case, to get two-thirds (probability ~0.666), we need the exponent to be ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.405, so the exponent is -0.405 = - (30/(average distance)), so average distance must be 30 / (0.405) \u2248 74 meters. \n\nWait, but average distance is gamma * c * tau. \n\nIf when gamma is 20, average distance is 30 m, then gamma' must satisfy gamma' * c tau = 2*30 m = 60 m? \n\nWait no, let me think again. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the average distance when gamma is 20 is 30 m, then:\n\naverage distance = gamma * c * tau = 30 m \n\nSo gamma' * c * tau = desired average distance. \n\nThe probability is exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) ) \n\nWe want that probability to be 2/3. \n\nSo set exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) ) = 2/3 \n\nTake natural log: \n\n-30/(gamma' c tau) = ln(2/3) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n30/(gamma' c tau) = - ln(2/3) \n\n=> gamma' = 30/( (c tau) * (-ln(2/3)) )\n\nBut from the original condition when gamma=20 gives average distance 30 = 20*(c tau), so c tau = 30/(20) = 1.5 meters. \n\nWait, so c tau = 1.5 m. \n\nWait, but c is the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s, so tau would be extremely small. \n\nWait, but in this approach, if average distance = gamma * c * tau = 30 m when gamma is 20, then c tau is 1.5 m. \n\nTherefore, substituting into gamma':\n\ngamma' = 30/( (1.5 m) * (-ln(2/3)) )\n\nWait, let's compute this:\n\nFirst, compute -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055 \n\nSo gamma' = 30/( 1.5 * 0.4055 ) \n\nCalculate denominator: 1.5 * 0.4055 \u2248 0.60825 \n\nThus, 30 / 0.60825 \u2248 49.3 \n\nHmm, that's about 49.3, which is close to 50. But the options don't have that. Wait, but this approach is conflicting with the previous one. \n\nWait, so this method gives ~49.3, but the previous method gave ~54. \n\nHmm, so where's the discrepancy? \n\nAh, perhaps I mixed up the formula. \n\nWait, in this second approach, the probability is exp(-d/(average distance)). \n\nIf the average distance is 30 m when gamma=20, then the probability is exp(-1) \u2248 0.367 (so 1/3 is approximately correct). \n\nTo get a probability of 2/3, we need exp(-d/(avg_dist)) = 2/3 \n\nSo solving for avg_dist: \n\nexp(-30/avg_dist) = 2/3 \n\nTake ln both sides:\n\n-30/avg_dist = ln(2/3) \n\n=> avg_dist = -30 / ln(2/3) \n\nln(2/3) is negative, so avg_dist = 30 / ( -ln(2/3) )\n\nCompute that:\n\n- ln(2/3) is ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055 \n\nThus, avg_dist \u2248 30 /0.4055 \u2248 74 meters. \n\nSo average distance needs to be 74 m. \n\nSince average distance is gamma * c * tau, and since when gamma is 20, average is 30 m, then c * tau = 30/20 = 1.5 m. \n\nThus, gamma' * (1.5 m) = 74 m \n\nSo gamma' = 74 /1.5 \u224849.33. \n\nHmm, that's a different answer. So which approach is correct?\n\nWait, the problem arises from different interpretations of the relation between gamma and the average distance. \n\nThe first approach uses the exponential probability formula, which is correct because the lifetime is gamma * tau, and the distance is speed * time. \n\nThe second approach assumes that average distance is gamma * c * tau, but that's actually the same as the first approach. \n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nThe average distance traveled by the particle is indeed the expectation value of the distance, which for an exponential distribution with mean lifetime gamma*tau, and speed v =c, the average distance is v * (gamma tau). \n\nSo average distance is gamma c tau. \n\nThus, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20 c tau. \n\nThe problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector. Wait, but the average distance being 30 m (when gamma=20) would mean that the average distance is 20 c tau = 30. \n\nThus, c tau = 30/(20) = 1.5 m. \n\nThe probability that a particle travels more than 30 m is exp(-30/(average distance)). Wait, no, the average distance is the mean of the exponential distribution. The probability that the distance is greater than D is exp(-D/(mean)). \n\nThus, when the average distance is 30 m (gamma=20), then the probability to travel more than 30 m is exp(-30/30) = exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is ~1/3. That matches the problem's statement. \n\nTherefore, to have the probability be 2/3, we need exp(-D/mean) = 2/3. \n\nHere, D is still 30 m, so:\n\nexp(-30/mean) = 2/3 \u2192 mean = -30 / ln(2/3) \u2248 30 /0.4055 \u224874 m. \n\nThus, the average distance must be 74 m. \n\nThe average distance is gamma * c * tau = gamma * (1.5 m). \n\nTherefore, gamma = 74 /1.5 \u224849.33. \n\nHmm, so that's about 49.3, which is close to 50. But the options don't have that. Wait, but the options are 54, 68,40,28. \n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy between the two approaches. \n\nWait, in the first approach, the answer was 54, in the second approach (using the average distance and the probability formula) it's ~49.3. \n\nWait, why the difference? \n\nWait, let me re-examine the first approach's calculation. \n\nThe first approach was:\n\ngamma' = 20 * ( ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) )\n\nln(1/3) is about -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) is about -0.4055 \n\nSo the ratio is ( -1.0986 ) / ( -0.4055 ) = 2.709 \n\nThus, 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18 \n\nBut in the second approach, the ratio is (74 m)/(30 m) = 2.466..., so the gamma ratio is 2.466, so 20 * 2.466 \u224849.3. \n\nAh, so the discrepancy comes from different interpretations of the equations. \n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I set up the equations correctly but made a mistake in the ratio. \n\nWait, let me re-derive the first approach with the correct variables. \n\nLet me use variables more carefully. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let \u03c4 be the proper lifetime. \n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4. \n\nThe time needed to reach the detector is t_required = distance / speed = 30 m / c. \n\nThe probability that the particle\u2019s lifetime exceeds this time is:\n\nP = exp(- t_required / (\u03b3\u03c4) )\n\nBecause the decay time is exponential with mean \u03b3\u03c4. \n\nSo substituting t_required:\n\nP = exp( - (30/c) / (\u03b3\u03c4) ) \n\nWe can write this as P = exp( -30/(c \u03b3 \u03c4) ) \n\nNow, let\u2019s call the term c\u03c4 as a constant. Let\u2019s let\u2019s denote K = c\u03c4. \n\nThus, P = exp( -30/(\u03b3 K) ) \n\nWhen \u03b3 =20, P=1/3. \n\nSo 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 K)) \u2192 take ln:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 K) \u2192 rearranged: \n\nK = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nSimilarly, when P=2/3, we have:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(\u03b3' K) \n\nSolve for \u03b3':\n\n\u03b3' = -30/( K * ln(2/3) )\n\nSubstitute K from above:\n\n\u03b3' = -30 / [ ( -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ) * ln(2/3) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe numerator is -30 \n\nThe denominator is [ -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ) * ln(2/3) ]\n\nThus,\n\n\u03b3' = [ -30 ] / [ ( -30 * ln(2/3) ) / (20 * ln(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nThe negatives cancel. \n\nThe 30 cancels:\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSo that gives 54. \n\nBut in the second approach, where average distance is gamma * K (since K = c\u03c4), then average distance is gamma * K. \n\nThus, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20*K. \n\nBut in the first approach, when gamma is 20, then:\n\nK = c\u03c4 = [ -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ] \n\nWait, substituting K = c\u03c4 from the first approach's equation:\n\nK = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nWait, but in the second approach, when gamma is 20, the average distance is 20*K = 20*(c\u03c4) = 30 m (from the problem statement's implied average distance leading to 1/3 probability). \n\nWait, let me compute K from first approach's equation. \n\nFrom first approach when gamma is 20:\n\nK = c\u03c4 = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nCompute that:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248-1.0986 \n\nSo denominator is 20*(-1.0986) = -21.97 \n\nThus, K = -30 / (-21.97) \u2248 1.366 m \n\nWait, so K = c\u03c4 \u22481.366 meters. \n\nWait, so then average distance when gamma is 20 is 20 * 1.366 \u224827.32 meters. \n\nWait but according to the problem's statement, when gamma is 20, the average distance would lead to 1/3 of particles reaching. \n\nWait but 27.32 meters is less than 30 meters. So the probability would be exp(-30/(27.32)) \u2248exp(-1.098) \u2248 0.333, which is 1/3. \n\nAh, okay, so average distance is 27.32 m, but the required distance is 30 m. \n\nSo when the average distance is 27.32 m (gamma=20), the probability is exp(-30/27.32) = exp(-1.098) \u2248 0.333. \n\nSo to get the probability to be 2/3, we need exp(-30/(gamma' * K)) = 2/3 \n\nSolve for gamma':\n\n-30/(gamma' * K) = ln(2/3) \n\ngamma' = -30/( K * ln(2/3) )\n\nSubstituting K=1.366 m:\n\ngamma' = -30/(1.366 * (-0.4055)) \n\nCalculate denominator: 1.366 *0.4055 \u22480.554 \n\nThus gamma' \u224830/0.554 \u224854.15 \n\nSo that's consistent with the first approach. \n\nThus the second approach had an error in assuming that when gamma=20, the average distance was 30 m. But actually, it's 20*K where K=1.366 m, which is 27.32 m, not 30. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the first one, leading to 54. So the correct answer is A)54. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required so that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls instead of one-third. The problem states that currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, one third make it. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that ultra-relativistic particles have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation from special relativity. The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is gamma here. The key idea is that the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is \u03b3 times the proper lifetime (\u03c4). So the particles are moving at such high speeds that their decay time is extended, allowing them to travel further before decaying.\n\nThe particles are produced at the center and need to reach the walls. The distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The number that reach the detector depends on how far they can travel before decaying. \n\nLet me think: The average distance a particle travels before decaying (in the lab frame) is the product of its speed and its lifetime. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c. So the distance would be roughly \u03b3 * (c * \u03c4). The proper lifetime \u03c4 is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime \u03c4 is the time it takes to decay in its own rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4, so the distance would be v * \u03b3\u03c4. But for ultra-relativistic particles, v \u2248 c, so that's \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nThe particles need to travel 30 meters. The fraction that reaches the detector would be the fraction of particles whose lifetime in the lab frame is long enough so that they can cover that distance. \n\nAssuming the decay happens randomly, maybe the average distance they travel is the key. The average distance would be the average of v times the lifetime. Since the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4, and v is near c, the average distance is \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nSo the fraction that reaches the detector would depend on how this average distance compares to 30 meters. If the average distance is equal to 30 meters, then on average, half would reach? Wait, maybe the problem is using an average here. Let me see.\n\nWait the problem states that currently, with \u03b3=20, one third reach the detector. So perhaps the average distance traveled is such that when \u03b3 is 20, the average distance is 30 meters multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe the fraction is calculated as (distance traveled)/(radius) when it's greater than or equal to the radius. But perhaps the probability is proportional to the average distance divided by the radius? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number that reach the detector is proportional to the average distance divided by the radius. Let me think again. Let me model this properly. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nThe proper lifetime is \u03c4. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4. The particle's speed is v \u2248 c. The maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is v * t, where t is the lab lifetime. \n\nThe probability that a particle reaches the detector is the probability that its lifetime is at least the time it takes to reach the detector. The time to reach the detector is d / v, where d is the radius (30 m). \n\nSo the condition is: t \u2265 d/(v). \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is t = \u03b3\u03c4. The decay process is exponential, so the probability that the lifetime is greater than some time T is exp(-T/\u03c4'). Wait, actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle lives longer than time T is P(T) = exp(-T/(\u03c4')), where \u03c4' is the mean lifetime in that frame. \n\nWait, in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4. So the probability that the particle's lifetime exceeds the required time (d/v) is exp(- (d/(v)) / (\u03b3\u03c4) ). Because the mean lifetime in the lab is \u03b3\u03c4, so the decay constant is 1/(\u03b3\u03c4). \n\nSo the probability P that the particle reaches the detector is exp(-d/(v \u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nAlternatively, since v is approximately c (since ultra-relativistic), so substituting v = c, then:\n\nP = exp(-d/(c \u03b3 \u03c4)) \n\nThe problem states that when \u03b3=20, this probability is 1/3. \n\nWe need to find \u03b3' such that P becomes 2/3. \n\nSo setting up equations:\n\nFor \u03b3=20: exp(-30/(c * 20 * \u03c4)) = 1/3 \n\nFor \u03b3'=?: exp(-30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4)) = 2/3 \n\nWe need to solve for \u03b3' given that. \n\nLet me take natural logarithm on both sides of the first equation:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4) \n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4) \n\nLet me denote the denominator terms. Let me call the first equation's right side as A = -30/(c *20 * \u03c4), so ln(1/3)=A. \n\nThe second equation's right side is B = -30/(c *\u03b3' * \u03c4) = ln(2/3). \n\nWe can take the ratio of the two equations. Let's see:\n\nLet me write the two equations:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4) \n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4) \n\nLet me divide the second equation by the first equation (equation2 / equation1):\n\n[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = [ -30/(c \u03b3' \u03c4) ] / [ -30/(c 20 \u03c4) ) ]\n\nSimplify the right side: ( (1/(\u03b3')) ) / ( (1/(20)) ) = 20/(\u03b3') \n\nThe left side is ln(2/3)/ln(1/3). Let me compute that numerically. \n\nln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 - 1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nln(1/3) = -ln(3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nSo the ratio is (-0.4055)/(-1.0986) \u2248 0.369 \n\nSo 0.369 \u2248 20/(\u03b3') \u2192 \u03b3' \u2248 20 / 0.369 \u2248 54.2 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 54.2, which would be option A) 54. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nThe key idea is that the probability is exp(-d/(v \u03b3 \u03c4)). Since v is c, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime. \n\nWait, but perhaps the speed isn't exactly c? But for ultra-relativistic particles, we can approximate v \u2248 c. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is 30 meters. The time needed to reach the detector is t_required = 30 m / v. \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4. The probability that the particle lives longer than t_required is exp( - t_required / (\u03b3 \u03c4) ), since the mean lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4. \n\nWait, wait, the decay constant in the lab frame is 1/(\u03b3 \u03c4), so the probability that it lives longer than time T is exp(- T/(\u03b3 \u03c4)). \n\nSo in that case, T here is the time required to reach the detector, which is (30 m)/v. \n\nThus, substituting:\n\nProbability P = exp( - (30/(v)) / (\u03b3 \u03c4) )\n\nBut since v \u2248 c, that's exp( -30/(c \u03b3 \u03c4) )\n\nSo that's what I had before. \n\nSo when \u03b3 is 20, P is 1/3. \n\nSo taking the equations:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * \u03c4 )\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * \u03b3' * \u03c4 )\n\nLet me solve for \u03b3'. Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for (30/(c * \u03c4 )):\n\n30/(c * \u03c4 ) = ( - ln(1/3) ) * 20 \n\nBecause from first equation: \n\nln(1/3) = - (30/(c*20*\u03c4 )) \n\nMultiply both sides by -20/(30/(c*\u03c4)), but perhaps better to express as:\n\nLet me denote K = 30/(c * \u03c4). \n\nThen the first equation: ln(1/3) = - K/(20) \n\nSo K = -20 * ln(1/3) \n\nThe second equation: ln(2/3) = - K/(\u03b3') \n\nSo substituting K from first equation into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - [ -20 * ln(1/3) ] / \u03b3'\n\nThus,\n\nln(2/3) = (20 * ln(1/3)) / \u03b3'\n\nSolving for \u03b3':\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)\n\nWait, but ln(1/3) is negative, and ln(2/3) is also negative. So the negatives will cancel. \n\nCalculating the values:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nThus,\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * (-1.0986) / (-0.4055) \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) \u2248 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18 \n\nSo that's approximately 54.18, which rounds to 54. So the answer would be option A. \n\nWait, but the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28. So 54 is an option. But let me check my calculation again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the division:\n\n1.0986 divided by 0.4055. Let me compute that:\n\n0.4055 \u00d7 2.7 = 1.095, which is close to 1.0986. So 1.0986 /0.4055 \u2248 2.709. \n\nYes, so 20 times that is 54.18. So the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the average distance traveled is \u03b3 c \u03c4. The particles need to go 30 meters. The fraction that reaches is the fraction of particles where their lifetime allows them to go at least 30 m. \n\nWait, but maybe the average distance is \u03b3 c \u03c4, and the required distance is 30 m. So if the average is 30, then maybe the fraction is 1/e? Wait, but the problem states that when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach: The average distance traveled is \u03b3 c \u03c4. If the average distance is equal to the radius, then the fraction that reaches would be something. But perhaps the fraction is related to the ratio of the required distance to the average distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is (distance)/(average distance) if it's a linear relationship, but that might not be the case. The exponential distribution's mean is \u03b3 c \u03c4, but the probability that the distance traveled is greater than 30 is exp(-30/(\u03b3 c \u03c4)), which is what I had before. \n\nSo that approach seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the mean free path. The mean free path (average distance) is \u03b3 c \u03c4. So if the average distance is three times the radius, then the fraction that can reach would be higher? Wait, the probability that the distance is greater than 30 is exp(-30/(mean distance)). \n\nSo if the average distance (mean) is \u03bc = \u03b3 c \u03c4. \n\nThen P( distance > 30 ) = exp(-30 / \u03bc )\n\nSo when gamma is 20, \u03bc = 20 c \u03c4. \n\nSo P = exp( -30/(20 c \u03c4 ) ). Wait, but in that case, the problem says that when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. \n\nWait, but in my previous equations, I considered the mean distance as gamma c tau, so substituting into the probability:\n\nP = exp( -d / (mean distance) ) \n\nSo when gamma is 20, P = exp( -30/(20 c tau * (c tau ?) Wait, no, the mean distance is gamma c tau, so substituting into the equation, P = exp( -30/(gamma c tau) ), which is the same as before. \n\nSo the equations are correct. \n\nThus, the calculation leading to gamma' \u224854 is correct, so the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the distance is 30 meters, so the required time is t_required = 30 / v. \n\nThe lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau. The probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t_required is exp( - (t_required) / (gamma tau) ). \n\nWait, because the decay probability is exponential with mean lifetime gamma tau. \n\nSo the probability is P = exp( - (30/(v)) / (gamma tau) )\n\nSince v is approximately c, then substituting:\n\nP = exp( - (30/(c gamma tau)) )\n\nWait, so the exponent is -30/(c gamma tau). \n\nWait, so when gamma is 20, then exponent is -30/(c *20 * tau). Let's call the denominator term (c * tau) as a constant. Let me call that term K. \n\nWait, but in the equations, the exponent is - (30/(c gamma tau)) = - (30/(gamma)) / (c tau) \n\nWait, but in the problem, the proper lifetime tau is a constant, right? Because the particles are the same type. So tau is fixed. \n\nTherefore, the exponent is proportional to 1/gamma. \n\nSo if when gamma is 20, the exponent is X, then when gamma is gamma', the exponent is X * (20/gamma'). \n\nWait, let me see. Let me denote the exponent for gamma=20 as E1 = -30/(c*20*tau) \n\nThe probability is exp(E1) = 1/3 \n\nFor gamma', E2 = -30/(c*gamma'*tau) \n\nWe want exp(E2) = 2/3 \n\nSo, E2 = ln(2/3) \n\nE1 = ln(1/3) \n\nTherefore, the ratio E2 / E1 = [ -30/(c gamma' tau) ] / [ -30/(c 20 tau) ) ] = (20/gamma') \n\nBut also, E2/E1 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) \n\nThus, 20/gamma' = [ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)] \n\nWait, wait, no, let me do the ratio again:\n\nE2 / E1 = [ (-30/(c gamma' tau)) ] / [ (-30/(c 20 tau) ) ] \n\nThe negatives cancel, 30 cancels, c and tau cancel. So (20)/(gamma') \n\nSo that ratio is 20/gamma'. \n\nThe other ratio is E2/E1 = ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) \n\nWait, but E2 is ln(2/3) and E1 is ln(1/3), so the ratio of E2 to E1 is [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nWait, no. Wait, E1 is ln(1/3) = the exponent when gamma is 20. \n\nWait, no, E1 is the exponent value, which is equal to ln(P1) where P1 is 1/3. Wait, no, actually, E1 is the exponent such that exp(E1) = 1/3. So E1 = ln(1/3). \n\nSimilarly, E2 = ln(2/3). \n\nThus, the ratio (E2)/(E1) = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nBut from the first ratio: (E2)/(E1) = (20 / gamma') \n\nWait, no, the first ratio is E2/E1 = (20/gamma') \n\nWait, let me re-arrange:\n\nThe first ratio (from the expressions of E2 and E1) is E2 / E1 = (20 / gamma') \n\nThe second ratio (from the values of E2 and E1) is E2/E1 = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nSetting them equal:\n\n20/gamma' = [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nTherefore, gamma' = 20 * [ln(1/3)/ln(2/3)] \n\nAh! Wait a second! Here's a mistake I made earlier. \n\nWait, in the previous step, when I set up the equation:\n\nE2/E1 = (20/gamma') \n\nBut E2 is equal to ln(2/3), and E1 is ln(1/3). \n\nWait, no, the exponent E1 is equal to the value that gives exp(E1) = P1, so E1 = ln(P1) = ln(1/3). \n\nSimilarly, E2 = ln(P2) = ln(2/3). \n\nThus, the ratio (E2)/(E1) is [ln(2/3)]/[ln(1/3)] \n\nBut from the other side, the ratio (E2)/(E1) is (20/gamma'). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the first ratio (from the expressions of E2 and E1 in terms of gamma) is:\n\nE2 = ( -30/(c gamma' tau) )\n\nE1 = ( -30/(c 20 tau) )\n\nThus, E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nSo E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nTherefore, rearranged: gamma' = 20 * (E1 / E2) \n\nWait, substituting E2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nE2 = (20/gamma') * E1 \n\nSo solving for gamma': \n\ngamma' = 20 * (E1 / E2) \n\nBut E1 is ln(1/3), E2 is ln(2/3). \n\nSo gamma' = 20 * ( ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) )\n\nAh! Here's the error. Previously I had gamma' = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) \n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation I had written:\n\ngamma' = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3). Wait, but let me compute this correctly. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate with the correct formula. \n\ngamma' = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))\n\nCompute the values:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055 \n\nThus, the ratio is (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) \u2248 2.709 \n\nSo gamma' = 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18, same as before. \n\nWait, so that still gives the same answer. So the initial calculation was correct. \n\nHmm, so why the confusion? Because in the earlier steps I thought perhaps there was a miscalculation, but the result still comes to 54. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but let me see the options again. Option A is 54, which matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the average distance. Suppose that the average distance is gamma * c * tau. Then when gamma is 20, the average distance is 20 * c * tau. \n\nThe fraction that reaches the detector might be the fraction of the average distance over the radius? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. The average distance is the mean of the exponential distribution. The probability that the particle travels more than 30 meters is exp(-30/(average distance)), since average distance is the mean. \n\nSo if the average distance is 20 * c * tau, then the probability is exp(-30/(20 c tau)). \n\nWait, but if the average distance is 20 c tau, then the exponent is 30/(average distance) = 30/(20 c tau). \n\nWait, so that term is (30/(average distance)). \n\nSo in the problem, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20 c tau. \n\nThe probability to reach 30 m is exp(-30/(20 c tau)). \n\nWait, but in this case, if the average distance was equal to 30 meters, then the probability would be exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is about 1/3. \n\nAh! Wait, that's interesting. \n\nSuppose that when gamma is 20, the average distance is 30 meters. Then the probability would be exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is approximately 1/3. \n\nSo that matches the problem's statement. \n\nSo in that case, to get two-thirds (probability ~0.666), we need the exponent to be ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.405, so the exponent is -0.405 = - (30/(average distance)), so average distance must be 30 / (0.405) \u2248 74 meters. \n\nWait, but average distance is gamma * c * tau. \n\nIf when gamma is 20, average distance is 30 m, then gamma' must satisfy gamma' * c tau = 2*30 m = 60 m? \n\nWait no, let me think again. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the average distance when gamma is 20 is 30 m, then:\n\naverage distance = gamma * c * tau = 30 m \n\nSo gamma' * c * tau = desired average distance. \n\nThe probability is exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) ) \n\nWe want that probability to be 2/3. \n\nSo set exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) ) = 2/3 \n\nTake natural log: \n\n-30/(gamma' c tau) = ln(2/3) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n30/(gamma' c tau) = - ln(2/3) \n\n=> gamma' = 30/( (c tau) * (-ln(2/3)) )\n\nBut from the original condition when gamma=20 gives average distance 30 = 20*(c tau), so c tau = 30/(20) = 1.5 meters. \n\nWait, so c tau = 1.5 m. \n\nWait, but c is the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s, so tau would be extremely small. \n\nWait, but in this approach, if average distance = gamma * c * tau = 30 m when gamma is 20, then c tau is 1.5 m. \n\nTherefore, substituting into gamma':\n\ngamma' = 30/( (1.5 m) * (-ln(2/3)) )\n\nWait, let's compute this:\n\nFirst, compute -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055 \n\nSo gamma' = 30/( 1.5 * 0.4055 ) \n\nCalculate denominator: 1.5 * 0.4055 \u2248 0.60825 \n\nThus, 30 / 0.60825 \u2248 49.3 \n\nHmm, that's about 49.3, which is close to 50. But the options don't have that. Wait, but this approach is conflicting with the previous one. \n\nWait, so this method gives ~49.3, but the previous method gave ~54. \n\nHmm, so where's the discrepancy? \n\nAh, perhaps I mixed up the formula. \n\nWait, in this second approach, the probability is exp(-d/(average distance)). \n\nIf the average distance is 30 m when gamma=20, then the probability is exp(-1) \u2248 0.367 (so 1/3 is approximately correct). \n\nTo get a probability of 2/3, we need exp(-d/(avg_dist)) = 2/3 \n\nSo solving for avg_dist: \n\nexp(-30/avg_dist) = 2/3 \n\nTake ln both sides:\n\n-30/avg_dist = ln(2/3) \n\n=> avg_dist = -30 / ln(2/3) \n\nln(2/3) is negative, so avg_dist = 30 / ( -ln(2/3) )\n\nCompute that:\n\n- ln(2/3) is ln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055 \n\nThus, avg_dist \u2248 30 /0.4055 \u2248 74 meters. \n\nSo average distance needs to be 74 m. \n\nSince average distance is gamma * c * tau, and since when gamma is 20, average is 30 m, then c * tau = 30/20 = 1.5 m. \n\nThus, gamma' * (1.5 m) = 74 m \n\nSo gamma' = 74 /1.5 \u224849.33. \n\nHmm, that's a different answer. So which approach is correct?\n\nWait, the problem arises from different interpretations of the relation between gamma and the average distance. \n\nThe first approach uses the exponential probability formula, which is correct because the lifetime is gamma * tau, and the distance is speed * time. \n\nThe second approach assumes that average distance is gamma * c * tau, but that's actually the same as the first approach. \n\nWait, let me clarify. \n\nThe average distance traveled by the particle is indeed the expectation value of the distance, which for an exponential distribution with mean lifetime gamma*tau, and speed v =c, the average distance is v * (gamma tau). \n\nSo average distance is gamma c tau. \n\nThus, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20 c tau. \n\nThe problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector. Wait, but the average distance being 30 m (when gamma=20) would mean that the average distance is 20 c tau = 30. \n\nThus, c tau = 30/(20) = 1.5 m. \n\nThe probability that a particle travels more than 30 m is exp(-30/(average distance)). Wait, no, the average distance is the mean of the exponential distribution. The probability that the distance is greater than D is exp(-D/(mean)). \n\nThus, when the average distance is 30 m (gamma=20), then the probability to travel more than 30 m is exp(-30/30) = exp(-1) \u2248 0.367, which is ~1/3. That matches the problem's statement. \n\nTherefore, to have the probability be 2/3, we need exp(-D/mean) = 2/3. \n\nHere, D is still 30 m, so:\n\nexp(-30/mean) = 2/3 \u2192 mean = -30 / ln(2/3) \u2248 30 /0.4055 \u224874 m. \n\nThus, the average distance must be 74 m. \n\nThe average distance is gamma * c * tau = gamma * (1.5 m). \n\nTherefore, gamma = 74 /1.5 \u224849.33. \n\nHmm, so that's about 49.3, which is close to 50. But the options don't have that. Wait, but the options are 54, 68,40,28. \n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy between the two approaches. \n\nWait, in the first approach, the answer was 54, in the second approach (using the average distance and the probability formula) it's ~49.3. \n\nWait, why the difference? \n\nWait, let me re-examine the first approach's calculation. \n\nThe first approach was:\n\ngamma' = 20 * ( ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) )\n\nln(1/3) is about -1.0986 \n\nln(2/3) is about -0.4055 \n\nSo the ratio is ( -1.0986 ) / ( -0.4055 ) = 2.709 \n\nThus, 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18 \n\nBut in the second approach, the ratio is (74 m)/(30 m) = 2.466..., so the gamma ratio is 2.466, so 20 * 2.466 \u224849.3. \n\nAh, so the discrepancy comes from different interpretations of the equations. \n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I set up the equations correctly but made a mistake in the ratio. \n\nWait, let me re-derive the first approach with the correct variables. \n\nLet me use variables more carefully. \n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let \u03c4 be the proper lifetime. \n\nIn the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4. \n\nThe time needed to reach the detector is t_required = distance / speed = 30 m / c. \n\nThe probability that the particle\u2019s lifetime exceeds this time is:\n\nP = exp(- t_required / (\u03b3\u03c4) )\n\nBecause the decay time is exponential with mean \u03b3\u03c4. \n\nSo substituting t_required:\n\nP = exp( - (30/c) / (\u03b3\u03c4) ) \n\nWe can write this as P = exp( -30/(c \u03b3 \u03c4) ) \n\nNow, let\u2019s call the term c\u03c4 as a constant. Let\u2019s let\u2019s denote K = c\u03c4. \n\nThus, P = exp( -30/(\u03b3 K) ) \n\nWhen \u03b3 =20, P=1/3. \n\nSo 1/3 = exp(-30/(20 K)) \u2192 take ln:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(20 K) \u2192 rearranged: \n\nK = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nSimilarly, when P=2/3, we have:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(\u03b3' K) \n\nSolve for \u03b3':\n\n\u03b3' = -30/( K * ln(2/3) )\n\nSubstitute K from above:\n\n\u03b3' = -30 / [ ( -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ) * ln(2/3) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe numerator is -30 \n\nThe denominator is [ -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ) * ln(2/3) ]\n\nThus,\n\n\u03b3' = [ -30 ] / [ ( -30 * ln(2/3) ) / (20 * ln(1/3) ) ) ]\n\nThe negatives cancel. \n\nThe 30 cancels:\n\n\u03b3' = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSo that gives 54. \n\nBut in the second approach, where average distance is gamma * K (since K = c\u03c4), then average distance is gamma * K. \n\nThus, when gamma is 20, average distance is 20*K. \n\nBut in the first approach, when gamma is 20, then:\n\nK = c\u03c4 = [ -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) ] \n\nWait, substituting K = c\u03c4 from the first approach's equation:\n\nK = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nWait, but in the second approach, when gamma is 20, the average distance is 20*K = 20*(c\u03c4) = 30 m (from the problem statement's implied average distance leading to 1/3 probability). \n\nWait, let me compute K from first approach's equation. \n\nFrom first approach when gamma is 20:\n\nK = c\u03c4 = -30/(20 * ln(1/3)) \n\nCompute that:\n\nln(1/3) \u2248-1.0986 \n\nSo denominator is 20*(-1.0986) = -21.97 \n\nThus, K = -30 / (-21.97) \u2248 1.366 m \n\nWait, so K = c\u03c4 \u22481.366 meters. \n\nWait, so then average distance when gamma is 20 is 20 * 1.366 \u224827.32 meters. \n\nWait but according to the problem's statement, when gamma is 20, the average distance would lead to 1/3 of particles reaching. \n\nWait but 27.32 meters is less than 30 meters. So the probability would be exp(-30/(27.32)) \u2248exp(-1.098) \u2248 0.333, which is 1/3. \n\nAh, okay, so average distance is 27.32 m, but the required distance is 30 m. \n\nSo when the average distance is 27.32 m (gamma=20), the probability is exp(-30/27.32) = exp(-1.098) \u2248 0.333. \n\nSo to get the probability to be 2/3, we need exp(-30/(gamma' * K)) = 2/3 \n\nSolve for gamma':\n\n-30/(gamma' * K) = ln(2/3) \n\ngamma' = -30/( K * ln(2/3) )\n\nSubstituting K=1.366 m:\n\ngamma' = -30/(1.366 * (-0.4055)) \n\nCalculate denominator: 1.366 *0.4055 \u22480.554 \n\nThus gamma' \u224830/0.554 \u224854.15 \n\nSo that's consistent with the first approach. \n\nThus the second approach had an error in assuming that when gamma=20, the average distance was 30 m. But actually, it's 20*K where K=1.366 m, which is 27.32 m, not 30. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the first one, leading to 54. So the correct answer is A)54. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor (\u03b3') so that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector, we use the exponential decay probability. The probability that a particle reaches the detector is given by \\( P = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{c \\gamma \\tau}\\right) \\), where \\( d = 30 \\) meters, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, and \\( \\tau \\) is the proper lifetime. \n\nGiven that at \\( \\gamma = 20 \\), the probability \\( P = \\frac{1}{3} \\), we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau}\n\\]\nFor the desired probability \\( P = \\frac{2}{3} \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{c \\cdot \\gamma' \\cdot \\tau}\n\\]\nDividing the second equation by the first to eliminate constants:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{20}{\\gamma'}\n\\]\nCalculating the ratio of logarithms:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)} \\approx \\frac{-0.4055}{-1.0986} \\approx 0.369\n\\]\nSolving for \\( \\gamma' \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma' = \\frac{20}{0.369} \\approx 54.2\n\\]\nThe closest option is **54**, corresponding to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
