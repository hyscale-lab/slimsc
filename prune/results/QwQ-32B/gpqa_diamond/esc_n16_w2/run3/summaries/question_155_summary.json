      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty \u0394P_z for the given state. Hmm, the uncertainty is calculated using the formula sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2), right? Let me start by recalling that.\n\nThe state vector is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2]. Let me write that down properly. Let me denote this state as |\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nFirst, I need to compute the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9. Since P_z is a diagonal matrix, its expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the square of the corresponding components of the state vector. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the expectation value is \u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, that should be straightforward.\n\nThe matrix for P_z is given as:\nFirst row: (\u0127, 0, 0),\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0),\nThird row: (0,0,-\u0127).\n\nSo the diagonal entries are \u0127, 0, -\u0127. \n\nSo let me compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. The state vector is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] as a column. So the components are \u03c8\u2081 = -1/2, \u03c8\u2082 = 1/\u221a2, \u03c8\u2083 = -1/2.\n\nThe expectation value is:\n\n\u03c8\u2081*(P_z)\u2081\u2081 \u03c8\u2081 + \u03c8\u2082*(P_z)\u2082\u2082 \u03c8\u2082 + \u03c8\u2083*(P_z)\u2083\u2083 \u03c8\u2083 \n\nWait, but since P_z is diagonal, it's just the sum of each component squared times the corresponding diagonal element.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9 = (\u03c8\u2081* , \u03c8\u2082*, \u03c8\u2083*) * P_z matrix * (\u03c8\u2081, \u03c8\u2082, \u03c8\u2083)^T.\n\nSince the matrix is diagonal, this becomes:\n\n\u03c8\u2081* (P_z)\u2081\u2081 \u03c8\u2081 + \u03c8\u2082* (P_z)\u2082\u2082 \u03c8\u2082 + \u03c8\u2083* (P_z)\u2083\u2083 \u03c8\u2083.\n\nSince the components here are real numbers (the state vector given has real entries), the complex conjugate doesn't change anything. So:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (-1/2)^2 * \u0127 + (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-\u0127)\n\nWait, let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (\u03c8\u2081)^2 * (P_z)\u2081\u2081 \u2192 (-1/2)^2 * \u0127 = (1/4) * \u0127.\n\nSecond term: (\u03c8\u2082)^2 * (P_z)\u2082\u2082 \u2192 (1/2) * 0 = 0. Because (1/\u221a2)^2 is 1/2.\n\nThird term: (\u03c8\u2083)^2 * (P_z)\u2083\u2083 \u2192 (-1/2)^2 * (-\u0127) = (1/4)*(-\u0127) = -\u0127/4.\n\nAdding them up: (1/4 \u0127) + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) = 0. Wait, that's interesting. The expectation value of P_z here is zero?\n\nHmm, that's unexpected. But let me check again. Let me compute each term again:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by \u0127 \u2192 1/4 \u0127.\n\nThird term: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by -\u0127 \u2192 -1/4 \u0127. So yes, 1/4 \u0127 minus 1/4 \u0127 is 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero. \n\nNow I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would be the square of the diagonal elements. So the matrix P_z squared has entries (\u0127)^2, 0, (-\u0127)^2. So the diagonal entries are \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is:\n\n\u03c8\u2081\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + \u03c8\u2082\u00b2*(0) + \u03c8\u2083\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2).\n\nAgain, substituting the values:\n\nFirst term: (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2,\n\nThird term: (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2,\n\nSecond term is zero.\n\nSo total \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4 + 1/4)\u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nThen the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. Therefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nWait, but let me double-check everything again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, the problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, and the given vector is the explicit form. Let me confirm if the given vector is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. Because if it's not, then maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nThe matrix for P_x is given with first row (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0), second row (\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2), third row (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0). \n\nLet me apply P_x to the given state vector [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] and see if it gives -\u0127 times the vector.\n\nCalculating P_x |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nFirst component: (0)(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) \n\n= (\u0127/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = \u0127/(2)\n\nSecond component: (\u0127/\u221a2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(-1/2)\n\n= ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) ) = - \u0127/(\u221a2 )\n\nThird component: 0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) +0*(-1/2)\n\n= same as first component: \u0127/(2)\n\nSo the result of P_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n[ \u0127/2, - \u0127/\u221a2, \u0127/2 ] \n\nNow, if this is supposed to be equal to -\u0127 times the original vector, let's see:\n\n-\u0127 * [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] = [ \u0127/2, - \u0127/\u221a2, \u0127/2 ]\n\nWhich matches exactly. So yes, the given vector is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculations for \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 are okay. \n\nSo the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = (\u0127)/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B. \n\nWait, but let me check once more the calculations for \u27e8P_z\u27e9 and \u27e8P_z squared\u27e9. \n\nThe state vector components are (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). \n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 is:\n\nFirst component squared times \u0127: ( (-1/2)^2 )*\u0127 = (1/4)\u0127,\n\nSecond component squared times 0: ( (1/\u221a2)^2 )*0 = 0,\n\nThird component squared times (-\u0127): ( (-1/2)^2 )*(-\u0127) = (1/4)(-\u0127) = -\u0127/4,\n\nAdding them: 1/4 \u0127 - 1/4 \u0127 = 0. Correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z squared\u27e9:\n\nFirst component squared times (\u0127)^2: (1/4)\u0127\u00b2,\n\nThird component squared times (-\u0127)^2 = (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2),\n\nSecond term 0.\n\nTotal: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nUncertainty is sqrt( (1/2)\u0127\u00b2 - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) \u0127 = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So option B. \n\nHmm, but wait, the options have B as \\hbar / \\sqrt{2}, which matches. So yes, that's the answer. \n\nI don't see any mistake here. Let me think if there's another approach. Maybe someone might confuse the components, but since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix representations are already in that basis, so the calculations are correct. \n\nAnother possible confusion: sometimes, when dealing with angular momentum, the operators might have different conventions, but here the problem gives explicit matrices, so we should use them as given. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n",

Let me compute each term again:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by \u0127 \u2192 1/4 \u0127.\n\nThird term: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, multiplied by -\u0127 \u2192 -1/4 \u0127.

Maybe someone might confuse the components, but since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix representations are already in that basis, so the calculations are correct. \n\nAnother possible confusion: sometimes, when dealing with angular momentum, the operators might have different conventions, but here the problem gives explicit matrices, so we should use them as given. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n\nTo find the uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\), we use the formula \\(\\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}\\).\n\nThe given state vector is \\(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Compute \\(\\langle P_z \\rangle\\)**  \nThe \\(P_z\\) matrix is diagonal with entries \\(\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar\\).  \n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\hbar + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot 0 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 (-\\hbar) \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\hbar + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\hbar = 0.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Compute \\(\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle\\)**  \nThe \\(P_z^2\\) matrix has diagonal entries \\(\\hbar^2, 0, \\hbar^2\\).  \n\\[\n\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\hbar^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot 0 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\hbar^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\hbar^2 + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\hbar^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(\\Delta P_z\\)**  \n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar^2 - 0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThe uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\) is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty \u0394P_z for a system in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, right. The uncertainty is calculated using the formula \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). So I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and then the expectation value of P_z squared, then subtract the square of the first from the second, take the square root.\n\nFirst, let me recall the state vector given. The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, and the explicit form is the column vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me write that as a ket vector: |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. Since it's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, that might help in some way, but maybe not directly here because we're dealing with P_z.\n\nThe basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The matrix for P_z is given as:\n\nFirst row (\u0127, 0, 0),\nSecond row (0,0,0),\nThird row (0,0,-\u0127).\n\nSo in matrix form, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127 along the diagonal. That makes sense because it's the operator in its own eigenbasis. The eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127. So the basis vectors are the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, which is the expectation value of P_z in the state |\u03c8\u27e9. The expectation value is calculated as \u27e8\u03c8 | P_z | \u03c8\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, this is straightforward. Let me write out the calculation.\n\nLet me denote the components of |\u03c8\u27e9 as \u03c8\u2081 = -1/2, \u03c8\u2082 = 1/\u221a2, \u03c8\u2083 = -1/2. The complex conjugate transpose (bra vector) would be [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] since all components are real here.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over i,j of \u03c8_i*(P_z)_{i,j} \u03c8_j. Since P_z is diagonal, only terms where i = j contribute. So it's:\n\n\u03c8\u2081*(P_z)\u2081\u2081 \u03c8\u2081 + \u03c8\u2082*(P_z)\u2082\u2082 \u03c8\u2082 + \u03c8\u2083*(P_z)\u2083\u2083 \u03c8\u2083.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2) * \u0127 * (-1/2) = (1/4)\u0127\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2) * 0 * (1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2) * (-\u0127) * (-1/2) = (-1/2 * -1/2 is 1/4, multiplied by -\u0127? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, (P_z)\u2083\u2083 is -\u0127, so the third term is (\u03c8\u2083)^2 * (P_z)\u2083\u2083. Wait, actually, \u03c8\u2083 squared times the eigenvalue?\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nEach term is \u03c8_i squared times (P_z eigenvalue for that basis vector). Because since P_z is diagonal, each basis vector |i\u27e9 has eigenvalue (P_z)_{ii}, so when you compute \u27e8\u03c8|P_z|\u03c8\u27e9, it's sum_i (\u03c8_i)^2 (P_z eigenvalue for that component). \n\nYes, so the second term is (1/\u221a2)^2 * 0 = 0. The third term is (-1/2)^2 * (-\u0127). Wait, that's (1/4)*(-\u0127) ?\n\nWait, let me redo:\n\nFirst term: (\u03c8\u2081)^2 * (\u0127) = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * \u0127 = (1/4)\u0127.\n\nSecond term: (\u03c8\u2082)^2 * 0 = 0.\n\nThird term: (\u03c8\u2083)^2 * (-\u0127) = ( (-1/2)^2 )*(-\u0127) = (1/4)*(-\u0127).\n\nSo adding all together: (1/4 \u0127) + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero?\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. The components squared:\n\nFirst component squared is ( -1/2 )\u00b2 = 1/4. Multiply by \u0127 gives 1/4 \u0127.\n\nThird component is squared ( -1/2 )\u00b2 = 1/4, multiplied by (-\u0127) gives -1/4 \u0127. So yes, adding those gives 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero.\n\nNow, moving on to \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. The expectation value of P_z squared is \u27e8\u03c8 | P_z\u00b2 | \u03c8\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal elements. So P_z squared matrix is diagonal with entries (\u0127)^2, 0^2=0, (-\u0127)^2 = \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the calculation for \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 would be:\n\n\u03c8\u2081\u00b2 * (\u0127\u00b2) + \u03c8\u2082\u00b2 * 0 + \u03c8\u2083\u00b2 * (\u0127\u00b2).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2,\n\nThird term: (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2,\n\nSecond term 0.\n\nSo total \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4 + 1/4) \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - (\u27e8P_z\u27e9)^2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - (0)^2 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTaking the square root gives sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nSo the uncertainty \u0394P_z is \u0127 over root 2, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything again to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. \n\nThe state vector components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me confirm that this is a normalized vector. The sum of squares of the components squared:\n\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 +1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. That's good.\n\nThe calculation for \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is indeed zero. So when computing \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, each term for the first and third components contributes (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2 each, so total 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2)\u0127, which is equivalent to \u0127 divided by sqrt(2), so the answer should be B.\n",
