      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X\u2070. The given information includes the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 as 8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds, the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so the answer probably involves calculating the average distance the particle travels before decaying, considering relativistic effects, and then figuring out the required resolution based on that.\n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (the bubble chamber's frame), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So the actual lifetime in the lab frame is longer, which means the particle travels farther before decaying. The problem is about resolving the decay, so the resolution needs to be small enough to detect the track length of the particle before it decays. \n\nWait, but how does the energy come into play here? The energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle in the lab frame. Since the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV, we can compute the Lorentz factor \u03b3. Because in relativity, the total energy E is \u03b3mc\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nLet me note down the given values:\n\n- \u03c4\u2080 = 8e-16 s\n- E (lab frame) = 27 GeV\n- m (X\u2070) = 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (assuming units here, since energy is in GeV and mass is given as 3.41 GeV, so probably in units where c=1, so m would be 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2)\n\nSo \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 Wait, actually, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E and m are given in GeV (assuming that the mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, so when multiplied by c\u00b2, it becomes GeV). So plugging in numbers:\n\n\u03b3 = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 Wait, no, hold on. Let me think in terms of units properly. Let me write m as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. Then m c\u00b2 would be 3.41 GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u2248 27/3.41 \u2248 let me compute that. 3.41*8 is 27.28, so 27 is a bit less than 8. So 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917... approximately 7.92. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.92.\n\nTherefore, the time dilation factor is \u03b3 \u2248 7.92. So the lifetime in the lab frame \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2248 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.92 * 8 = 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nNow, the next step is to find how far the particle travels in that time. To find the distance, we need its velocity. Since we have \u03b3, the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity v. The relation between \u03b3 and v is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Alternatively, we can find the velocity from the energy. \n\nAlternatively, since in relativity, the momentum p is equal to \u03b3 m v. The total energy E is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. Therefore, solving for p:\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. Let me compute that. \n\nE = 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 = 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo (E)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 GeV\u00b2. \n\n27 squared is 729. 3.41 squared is approx 11.6281. So 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719. So sqrt(717.3719) \u2248 let's see, 26.78 squared is 717.368, so sqrt(717.37) is approx 26.78 GeV. Therefore, p \u2248 26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThen, since p = \u03b3 m v, so v = p/(\u03b3 m). Let's compute that. \n\np is 26.78 GeV/c, \u03b3 m is 7.92 * 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2? Wait, units again. Let me think in terms of variables. \n\np = \u03b3 m v \u2192 v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\np/(\u03b3 m) = (26.78 GeV/c) / (7.92 * 3.41 GeV) \n\nThe GeV units cancel, so:\n\n26.78 / (7.92 * 3.41) * 1/c. Wait, but 1/c is in terms of 1/(speed of light). Let me compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst compute denominator: 7.92 *3.41 \u2248 7.92*3 =23.76, 7.92*0.41\u22483.2472 \u2192 total \u224823.76+3.2472\u224827.0072. \n\nSo denominator is approximately 27.0072. \n\nSo 26.78 divided by 27.0072 \u2248 ~0.9916. \n\nTherefore, v \u2248 0.9916 c. \n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9916 times the speed of light. \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the lab frame is d = v * \u03c4. \n\n\u03c4 was 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nSo d = 0.9916 * c * 6.336e-15 s. \n\nWe need to compute this distance. Let's plug in c \u2248 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo 0.9916 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s. \n\nMultiply the numbers:\n\n0.9916 *3 \u2248 2.9748. \n\nThen multiply by 6.336e-15:\n\n2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 let's see, 3 *6.336 is 19.008, subtract 0.0252 *6.336 (since 3 -0.9916 is 0.0084, but maybe better to just compute 2.9748*6.336)\n\nAlternatively, 2.9748 *6 = 17.8488, 2.9748 *0.336\u2248 1.000 (approx). So total is about 18.8488? Wait maybe better exact calculation:\n\n6.336 *2.9748:\n\nLet me compute 6 *2.9748 = 17.8488\n\n0.336 *2.9748: \n\n0.3 *2.9748 = 0.89244\n\n0.036*2.9748 = 0.1070928\n\nAdding those: 0.89244 +0.1070928 \u2248 0.99953\n\nTotal: 17.8488 +0.99953\u2248 18.8483.\n\nSo total is 18.8483e-15 m/s * s \u2192 meters. Wait, the units: the velocity is in m/s, multiplied by seconds, so yes, meters. \n\nSo d \u224818.8483e-15 m? Wait wait, no:\n\nWait, 0.9916 *3e8 m/s = 0.9916 *3e8 \u2248 2.9748e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by 6.336e-15 s gives:\n\n2.9748e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.9748 *6.336) *1e-7 \n\nWait, 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7, yes. \n\nSo 2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 let's compute that again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 2.9748 *6.336:\n\nLet me compute 2.9748 *6 = 17.8488\n\n2.9748 *0.336:\n\n2.9748 *0.3 =0.89244\n\n2.9748 *0.036=0.1070928\n\nAdding: 0.89244+0.1070928=0.9995328\n\nTotal is 17.8488 +0.9995328 =18.8483328\n\nSo total is 18.8483328 *1e-7 meters. \n\nSo 18.848e-7 m is 1.8848e-6 meters. Wait, that's 1.8848 micrometers. Hmm, but the options are in different exponents. Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step. \n\nd = v * \u03c4 \n\nv is 0.9916 c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\n\u03c4 is 6.336e-15 s. \n\nThus:\n\nv = 0.9916 * 3e8 = approx 2.9748e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by \u03c4: 2.9748e8 m/s *6.336e-15 s = 2.9748e8 *6.336e-15 \n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 ~18.848 as before. \n\nMultiply the exponents: 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. \n\nSo total is 18.848 *1e-7 m = 1.8848e-6 meters. \n\nHmm, that's 1.8848 micrometers, so about 1.88e-6 meters. \n\nBut the options are A) 2.08e-6, B) 2.08e-9, C) 2.08e-1, D) 2.08e-3. \n\nHmm, so my calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). But why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating \u03b3. Let me check that again.\n\nGiven E =27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Therefore \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) =27 /3.41 \u2248 7.91787. So that's correct. \n\nThen \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080: 7.91787 *8e-16 = 6.3343e-15 s. Correct. \n\nVelocity calculation: \n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c \u2192 sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) GeV /c. \n\n27 squared is 729, 3.41 squared is ~11.6281. So 729 -11.6281=717.3719. \n\nsqrt(717.3719)=26.78 (as before). \n\np =26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThen v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\n\u03b3 m is 7.91787 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2? Wait, units again. Let me write it as:\n\nv = (p c\u00b2)/(\u03b3 m c\u00b2) ?\n\nWait maybe I should do this differently. Let me recall that v = pc\u00b2/(E). Since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. Then v = (p c\u00b2)/E ?\n\nWait, let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, p = \u03b3 m v. So v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\nYes, that's what I did earlier. \n\nSo p/(\u03b3 m) = (26.78 GeV/c) / (7.91787 *3.41 GeV) \n\nThe GeV cancels, and 1/c remains. \n\nWait, but the units of p is GeV/c, and \u03b3 m is (unitless) * (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2? Wait, m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is GeV. So \u03b3 m has units of (GeV/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, perhaps the units are getting mixed here. Let me think of everything in terms of natural units where c=1. Maybe that's easier. \n\nIn natural units (c=1), E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV, so \u03b3 = E/m = 27/3.41 \u22487.91787. \n\nThen p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt(27\u00b2 - 3.41\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(729 - 11.6281)= sqrt(717.3719) \u224826.78 GeV/c (but in natural units, c=1, so units of p would be GeV, but maybe this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity can be calculated as v = p/E * c. Because in natural units, v is p/E (since p = \u03b3 m v, E = \u03b3 m, so v = p/E). \n\nWait, that's a simpler way. Let me see:\n\nv = (p c) / E * c? Wait, maybe better to think:\n\nIn natural units where c=1, then p is in GeV, E is in GeV. Then v = p/E. \n\nSo in natural units, v = p/E \u224826.78 /27 \u22480.9918. So that's the same as before. So v \u22480.9918 c. \n\nSo that part checks out. So the velocity calculation is correct. \n\nThen the distance is v * \u03c4. \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSo putting all together:\n\nd = v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nBut let me see: \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so d = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nAlternatively, since v = \u03b2 c, where \u03b2 = v/c ~0.9918. \n\nSo d = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this. \n\nAlternatively, the mean proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The average distance traveled is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSo that's exactly what I did. \n\nHmm, so the distance is approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers. The closest option is A (2.08e-6), which is about 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, the difference between 1.88 and 2.08 is about 10%. Maybe I made an approximation error somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check the exact numbers again. \n\nLet me recalculate \u03b3. 27 divided by 3.41: \n\n3.41 \u00d7 7 = 23.87, 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13 /3.41 \u22480.918. So 7.918. So \u03b3=7.918. \n\nThen \u03c4 =7.918\u00d78e-16=6.334e-15 seconds. \n\nv is p/E *c. \n\np= sqrt(E\u00b2 -m\u00b2) = sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2). Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n27 squared is exactly 729. \n\n3.41 squared: 3.41*3.41. Let's calculate that. 3*3=9, 3*0.41=1.23, 0.41*3=1.23, 0.41\u00b2=0.1681. So (3+0.41)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.41 + 0.41\u00b2 =9 +2.46 +0.1681= 11.6281. So yes. \n\n729 -11.6281=717.3719. \n\nSquare root of 717.3719: Let's see, 26^2=676, 27\u00b2=729. 26.78\u00b2: \n\n26.78 squared: 26\u00b2 =676, 0.78\u00b2=0.6084, 2*26*0.78=40.56. So total (26 +0.78)^2 =26\u00b2 + 2*26*0.78 +0.78\u00b2 =676+40.56+0.6084=717.1684. \n\nSo sqrt(717.3719) is a bit higher than 26.78. Let me see: 26.78^2=717.1684. The difference between 717.3719 and that is 0.2035. \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=717.1684 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(2*26.78) \u22480.0187 per unit x. \n\nSo delta x is 0.2035, so delta sqrt(x) \u22480.0187 *0.2035 \u22480.0038. \n\nThus sqrt(717.3719)\u224826.78+0.0038\u224826.7838. \n\nSo p is 26.7838 GeV/c. \n\nSo p/E is 26.7838 /27 \u22480.99199. \n\nThus, v =0.99199c. \n\nSo v is ~0.992c. \n\nSo recalculate d:\n\nv =0.992c, c=3e8 m/s, so v=0.992*3e8\u22482.976e8 m/s. \n\n\u03c4=6.334e-15 s. \n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 *6.334e-15 = \n\nFirst multiply 2.976 *6.334 \u2248 let's do 2.976 *6 =17.856, 2.976*0.334 \u2248 2.976*0.3=0.8928, 2.976*0.034=0.1012. Total for 0.334: 0.8928+0.1012\u22480.994. So total 17.856+0.994\u224818.85. \n\nSo 18.85 *1e8 *1e-15 = 18.85e-7 meters =1.885e-6 meters. \n\nHmm, so still about 1.885e-6 meters. \n\nThe options are A:2.08e-6, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's requirement. The question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". Wait, I assumed that the average distance is what's needed, but maybe it's about the mean free path and the resolution required to capture 30% of the decays? Wait, perhaps I need to consider the decay length distribution. \n\nThe decay length in the lab frame is given by the distribution: the probability that the particle decays between t and t+dt is (1/\u03c4) e^{-t/\u03c4} dt. So the average distance is v\u03c4, which is exactly what I calculated. But perhaps the question is asking for the resolution needed such that the decay is observed, meaning that the track length must be resolved. So the resolution must be smaller than the average decay length? Or perhaps they want the standard deviation? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the minimum resolution so that the detector can distinguish between the decay happening and not happening. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty in the position, and the resolution needed is such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex within a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the proper lifetime and the time dilation, but I might have miscalculated. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, so the average distance is v gamma tau_0, which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not asking for the average distance, but the minimum resolution so that a certain percentage of decays are observed. The lifetime is a decay constant, so the distance traveled would follow an exponential distribution. The probability that a decay occurs within a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)). To have at least 30% of the decays, set 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)) >=0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/(v tau)) <=0.7 \u2192 -L/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) \u2192 L >= -v tau ln(0.7). \n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think again. \n\nThe question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps the detector's resolution must be good enough to resolve the decay within a certain path length. If the decay happens too quickly, the track length is too small to be resolved. The minimum resolution required would be such that the average path length is at least the resolution. Wait, perhaps the required resolution is the average path length divided by some factor? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the average lifetime, and the resolution must be smaller than the average path length. So the resolution needs to be less than the average path length. So the minimum resolution is the average path length. But then why 30%?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is referring to the distance the particle travels before decaying, and to observe the decay, the detector must have a resolution better than that distance. Since the lifetime is a random variable with an exponential distribution, the average is v\u03c4, but to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% have decayed. \n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the detector has a resolution \u0394x. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than \u0394x, so that the track can be resolved. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be distinguished. So if the particle travels a distance L, then to see the decay, L must be larger than the resolution. So the probability that L is greater than \u0394x is the probability that the decay happened after a certain time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution needs to be smaller than the average decay length so that most decays can be seen. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the time dilation and then calculating the distance, but the answer comes out to 1.88e-6, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). Maybe there was an approximation in the calculation. Let me check all steps again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute \u03b3 again. \n\nE =27 GeV. m=3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So yes, 27 /3.41 \u22487.91787. \n\nHmm, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the energy being kinetic energy, not total energy? Wait, the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, but in particle physics, when they say the energy of a particle in a collider or chamber, it usually refers to the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic energy? If that's the case, then the total energy would be K + m c\u00b2 =27 GeV +3.41 GeV =30.41 GeV. That would change things. \n\nOh, that's a possible mistake here. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Maybe that is the kinetic energy? \n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. If the energy is the total energy, then my previous calculation holds. But if it's the kinetic energy, then E_total = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nThat would significantly change the gamma. \n\nLet me check this possibility. \n\nSuppose the energy given is the kinetic energy, K =27 GeV, then total energy is E = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. Then gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/(3.41)= ~9. So that would make gamma ~9. \n\nThen the lifetime \u03c4 =gamma \u03c4\u2080 =9 *8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nThen v would be sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2))? Wait, let's compute via p again. \n\nIf E=30.41 GeV, then p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. \n\nSo E\u00b2 = (30.41)^2 \u2248924.77 GeV\u00b2 \n\n(m c\u00b2)^2 = (3.41)^2 \u224811.628 GeV\u00b2 \n\nThus p = sqrt(924.77 -11.628)=sqrt(913.142)\u224830.21 GeV/c. \n\nThen v = p/(gamma m) \u2192 p/(gamma m c\u00b2 * c) ? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, p = gamma m v \u2192 v = p/(gamma m). \n\ngamma is 30.41/(3.41) \u22489. \n\nSo v = (30.21 GeV/c)/(9 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 \n\nWait, units: 30.21 GeV/c divided by (9 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 (GeV/c) / (GeV/(c\u00b2)) \u2192 c. \n\nSo units work. \n\n30.21/(9*3.41)=30.21/(30.69)\u22480.9843. \n\nSo v \u22480.9843c. \n\nThus, the distance is v * tau =0.9843 *3e8 m/s *7.2e-15 s. \n\nCompute that: 0.9843 *3e8 =2.9529e8 m/s \n\nMultiply by 7.2e-15 s: 2.9529e8 *7.2e-15 = (2.9529 *7.2) *1e-7 \n\n2.9529 *7 =20.67, 2.9529*0.2=0.5906 \u2192 total\u224821.26. \n\nThus, 21.26e-7 m =2.126e-6 meters. \n\nAh! Now that's about 2.126e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6). The difference might be due to rounding in intermediate steps. \n\nAh, so this is probably the correct approach. The problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that's the kinetic energy, then the calculation gives approximately 2.12e-6 m, which matches option A. \n\nBut why would the energy be the kinetic energy? The problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics contexts, when they refer to the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy unless specified otherwise. However, sometimes \"energy\" can refer to kinetic. This ambiguity might be the key here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using relativistic energy, which is total energy. Wait, but if it's total energy, then the distance would be ~1.88e-6 m, which is close to 2.08e-6 but not exactly. The options might have used approximate values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the question wants the average decay length. Wait, the question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps it's not the average distance, but the distance such that 30% of decays occur beyond that point. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the detector can resolve a decay if the particle travels a distance greater than \u0394x. The probability that a decay occurs at a distance greater than \u0394x is the probability that the decay time is greater than \u0394x / v. \n\nThe probability that the decay happens after time t is exp(-t/\u03c4). So the probability that the decay happens after \u0394x /v is exp(- (\u0394x /v)/\u03c4 ). \n\nWait, the probability that the decay happens after \u0394x /v is exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)). \n\nTo have at least 30% of decays observed, perhaps we need the probability that the decay occurs after \u0394x is \u2264 70% (so that 30% occur before \u0394x, so that they can be observed). Wait, I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the detector can resolve the decay if the particle travels at least \u0394x. So the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than \u0394x is 30%, so that 30% of decays are observed. \n\nWait, perhaps they want the resolution to be such that the probability of the decay happening within the resolution is 30%, so that you can see it. So the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394x is 30%, so that you can observe it. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within \u0394x is 1 - exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.3. \n\nSolving for \u0394x: \n\n1 - exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) =0.3 \u2192 exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) =0.7 \u2192 \n\n-\u0394x/(v \u03c4) = ln(0.7) \u2192 \n\n\u0394x = - v \u03c4 ln(0.7) \n\nCompute that:\n\nln(0.7) \u2248-0.35667 \n\nSo \u0394x = v \u03c4 *0.35667 \n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the required \u0394x is 0.35667 * v \u03c4. \n\nSo if we use the first calculation where energy was total (27 GeV):\n\nv \u03c4 =1.885e-6 m, then \u0394x would be 0.35667 *1.885e-6 \u22480.673e-6 m. But that's smaller than option A. \n\nAlternatively, if the energy is kinetic (30.41 GeV total):\n\nv \u03c4 =2.126e-6 m, so \u0394x =0.35667 *2.126e-6 \u22480.757e-6, which is still not matching the options. \n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the average distance, and the 30% is a red herring, or perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to resolve the decay, which would be on the order of the average distance. The answer options are all different orders of magnitude. The closest is option A (2.08e-6 m), which would be the case if the energy was kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the proper lifetime without time dilation? Let me see what happens in that case. If \u03c4=\u03c4\u2080=8e-16 s, then distance would be v *8e-16. But then v would be based on the given energy. \n\nWait, but that would ignore relativity. Probably not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation for the decay length in the lab frame as gamma times the proper decay length multiplied by velocity. Wait, that's what we did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relativistic momentum differently. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe decay length in the lab frame is L = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nWe need to compute L. \n\nBut to find v, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v. \n\nAlso, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSo, solving for v: \n\nv = pc\u00b2 / E. \n\nSo L = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = (pc\u00b2 / E ) * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nBut since \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), substituting: \n\nL = (p c\u00b2 / E ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nSimplify terms: \n\n(p c\u00b2 / E ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) = p/(m) \n\nThus L = (p/m) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nHmm, interesting. \n\nWait, p/m is (\u03b3 m v)/m = \u03b3 v. \n\nWait, but then L = \u03b3 v \u03c4\u2080, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the other expression: \n\nL = (p/m) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c \n\nThus, p/m = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/(m c) \n\nSo L = [ sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) / (m c) ] * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nPlugging in numbers with E as total energy (27 GeV):\n\nsqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) = sqrt(729-11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c \n\nDivide by m c (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 *c =3.41 GeV/c ) \n\nWait, units: \n\np/m = (26.78 GeV/c) / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 units are (GeV/c)/(GeV/c\u00b2) ) = c. \n\nSo 26.78 /3.41 \u22487.85. So p/m =7.85 c \n\nThus, L =7.85 c * \u03c4\u2080 \n\n\u03c4\u2080=8e-16 s \n\nThus L =7.85 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s \n\nMultiply: 7.85 *8 =62.8 \n\n3e8 *62.8e-16 = 62.8 *3 *1e-8 = 188.4e-8 m =1.884e-6 m. \n\nSo same result as before. \n\nSo if the energy is total, then it's ~1.88e-6 m. \n\nIf energy is kinetic (so total E=30.41 GeV), then:\n\np = sqrt(30.41\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) = sqrt( (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) \n\n30.41 squared is (30)^2 + 2*30*0.41 +0.41\u00b2=900+24.6+0.1681= 924.7681 \n\nMinus 3.41 squared (~11.628) gives 913.14, sqrt(913.14)=30.21 \n\nThus p/m =30.21/(3.41) =8.86 \n\nThus L =8.86 *c *8e-16 \n\n8.86 *8 =70.88 \n\n70.88 *3e8 *1e-16 =70.88*3e-8 =212.64e-8=2.126e-6 m. \n\nSo that's ~2.126e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nGiven that the options are given, perhaps the question expects us to take the energy as the total energy. Wait but then the answer would be ~1.88e-6, but the closest is option A. The difference could be due to rounding. Let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m \u2192 2.08e-6\n\nB) 2.08e-9\n\nC) 2.08e-1\n\nD) 2.08e-3\n\nHmm. The value of 2.08e-6 is very close to the 2.126e-6 when assuming kinetic energy. If the problem states the energy is the kinetic energy, then this is the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the energy is 30 GeV instead of 27? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Wait, let me check with the kinetic energy approach again. \n\nIf the energy given is kinetic (27 GeV), then total E =30.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/3.41 \u22489. \n\nThen v = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) *c \n\nWait, since v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nLet me compute that way. \n\n\u03b3 =9, so 1/\u03b3\u00b2 =1/81\u22480.0123. \n\n1-0.0123=0.9877 \u2192 sqrt(0.9877)=0.9938. \n\nThus v=0.9938c. \n\nThen \u03c4 = gamma \u03c4\u2080 =9*8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nThus distance is v \u03c4 =0.9938 *3e8 *7.2e-15 \n\n0.9938*3 =2.9814 \n\n2.9814e8 *7.2e-15 =2.9814*7.2 *1e-7 \n\n2.9814*7 =20.87, 2.9814*0.2=0.596 \u2192 total 21.466 \n\nThus, 21.466e-7 m =2.1466e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so that's ~2.15e-6 m. The given option A is 2.08e-6, which is close. Perhaps the question uses approximate values for gamma or the calculation steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, such as using the relation between the proper lifetime and the average decay length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the time dilation formula without considering the velocity? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in unit conversion somewhere. Let me check the final calculation once more with the kinetic energy assumption. \n\nIf the energy given is kinetic, then total E=27+3.41=30.41 GeV. \n\nThen gamma is 30.41/3.41\u22489. \n\nVelocity via beta = sqrt(1-1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1-1/81)=sqrt(80/81)= (sqrt(80))/9\u22488.9443/9\u22480.9938. \n\nThus, v=0.9938c. \n\nDistance is v*gamma*tau_0. \n\nWait, no: the lifetime in lab frame is gamma*tau_0. \n\nThus, distance is v * gamma * tau_0. \n\nWait, v is 0.9938c. \n\ngamma *tau_0 =9*8e-16 =7.2e-15 s. \n\nThus, distance =0.9938 *3e8 m/s *7.2e-15 s \n\nCalculate: \n\n0.9938 *3 =2.9814 \n\n2.9814 *7.2 =21.466 \n\n21.466e-7 m =2.1466e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so this is about 2.15e-6, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6. The difference could be due to rounding in the given values. The problem states the mass as 3.41 GeV, which may be exact, and energy 27 GeV. Let me try with more precise calculations. \n\nLet me recalculate gamma with E=30.41 (assuming kinetic):\n\nE = K + m =27+3.41=30.41 GeV. \n\nm=3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2)=30.41/3.41= 30.41 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d79=30.69 \u2192 30.41 is less than that. \n\n3.41 \u00d78.9=3.41*(9-0.1)=30.69-0.341=30.349 \n\n30.349 is still less than 30.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d78.91 =3.41*(8.9 +0.01)=30.349 +0.0341=30.3831 \n\nStill less than 30.41. \n\n3.41\u00d78.92=30.3831+0.0341=30.4172 \n\nAh! So 3.41 \u00d78.92 \u224830.4172, which is very close to 30.41. So gamma is approximately 8.92. \n\nSo gamma\u22488.92. \n\nThus, tau=8.92 \u00d78e-16 =7.136e-15 s. \n\nVelocity via v= sqrt(1-1/(gamma)^2)*c \n\ngamma squared is (8.92)^2\u224879.5664. \n\n1/gamma squared\u22480.01257. \n\n1-0.01257=0.98743 \u2192 sqrt(0.98743)=0.9937. \n\nThus, v=0.9937c. \n\nThus distance is 0.9937 *3e8 *7.136e-15 \n\n0.9937*3=2.9811 \n\n2.9811e8 *7.136e-15 =2.9811*7.136 *1e-7 \n\n2.9811\u00d77=20.8677, 2.9811\u00d70.136\u22480.406 \u2192 total \u224821.2737e-7 m \u2192 2.127e-6 m. \n\nSo that's still about 2.13e-6 m. \n\nThe option A is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 versus my calculation of ~2.13. The difference is about 2%. Perhaps the question uses an approximate gamma of 8.9 instead of 8.92. Let's see:\n\nIf gamma is exactly 30.41/3.41 = let me compute precisely:\n\n30.41 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d78=27.28 \n\n30.41 -27.28=3.13 \n\n3.13/3.41=0.918. \n\nSo gamma=8.918. \n\nThus, gamma is 8.918, so v is sqrt(1-1/(8.918)^2). \n\n(8.918)^2=79.53. \n\n1/79.53\u22480.01257. \n\nsqrt(1-0.01257)=sqrt(0.98743)=0.9937. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem expects using gamma as 27/3.41 (assuming total energy), which gives 7.917. \n\nThen the distance would be 1.88e-6 m. \n\nBut option A is 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me try calculating v from E and gamma again. \n\nIf E is total (27 GeV), then gamma is 27/3.41\u22487.917. \n\nThus, beta = sqrt(1-1/(gamma)^2) \n\ngamma squared is (7.917)^2\u224862.68. \n\n1/gamma squared\u22480.01596. \n\n1-0.01596=0.98404. \n\nsqrt(0.98404)=0.992. \n\nThus, v=0.992c. \n\nThus distance: 0.992 *3e8 * (7.917*8e-16). \n\nWait, \u03c4 =gamma \u03c4\u2080=7.917\u00d78e-16\u22486.333e-15 s. \n\nThus, v*tau =0.992*3e8 *6.333e-15 \n\n0.992*3=2.976 \n\n2.976e8 *6.333e-15 =2.976*6.333 *1e-7 \n\n2.976 \u00d76 =17.856 \n\n2.976 \u00d70.333\u22480.992. \n\nTotal\u224817.856+0.992=18.848e-7 \u21921.8848e-6 m. \n\nSo 1.8848e-6 m, which is approximately 1.88e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A (2.08e-6), but it's about 10% less. Maybe the question uses a different approximation or there's an error in the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the decay length is simply gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIf someone incorrectly calculates the decay length as L=gamma * tau_0 * c. \n\nThat would be 7.917 *8e-16 *3e8. \n\n7.917*8=63.336 \n\n63.336e-16 *3e8=63.336*3e-8=190e-8=1.90e-6 m. \n\nAh, that's 1.90e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6) but still not exact. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they used c=3e8 m/s but miscalculated the gamma? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the rest mass energy as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, but in calculations, the gamma was computed as E/(m) instead of E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is in GeV and m c\u00b2 is also in GeV. \n\nWait, if someone does gamma = E / m (without the c\u00b2), but since m is given in GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, but in the problem statement it's written as 3.41 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the incorrect formula where the decay length is gamma * tau_0 * c, which would give 1.9e-6 m, which is still not A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's given proper lifetime is in the lab frame? No, it says proper lifetime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the mean lifetime instead of the proper lifetime? But no, it says proper lifetime. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Given the options, the closest value when assuming the energy is total is ~1.88e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6. The next possible scenario is that the energy is kinetic, which gives ~2.12e-6 m, which is very close to option A. \n\nGiven that in particle physics, when they say \"energy\" without specifying, it's usually the total energy. But maybe in this context, the energy provided is the kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the non-relativistic approximation. Wait, but at these energies, that's not valid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the distance. Let me check one more time with the kinetic energy assumption (27 GeV kinetic):\n\nTotal energy E = 30.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E/(mc\u00b2) =30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nLifetime in lab frame: 8.92 \u00d78e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nVelocity: v = sqrt(1 -1/(8.92)^2)*c. \n\nCalculates to ~0.9937c. \n\nThus, distance is 0.9937 *3e8 m/s *7.136e-15 s \n\nLet me compute this precisely:\n\n0.9937 * 3 = 2.9811 \n\n2.9811 * 7.136 = let's compute 2.9811 \u00d77 =20.8677 \n\n2.9811 \u00d70.136 =0.406 (approx). \n\nTotal is 20.8677+0.406\u224821.2737 \n\nThus, 21.2737e-7 m = 2.127e-6 m. \n\nHmm. So if the problem's answer is 2.08e-6, perhaps there was a rounding in the question's numbers. Let me check the given mass and energy:\n\nThe mass is given as 3.41 GeV. If I use 3.4 GeV instead of 3.41, then:\n\nIf energy is kinetic (27 GeV), total E=27+3.4=30.4 GeV. \n\nGamma =30.4/3.4\u22489. \n\nThus, gamma=9. \n\nThen v= sqrt(1-1/81)=0.9938c. \n\nTau=9*8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nDistance: 0.9938*3e8 *7.2e-15 =0.9938*3*7.2e-7 \n\n0.9938*21.6\u224821.57e-7 \u2192 2.157e-6 m. \n\nHmm. Not quite. \n\nAlternatively, if the given mass is 3.4 GeV and energy 27 GeV, then:\n\nIf total energy is 27 GeV (so kinetic is 23.6), then gamma is 27/3.4\u22487.941. \n\nThen v= sqrt(1-1/(7.941)^2). \n\n7.941 squared\u224863.06. \n\n1/63.06\u22480.01586 \n\nsqrt(1-0.01586)=sqrt(0.98414)=0.992. \n\nDistance: 0.992*3e8 * (7.941*8e-16)=0.992*3e8 *6.3528e-15 \n\n0.992*3=2.976 \n\n2.976e8 *6.3528e-15 =2.976*6.3528 *1e-7 \n\n2.976 \u00d76 =17.856 \n\n2.976 \u00d70.3528\u22481.048 \n\nTotal:18.904e-7 \u21921.89e-6 m. \n\nStill close to 1.89e-6. \n\nHmm. Given that the options are given, perhaps the correct approach is to use the energy as total, and the calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the closest option is A (2.08e-6). Alternatively, maybe the question has a mistake in the numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nPerhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least 30% of the average decay length? \n\nIf the average is L_avg = v gamma tau\u2080, then 30% of that is 0.3 L_avg. \n\nBut why would the resolution need to be that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution must be small enough to distinguish the decay from no decay, so the average decay length must be greater than the resolution multiplied by some factor. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mean free path in terms of the detector resolution. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be referring to the spatial resolution required to detect the decay vertex, which would need to be better than the typical distance traveled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the uncertainty in the position. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relation that the decay length is gamma times the proper lifetime times c, but forgets the velocity component. \n\nWait, if someone does L = gamma * tau_0 * c, then that would be 7.917 *8e-16 *3e8 = 7.917*8*3 *1e-8 = 189. 189e-8 m =1.89e-6 m, which is 1.89e-6 m, very close to my first calculation. \n\nThe options have 2.08e-6, which is about 10% higher. \n\nPerhaps the question uses an approximate value of gamma as 8. \n\nIf gamma=8, then L=8*8e-16*3e8= 8*8*3 *1e-8= 192e-8=1.92e-6 m. \n\nClose to 2.0e-6. \n\nIf they used gamma=8.5, then 8.5*8*3=204 \u2192 2.04e-6, which is close to option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for c. For example, using c=3e8 m/s is correct, but perhaps they used c=2.998e8, but that won't make a big difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the energy given is the kinetic energy, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, leading to the calculation of ~2.12e-6 m, and the given option A is rounded to 2.08e-6. \n\nGiven that option A is the only one in the 1e-6 range, and the other options are orders of magnitude off, I think the intended answer is option A, assuming that the energy is the total energy and there was a rounding in the calculation steps. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle X\u2070. The given information includes the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 as 8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds, the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so the answer probably involves calculating the average distance the particle travels before decaying, considering relativistic effects, and then figuring out the required resolution based on that.\n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (the bubble chamber's frame), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So the actual lifetime in the lab frame is longer, which means the particle travels farther before decaying. The problem is about resolving the decay, so the resolution needs to be small enough to detect the track length of the particle before it decays. \n\nWait, but how does the energy come into play here? The energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy of the particle in the lab frame. Since the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV, we can compute the Lorentz factor \u03b3. Because in relativity, the total energy E is \u03b3mc\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nLet me note down the given values:\n\n- \u03c4\u2080 = 8e-16 s\n- E (lab frame) = 27 GeV\n- m (X\u2070) = 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (assuming units here, since energy is in GeV and mass is given as 3.41 GeV, so probably in units where c=1, so m would be 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2)\n\nSo \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 Wait, actually, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since E and m are given in GeV (assuming that the mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, so when multiplied by c\u00b2, it becomes GeV). So plugging in numbers:\n\n\u03b3 = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 Wait, no, hold on. Let me think in terms of units properly. Let me write m as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. Then m c\u00b2 would be 3.41 GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u2248 27/3.41 \u2248 let me compute that. 3.41*8 is 27.28, so 27 is a bit less than 8. So 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917... approximately 7.92. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.92.\n\nTherefore, the time dilation factor is \u03b3 \u2248 7.92. So the lifetime in the lab frame \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2248 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.92 * 8 = 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nNow, the next step is to find how far the particle travels in that time. To find the distance, we need its velocity. Since we have \u03b3, the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity v. The relation between \u03b3 and v is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Alternatively, we can find the velocity from the energy. \n\nAlternatively, since in relativity, the momentum p is equal to \u03b3 m v. The total energy E is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. Therefore, solving for p:\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. Let me compute that. \n\nE = 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 = 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo (E)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 GeV\u00b2. \n\n27 squared is 729. 3.41 squared is approx 11.6281. So 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719. So sqrt(717.3719) \u2248 let's see, 26.78 squared is 717.368, so sqrt(717.37) is approx 26.78 GeV. Therefore, p \u2248 26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThen, since p = \u03b3 m v, so v = p/(\u03b3 m). Let's compute that. \n\np is 26.78 GeV/c, \u03b3 m is 7.92 * 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2? Wait, units again. Let me think in terms of variables. \n\np = \u03b3 m v \u2192 v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\np/(\u03b3 m) = (26.78 GeV/c) / (7.92 * 3.41 GeV) \n\nThe GeV units cancel, so:\n\n26.78 / (7.92 * 3.41) * 1/c. Wait, but 1/c is in terms of 1/(speed of light). Let me compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst compute denominator: 7.92 *3.41 \u2248 7.92*3 =23.76, 7.92*0.41\u22483.2472 \u2192 total \u224823.76+3.2472\u224827.0072. \n\nSo denominator is approximately 27.0072. \n\nSo 26.78 divided by 27.0072 \u2248 ~0.9916. \n\nTherefore, v \u2248 0.9916 c. \n\nSo the velocity is about 0.9916 times the speed of light. \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the lab frame is d = v * \u03c4. \n\n\u03c4 was 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nSo d = 0.9916 * c * 6.336e-15 s. \n\nWe need to compute this distance. Let's plug in c \u2248 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo 0.9916 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s. \n\nMultiply the numbers:\n\n0.9916 *3 \u2248 2.9748. \n\nThen multiply by 6.336e-15:\n\n2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 let's see, 3 *6.336 is 19.008, subtract 0.0252 *6.336 (since 3 -0.9916 is 0.0084, but maybe better to just compute 2.9748*6.336)\n\nAlternatively, 2.9748 *6 = 17.8488, 2.9748 *0.336\u2248 1.000 (approx). So total is about 18.8488? Wait maybe better exact calculation:\n\n6.336 *2.9748:\n\nLet me compute 6 *2.9748 = 17.8488\n\n0.336 *2.9748: \n\n0.3 *2.9748 = 0.89244\n\n0.036*2.9748 = 0.1070928\n\nAdding those: 0.89244 +0.1070928 \u2248 0.99953\n\nTotal: 17.8488 +0.99953\u2248 18.8483.\n\nSo total is 18.8483e-15 m/s * s \u2192 meters. Wait, the units: the velocity is in m/s, multiplied by seconds, so yes, meters. \n\nSo d \u224818.8483e-15 m? Wait wait, no:\n\nWait, 0.9916 *3e8 m/s = 0.9916 *3e8 \u2248 2.9748e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by 6.336e-15 s gives:\n\n2.9748e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.9748 *6.336) *1e-7 \n\nWait, 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7, yes. \n\nSo 2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 let's compute that again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 2.9748 *6.336:\n\nLet me compute 2.9748 *6 = 17.8488\n\n2.9748 *0.336:\n\n2.9748 *0.3 =0.89244\n\n2.9748 *0.036=0.1070928\n\nAdding: 0.89244+0.1070928=0.9995328\n\nTotal is 17.8488 +0.9995328 =18.8483328\n\nSo total is 18.8483328 *1e-7 meters. \n\nSo 18.848e-7 m is 1.8848e-6 meters. Wait, that's 1.8848 micrometers. Hmm, but the options are in different exponents. Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step. \n\nd = v * \u03c4 \n\nv is 0.9916 c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\n\u03c4 is 6.336e-15 s. \n\nThus:\n\nv = 0.9916 * 3e8 = approx 2.9748e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by \u03c4: 2.9748e8 m/s *6.336e-15 s = 2.9748e8 *6.336e-15 \n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.9748 *6.336 \u2248 ~18.848 as before. \n\nMultiply the exponents: 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7. \n\nSo total is 18.848 *1e-7 m = 1.8848e-6 meters. \n\nHmm, that's 1.8848 micrometers, so about 1.88e-6 meters. \n\nBut the options are A) 2.08e-6, B) 2.08e-9, C) 2.08e-1, D) 2.08e-3. \n\nHmm, so my calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). But why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating \u03b3. Let me check that again.\n\nGiven E =27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Therefore \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) =27 /3.41 \u2248 7.91787. So that's correct. \n\nThen \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080: 7.91787 *8e-16 = 6.3343e-15 s. Correct. \n\nVelocity calculation: \n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c \u2192 sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) GeV /c. \n\n27 squared is 729, 3.41 squared is ~11.6281. So 729 -11.6281=717.3719. \n\nsqrt(717.3719)=26.78 (as before). \n\np =26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThen v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\n\u03b3 m is 7.91787 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2? Wait, units again. Let me write it as:\n\nv = (p c\u00b2)/(\u03b3 m c\u00b2) ?\n\nWait maybe I should do this differently. Let me recall that v = pc\u00b2/(E). Since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. Then v = (p c\u00b2)/E ?\n\nWait, let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, p = \u03b3 m v. So v = p/(\u03b3 m). \n\nYes, that's what I did earlier. \n\nSo p/(\u03b3 m) = (26.78 GeV/c) / (7.91787 *3.41 GeV) \n\nThe GeV cancels, and 1/c remains. \n\nWait, but the units of p is GeV/c, and \u03b3 m is (unitless) * (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2? Wait, m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is GeV. So \u03b3 m has units of (GeV/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, perhaps the units are getting mixed here. Let me think of everything in terms of natural units where c=1. Maybe that's easier. \n\nIn natural units (c=1), E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV, so \u03b3 = E/m = 27/3.41 \u22487.91787. \n\nThen p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2) = sqrt(27\u00b2 - 3.41\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(729 - 11.6281)= sqrt(717.3719) \u224826.78 GeV/c (but in natural units, c=1, so units of p would be GeV, but maybe this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity can be calculated as v = p/E * c. Because in natural units, v is p/E (since p = \u03b3 m v, E = \u03b3 m, so v = p/E). \n\nWait, that's a simpler way. Let me see:\n\nv = (p c) / E * c? Wait, maybe better to think:\n\nIn natural units where c=1, then p is in GeV, E is in GeV. Then v = p/E. \n\nSo in natural units, v = p/E \u224826.78 /27 \u22480.9918. So that's the same as before. So v \u22480.9918 c. \n\nSo that part checks out. So the velocity calculation is correct. \n\nThen the distance is v * \u03c4. \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSo putting all together:\n\nd = v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nBut let me see: \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so d = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nAlternatively, since v = \u03b2 c, where \u03b2 = v/c ~0.9918. \n\nSo d = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this. \n\nAlternatively, the mean proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The average distance traveled is v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nSo that's exactly what I did. \n\nHmm, so the distance is approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers. The closest option is A (2.08e-6), which is about 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, the difference between 1.88 and 2.08 is about 10%. Maybe I made an approximation error somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check the exact numbers again. \n\nLet me recalculate \u03b3. 27 divided by 3.41: \n\n3.41 \u00d7 7 = 23.87, 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13 /3.41 \u22480.918. So 7.918. So \u03b3=7.918. \n\nThen \u03c4 =7.918\u00d78e-16=6.334e-15 seconds. \n\nv is p/E *c. \n\np= sqrt(E\u00b2 -m\u00b2) = sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2). Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n27 squared is exactly 729. \n\n3.41 squared: 3.41*3.41. Let's calculate that. 3*3=9, 3*0.41=1.23, 0.41*3=1.23, 0.41\u00b2=0.1681. So (3+0.41)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.41 + 0.41\u00b2 =9 +2.46 +0.1681= 11.6281. So yes. \n\n729 -11.6281=717.3719. \n\nSquare root of 717.3719: Let's see, 26^2=676, 27\u00b2=729. 26.78\u00b2: \n\n26.78 squared: 26\u00b2 =676, 0.78\u00b2=0.6084, 2*26*0.78=40.56. So total (26 +0.78)^2 =26\u00b2 + 2*26*0.78 +0.78\u00b2 =676+40.56+0.6084=717.1684. \n\nSo sqrt(717.3719) is a bit higher than 26.78. Let me see: 26.78^2=717.1684. The difference between 717.3719 and that is 0.2035. \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=717.1684 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) = 1/(2*26.78) \u22480.0187 per unit x. \n\nSo delta x is 0.2035, so delta sqrt(x) \u22480.0187 *0.2035 \u22480.0038. \n\nThus sqrt(717.3719)\u224826.78+0.0038\u224826.7838. \n\nSo p is 26.7838 GeV/c. \n\nSo p/E is 26.7838 /27 \u22480.99199. \n\nThus, v =0.99199c. \n\nSo v is ~0.992c. \n\nSo recalculate d:\n\nv =0.992c, c=3e8 m/s, so v=0.992*3e8\u22482.976e8 m/s. \n\n\u03c4=6.334e-15 s. \n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 *6.334e-15 = \n\nFirst multiply 2.976 *6.334 \u2248 let's do 2.976 *6 =17.856, 2.976*0.334 \u2248 2.976*0.3=0.8928, 2.976*0.034=0.1012. Total for 0.334: 0.8928+0.1012\u22480.994. So total 17.856+0.994\u224818.85. \n\nSo 18.85 *1e8 *1e-15 = 18.85e-7 meters =1.885e-6 meters. \n\nHmm, so still about 1.885e-6 meters. \n\nThe options are A:2.08e-6, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's requirement. The question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". Wait, I assumed that the average distance is what's needed, but maybe it's about the mean free path and the resolution required to capture 30% of the decays? Wait, perhaps I need to consider the decay length distribution. \n\nThe decay length in the lab frame is given by the distribution: the probability that the particle decays between t and t+dt is (1/\u03c4) e^{-t/\u03c4} dt. So the average distance is v\u03c4, which is exactly what I calculated. But perhaps the question is asking for the resolution needed such that the decay is observed, meaning that the track length must be resolved. So the resolution must be smaller than the average decay length? Or perhaps they want the standard deviation? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the minimum resolution so that the detector can distinguish between the decay happening and not happening. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty in the position, and the resolution needed is such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex within a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the proper lifetime and the time dilation, but I might have miscalculated. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, so the average distance is v gamma tau_0, which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not asking for the average distance, but the minimum resolution so that a certain percentage of decays are observed. The lifetime is a decay constant, so the distance traveled would follow an exponential distribution. The probability that a decay occurs within a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)). To have at least 30% of the decays, set 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)) >=0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/(v tau)) <=0.7 \u2192 -L/(v tau) <= ln(0.7) \u2192 L >= -v tau ln(0.7). \n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think again. \n\nThe question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps the detector's resolution must be good enough to resolve the decay within a certain path length. If the decay happens too quickly, the track length is too small to be resolved. The minimum resolution required would be such that the average path length is at least the resolution. Wait, perhaps the required resolution is the average path length divided by some factor? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the average lifetime, and the resolution must be smaller than the average path length. So the resolution needs to be less than the average path length. So the minimum resolution is the average path length. But then why 30%?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is referring to the distance the particle travels before decaying, and to observe the decay, the detector must have a resolution better than that distance. Since the lifetime is a random variable with an exponential distribution, the average is v\u03c4, but to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% have decayed. \n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the detector has a resolution \u0394x. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than \u0394x, so that the track can be resolved. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be distinguished. So if the particle travels a distance L, then to see the decay, L must be larger than the resolution. So the probability that L is greater than \u0394x is the probability that the decay happened after a certain time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution needs to be smaller than the average decay length so that most decays can be seen. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the time dilation and then calculating the distance, but the answer comes out to 1.88e-6, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). Maybe there was an approximation in the calculation. Let me check all steps again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute \u03b3 again. \n\nE =27 GeV. m=3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So yes, 27 /3.41 \u22487.91787. \n\nHmm, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the energy being kinetic energy, not total energy? Wait, the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, but in particle physics, when they say the energy of a particle in a collider or chamber, it usually refers to the total energy. But maybe it's the kinetic energy? If that's the case, then the total energy would be K + m c\u00b2 =27 GeV +3.41 GeV =30.41 GeV. That would change things. \n\nOh, that's a possible mistake here. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Maybe that is the kinetic energy? \n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. If the energy is the total energy, then my previous calculation holds. But if it's the kinetic energy, then E_total = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nThat would significantly change the gamma. \n\nLet me check this possibility. \n\nSuppose the energy given is the kinetic energy, K =27 GeV, then total energy is E = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. Then gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/(3.41)= ~9. So that would make gamma ~9. \n\nThen the lifetime \u03c4 =gamma \u03c4\u2080 =9 *8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nThen v would be sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2))? Wait, let's compute via p again. \n\nIf E=30.41 GeV, then p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c. \n\nSo E\u00b2 = (30.41)^2 \u2248924.77 GeV\u00b2 \n\n(m c\u00b2)^2 = (3.41)^2 \u224811.628 GeV\u00b2 \n\nThus p = sqrt(924.77 -11.628)=sqrt(913.142)\u224830.21 GeV/c. \n\nThen v = p/(gamma m) \u2192 p/(gamma m c\u00b2 * c) ? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, p = gamma m v \u2192 v = p/(gamma m). \n\ngamma is 30.41/(3.41) \u22489. \n\nSo v = (30.21 GeV/c)/(9 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 \n\nWait, units: 30.21 GeV/c divided by (9 *3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 (GeV/c) / (GeV/(c\u00b2)) \u2192 c. \n\nSo units work. \n\n30.21/(9*3.41)=30.21/(30.69)\u22480.9843. \n\nSo v \u22480.9843c. \n\nThus, the distance is v * tau =0.9843 *3e8 m/s *7.2e-15 s. \n\nCompute that: 0.9843 *3e8 =2.9529e8 m/s \n\nMultiply by 7.2e-15 s: 2.9529e8 *7.2e-15 = (2.9529 *7.2) *1e-7 \n\n2.9529 *7 =20.67, 2.9529*0.2=0.5906 \u2192 total\u224821.26. \n\nThus, 21.26e-7 m =2.126e-6 meters. \n\nAh! Now that's about 2.126e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6). The difference might be due to rounding in intermediate steps. \n\nAh, so this is probably the correct approach. The problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that's the kinetic energy, then the calculation gives approximately 2.12e-6 m, which matches option A. \n\nBut why would the energy be the kinetic energy? The problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which is a bit ambiguous. In particle physics contexts, when they refer to the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy unless specified otherwise. However, sometimes \"energy\" can refer to kinetic. This ambiguity might be the key here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using relativistic energy, which is total energy. Wait, but if it's total energy, then the distance would be ~1.88e-6 m, which is close to 2.08e-6 but not exactly. The options might have used approximate values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the question wants the average decay length. Wait, the question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps it's not the average distance, but the distance such that 30% of decays occur beyond that point. \n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the detector can resolve a decay if the particle travels a distance greater than \u0394x. The probability that a decay occurs at a distance greater than \u0394x is the probability that the decay time is greater than \u0394x / v. \n\nThe probability that the decay happens after time t is exp(-t/\u03c4). So the probability that the decay happens after \u0394x /v is exp(- (\u0394x /v)/\u03c4 ). \n\nWait, the probability that the decay happens after \u0394x /v is exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)). \n\nTo have at least 30% of decays observed, perhaps we need the probability that the decay occurs after \u0394x is \u2264 70% (so that 30% occur before \u0394x, so that they can be observed). Wait, I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the detector can resolve the decay if the particle travels at least \u0394x. So the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than \u0394x is 30%, so that 30% of decays are observed. \n\nWait, perhaps they want the resolution to be such that the probability of the decay happening within the resolution is 30%, so that you can see it. So the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394x is 30%, so that you can observe it. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within \u0394x is 1 - exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.3. \n\nSolving for \u0394x: \n\n1 - exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) =0.3 \u2192 exp(-\u0394x/(v \u03c4)) =0.7 \u2192 \n\n-\u0394x/(v \u03c4) = ln(0.7) \u2192 \n\n\u0394x = - v \u03c4 ln(0.7) \n\nCompute that:\n\nln(0.7) \u2248-0.35667 \n\nSo \u0394x = v \u03c4 *0.35667 \n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the required \u0394x is 0.35667 * v \u03c4. \n\nSo if we use the first calculation where energy was total (27 GeV):\n\nv \u03c4 =1.885e-6 m, then \u0394x would be 0.35667 *1.885e-6 \u22480.673e-6 m. But that's smaller than option A. \n\nAlternatively, if the energy is kinetic (30.41 GeV total):\n\nv \u03c4 =2.126e-6 m, so \u0394x =0.35667 *2.126e-6 \u22480.757e-6, which is still not matching the options. \n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the average distance, and the 30% is a red herring, or perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to resolve the decay, which would be on the order of the average distance. The answer options are all different orders of magnitude. The closest is option A (2.08e-6 m), which would be the case if the energy was kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the proper lifetime without time dilation? Let me see what happens in that case. If \u03c4=\u03c4\u2080=8e-16 s, then distance would be v *8e-16. But then v would be based on the given energy. \n\nWait, but that would ignore relativity. Probably not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation for the decay length in the lab frame as gamma times the proper decay length multiplied by velocity. Wait, that's what we did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relativistic momentum differently. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe decay length in the lab frame is L = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nWe need to compute L. \n\nBut to find v, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and p = \u03b3 m v. \n\nAlso, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSo, solving for v: \n\nv = pc\u00b2 / E. \n\nSo L = v \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = (pc\u00b2 / E ) * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nBut since \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), substituting: \n\nL = (p c\u00b2 / E ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nSimplify terms: \n\n(p c\u00b2 / E ) * (E/(m c\u00b2)) = p/(m) \n\nThus L = (p/m) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nHmm, interesting. \n\nWait, p/m is (\u03b3 m v)/m = \u03b3 v. \n\nWait, but then L = \u03b3 v \u03c4\u2080, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the other expression: \n\nL = (p/m) * \u03c4\u2080 \n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/c \n\nThus, p/m = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2)/(m c) \n\nSo L = [ sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2) / (m c) ] * \u03c4\u2080 \n\nPlugging in numbers with E as total energy (27 GeV):\n\nsqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) = sqrt(729-11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c \n\nDivide by m c (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 *c =3.41 GeV/c ) \n\nWait, units: \n\np/m = (26.78 GeV/c) / (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) \u2192 units are (GeV/c)/(GeV/c\u00b2) ) = c. \n\nSo 26.78 /3.41 \u22487.85. So p/m =7.85 c \n\nThus, L =7.85 c * \u03c4\u2080 \n\n\u03c4\u2080=8e-16 s \n\nThus L =7.85 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s \n\nMultiply: 7.85 *8 =62.8 \n\n3e8 *62.8e-16 = 62.8 *3 *1e-8 = 188.4e-8 m =1.884e-6 m. \n\nSo same result as before. \n\nSo if the energy is total, then it's ~1.88e-6 m. \n\nIf energy is kinetic (so total E=30.41 GeV), then:\n\np = sqrt(30.41\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) = sqrt( (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) \n\n30.41 squared is (30)^2 + 2*30*0.41 +0.41\u00b2=900+24.6+0.1681= 924.7681 \n\nMinus 3.41 squared (~11.628) gives 913.14, sqrt(913.14)=30.21 \n\nThus p/m =30.21/(3.41) =8.86 \n\nThus L =8.86 *c *8e-16 \n\n8.86 *8 =70.88 \n\n70.88 *3e8 *1e-16 =70.88*3e-8 =212.64e-8=2.126e-6 m. \n\nSo that's ~2.126e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nGiven that the options are given, perhaps the question expects us to take the energy as the total energy. Wait but then the answer would be ~1.88e-6, but the closest is option A. The difference could be due to rounding. Let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m \u2192 2.08e-6\n\nB) 2.08e-9\n\nC) 2.08e-1\n\nD) 2.08e-3\n\nHmm. The value of 2.08e-6 is very close to the 2.126e-6 when assuming kinetic energy. If the problem states the energy is the kinetic energy, then this is the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the energy is 30 GeV instead of 27? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Wait, let me check with the kinetic energy approach again. \n\nIf the energy given is kinetic (27 GeV), then total E =30.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/3.41 \u22489. \n\nThen v = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) *c \n\nWait, since v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nLet me compute that way. \n\n\u03b3 =9, so 1/\u03b3\u00b2 =1/81\u22480.0123. \n\n1-0.0123=0.9877 \u2192 sqrt(0.9877)=0.9938. \n\nThus v=0.9938c. \n\nThen \u03c4 = gamma \u03c4\u2080 =9*8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nThus distance is v \u03c4 =0.9938 *3e8 *7.2e-15 \n\n0.9938*3 =2.9814 \n\n2.9814e8 *7.2e-15 =2.9814*7.2 *1e-7 \n\n2.9814*7 =20.87, 2.9814*0.2=0.596 \u2192 total 21.466 \n\nThus, 21.466e-7 m =2.1466e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so that's ~2.15e-6 m. The given option A is 2.08e-6, which is close. Perhaps the question uses approximate values for gamma or the calculation steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, such as using the relation between the proper lifetime and the average decay length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the time dilation formula without considering the velocity? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in unit conversion somewhere. Let me check the final calculation once more with the kinetic energy assumption. \n\nIf the energy given is kinetic, then total E=27+3.41=30.41 GeV. \n\nThen gamma is 30.41/3.41\u22489. \n\nVelocity via beta = sqrt(1-1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1-1/81)=sqrt(80/81)= (sqrt(80))/9\u22488.9443/9\u22480.9938. \n\nThus, v=0.9938c. \n\nDistance is v*gamma*tau_0. \n\nWait, no: the lifetime in lab frame is gamma*tau_0. \n\nThus, distance is v * gamma * tau_0. \n\nWait, v is 0.9938c. \n\ngamma *tau_0 =9*8e-16 =7.2e-15 s. \n\nThus, distance =0.9938 *3e8 m/s *7.2e-15 s \n\nCalculate: \n\n0.9938 *3 =2.9814 \n\n2.9814 *7.2 =21.466 \n\n21.466e-7 m =2.1466e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so this is about 2.15e-6, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6. The difference could be due to rounding in the given values. The problem states the mass as 3.41 GeV, which may be exact, and energy 27 GeV. Let me try with more precise calculations. \n\nLet me recalculate gamma with E=30.41 (assuming kinetic):\n\nE = K + m =27+3.41=30.41 GeV. \n\nm=3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2)=30.41/3.41= 30.41 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d79=30.69 \u2192 30.41 is less than that. \n\n3.41 \u00d78.9=3.41*(9-0.1)=30.69-0.341=30.349 \n\n30.349 is still less than 30.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d78.91 =3.41*(8.9 +0.01)=30.349 +0.0341=30.3831 \n\nStill less than 30.41. \n\n3.41\u00d78.92=30.3831+0.0341=30.4172 \n\nAh! So 3.41 \u00d78.92 \u224830.4172, which is very close to 30.41. So gamma is approximately 8.92. \n\nSo gamma\u22488.92. \n\nThus, tau=8.92 \u00d78e-16 =7.136e-15 s. \n\nVelocity via v= sqrt(1-1/(gamma)^2)*c \n\ngamma squared is (8.92)^2\u224879.5664. \n\n1/gamma squared\u22480.01257. \n\n1-0.01257=0.98743 \u2192 sqrt(0.98743)=0.9937. \n\nThus, v=0.9937c. \n\nThus distance is 0.9937 *3e8 *7.136e-15 \n\n0.9937*3=2.9811 \n\n2.9811e8 *7.136e-15 =2.9811*7.136 *1e-7 \n\n2.9811\u00d77=20.8677, 2.9811\u00d70.136\u22480.406 \u2192 total \u224821.2737e-7 m \u2192 2.127e-6 m. \n\nSo that's still about 2.13e-6 m. \n\nThe option A is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 versus my calculation of ~2.13. The difference is about 2%. Perhaps the question uses an approximate gamma of 8.9 instead of 8.92. Let's see:\n\nIf gamma is exactly 30.41/3.41 = let me compute precisely:\n\n30.41 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d78=27.28 \n\n30.41 -27.28=3.13 \n\n3.13/3.41=0.918. \n\nSo gamma=8.918. \n\nThus, gamma is 8.918, so v is sqrt(1-1/(8.918)^2). \n\n(8.918)^2=79.53. \n\n1/79.53\u22480.01257. \n\nsqrt(1-0.01257)=sqrt(0.98743)=0.9937. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem expects using gamma as 27/3.41 (assuming total energy), which gives 7.917. \n\nThen the distance would be 1.88e-6 m. \n\nBut option A is 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me try calculating v from E and gamma again. \n\nIf E is total (27 GeV), then gamma is 27/3.41\u22487.917. \n\nThus, beta = sqrt(1-1/(gamma)^2) \n\ngamma squared is (7.917)^2\u224862.68. \n\n1/gamma squared\u22480.01596. \n\n1-0.01596=0.98404. \n\nsqrt(0.98404)=0.992. \n\nThus, v=0.992c. \n\nThus distance: 0.992 *3e8 * (7.917*8e-16). \n\nWait, \u03c4 =gamma \u03c4\u2080=7.917\u00d78e-16\u22486.333e-15 s. \n\nThus, v*tau =0.992*3e8 *6.333e-15 \n\n0.992*3=2.976 \n\n2.976e8 *6.333e-15 =2.976*6.333 *1e-7 \n\n2.976 \u00d76 =17.856 \n\n2.976 \u00d70.333\u22480.992. \n\nTotal\u224817.856+0.992=18.848e-7 \u21921.8848e-6 m. \n\nSo 1.8848e-6 m, which is approximately 1.88e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A (2.08e-6), but it's about 10% less. Maybe the question uses a different approximation or there's an error in the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the decay length is simply gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIf someone incorrectly calculates the decay length as L=gamma * tau_0 * c. \n\nThat would be 7.917 *8e-16 *3e8. \n\n7.917*8=63.336 \n\n63.336e-16 *3e8=63.336*3e-8=190e-8=1.90e-6 m. \n\nAh, that's 1.90e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6) but still not exact. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they used c=3e8 m/s but miscalculated the gamma? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the rest mass energy as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, but in calculations, the gamma was computed as E/(m) instead of E/(m c\u00b2). Wait, but E is in GeV and m c\u00b2 is also in GeV. \n\nWait, if someone does gamma = E / m (without the c\u00b2), but since m is given in GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, but in the problem statement it's written as 3.41 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the incorrect formula where the decay length is gamma * tau_0 * c, which would give 1.9e-6 m, which is still not A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's given proper lifetime is in the lab frame? No, it says proper lifetime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the mean lifetime instead of the proper lifetime? But no, it says proper lifetime. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Given the options, the closest value when assuming the energy is total is ~1.88e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6. The next possible scenario is that the energy is kinetic, which gives ~2.12e-6 m, which is very close to option A. \n\nGiven that in particle physics, when they say \"energy\" without specifying, it's usually the total energy. But maybe in this context, the energy provided is the kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the non-relativistic approximation. Wait, but at these energies, that's not valid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the distance. Let me check one more time with the kinetic energy assumption (27 GeV kinetic):\n\nTotal energy E = 30.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E/(mc\u00b2) =30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nLifetime in lab frame: 8.92 \u00d78e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nVelocity: v = sqrt(1 -1/(8.92)^2)*c. \n\nCalculates to ~0.9937c. \n\nThus, distance is 0.9937 *3e8 m/s *7.136e-15 s \n\nLet me compute this precisely:\n\n0.9937 * 3 = 2.9811 \n\n2.9811 * 7.136 = let's compute 2.9811 \u00d77 =20.8677 \n\n2.9811 \u00d70.136 =0.406 (approx). \n\nTotal is 20.8677+0.406\u224821.2737 \n\nThus, 21.2737e-7 m = 2.127e-6 m. \n\nHmm. So if the problem's answer is 2.08e-6, perhaps there was a rounding in the question's numbers. Let me check the given mass and energy:\n\nThe mass is given as 3.41 GeV. If I use 3.4 GeV instead of 3.41, then:\n\nIf energy is kinetic (27 GeV), total E=27+3.4=30.4 GeV. \n\nGamma =30.4/3.4\u22489. \n\nThus, gamma=9. \n\nThen v= sqrt(1-1/81)=0.9938c. \n\nTau=9*8e-16=7.2e-15 s. \n\nDistance: 0.9938*3e8 *7.2e-15 =0.9938*3*7.2e-7 \n\n0.9938*21.6\u224821.57e-7 \u2192 2.157e-6 m. \n\nHmm. Not quite. \n\nAlternatively, if the given mass is 3.4 GeV and energy 27 GeV, then:\n\nIf total energy is 27 GeV (so kinetic is 23.6), then gamma is 27/3.4\u22487.941. \n\nThen v= sqrt(1-1/(7.941)^2). \n\n7.941 squared\u224863.06. \n\n1/63.06\u22480.01586 \n\nsqrt(1-0.01586)=sqrt(0.98414)=0.992. \n\nDistance: 0.992*3e8 * (7.941*8e-16)=0.992*3e8 *6.3528e-15 \n\n0.992*3=2.976 \n\n2.976e8 *6.3528e-15 =2.976*6.3528 *1e-7 \n\n2.976 \u00d76 =17.856 \n\n2.976 \u00d70.3528\u22481.048 \n\nTotal:18.904e-7 \u21921.89e-6 m. \n\nStill close to 1.89e-6. \n\nHmm. Given that the options are given, perhaps the correct approach is to use the energy as total, and the calculation gives approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the closest option is A (2.08e-6). Alternatively, maybe the question has a mistake in the numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nPerhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least 30% of the average decay length? \n\nIf the average is L_avg = v gamma tau\u2080, then 30% of that is 0.3 L_avg. \n\nBut why would the resolution need to be that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution must be small enough to distinguish the decay from no decay, so the average decay length must be greater than the resolution multiplied by some factor. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mean free path in terms of the detector resolution. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be referring to the spatial resolution required to detect the decay vertex, which would need to be better than the typical distance traveled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the uncertainty in the position. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relation that the decay length is gamma times the proper lifetime times c, but forgets the velocity component. \n\nWait, if someone does L = gamma * tau_0 * c, then that would be 7.917 *8e-16 *3e8 = 7.917*8*3 *1e-8 = 189. 189e-8 m =1.89e-6 m, which is 1.89e-6 m, very close to my first calculation. \n\nThe options have 2.08e-6, which is about 10% higher. \n\nPerhaps the question uses an approximate value of gamma as 8. \n\nIf gamma=8, then L=8*8e-16*3e8= 8*8*3 *1e-8= 192e-8=1.92e-6 m. \n\nClose to 2.0e-6. \n\nIf they used gamma=8.5, then 8.5*8*3=204 \u2192 2.04e-6, which is close to option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for c. For example, using c=3e8 m/s is correct, but perhaps they used c=2.998e8, but that won't make a big difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the energy given is the kinetic energy, and the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, leading to the calculation of ~2.12e-6 m, and the given option A is rounded to 2.08e-6. \n\nGiven that option A is the only one in the 1e-6 range, and the other options are orders of magnitude off, I think the intended answer is option A, assuming that the energy is the total energy and there was a rounding in the calculation steps. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle \\( X^0 \\) in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The proper lifetime \\( \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) seconds, the energy in the lab frame is 27 GeV, and the mass of \\( X^0 \\) is 3.41 GeV. \n\n1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):**\n   - Total energy \\( E = 27 \\) GeV.\n   - Rest energy \\( m c^2 = 3.41 \\) GeV.\n   - \\( \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.92 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the lifetime in the lab frame \\( \\tau \\):**\n   - \\( \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\approx 6.34 \\times 10^{-15} \\) seconds.\n\n3. **Compute the velocity \\( v \\):**\n   - Momentum \\( p = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} / c \\approx 26.78 \\) GeV/\\( c \\).\n   - \\( v = \\frac{p}{\\gamma m} \\approx 0.992c \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the average decay distance \\( d \\):**\n   - \\( d = v \\tau \\approx 0.992 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\times 6.34 \\times 10^{-15} \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\) meters.\n\nConsidering potential rounding and the options provided, the closest value is **2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m** when assuming slight approximations or if the energy is interpreted as kinetic (yielding ~2.12 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m). The options suggest the answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the X\u2070 particle. Hmm, the given data includes the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 as 8\u00d710^-16 seconds, the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions in meters. \n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the bubble chamber, the particles are moving, so their lifetime from our perspective (the lab frame) would be longer. The problem mentions energy, so I think I need to calculate the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) to find the dilated lifetime. \n\nThe energy given is 27 GeV. Since the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV, the total energy (E) is related to the rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, but energy here is given in GeV, which is already E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. So maybe I can use that. Let me confirm: \n\nThe total energy of a particle is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. So rearranging, \u03b3 = E/(mc\u00b2). But since the mass is given in GeV, and energy is also in GeV, maybe the units work out. Let me check:\n\nIf E is 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (since mass in GeV is actually GeV/c\u00b2, but when using E=\u03b3mc\u00b2, the c\u00b2 would cancel out in the ratio. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 respectively, then the c\u00b2 would actually be part of the units. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe since both E and m are given in units that include the c\u00b2 terms, the ratio E/(m) would directly give \u03b3. Let me think again. \n\nLet me write the equation properly. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since the mass is given in GeV (but actually, the unit for mass should be GeV/c\u00b2), so if m is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) would be (27 GeV)/( (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 ) ) = 27 /3.41 \u2248 7.917. So \u03b3 is approximately 7.917. \n\nTherefore, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is roughly 7.92. \n\nNow, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So \u03c4 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, how does resolution relate here? Maybe the decay length is important here. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the longer the decay length. But to observe the decay, the detector must have a resolution fine enough to detect the decay products. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution required is the distance the particle travels during its lifetime. But since they want at least 30% of decays observed, maybe we need to consider the decay length and the detector's spatial resolution. \n\nWait, the problem states \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps the resolution must be better than the average decay length multiplied by some factor? Let me think. \n\nThe decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The average decay length in the lab frame is v * \u03c4, where v is the velocity of the particle. But the particle's velocity can be found via v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nAlternatively, since \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute v. \n\nFirst, let me compute \u03b3 again. From earlier, \u03b3 is approximately 7.92. \n\nSo 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is about 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7 \u2248 0.01595. \n\nSo 1 - 0.01595 \u2248 0.98405. \n\nSo v = c * sqrt(0.98405) \u2248 c * 0.992. \n\nSo approximately 0.992c. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is very close to the speed of light. \n\nThe average decay length L would then be v * \u03c4. \n\nWait, but the decay occurs at a random time during the lifetime. The average decay length would be the average of v multiplied by the time until decay. Since the lifetime is exponentially distributed, the average lifetime is \u03c4, so average L is v * \u03c4. \n\nSo let's compute L. \n\nFirst, \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2248 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nv is approx 0.992c. Let's use c as 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo v \u2248 0.992 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = (2.976e8 m/s) * (6.336e-15 s) \n\nMultiplying those numbers: \n\n2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) * 1e-7 \n\nLet me compute 2.976 *6.336. \n\n2 *6.336 is 12.672, 0.976*6.336 is approx 6.172 (since 0.9*6.336=5.7024, 0.076*6.336\u22480.481, total \u22486.1834). So total is approx 12.672 +6.1834 \u224818.855. \n\nSo L \u2248 18.855e-7 meters, which is 1.8855e-6 meters, or approximately 1.89e-6 m. \n\nBut the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length so that the detector can distinguish the decay from the original particle. If the detector's resolution is too poor, it can't see the separation between the original track and the decay products, so the decay would not be observed. \n\nTherefore, to observe the decay, the resolution must be better than the average decay length. But the question specifies \"at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the spatial resolution needed such that the decay occurs within a detectable distance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the spatial resolution required to resolve the decay vertex from the production point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the time resolution? But the options are in meters, so it's spatial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution (like the distance between points the detector can resolve) so that a significant fraction of the decay paths are detectable. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might involve the lifetime of the particle and the distance traveled, but I need to think again. \n\nWait, another thought: in bubble chambers, the resolution is the distance between the points where the particle's path is recorded. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a position that can be distinguished from the original track. So the decay length must be longer than the resolution. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within a distance L from the production point is given by the exponential decay distribution. The probability that the decay happens within a certain distance would be the integral from 0 to x of the decay probability density function. \n\nThe decay probability per unit distance is (1/\u03bb) e^(-x/\u03bb), where \u03bb is the mean free path (average decay length). The probability that the decay happens within a distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb). \n\nWe need this probability to be at least 30% (0.3). \n\nSo set 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb) \u2265 0.3 \n\nSolving for x: \n\ne^(-x/\u03bb) \u2264 0.7 \n\nTake natural log of both sides: \n\n- x/\u03bb \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): \n\nx/\u03bb \u2265 -ln(0.7) \n\nx \u2265 -\u03bb ln(0.7) \n\nCompute -ln(0.7): ln(1/0.7) \u2248 ln(1.4286) \u2248 0.3567 \n\nSo x \u2265 \u03bb *0.3567 \n\nTherefore, the required minimum distance x is 0.3567 * \u03bb \n\nWait, but the problem says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". The resolution would need to be better than this x. Hmm, perhaps the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay if it happens within that x. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So the detector's resolution must be less than the x that gives 30% probability. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length so that the detector can see the decay. Alternatively, the resolution is the maximum distance between points, so the decay has to be longer than that to be detected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me check the options. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, C) 2.08e-1 m, D) 2.08e-3 m. \n\nEarlier, my calculation of L (the mean decay length) was ~1.89e-6 m. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of decays. \n\nWait, the mean decay length is ~1.89e-6 m. To have 30% of decays observed, perhaps the resolution must be better than the decay length multiplied by some factor. \n\nWait, if the detector has a resolution of d, then the decay must have a path longer than d to be detected. The probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than d is P(d) = e^(-d/\u03bb). Because the probability of surviving (not decaying) up to distance d is e^(-d/\u03bb). Wait, actually, the probability that the decay occurs after distance d is e^(-d/\u03bb). But we want the probability that it decays before distance d to be at least 30%? \n\nWait, the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So maybe the detector must be able to detect decays that occur within a distance d, and we need P(decay within d) \u2265 0.3. \n\nIn that case, the required d is found from 1 - e^{-d/\u03bb} \u2265 0.3 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo solving for d: d = -\u03bb ln(1 - 0.3) = -\u03bb ln(0.7) \u2248 \u03bb *0.3567 \n\nSo substituting \u03bb = v \u03c4 = v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nWait, but earlier I calculated \u03bb \u22481.89e-6 m. \n\nThen d \u2248 1.89e-6 * 0.3567 \u2248 0.675e-6 m? \n\nWait, but that would give d \u22486.75e-7 m, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate. \n\nWait let me recalculate the decay length properly. Let me go step by step again. \n\nFirst, compute \u03b3. \n\nGiven: \n\nEnergy E = 27 GeV \n\nMass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (since mass in GeV is actually GeV/c\u00b2, but when using E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, the units would be: \n\nE (GeV) = \u03b3 (m (GeV/c\u00b2)) c\u00b2 \u2192 so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, the c\u00b2 cancels out. \n\nWait, but the units might complicate here. Alternatively, perhaps better to write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so the denominator has m c\u00b2 in (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 = GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 = (27 GeV)/(3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 the c\u00b2 terms cancel, so it's 27 / 3.41 \u22487.917 as before. \n\nSo \u03b3 \u22487.92. \n\nNow, the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nThe dilated lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u22487.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nVelocity v = (c) * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nLet me compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2: 1/(7.92)^2 \u22481/62.7264\u22480.01594. \n\nSo 1 - 0.01594 \u22480.98406. \n\nsqrt(0.98406) \u22480.9920. \n\nThus, v \u22480.9920c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\nv \u22480.992 *3e8 \u22482.976e8 m/s. \n\nDecay length L = v * \u03c4 = 2.976e8 m/s *6.336e-15 s \n\nLet me compute that: \n\nMultiply 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) * 1e-7 \n\nCalculating 2.976 *6.336: \n\n2 *6.336 = 12.672 \n\n0.976 *6.336: \n\n0.9*6.336=5.7024 \n\n0.076*6.336 = 0.481 \n\nTotal: 5.7024 +0.481 =6.1834 \n\nSo total 12.672 +6.1834 = 18.8554 \n\nThus, L =18.8554e-7 m =1.8855e-6 m, which is approximately 1.89e-6 meters. \n\nSo the average decay length is ~1.89e-6 m. \n\nNow, to find the distance d where the probability of decay within d is 30%, so 1 - e^{-d/L} =0.3 \u2192 e^{-d/L} =0.7 \u2192 -d/L = ln(0.7) \u2192 d = -L * ln(0.7) \n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667 \n\nSo d = L *0.35667 \u22481.8855e-6 *0.35667 \u22480.674e-6 m =6.74e-7 m. \n\nBut none of the options is that. The options are 2.08e-6, etc. \n\nHmm, so maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read the problem. \n\nThe question says: What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV. \n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the decay length multiplied by gamma? Or perhaps the question is asking for the proper lifetime multiplied by the velocity? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spatial resolution as the decay length divided by gamma? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic effects in another way. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080 =8e-16 s. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The decay length is v \u03c4. \n\nWait, but perhaps the question wants the minimum spatial resolution so that the detector can resolve the decay. The resolution must be smaller than the average decay length. But the question says \"at least 30% of the decays\", so perhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least the resolution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think: \n\nThe decay occurs in a time \u03c4, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the distance is v*\u03c4. But maybe the time resolution is needed? No, the options are in meters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum spatial resolution so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the original path. To do so, the decay must occur a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance d is e^{-d/(L)}, where L is the mean decay length. \n\nWait, if the resolution is d, then the detector can only detect decays that are further than d. Wait, no, actually, if the resolution is d, then the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution to be seen as separate. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So, to observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance is e^{-d/L}, but we want the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution to be at least 30%? \n\nWait, no. If the detector can only resolve decays that are at least some distance away, then the probability of being observed would be the probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance. Because if the decay happens closer than the resolution, it can't be seen as a separate track. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nSuppose the detector has a spatial resolution of d. That means that any decay that happens within a distance less than d from the production point would not be resolvable as a separate decay. The decay would just look like a continuation of the original track. \n\nTherefore, to observe the decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than d. \n\nTherefore, the probability of observing a decay is the probability that the decay occurs beyond distance d. \n\nWe want this probability to be at least 30%. \n\nWait, but that would mean: \n\nProbability (decay occurs beyond d) = e^{-d/L} \u2265 0.3 \n\nTherefore, solving e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \n\nTake natural log: \n\n- d/L \u2265 ln(0.3) \u2192 \n\nd \u2264 - L ln(0.3) \n\nWait, but we need the minimum resolution (d) such that the probability of observing the decay is at least 30%. \n\nWait, the probability of observing is the probability that the decay is beyond d. So, if we want that probability to be \u2265 30%, then e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 \n\nd \u2264 - L ln(0.3). \n\nWait, but the resolution must be less than or equal to that d. \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So the resolution d must be such that the probability of observing (i.e., decay beyond d) is at least 30%. \n\nTherefore, setting e^{-d/L} =0.3 \u2192 solving for d gives d= - L ln(0.3). \n\nCalculating that: \n\nln(0.3) \u2248-1.20397 \n\nThus, d = - L * (-1.20397) = L *1.20397 \n\nSo d =1.8855e-6 m *1.204 \u2248 2.27e-6 m. \n\nHmm, but the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, maybe my calculation has some inaccuracies. Let me check the numbers again. \n\nFirst, let's recalculate L: \n\n\u03b3=27/(3.41)=27/3.41\u22487.91789 \n\n\u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 =7.91789 *8e-16 \u22486.3343e-15 s \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) *c \n\n1/\u03b3\u00b2 =1/(7.91789)^2\u22481/(62.7)\u22480.01594 \n\nso 1-0.01594=0.98406 \n\nsqrt(0.98406)=0.9920 \n\nv=0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s \n\nL =v*\u03c4=2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 \n\nLet me compute that more precisely: \n\n2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976 *6.3343) *1e-7 \n\n2.976 *6.3343: \n\nLet me compute 2.976 *6 =17.856 \n\n2.976 *0.3343: \n\n2.976 *0.3 =0.8928 \n\n2.976 *0.0343\u22480.102 \n\nTotal: 0.8928+0.102\u22480.9948 \n\nTotal 17.856+0.9948\u224818.8508 \n\nSo L =18.8508e-7 =1.88508e-6 m \n\nThen d = L * ln(1/0.3) \n\nln(1/0.3)=ln(3.3333)=1.1939 \n\nWait, ln(1/0.3)=ln(10/3)=ln(3.3333)=1.1939 \n\nWait, yes. So 1.1939. \n\nSo d=1.88508e-6 *1.1939\u2248 \n\n1.885 *1.1939: \n\n1.885 *1 =1.885 \n\n1.885 *0.1939 \u22480.365 \n\nTotal \u22482.25 \n\nThus, d\u22482.25e-6 m. \n\nHmm, the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but E is 27 GeV, and m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nWait, wait a second! Wait, hold on. The mass times c squared is the rest energy. So m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u22487.917. So that part was correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives around 2.25e-6 m, but the closest option is A)2.08e-6. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an error in the approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not considering the exponential distribution but the average decay length. \n\nWait, the problem says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". If the resolution is the distance required, then if the resolution is equal to the average decay length, then the probability of decaying before that distance is 1 - e^{-1} \u224863%. So to get 30%, maybe they just want 30% of the average? \n\nWait, if we take 0.3 times the average decay length, that would be 0.3 *1.885e-6\u22485.66e-7 m. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proper lifetime multiplied by the velocity, but not using gamma? \n\nWait, if someone forgets to consider time dilation and uses \u03c4\u2080 instead of \u03c4, then \u03c4 would be 8e-16 s, v is the same (but if using gamma from proper energy?), but that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think of another way. \n\nThe decay length is L = v * \u03c4. \n\nThe minimum resolution required to observe 30% of the decays would be the length such that the decay occurs within that distance with 30% probability. \n\nWait, so that would be the same as the previous approach, but that gives 0.356*L, but that would give a lower value than the average. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution to be the decay length multiplied by gamma? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the proper lifetime and not considering the Lorentz factor. \n\nWait, let's try that. \n\nIf someone forgets to account for time dilation and uses \u03c4\u2080, then \u03c4 =8e-16 s. \n\nThen v = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2/E\u00b2)c\u00b2) ? Wait, no. \n\nWait, without considering time dilation, but calculating the velocity based on energy. \n\nWait, the energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nTotal energy squared is (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 = (27 GeV)^2. \n\nSo (pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281=717.37 GeV\u00b2 \n\nThus, pc = sqrt(717.37) GeV \u224826.78 GeV \n\nThus, momentum p = 26.78 GeV /c \n\nThen velocity v = pc\u00b2 / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 ) \n\nWait, but perhaps more straightforwardly, \n\nv = (pc\u00b2)/E \n\nBecause E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nThus, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c^4)/c \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write v = (pc\u00b2)/E \n\nSo plugging numbers, \n\npc =26.78 GeV (since pc was sqrt(717.37 GeV\u00b2) \u224826.78 GeV). \n\nThus, v = (26.78 GeV * c\u00b2 ) / (27 GeV) ) \n\nThe GeV cancels, so v = (26.78 /27)*c \u22480.9918c \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSo v is still ~0.992c. \n\nSo even without time dilation, the velocity is the same. \n\nWait, but \u03c4 is the lifetime in lab frame. \n\nWait, if someone didn't consider time dilation, they would think \u03c4= \u03c4\u2080, so \u03c4=8e-16 s. Then L =v \u03c4 =0.992e8 m/s *8e-16 s\u22487.94e-8 m =7.94e-8 m. \n\nWhich is 7.94e-8 m, so the required d would be d =-L ln(0.7) =7.94e-8 *0.3567 \u22482.83e-8 m. That's even smaller and not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the proper decay length? \n\nProper decay length is v\u2080 \u03c4\u2080, where v\u2080 is velocity in the lab frame (since in the proper frame, the particle is at rest, so decay length is zero). Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation between the proper lifetime and the decay length without considering the velocity properly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in gamma. Let me check again. \n\nWait, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nE is 27 GeV. \n\nm c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nThus gamma =27/3.41 \u22487.917. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are A:2.08e-6, B:2.08e-9, C:2.08e-1, D:2.08e-3. \n\nThe calculation I did gives ~2.25e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6). The difference might be due to rounding during calculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me try that. \n\nCompute gamma: 27 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87 \n\n27-23.87=3.13 \n\nSo 3.13/3.41\u22480.9179 \n\nThus, gamma is 7.9179. \n\nThen \u03c4=7.9179 \u00d78e-16 = 6.33432e-15 seconds. \n\nv= sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3^2)) \n\n1/\u03b3\u00b2=1/(7.9179)^2. \n\n7.9179 squared: 7^2=49, 0.9179^2\u22480.8426, cross terms 2\u00d77\u00d70.9179\u224812.85 \n\nTotal approx (7+0.9179)^2= (7.9179)^2\u224862.7. \n\nSo 1/62.7=0.01594 \n\nThus, sqrt(1-0.01594)=sqrt(0.98406)=0.99200. \n\nThus, v=0.99200c =0.992*3e8=2.976e8 m/s. \n\nL=2.976e8 \u00d76.33432e-15 \n\nLet me compute this precisely: \n\n2.976e8 *6.33432e-15 = \n\nMultiply 2.976 \u00d76.33432 = \n\n2 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 \n\n0.976 \u00d76.33432 = \n\n0.9 \u00d76.33432=5.700888 \n\n0.076 \u00d76.33432=0.481005 \n\nTotal:5.700888+0.481005=6.181893 \n\nTotal sum:12.66864 +6.181893=18.85053 \n\nThus L=18.85053e-7 m =1.885053e-6 m. \n\nThen, d = L * ln(1/0.3) \n\nln(1/0.3)=ln(10/3)=1.2039728043 \n\nThus d=1.885053e-6 *1.2039728043 \n\nCalculating: \n\n1.885053 *1.2039728 \u2248 \n\n1 *1.2039728=1.2039728 \n\n0.885053 *1.2039728 \n\nLet me compute 0.8 *1.2039728=0.963178 \n\n0.085053*1.2039728\u22480.1024 \n\nTotal:0.963178+0.1024\u22481.0656 \n\nTotal sum:1.2039728+1.0656\u22482.2696 \n\nThus d\u22482.2696e-6 m. \n\nHmm, which is ~2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe options given are A)2.08e-6, which is close but not exact. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the proper decay length multiplied by gamma? \n\nWait, the proper decay length would be zero because in the particle's rest frame, it's not moving. But the lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the relation between the proper time and the decay length. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spatial resolution as the Lorentz contraction of the decay length? \n\nWait, the decay length in the lab frame is L = v \u03c4. The proper length (in the particle's frame) is zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to resolve the decay over the lifetime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula for the minimum distance, which is the average decay length multiplied by some factor. \n\nWait, let me think of another way. \n\nThe problem states that the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. The question is about the minimum resolution in the lab frame. \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, so the time taken for the particle to decay is longer. The distance it travels is v\u03b3\u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe resolution must be less than this distance to observe the decay. But the question wants 30% of the decays observed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the relation between the proper lifetime and the Lorentz factor, but using a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of the decay length as the mean free path, and the resolution must be smaller than that to resolve the decay. But to have 30% detection, perhaps they want the mean free path multiplied by a factor. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake in the options, but given the options, the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. \n\nWait, another way to calculate v is via the relation between energy and velocity. \n\nThe total energy is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. The momentum is p = \u03b3mv. \n\nWe can find v using p/E = v/c\u00b2. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nThen p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c^4)/c \n\nThen v = pc\u00b2 / E \n\nSo plugging in numbers: \n\nE =27 GeV \n\nm c\u00b2 =3.41 GeV \n\nThus, (pc) = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV \n\n= sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) \u224826.78 GeV \n\nThus p =26.78 GeV /c \n\nThen v = (26.78 GeV/c * c\u00b2 ) / (27 GeV) \n\nThe GeV cancels, so v = (26.78/c * c\u00b2 ) /27 \u2192 wait, maybe units again. \n\nWait, pc is in GeV (since p is in GeV/c and c is m/s, but perhaps in natural units where c=1). \n\nAlternatively, in terms of velocity, \n\nv/c = (pc)/E \n\nSo v/c = (26.78 GeV )/(27 GeV ) =0.9918 \n\nThus v =0.9918c, which matches previous calculation. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the proper time multiplied by the speed of light? \n\nBut c * \u03c4\u2080 =3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m. \n\nBut that's 2.4e-7 m, which is 2.4e-7 meters. Not an option either. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering relativistic Doppler effect? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution such that the decay is observed within the detector's length. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the size of the bubble chamber. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the probability calculation. \n\nWait, the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So if the resolution is d, then the probability that the decay occurs beyond d is e^{-d/L}, which we want to be \u226530%. \n\nWait, no, that's the probability of observing (since if it decays beyond d, you can see it). So setting e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 d \u2264 L * ln(1/0.3) \u2248 L *1.2039. \n\nSo d = L \u00d71.2039 \u22481.885e-6 \u00d71.2039\u22482.269e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the difference comes from using more precise values for constants. Let me see: \n\nLet me recalculate with more precise numbers. \n\nFirst, let's compute gamma precisely: \n\n27 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87 \n\n27-23.87 =3.13 \n\n3.13/3.41 = 0.9179 \n\nThus, gamma =7.9179 \n\n\u03c4 = gamma * \u03c4\u2080 =7.9179 \u00d78e-16 =6.33432e-15 seconds. \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) \n\ngamma squared is 7.9179^2. Let's calculate 7.9179^2: \n\n7.9^2 =62.41 \n\n0.0179^2 = ~0.0003 \n\nCross term 2\u00d77.9\u00d70.0179= 0.283 \n\nSo total (7.9+0.0179)^2 \u224862.41 +0.283 +0.0003 \u224862.693. \n\nWait, but more precisely, 7.9179 \u00d77.9179: \n\n7 \u00d77 =49 \n\n7 \u00d70.9179 =6.4253 \n\n0.9179 \u00d77 =6.4253 \n\n0.9179 \u00d70.9179 \u22480.8426 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\nFirst, 7.9179 \u00d77.9179 = \n\nLet me compute as (7 +0.9179)^2 =49 + 2\u00d77\u00d70.9179 +0.9179\u00b2 \n\n=49 +12.8506 +0.8426 = 49+13.6932=62.6932 \n\nThus gamma squared is 62.6932 \n\nThus 1/gamma squared is 1/62.6932 \u22480.01595 \n\nThus 1-0.01595=0.98405 \n\nsqrt(0.98405)=0.99200 (since 0.992^2=0.984064, very close). \n\nThus v=0.99200c. \n\nv=0.992 \u00d73e8 =2.976e8 m/s \n\nL= v \u00d7 tau =2.976e8 \u00d76.33432e-15 \n\nLet me compute 2.976 \u00d76.33432 \n\nLet me do it step by step: \n\n2 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 \n\n0.976 \u00d76.33432 \n\nBreakdown: \n\n0.9 \u00d76.33432 =5.700888 \n\n0.07 \u00d76.33432 =0.4434024 \n\n0.006 \u00d76.33432=0.0380059 \n\nTotal:5.700888+0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.0380059=6.1822963 \n\nThus total 2.976 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 +6.1822963=18.850936 \n\nThus L=18.850936e-7 m =1.8850936e-6 m \n\nThen d= L \u00d7 ln(1/0.3)=1.8850936e-6 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nLet me compute this: \n\n1.8850936 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nFirst, 1 \u00d71.2039728 =1.2039728 \n\n0.8850936 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nBreakdown: \n\n0.8 \u00d71.2039728=0.96317824 \n\n0.08 \u00d71.2039728=0.09631782 \n\n0.0050936 \u00d71.2039728\u22480.006134 \n\nAdding these:0.96317824 +0.09631782=1.059496 +0.006134\u22481.06563 \n\nTotal sum:1.2039728+1.06563\u22482.2696 \n\nThus, d\u22482.2696e-6 m. \n\nHmm, the problem's option A is 2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, perhaps the question used the approximation gamma=7.9, leading to slightly different numbers. Let me try with gamma=7.9. \n\ngamma=7.9 \n\ntau=7.9\u00d78e-16=6.32e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1 -1/62.41)= sqrt(1-0.01602)=sqrt(0.98398)=0.99196 \n\nv=0.99196e8 m/s \n\nL=0.99196e8 \u00d76.32e-15 = (0.99196\u00d76.32) \u00d71e-7 \n\n0.99196\u00d76.32 \u22486.267 \n\nThus L=6.267e-7 m=6.267e-7 m \u2192 6.267e-7 is 6.267e-7 m =6.267e-7 m, which is 6.27e-7 m. \n\nThen d= L \u00d71.2039 \n\n6.267e-7 \u00d71.2039 \u22487.54e-7 m \u2192 7.54e-7 m =7.54e-7 m \u2192 0.754e-6 m. \n\nNo, that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the average lifetime without gamma? \n\nWait, if someone forgets to multiply by gamma, then tau=tau0=8e-16 s. \n\nThen L =v tau =0.992e8 \u00d78e-16 =7.936e-8 m. \n\nThen d= L \u00d7 ln(1/0.3)=7.936e-8 \u00d71.2039 \u22489.54e-8 m, which is 9.54e-8 m =0.954e-7 m. \n\nNo, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the proper time multiplied by the velocity in the lab frame. \n\nv \u00d7 tau0 =0.992e8 \u00d78e-16=7.936e-8 m. \n\nBut that's even smaller. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the relation between energy and momentum to find the velocity, but in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the velocity as (E/mc^2) * c, but that would be greater than c, which is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the Lorentz contraction of the decay length. \n\nWait, the decay length in the lab frame is L = v gamma tau0. \n\nWait, no, because tau is already gamma tau0. So L= v gamma tau0. \n\nAlternatively, the proper length is zero. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be the decay length multiplied by 0.3? \n\n0.3\u00d71.885e-6 m \u22485.66e-7 m, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula where the decay length is \u03c4\u2080 multiplied by c, so 8e-16 \u00d73e8=2.4e-7 m, and then multiplied by gamma? \n\n2.4e-7 \u00d77.92=1.899e-6 m, which is the same as L. \n\nThen, to have 30%, it would be multiplied by ln(1/0.3) gives same result. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the answer is A, which is 2.08e-6 m. \n\nGiven that my calculation gives approximately 2.27e-6, which is close to 2.08e-6, perhaps rounding differences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, the energy is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nWait, if the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then the energy is 27 GeV. \n\nThus, gamma is 27/(3.41)\u22487.917. \n\nYes. \n\nThe proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nSo the lab lifetime is 7.917\u00d78e-16 =6.33e-15 s. \n\nVelocity is ~0.992c. \n\nDecay length is v * tau =0.992e8 m/s *6.33e-15 s \n\nWait, 0.992e8 is 9.92e7. \n\n9.92e7 m/s *6.33e-15 s = \n\nMultiply 9.92e7 *6.33e-15 = (9.92*6.33) *1e-8 \n\n9.92\u00d76.33: \n\n10\u00d76.33=63.3 \n\nsubtract 0.08\u00d76.33=0.5064 \u219263.3-0.5064=62.7936 \n\nThus 62.7936e-8 m =6.27936e-7 m =6.28e-7 m? \n\nWait, no, wait: \n\nWait, 9.92e7 *6.33e-15 = (9.92 *6.33) \u00d71e7 \u00d71e-15 = (62.7936) \u00d71e-8 =6.27936e-7 m. \n\nWait a second, this is different than before. Wait, what's happening here? \n\nHold on, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me recompute L properly. \n\nv =0.992c =0.992 \u00d73e8 m/s =2.976e8 m/s \n\ntau =6.3343e-15 seconds \n\nThus, L =v * tau =2.976e8 m/s \u00d76.3343e-15 s \n\nMultiply the numbers: \n\n2.976e8 \u00d76.3343e-15 = (2.976 \u00d76.3343) \u00d710^(8-15) \n\n= (2.976 \u00d76.3343) \u00d710^-7 \n\nEarlier I computed 2.976 \u00d76.3343 as approximately 18.85, so 18.85 \u00d71e-7 =1.885e-6 m. \n\nBut in this other approach, 9.92e7 \u00d76.33e-15: \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in that step. Let's see: \n\nWait 0.992e8 is 9.92e7, right. \n\nYes, so 9.92e7 \u00d76.33e-15 = (9.92 \u00d76.33) \u00d71e-8 \n\nWait, 9.92 \u00d76.33 = let's compute that: \n\n10 \u00d76.33 =63.3 \n\nminus 0.08 \u00d76.33 =0.5064 \n\n63.3-0.5064=62.7936 \n\nSo 62.7936 \u00d71e-8 =6.27936e-7 m, which is 6.28e-7 m? \n\nWait, this contradicts the previous result of ~1.885e-6 m. \n\nWait, what's the error here? \n\nAh! Wait, I see now. \n\nWait, 0.992e8 m/s is 9.92 \u00d710^7 m/s. \n\nMultiply by 6.3343e-15 seconds: \n\n9.92e7 *6.3343e-15 = (9.92 *6.3343) \u00d710^(7-15) \n\n= (62.79) \u00d710^-8 \n\n=6.279 \u00d710^-7 m \n\nWait, but this is conflicting with the previous result of ~1.88e-6 m. \n\nOh no, now I'm really confused. What's the mistake here? \n\nWait, no, wait, I think I made an error in the first calculation. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, 2.976e8 m/s \u00d76.3343e-15 s \n\n2.976e8 is 2.976 \u00d710^8 \n\n6.3343e-15 is 6.3343 \u00d710^-15 \n\nMultiply them: \n\n2.976 \u00d76.3343 = let's compute this precisely: \n\n2 \u00d76.3343 =12.6686 \n\n0.9 \u00d76.3343=5.70087 \n\n0.07 \u00d76.3343=0.443401 \n\n0.006 \u00d76.3343=0.0380058 \n\nAdding all parts: \n\n12.6686 +5.70087 =18.36947 \n\n+0.443401 \u219218.81287 \n\n+0.0380058 \u219218.8508758 \n\nThus, 2.976 \u00d76.3343 \u224818.8508758 \n\nThen, 10^8 \u00d710^-15 =10^-7 \n\nSo total is 18.8508758 \u00d710^-7 m =1.88508758e-6 m. \n\nAh! So the correct calculation gives 1.885e-6 m. \n\nIn the alternative calculation I made an error in the exponent. Because 2.976e8 is 2.976\u00d710^8, and multiplying by 6.33e-15 gives exponent 8-15 = -7, not -8. \n\nAh, so that was a mistake in the exponent. So the correct L is indeed ~1.885e-6 m. \n\nThus, the required d is approximately 2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the question uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me try gamma=8. \n\nIf gamma is 8, then \n\ntau=8\u00d78e-16=6.4e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1-1/64)=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)=0.9921567 \n\nv=0.9921567 \u00d73e8=2.97647e8 m/s \n\nL=2.97647e8 \u00d76.4e-15= (2.97647\u00d76.4) \u00d71e-7 \n\n2.97647\u00d76=17.8588 \n\n2.97647\u00d70.4=1.190588 \n\nTotal:17.8588+1.190588=19.0494 \u00d71e-7=1.90494e-6 m \n\nThen d=1.90494e-6 \u00d71.20397\u22482.293e-6 m \n\nStill not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the average decay length as the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light, then multiplied by gamma. \n\ntau0*c =8e-16\u00d73e8=2.4e-7 m \n\nMultiply by gamma=7.92 gives 2.4e-7 \u00d77.92=1.899e-6 m \u2192 same as L. \n\nThen, d= L \u00d71.2039\u22482.28e-6 \u2192 same. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the decay length divided by gamma? \n\nNo, that would give a smaller value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the resolution must be less than the decay length. So the minimum resolution is the decay length. But then the answer would be ~1.88e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the exponent of the options. \n\nWait, the options are: \n\nA)2.08*1e-6 m \n\nB)2.08*1e-9 m \n\nC)2.08*1e-1 m \n\nD)2.28*1e-3 m \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is A, and the slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nGiven that my calculated value is approximately 2.27e-6, which is close to 2.08e-6, but not extremely close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probability calculation. \n\nWait, the question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nIf the resolution is the maximum distance that can be resolved, then the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution is P(d) =1 - e^{-d/L}. We want this to be \u226530%: \n\n1 - e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 e^{-d/L} \u22640.7 \u2192 -d/L \u2264 ln(0.7) \u2192 d \u2265 -L ln(0.7) \n\nSo d must be at least L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so multiplying by -1 gives a positive number. \n\nThus, d \u2265 L * ( - ln(0.7) ) \n\nWait, so the minimum d is L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nWait, that would be d = L * 0.3567 \n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I did earlier. \n\nWait, I think I messed up the inequality direction. \n\nLet me re-derive this carefully: \n\nWe want the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution distance d to be \u226530% \n\nP(d) =1 - e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \n\n\u2192 e^{-d/L} \u22640.7 \n\nTake natural logarithm both sides: \n\nln(e^{-d/L}) \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\n\u2192 -d/L \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): \n\nd/L \u2265 -ln(0.7) \n\n\u2192 d \u2265 L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nThus, the minimum resolution d is L multiplied by (-ln(0.7)). \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so -ln(0.7)=0.3567. \n\nThus, d must be at least 0.3567*L. \n\nAh! This is the key mistake I made earlier. \n\nPreviously, I thought the question wanted the probability to observe decays beyond the resolution, but it actually wants the probability to observe decays within the resolution. \n\nWait, no, the wording says: \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution? Or within the resolution? \n\nThis is the critical point. \n\nThe resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So, if a decay occurs at a distance less than the resolution, the detector can't distinguish it from the original track, so it won't observe the decay. \n\nTo observe the decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nThus, the probability of observing is the probability that the decay occurs beyond d: P_obs = e^{-d/L} \n\nWe want P_obs \u22650.3 \n\nThus, e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 -d/L \u2265 ln(0.3) \u2192 d \u2264 -L ln(0.3) \n\nSo the maximum allowable d is -L ln(0.3), but the question asks for the minimum resolution needed. \n\nThe resolution is the maximum d such that the probability to observe is 30%. \n\nThus, the minimum resolution required is d_max = -L ln(0.3) \n\nSo that if the resolution is at most d_max, then the probability is at least 30%. \n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. \n\nThe resolution must be \u2264d_max, so the minimum resolution (smallest d that allows at least 30% observation) is d_max. \n\nAh! So the answer is d_max= -L ln(0.3)= L *1.2039 \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nThus, the value is ~2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the question used a different value for gamma. Let me see what gamma would give d=2.08e-6 m. \n\nWe have d= L * ln(1/0.3)= (v tau)*ln(1/0.3) \n\nSuppose d=2.08e-6 m. \n\nThen v tau= d / ln(1/0.3)=2.08e-6 /1.20397\u22481.728e-6 m \n\nSo L=1.728e-6 m \n\nL= v tau \n\nv= sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2)*c \n\ntau= gamma tau0 \n\nThus L= sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c * gamma tau0 \n\nLet me write this equation: \n\nL =c gamma tau0 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. \n\nL=1.728e-6 m \n\nc=3e8 m/s \n\ntau0=8e-16 s \n\nThus: \n\n1.728e-6 =3e8 * gamma *8e-16 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nSimplify the right side: \n\n3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 \n\nThus: \n\n1.728e-6 =2.4e-7 * gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nDivide both sides by 2.4e-7: \n\n(1.728e-6)/(2.4e-7)=7.2 = gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nLet me denote x=gamma. \n\nThus: \n\nx * sqrt(1 -1/x\u00b2)=7.2 \n\nSquare both sides: \n\nx\u00b2 (1 -1/x\u00b2 ) =51.84 \n\nx\u00b2 -1=51.84 \n\nx\u00b2=52.84 \u2192x\u22487.27 \n\nThus gamma is about7.27 \n\nThen, gamma= E/(m c\u00b2)=27/3.41=7.917 \n\nHmm, so if the answer requires gamma=7.27, then E would be 7.27 *3.41\u224824.8 GeV, but the given energy is27 GeV. \n\nSo this discrepancy suggests that either the question has a different approach or there's a rounding assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the average decay length directly multiplied by a factor of 0.3. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be the average decay length multiplied by 0.3, but that gives 0.3*1.88e-6=5.6e-7 m. \n\nNot an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the decay length as the proper time multiplied by the speed of light, and then multiplied by gamma. \n\n\u03c40 *c =8e-16 *3e8=2.4e-7 m \n\nMultiply by gamma: 2.4e-7 *7.917=1.899e-6 m, which is the same as L. \n\nThen, to get 30%, it's L multiplied by ln(1/0.3)=2.27e-6 m, but the options have A as 2.08e-6. \n\nPerhaps the question uses the natural logarithm of 0.3 as -1.20397, but rounded to -1.20? \n\nThen d= L *1.20 =1.885e-6 *1.20=2.262e-6 m. \n\nStill, the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different approximation for gamma. \n\nIf I take gamma=8, then L= v tau= \n\nv=sqrt(1-1/64)*c= sqrt(63/64)c\u22480.992156c \n\ntau=8e-16*8=6.4e-15 \n\nL=0.992156e8 *6.4e-15=6.35e-7 m \n\nWait, no, wait: \n\nWait, v=0.992156 \u00d73e8=2.97647e8 m/s \n\ntau=8e-16 \u00d78=6.4e-15 s \n\nL=2.97647e8 \u00d76.4e-15 = (2.97647\u00d76.4) \u00d71e-7 \n\n2.97647 \u00d76=17.8588 \n\n2.97647\u00d70.4=1.190588 \n\nTotal 19.0494 \u00d71e-7=1.9049e-6 m \n\nThen d=1.9049e-6 \u00d71.2039=2.293e-6 m. \n\nStill not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relativistic Doppler effect. \n\nThe decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau0, so the distance is v gamma tau0. \n\nBut that's the same as L. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a mistake in the exponent of the options. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). \n\nB is 2.08e-9 m (nanometers), which is too small. \n\nC is meters, way too big. \n\nD is millimeters, also too big. \n\nGiven that my calculated value is about 2.27e-6 m (2.27 micrometers), and the closest option is A (2.08e-6), I think the intended answer is A. \n\nPerhaps in the problem's calculation, they used gamma=7, leading to: \n\ngamma=7 \u2192tau=5.6e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1-1/49)=sqrt(48/49)=0.9798 \n\nL=0.9798e8 \u00d75.6e-15=5.486e-7 m \n\nThen d=5.486e-7 *1.2039\u22486.6e-7 m \u2192 not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they used a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a different approach. \n\nThe decay length is L = gamma * tau0 * c \n\nWait, that would be L = gamma * tau0 *c \n\nWait, but that is the same as v * gamma * tau0 /v? \n\nNo, wait, v is already gamma * something. \n\nWait, the decay length is v * tau = v * gamma * tau0 \n\nBut v = sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c \n\nThus, L= sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c * gamma * tau0 \n\n= c*gamma*tau0*sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nThis is what I had before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they use L = gamma * tau0 * c \n\nWhich would be \n\nL=7.917 *8e-16 *3e8 \n\n=7.917 *8*3 *1e-8 \n\n7.917*24=190.008 \n\nThus, L=190.008e-8 m =1.90008e-6 m \n\nThen d= L * ln(1/0.3)=1.90008e-6 *1.20397\u22482.287e-6 m \n\nStill close to 2.28e-6. \n\nAh! Here, if we take L as gamma * tau0 * c, that's different from the previous calculation. \n\nWait, why would they do that? \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the decay length is the proper time multiplied by c, then multiplied by gamma. \n\nThat is, L = gamma * c * tau0. \n\nBecause in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma. \n\nSo the distance is v * gamma * tau0. \n\nBut v is not c. \n\nBut if someone incorrectly uses v=c, then L=gamma *c *tau0. \n\nIn that case, \n\nL=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16 \n\nCalculate that: \n\n7.917 *3=23.751 \n\n23.751e8 *8e-16 = \n\n23.751 *8=190.008 \n\n190.008e-8 m =1.90008e-6 m \n\nThen, d=1.90008e-6 *1.20397=2.287e-6 m \n\nStill not matching the option A's 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the energy to find the momentum, then uses momentum to find velocity, but with a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the decay length is given by L = gamma * tau0 * v \n\nWhere v is the velocity. \n\nBut that's the same as what we've done. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the closest option to my calculation is A (2.08e-6 m), and the discrepancy might be due to rounding during the problem's creation, I think the intended answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the X\u2070 particle. Hmm, the given data includes the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 as 8\u00d710^-16 seconds, the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions in meters. \n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the bubble chamber, the particles are moving, so their lifetime from our perspective (the lab frame) would be longer. The problem mentions energy, so I think I need to calculate the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) to find the dilated lifetime. \n\nThe energy given is 27 GeV. Since the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV, the total energy (E) is related to the rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. Wait, but energy here is given in GeV, which is already E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. So maybe I can use that. Let me confirm: \n\nThe total energy of a particle is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. So rearranging, \u03b3 = E/(mc\u00b2). But since the mass is given in GeV, and energy is also in GeV, maybe the units work out. Let me check:\n\nIf E is 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (since mass in GeV is actually GeV/c\u00b2, but when using E=\u03b3mc\u00b2, the c\u00b2 would cancel out in the ratio. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E and m are in GeV and GeV/c\u00b2 respectively, then the c\u00b2 would actually be part of the units. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe since both E and m are given in units that include the c\u00b2 terms, the ratio E/(m) would directly give \u03b3. Let me think again. \n\nLet me write the equation properly. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But since the mass is given in GeV (but actually, the unit for mass should be GeV/c\u00b2), so if m is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then E/(m c\u00b2) would be (27 GeV)/( (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 ) ) = 27 /3.41 \u2248 7.917. So \u03b3 is approximately 7.917. \n\nTherefore, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is roughly 7.92. \n\nNow, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So \u03c4 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, how does resolution relate here? Maybe the decay length is important here. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the longer the decay length. But to observe the decay, the detector must have a resolution fine enough to detect the decay products. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution required is the distance the particle travels during its lifetime. But since they want at least 30% of decays observed, maybe we need to consider the decay length and the detector's spatial resolution. \n\nWait, the problem states \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So perhaps the resolution must be better than the average decay length multiplied by some factor? Let me think. \n\nThe decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The average decay length in the lab frame is v * \u03c4, where v is the velocity of the particle. But the particle's velocity can be found via v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nAlternatively, since \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute v. \n\nFirst, let me compute \u03b3 again. From earlier, \u03b3 is approximately 7.92. \n\nSo 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is about 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7 \u2248 0.01595. \n\nSo 1 - 0.01595 \u2248 0.98405. \n\nSo v = c * sqrt(0.98405) \u2248 c * 0.992. \n\nSo approximately 0.992c. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is very close to the speed of light. \n\nThe average decay length L would then be v * \u03c4. \n\nWait, but the decay occurs at a random time during the lifetime. The average decay length would be the average of v multiplied by the time until decay. Since the lifetime is exponentially distributed, the average lifetime is \u03c4, so average L is v * \u03c4. \n\nSo let's compute L. \n\nFirst, \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u2248 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nv is approx 0.992c. Let's use c as 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo v \u2248 0.992 * 3e8 m/s \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, L = v * \u03c4 = (2.976e8 m/s) * (6.336e-15 s) \n\nMultiplying those numbers: \n\n2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) * 1e-7 \n\nLet me compute 2.976 *6.336. \n\n2 *6.336 is 12.672, 0.976*6.336 is approx 6.172 (since 0.9*6.336=5.7024, 0.076*6.336\u22480.481, total \u22486.1834). So total is approx 12.672 +6.1834 \u224818.855. \n\nSo L \u2248 18.855e-7 meters, which is 1.8855e-6 meters, or approximately 1.89e-6 m. \n\nBut the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length so that the detector can distinguish the decay from the original particle. If the detector's resolution is too poor, it can't see the separation between the original track and the decay products, so the decay would not be observed. \n\nTherefore, to observe the decay, the resolution must be better than the average decay length. But the question specifies \"at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the spatial resolution needed such that the decay occurs within a detectable distance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the spatial resolution required to resolve the decay vertex from the production point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the time resolution? But the options are in meters, so it's spatial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution (like the distance between points the detector can resolve) so that a significant fraction of the decay paths are detectable. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might involve the lifetime of the particle and the distance traveled, but I need to think again. \n\nWait, another thought: in bubble chambers, the resolution is the distance between the points where the particle's path is recorded. To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a position that can be distinguished from the original track. So the decay length must be longer than the resolution. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within a distance L from the production point is given by the exponential decay distribution. The probability that the decay happens within a certain distance would be the integral from 0 to x of the decay probability density function. \n\nThe decay probability per unit distance is (1/\u03bb) e^(-x/\u03bb), where \u03bb is the mean free path (average decay length). The probability that the decay happens within a distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb). \n\nWe need this probability to be at least 30% (0.3). \n\nSo set 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb) \u2265 0.3 \n\nSolving for x: \n\ne^(-x/\u03bb) \u2264 0.7 \n\nTake natural log of both sides: \n\n- x/\u03bb \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): \n\nx/\u03bb \u2265 -ln(0.7) \n\nx \u2265 -\u03bb ln(0.7) \n\nCompute -ln(0.7): ln(1/0.7) \u2248 ln(1.4286) \u2248 0.3567 \n\nSo x \u2265 \u03bb *0.3567 \n\nTherefore, the required minimum distance x is 0.3567 * \u03bb \n\nWait, but the problem says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". The resolution would need to be better than this x. Hmm, perhaps the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay if it happens within that x. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So the detector's resolution must be less than the x that gives 30% probability. Wait, no, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the decay length so that the detector can see the decay. Alternatively, the resolution is the maximum distance between points, so the decay has to be longer than that to be detected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me check the options. The options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, C) 2.08e-1 m, D) 2.08e-3 m. \n\nEarlier, my calculation of L (the mean decay length) was ~1.89e-6 m. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of decays. \n\nWait, the mean decay length is ~1.89e-6 m. To have 30% of decays observed, perhaps the resolution must be better than the decay length multiplied by some factor. \n\nWait, if the detector has a resolution of d, then the decay must have a path longer than d to be detected. The probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than d is P(d) = e^(-d/\u03bb). Because the probability of surviving (not decaying) up to distance d is e^(-d/\u03bb). Wait, actually, the probability that the decay occurs after distance d is e^(-d/\u03bb). But we want the probability that it decays before distance d to be at least 30%? \n\nWait, the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So maybe the detector must be able to detect decays that occur within a distance d, and we need P(decay within d) \u2265 0.3. \n\nIn that case, the required d is found from 1 - e^{-d/\u03bb} \u2265 0.3 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo solving for d: d = -\u03bb ln(1 - 0.3) = -\u03bb ln(0.7) \u2248 \u03bb *0.3567 \n\nSo substituting \u03bb = v \u03c4 = v * \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \n\nWait, but earlier I calculated \u03bb \u22481.89e-6 m. \n\nThen d \u2248 1.89e-6 * 0.3567 \u2248 0.675e-6 m? \n\nWait, but that would give d \u22486.75e-7 m, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate. \n\nWait let me recalculate the decay length properly. Let me go step by step again. \n\nFirst, compute \u03b3. \n\nGiven: \n\nEnergy E = 27 GeV \n\nMass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 (since mass in GeV is actually GeV/c\u00b2, but when using E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, the units would be: \n\nE (GeV) = \u03b3 (m (GeV/c\u00b2)) c\u00b2 \u2192 so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c\u00b2, the c\u00b2 cancels out. \n\nWait, but the units might complicate here. Alternatively, perhaps better to write E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c\u00b2, so the denominator has m c\u00b2 in (GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 = GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 = (27 GeV)/(3.41 GeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2) \u2192 the c\u00b2 terms cancel, so it's 27 / 3.41 \u22487.917 as before. \n\nSo \u03b3 \u22487.92. \n\nNow, the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nThe dilated lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 \u22487.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nVelocity v = (c) * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). \n\nLet me compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2: 1/(7.92)^2 \u22481/62.7264\u22480.01594. \n\nSo 1 - 0.01594 \u22480.98406. \n\nsqrt(0.98406) \u22480.9920. \n\nThus, v \u22480.9920c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\nv \u22480.992 *3e8 \u22482.976e8 m/s. \n\nDecay length L = v * \u03c4 = 2.976e8 m/s *6.336e-15 s \n\nLet me compute that: \n\nMultiply 2.976e8 *6.336e-15 = (2.976 *6.336) * 1e-7 \n\nCalculating 2.976 *6.336: \n\n2 *6.336 = 12.672 \n\n0.976 *6.336: \n\n0.9*6.336=5.7024 \n\n0.076*6.336 = 0.481 \n\nTotal: 5.7024 +0.481 =6.1834 \n\nSo total 12.672 +6.1834 = 18.8554 \n\nThus, L =18.8554e-7 m =1.8855e-6 m, which is approximately 1.89e-6 meters. \n\nSo the average decay length is ~1.89e-6 m. \n\nNow, to find the distance d where the probability of decay within d is 30%, so 1 - e^{-d/L} =0.3 \u2192 e^{-d/L} =0.7 \u2192 -d/L = ln(0.7) \u2192 d = -L * ln(0.7) \n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667 \n\nSo d = L *0.35667 \u22481.8855e-6 *0.35667 \u22480.674e-6 m =6.74e-7 m. \n\nBut none of the options is that. The options are 2.08e-6, etc. \n\nHmm, so maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read the problem. \n\nThe question says: What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV. \n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the decay length multiplied by gamma? Or perhaps the question is asking for the proper lifetime multiplied by the velocity? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spatial resolution as the decay length divided by gamma? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic effects in another way. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080 =8e-16 s. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. The decay length is v \u03c4. \n\nWait, but perhaps the question wants the minimum spatial resolution so that the detector can resolve the decay. The resolution must be smaller than the average decay length. But the question says \"at least 30% of the decays\", so perhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least the resolution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think: \n\nThe decay occurs in a time \u03c4, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the distance is v*\u03c4. But maybe the time resolution is needed? No, the options are in meters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum spatial resolution so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the original path. To do so, the decay must occur a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance d is e^{-d/(L)}, where L is the mean decay length. \n\nWait, if the resolution is d, then the detector can only detect decays that are further than d. Wait, no, actually, if the resolution is d, then the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution to be seen as separate. \n\nWait, perhaps the resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So, to observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance is e^{-d/L}, but we want the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution to be at least 30%? \n\nWait, no. If the detector can only resolve decays that are at least some distance away, then the probability of being observed would be the probability that the decay occurs beyond the resolution distance. Because if the decay happens closer than the resolution, it can't be seen as a separate track. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nSuppose the detector has a spatial resolution of d. That means that any decay that happens within a distance less than d from the production point would not be resolvable as a separate decay. The decay would just look like a continuation of the original track. \n\nTherefore, to observe the decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than d. \n\nTherefore, the probability of observing a decay is the probability that the decay occurs beyond distance d. \n\nWe want this probability to be at least 30%. \n\nWait, but that would mean: \n\nProbability (decay occurs beyond d) = e^{-d/L} \u2265 0.3 \n\nTherefore, solving e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \n\nTake natural log: \n\n- d/L \u2265 ln(0.3) \u2192 \n\nd \u2264 - L ln(0.3) \n\nWait, but we need the minimum resolution (d) such that the probability of observing the decay is at least 30%. \n\nWait, the probability of observing is the probability that the decay is beyond d. So, if we want that probability to be \u2265 30%, then e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 \n\nd \u2264 - L ln(0.3). \n\nWait, but the resolution must be less than or equal to that d. \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So the resolution d must be such that the probability of observing (i.e., decay beyond d) is at least 30%. \n\nTherefore, setting e^{-d/L} =0.3 \u2192 solving for d gives d= - L ln(0.3). \n\nCalculating that: \n\nln(0.3) \u2248-1.20397 \n\nThus, d = - L * (-1.20397) = L *1.20397 \n\nSo d =1.8855e-6 m *1.204 \u2248 2.27e-6 m. \n\nHmm, but the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, maybe my calculation has some inaccuracies. Let me check the numbers again. \n\nFirst, let's recalculate L: \n\n\u03b3=27/(3.41)=27/3.41\u22487.91789 \n\n\u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 =7.91789 *8e-16 \u22486.3343e-15 s \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) *c \n\n1/\u03b3\u00b2 =1/(7.91789)^2\u22481/(62.7)\u22480.01594 \n\nso 1-0.01594=0.98406 \n\nsqrt(0.98406)=0.9920 \n\nv=0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s \n\nL =v*\u03c4=2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 \n\nLet me compute that more precisely: \n\n2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976 *6.3343) *1e-7 \n\n2.976 *6.3343: \n\nLet me compute 2.976 *6 =17.856 \n\n2.976 *0.3343: \n\n2.976 *0.3 =0.8928 \n\n2.976 *0.0343\u22480.102 \n\nTotal: 0.8928+0.102\u22480.9948 \n\nTotal 17.856+0.9948\u224818.8508 \n\nSo L =18.8508e-7 =1.88508e-6 m \n\nThen d = L * ln(1/0.3) \n\nln(1/0.3)=ln(3.3333)=1.1939 \n\nWait, ln(1/0.3)=ln(10/3)=ln(3.3333)=1.1939 \n\nWait, yes. So 1.1939. \n\nSo d=1.88508e-6 *1.1939\u2248 \n\n1.885 *1.1939: \n\n1.885 *1 =1.885 \n\n1.885 *0.1939 \u22480.365 \n\nTotal \u22482.25 \n\nThus, d\u22482.25e-6 m. \n\nHmm, the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) \u2192 but E is 27 GeV, and m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nWait, wait a second! Wait, hold on. The mass times c squared is the rest energy. So m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u22487.917. So that part was correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives around 2.25e-6 m, but the closest option is A)2.08e-6. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an error in the approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not considering the exponential distribution but the average decay length. \n\nWait, the problem says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". If the resolution is the distance required, then if the resolution is equal to the average decay length, then the probability of decaying before that distance is 1 - e^{-1} \u224863%. So to get 30%, maybe they just want 30% of the average? \n\nWait, if we take 0.3 times the average decay length, that would be 0.3 *1.885e-6\u22485.66e-7 m. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proper lifetime multiplied by the velocity, but not using gamma? \n\nWait, if someone forgets to consider time dilation and uses \u03c4\u2080 instead of \u03c4, then \u03c4 would be 8e-16 s, v is the same (but if using gamma from proper energy?), but that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think of another way. \n\nThe decay length is L = v * \u03c4. \n\nThe minimum resolution required to observe 30% of the decays would be the length such that the decay occurs within that distance with 30% probability. \n\nWait, so that would be the same as the previous approach, but that gives 0.356*L, but that would give a lower value than the average. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution to be the decay length multiplied by gamma? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the proper lifetime and not considering the Lorentz factor. \n\nWait, let's try that. \n\nIf someone forgets to account for time dilation and uses \u03c4\u2080, then \u03c4 =8e-16 s. \n\nThen v = sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2/E\u00b2)c\u00b2) ? Wait, no. \n\nWait, without considering time dilation, but calculating the velocity based on energy. \n\nWait, the energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nTotal energy squared is (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 = (27 GeV)^2. \n\nSo (pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281=717.37 GeV\u00b2 \n\nThus, pc = sqrt(717.37) GeV \u224826.78 GeV \n\nThus, momentum p = 26.78 GeV /c \n\nThen velocity v = pc\u00b2 / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 ) \n\nWait, but perhaps more straightforwardly, \n\nv = (pc\u00b2)/E \n\nBecause E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nThus, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c^4)/c \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to write v = (pc\u00b2)/E \n\nSo plugging numbers, \n\npc =26.78 GeV (since pc was sqrt(717.37 GeV\u00b2) \u224826.78 GeV). \n\nThus, v = (26.78 GeV * c\u00b2 ) / (27 GeV) ) \n\nThe GeV cancels, so v = (26.78 /27)*c \u22480.9918c \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nSo v is still ~0.992c. \n\nSo even without time dilation, the velocity is the same. \n\nWait, but \u03c4 is the lifetime in lab frame. \n\nWait, if someone didn't consider time dilation, they would think \u03c4= \u03c4\u2080, so \u03c4=8e-16 s. Then L =v \u03c4 =0.992e8 m/s *8e-16 s\u22487.94e-8 m =7.94e-8 m. \n\nWhich is 7.94e-8 m, so the required d would be d =-L ln(0.7) =7.94e-8 *0.3567 \u22482.83e-8 m. That's even smaller and not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the proper decay length? \n\nProper decay length is v\u2080 \u03c4\u2080, where v\u2080 is velocity in the lab frame (since in the proper frame, the particle is at rest, so decay length is zero). Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation between the proper lifetime and the decay length without considering the velocity properly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in gamma. Let me check again. \n\nWait, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nE is 27 GeV. \n\nm c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nThus gamma =27/3.41 \u22487.917. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Let me see the options again. \n\nThe options are A:2.08e-6, B:2.08e-9, C:2.08e-1, D:2.08e-3. \n\nThe calculation I did gives ~2.25e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6). The difference might be due to rounding during calculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me try that. \n\nCompute gamma: 27 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87 \n\n27-23.87=3.13 \n\nSo 3.13/3.41\u22480.9179 \n\nThus, gamma is 7.9179. \n\nThen \u03c4=7.9179 \u00d78e-16 = 6.33432e-15 seconds. \n\nv= sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3^2)) \n\n1/\u03b3\u00b2=1/(7.9179)^2. \n\n7.9179 squared: 7^2=49, 0.9179^2\u22480.8426, cross terms 2\u00d77\u00d70.9179\u224812.85 \n\nTotal approx (7+0.9179)^2= (7.9179)^2\u224862.7. \n\nSo 1/62.7=0.01594 \n\nThus, sqrt(1-0.01594)=sqrt(0.98406)=0.99200. \n\nThus, v=0.99200c =0.992*3e8=2.976e8 m/s. \n\nL=2.976e8 \u00d76.33432e-15 \n\nLet me compute this precisely: \n\n2.976e8 *6.33432e-15 = \n\nMultiply 2.976 \u00d76.33432 = \n\n2 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 \n\n0.976 \u00d76.33432 = \n\n0.9 \u00d76.33432=5.700888 \n\n0.076 \u00d76.33432=0.481005 \n\nTotal:5.700888+0.481005=6.181893 \n\nTotal sum:12.66864 +6.181893=18.85053 \n\nThus L=18.85053e-7 m =1.885053e-6 m. \n\nThen, d = L * ln(1/0.3) \n\nln(1/0.3)=ln(10/3)=1.2039728043 \n\nThus d=1.885053e-6 *1.2039728043 \n\nCalculating: \n\n1.885053 *1.2039728 \u2248 \n\n1 *1.2039728=1.2039728 \n\n0.885053 *1.2039728 \n\nLet me compute 0.8 *1.2039728=0.963178 \n\n0.085053*1.2039728\u22480.1024 \n\nTotal:0.963178+0.1024\u22481.0656 \n\nTotal sum:1.2039728+1.0656\u22482.2696 \n\nThus d\u22482.2696e-6 m. \n\nHmm, which is ~2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe options given are A)2.08e-6, which is close but not exact. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the proper decay length multiplied by gamma? \n\nWait, the proper decay length would be zero because in the particle's rest frame, it's not moving. But the lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the relation between the proper time and the decay length. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spatial resolution as the Lorentz contraction of the decay length? \n\nWait, the decay length in the lab frame is L = v \u03c4. The proper length (in the particle's frame) is zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to resolve the decay over the lifetime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula for the minimum distance, which is the average decay length multiplied by some factor. \n\nWait, let me think of another way. \n\nThe problem states that the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080. The question is about the minimum resolution in the lab frame. \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, so the time taken for the particle to decay is longer. The distance it travels is v\u03b3\u03c4\u2080. \n\nThe resolution must be less than this distance to observe the decay. But the question wants 30% of the decays observed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the relation between the proper lifetime and the Lorentz factor, but using a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of the decay length as the mean free path, and the resolution must be smaller than that to resolve the decay. But to have 30% detection, perhaps they want the mean free path multiplied by a factor. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake in the options, but given the options, the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. \n\nWait, another way to calculate v is via the relation between energy and velocity. \n\nThe total energy is E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. The momentum is p = \u03b3mv. \n\nWe can find v using p/E = v/c\u00b2. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nSo (pc)^2 = E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 \n\nThen p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c^4)/c \n\nThen v = pc\u00b2 / E \n\nSo plugging in numbers: \n\nE =27 GeV \n\nm c\u00b2 =3.41 GeV \n\nThus, (pc) = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV \n\n= sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) \u224826.78 GeV \n\nThus p =26.78 GeV /c \n\nThen v = (26.78 GeV/c * c\u00b2 ) / (27 GeV) \n\nThe GeV cancels, so v = (26.78/c * c\u00b2 ) /27 \u2192 wait, maybe units again. \n\nWait, pc is in GeV (since p is in GeV/c and c is m/s, but perhaps in natural units where c=1). \n\nAlternatively, in terms of velocity, \n\nv/c = (pc)/E \n\nSo v/c = (26.78 GeV )/(27 GeV ) =0.9918 \n\nThus v =0.9918c, which matches previous calculation. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the proper time multiplied by the speed of light? \n\nBut c * \u03c4\u2080 =3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m. \n\nBut that's 2.4e-7 m, which is 2.4e-7 meters. Not an option either. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering relativistic Doppler effect? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum spatial resolution such that the decay is observed within the detector's length. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the size of the bubble chamber. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the probability calculation. \n\nWait, the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So if the resolution is d, then the probability that the decay occurs beyond d is e^{-d/L}, which we want to be \u226530%. \n\nWait, no, that's the probability of observing (since if it decays beyond d, you can see it). So setting e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 d \u2264 L * ln(1/0.3) \u2248 L *1.2039. \n\nSo d = L \u00d71.2039 \u22481.885e-6 \u00d71.2039\u22482.269e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the difference comes from using more precise values for constants. Let me see: \n\nLet me recalculate with more precise numbers. \n\nFirst, let's compute gamma precisely: \n\n27 divided by 3.41. \n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87 \n\n27-23.87 =3.13 \n\n3.13/3.41 = 0.9179 \n\nThus, gamma =7.9179 \n\n\u03c4 = gamma * \u03c4\u2080 =7.9179 \u00d78e-16 =6.33432e-15 seconds. \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) \n\ngamma squared is 7.9179^2. Let's calculate 7.9179^2: \n\n7.9^2 =62.41 \n\n0.0179^2 = ~0.0003 \n\nCross term 2\u00d77.9\u00d70.0179= 0.283 \n\nSo total (7.9+0.0179)^2 \u224862.41 +0.283 +0.0003 \u224862.693. \n\nWait, but more precisely, 7.9179 \u00d77.9179: \n\n7 \u00d77 =49 \n\n7 \u00d70.9179 =6.4253 \n\n0.9179 \u00d77 =6.4253 \n\n0.9179 \u00d70.9179 \u22480.8426 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\nFirst, 7.9179 \u00d77.9179 = \n\nLet me compute as (7 +0.9179)^2 =49 + 2\u00d77\u00d70.9179 +0.9179\u00b2 \n\n=49 +12.8506 +0.8426 = 49+13.6932=62.6932 \n\nThus gamma squared is 62.6932 \n\nThus 1/gamma squared is 1/62.6932 \u22480.01595 \n\nThus 1-0.01595=0.98405 \n\nsqrt(0.98405)=0.99200 (since 0.992^2=0.984064, very close). \n\nThus v=0.99200c. \n\nv=0.992 \u00d73e8 =2.976e8 m/s \n\nL= v \u00d7 tau =2.976e8 \u00d76.33432e-15 \n\nLet me compute 2.976 \u00d76.33432 \n\nLet me do it step by step: \n\n2 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 \n\n0.976 \u00d76.33432 \n\nBreakdown: \n\n0.9 \u00d76.33432 =5.700888 \n\n0.07 \u00d76.33432 =0.4434024 \n\n0.006 \u00d76.33432=0.0380059 \n\nTotal:5.700888+0.4434024=6.1442904 +0.0380059=6.1822963 \n\nThus total 2.976 \u00d76.33432 =12.66864 +6.1822963=18.850936 \n\nThus L=18.850936e-7 m =1.8850936e-6 m \n\nThen d= L \u00d7 ln(1/0.3)=1.8850936e-6 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nLet me compute this: \n\n1.8850936 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nFirst, 1 \u00d71.2039728 =1.2039728 \n\n0.8850936 \u00d71.2039728 \n\nBreakdown: \n\n0.8 \u00d71.2039728=0.96317824 \n\n0.08 \u00d71.2039728=0.09631782 \n\n0.0050936 \u00d71.2039728\u22480.006134 \n\nAdding these:0.96317824 +0.09631782=1.059496 +0.006134\u22481.06563 \n\nTotal sum:1.2039728+1.06563\u22482.2696 \n\nThus, d\u22482.2696e-6 m. \n\nHmm, the problem's option A is 2.08e-6 m. \n\nWait, perhaps the question used the approximation gamma=7.9, leading to slightly different numbers. Let me try with gamma=7.9. \n\ngamma=7.9 \n\ntau=7.9\u00d78e-16=6.32e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1 -1/62.41)= sqrt(1-0.01602)=sqrt(0.98398)=0.99196 \n\nv=0.99196e8 m/s \n\nL=0.99196e8 \u00d76.32e-15 = (0.99196\u00d76.32) \u00d71e-7 \n\n0.99196\u00d76.32 \u22486.267 \n\nThus L=6.267e-7 m=6.267e-7 m \u2192 6.267e-7 is 6.267e-7 m =6.267e-7 m, which is 6.27e-7 m. \n\nThen d= L \u00d71.2039 \n\n6.267e-7 \u00d71.2039 \u22487.54e-7 m \u2192 7.54e-7 m =7.54e-7 m \u2192 0.754e-6 m. \n\nNo, that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the average lifetime without gamma? \n\nWait, if someone forgets to multiply by gamma, then tau=tau0=8e-16 s. \n\nThen L =v tau =0.992e8 \u00d78e-16 =7.936e-8 m. \n\nThen d= L \u00d7 ln(1/0.3)=7.936e-8 \u00d71.2039 \u22489.54e-8 m, which is 9.54e-8 m =0.954e-7 m. \n\nNo, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the proper time multiplied by the velocity in the lab frame. \n\nv \u00d7 tau0 =0.992e8 \u00d78e-16=7.936e-8 m. \n\nBut that's even smaller. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the relation between energy and momentum to find the velocity, but in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using the velocity as (E/mc^2) * c, but that would be greater than c, which is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the Lorentz contraction of the decay length. \n\nWait, the decay length in the lab frame is L = v gamma tau0. \n\nWait, no, because tau is already gamma tau0. So L= v gamma tau0. \n\nAlternatively, the proper length is zero. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be the decay length multiplied by 0.3? \n\n0.3\u00d71.885e-6 m \u22485.66e-7 m, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula where the decay length is \u03c4\u2080 multiplied by c, so 8e-16 \u00d73e8=2.4e-7 m, and then multiplied by gamma? \n\n2.4e-7 \u00d77.92=1.899e-6 m, which is the same as L. \n\nThen, to have 30%, it would be multiplied by ln(1/0.3) gives same result. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the answer is A, which is 2.08e-6 m. \n\nGiven that my calculation gives approximately 2.27e-6, which is close to 2.08e-6, perhaps rounding differences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, the energy is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nWait, if the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, then the energy is 27 GeV. \n\nThus, gamma is 27/(3.41)\u22487.917. \n\nYes. \n\nThe proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. \n\nSo the lab lifetime is 7.917\u00d78e-16 =6.33e-15 s. \n\nVelocity is ~0.992c. \n\nDecay length is v * tau =0.992e8 m/s *6.33e-15 s \n\nWait, 0.992e8 is 9.92e7. \n\n9.92e7 m/s *6.33e-15 s = \n\nMultiply 9.92e7 *6.33e-15 = (9.92*6.33) *1e-8 \n\n9.92\u00d76.33: \n\n10\u00d76.33=63.3 \n\nsubtract 0.08\u00d76.33=0.5064 \u219263.3-0.5064=62.7936 \n\nThus 62.7936e-8 m =6.27936e-7 m =6.28e-7 m? \n\nWait, no, wait: \n\nWait, 9.92e7 *6.33e-15 = (9.92 *6.33) \u00d71e7 \u00d71e-15 = (62.7936) \u00d71e-8 =6.27936e-7 m. \n\nWait a second, this is different than before. Wait, what's happening here? \n\nHold on, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me recompute L properly. \n\nv =0.992c =0.992 \u00d73e8 m/s =2.976e8 m/s \n\ntau =6.3343e-15 seconds \n\nThus, L =v * tau =2.976e8 m/s \u00d76.3343e-15 s \n\nMultiply the numbers: \n\n2.976e8 \u00d76.3343e-15 = (2.976 \u00d76.3343) \u00d710^(8-15) \n\n= (2.976 \u00d76.3343) \u00d710^-7 \n\nEarlier I computed 2.976 \u00d76.3343 as approximately 18.85, so 18.85 \u00d71e-7 =1.885e-6 m. \n\nBut in this other approach, 9.92e7 \u00d76.33e-15: \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in that step. Let's see: \n\nWait 0.992e8 is 9.92e7, right. \n\nYes, so 9.92e7 \u00d76.33e-15 = (9.92 \u00d76.33) \u00d71e-8 \n\nWait, 9.92 \u00d76.33 = let's compute that: \n\n10 \u00d76.33 =63.3 \n\nminus 0.08 \u00d76.33 =0.5064 \n\n63.3-0.5064=62.7936 \n\nSo 62.7936 \u00d71e-8 =6.27936e-7 m, which is 6.28e-7 m? \n\nWait, this contradicts the previous result of ~1.885e-6 m. \n\nWait, what's the error here? \n\nAh! Wait, I see now. \n\nWait, 0.992e8 m/s is 9.92 \u00d710^7 m/s. \n\nMultiply by 6.3343e-15 seconds: \n\n9.92e7 *6.3343e-15 = (9.92 *6.3343) \u00d710^(7-15) \n\n= (62.79) \u00d710^-8 \n\n=6.279 \u00d710^-7 m \n\nWait, but this is conflicting with the previous result of ~1.88e-6 m. \n\nOh no, now I'm really confused. What's the mistake here? \n\nWait, no, wait, I think I made an error in the first calculation. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, 2.976e8 m/s \u00d76.3343e-15 s \n\n2.976e8 is 2.976 \u00d710^8 \n\n6.3343e-15 is 6.3343 \u00d710^-15 \n\nMultiply them: \n\n2.976 \u00d76.3343 = let's compute this precisely: \n\n2 \u00d76.3343 =12.6686 \n\n0.9 \u00d76.3343=5.70087 \n\n0.07 \u00d76.3343=0.443401 \n\n0.006 \u00d76.3343=0.0380058 \n\nAdding all parts: \n\n12.6686 +5.70087 =18.36947 \n\n+0.443401 \u219218.81287 \n\n+0.0380058 \u219218.8508758 \n\nThus, 2.976 \u00d76.3343 \u224818.8508758 \n\nThen, 10^8 \u00d710^-15 =10^-7 \n\nSo total is 18.8508758 \u00d710^-7 m =1.88508758e-6 m. \n\nAh! So the correct calculation gives 1.885e-6 m. \n\nIn the alternative calculation I made an error in the exponent. Because 2.976e8 is 2.976\u00d710^8, and multiplying by 6.33e-15 gives exponent 8-15 = -7, not -8. \n\nAh, so that was a mistake in the exponent. So the correct L is indeed ~1.885e-6 m. \n\nThus, the required d is approximately 2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the question uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me try gamma=8. \n\nIf gamma is 8, then \n\ntau=8\u00d78e-16=6.4e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1-1/64)=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)=0.9921567 \n\nv=0.9921567 \u00d73e8=2.97647e8 m/s \n\nL=2.97647e8 \u00d76.4e-15= (2.97647\u00d76.4) \u00d71e-7 \n\n2.97647\u00d76=17.8588 \n\n2.97647\u00d70.4=1.190588 \n\nTotal:17.8588+1.190588=19.0494 \u00d71e-7=1.90494e-6 m \n\nThen d=1.90494e-6 \u00d71.20397\u22482.293e-6 m \n\nStill not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the average decay length as the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light, then multiplied by gamma. \n\ntau0*c =8e-16\u00d73e8=2.4e-7 m \n\nMultiply by gamma=7.92 gives 2.4e-7 \u00d77.92=1.899e-6 m \u2192 same as L. \n\nThen, d= L \u00d71.2039\u22482.28e-6 \u2192 same. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the decay length divided by gamma? \n\nNo, that would give a smaller value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the resolution must be less than the decay length. So the minimum resolution is the decay length. But then the answer would be ~1.88e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the exponent of the options. \n\nWait, the options are: \n\nA)2.08*1e-6 m \n\nB)2.08*1e-9 m \n\nC)2.08*1e-1 m \n\nD)2.28*1e-3 m \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is A, and the slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nGiven that my calculated value is approximately 2.27e-6, which is close to 2.08e-6, but not extremely close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probability calculation. \n\nWait, the question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nIf the resolution is the maximum distance that can be resolved, then the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution is P(d) =1 - e^{-d/L}. We want this to be \u226530%: \n\n1 - e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 e^{-d/L} \u22640.7 \u2192 -d/L \u2264 ln(0.7) \u2192 d \u2265 -L ln(0.7) \n\nSo d must be at least L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so multiplying by -1 gives a positive number. \n\nThus, d \u2265 L * ( - ln(0.7) ) \n\nWait, so the minimum d is L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nWait, that would be d = L * 0.3567 \n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I did earlier. \n\nWait, I think I messed up the inequality direction. \n\nLet me re-derive this carefully: \n\nWe want the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution distance d to be \u226530% \n\nP(d) =1 - e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \n\n\u2192 e^{-d/L} \u22640.7 \n\nTake natural logarithm both sides: \n\nln(e^{-d/L}) \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\n\u2192 -d/L \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): \n\nd/L \u2265 -ln(0.7) \n\n\u2192 d \u2265 L * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nThus, the minimum resolution d is L multiplied by (-ln(0.7)). \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so -ln(0.7)=0.3567. \n\nThus, d must be at least 0.3567*L. \n\nAh! This is the key mistake I made earlier. \n\nPreviously, I thought the question wanted the probability to observe decays beyond the resolution, but it actually wants the probability to observe decays within the resolution. \n\nWait, no, the wording says: \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". To observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution? Or within the resolution? \n\nThis is the critical point. \n\nThe resolution is the minimum distance that can be resolved. So, if a decay occurs at a distance less than the resolution, the detector can't distinguish it from the original track, so it won't observe the decay. \n\nTo observe the decay, the decay must occur at a distance greater than the resolution. \n\nThus, the probability of observing is the probability that the decay occurs beyond d: P_obs = e^{-d/L} \n\nWe want P_obs \u22650.3 \n\nThus, e^{-d/L} \u22650.3 \u2192 -d/L \u2265 ln(0.3) \u2192 d \u2264 -L ln(0.3) \n\nSo the maximum allowable d is -L ln(0.3), but the question asks for the minimum resolution needed. \n\nThe resolution is the maximum d such that the probability to observe is 30%. \n\nThus, the minimum resolution required is d_max = -L ln(0.3) \n\nSo that if the resolution is at most d_max, then the probability is at least 30%. \n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. \n\nThe resolution must be \u2264d_max, so the minimum resolution (smallest d that allows at least 30% observation) is d_max. \n\nAh! So the answer is d_max= -L ln(0.3)= L *1.2039 \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nThus, the value is ~2.27e-6 m. \n\nThe closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. \n\nPerhaps the question used a different value for gamma. Let me see what gamma would give d=2.08e-6 m. \n\nWe have d= L * ln(1/0.3)= (v tau)*ln(1/0.3) \n\nSuppose d=2.08e-6 m. \n\nThen v tau= d / ln(1/0.3)=2.08e-6 /1.20397\u22481.728e-6 m \n\nSo L=1.728e-6 m \n\nL= v tau \n\nv= sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2)*c \n\ntau= gamma tau0 \n\nThus L= sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c * gamma tau0 \n\nLet me write this equation: \n\nL =c gamma tau0 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. \n\nL=1.728e-6 m \n\nc=3e8 m/s \n\ntau0=8e-16 s \n\nThus: \n\n1.728e-6 =3e8 * gamma *8e-16 * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nSimplify the right side: \n\n3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 \n\nThus: \n\n1.728e-6 =2.4e-7 * gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nDivide both sides by 2.4e-7: \n\n(1.728e-6)/(2.4e-7)=7.2 = gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nLet me denote x=gamma. \n\nThus: \n\nx * sqrt(1 -1/x\u00b2)=7.2 \n\nSquare both sides: \n\nx\u00b2 (1 -1/x\u00b2 ) =51.84 \n\nx\u00b2 -1=51.84 \n\nx\u00b2=52.84 \u2192x\u22487.27 \n\nThus gamma is about7.27 \n\nThen, gamma= E/(m c\u00b2)=27/3.41=7.917 \n\nHmm, so if the answer requires gamma=7.27, then E would be 7.27 *3.41\u224824.8 GeV, but the given energy is27 GeV. \n\nSo this discrepancy suggests that either the question has a different approach or there's a rounding assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the average decay length directly multiplied by a factor of 0.3. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to be the average decay length multiplied by 0.3, but that gives 0.3*1.88e-6=5.6e-7 m. \n\nNot an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the decay length as the proper time multiplied by the speed of light, and then multiplied by gamma. \n\n\u03c40 *c =8e-16 *3e8=2.4e-7 m \n\nMultiply by gamma: 2.4e-7 *7.917=1.899e-6 m, which is the same as L. \n\nThen, to get 30%, it's L multiplied by ln(1/0.3)=2.27e-6 m, but the options have A as 2.08e-6. \n\nPerhaps the question uses the natural logarithm of 0.3 as -1.20397, but rounded to -1.20? \n\nThen d= L *1.20 =1.885e-6 *1.20=2.262e-6 m. \n\nStill, the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different approximation for gamma. \n\nIf I take gamma=8, then L= v tau= \n\nv=sqrt(1-1/64)*c= sqrt(63/64)c\u22480.992156c \n\ntau=8e-16*8=6.4e-15 \n\nL=0.992156e8 *6.4e-15=6.35e-7 m \n\nWait, no, wait: \n\nWait, v=0.992156 \u00d73e8=2.97647e8 m/s \n\ntau=8e-16 \u00d78=6.4e-15 s \n\nL=2.97647e8 \u00d76.4e-15 = (2.97647\u00d76.4) \u00d71e-7 \n\n2.97647 \u00d76=17.8588 \n\n2.97647\u00d70.4=1.190588 \n\nTotal 19.0494 \u00d71e-7=1.9049e-6 m \n\nThen d=1.9049e-6 \u00d71.2039=2.293e-6 m. \n\nStill not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the relativistic Doppler effect. \n\nThe decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau0, so the distance is v gamma tau0. \n\nBut that's the same as L. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a mistake in the exponent of the options. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). \n\nB is 2.08e-9 m (nanometers), which is too small. \n\nC is meters, way too big. \n\nD is millimeters, also too big. \n\nGiven that my calculated value is about 2.27e-6 m (2.27 micrometers), and the closest option is A (2.08e-6), I think the intended answer is A. \n\nPerhaps in the problem's calculation, they used gamma=7, leading to: \n\ngamma=7 \u2192tau=5.6e-15 \n\nv= sqrt(1-1/49)=sqrt(48/49)=0.9798 \n\nL=0.9798e8 \u00d75.6e-15=5.486e-7 m \n\nThen d=5.486e-7 *1.2039\u22486.6e-7 m \u2192 not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they used a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a different approach. \n\nThe decay length is L = gamma * tau0 * c \n\nWait, that would be L = gamma * tau0 *c \n\nWait, but that is the same as v * gamma * tau0 /v? \n\nNo, wait, v is already gamma * something. \n\nWait, the decay length is v * tau = v * gamma * tau0 \n\nBut v = sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c \n\nThus, L= sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2)*c * gamma * tau0 \n\n= c*gamma*tau0*sqrt(1-1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nThis is what I had before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they use L = gamma * tau0 * c \n\nWhich would be \n\nL=7.917 *8e-16 *3e8 \n\n=7.917 *8*3 *1e-8 \n\n7.917*24=190.008 \n\nThus, L=190.008e-8 m =1.90008e-6 m \n\nThen d= L * ln(1/0.3)=1.90008e-6 *1.20397\u22482.287e-6 m \n\nStill close to 2.28e-6. \n\nAh! Here, if we take L as gamma * tau0 * c, that's different from the previous calculation. \n\nWait, why would they do that? \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the decay length is the proper time multiplied by c, then multiplied by gamma. \n\nThat is, L = gamma * c * tau0. \n\nBecause in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma. \n\nSo the distance is v * gamma * tau0. \n\nBut v is not c. \n\nBut if someone incorrectly uses v=c, then L=gamma *c *tau0. \n\nIn that case, \n\nL=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16 \n\nCalculate that: \n\n7.917 *3=23.751 \n\n23.751e8 *8e-16 = \n\n23.751 *8=190.008 \n\n190.008e-8 m =1.90008e-6 m \n\nThen, d=1.90008e-6 *1.20397=2.287e-6 m \n\nStill not matching the option A's 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the energy to find the momentum, then uses momentum to find velocity, but with a different formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the decay length is given by L = gamma * tau0 * v \n\nWhere v is the velocity. \n\nBut that's the same as what we've done. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the closest option to my calculation is A (2.08e-6 m), and the discrepancy might be due to rounding during the problem's creation, I think the intended answer is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the \\(X^0\\) particle, we first calculate the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) using the given energy (27 GeV) and mass (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) of the particle:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m c^2} = \\frac{27 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 7.92\n\\]\n\nThe proper lifetime (\\(\\tau_0\\)) of \\(X^0\\) is \\(8 \\times 10^{-16}\\) seconds.
