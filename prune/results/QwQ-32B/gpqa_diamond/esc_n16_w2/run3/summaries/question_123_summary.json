      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the galactic center. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. They also mention that both frames are inertial, and we can ignore gravity, rotation, etc. Hmm, so this is a relativity problem involving different frames. Since the speeds are significant (60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light, since c is about 300,000 km/s), we need to consider special relativity here.\n\nFirst, let's note the given data. The ejecta sees the galaxy's center approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds, and we need the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (which would be the proper time or not? Wait, maybe I need to think about time dilation and length contraction here).\n\nWait, the key is that the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes would be longer due to time dilation. Because when you have a moving clock, the observer in the other frame sees the moving clock's time as dilated. So the ejecta's clock (which is moving relative to the Galaxy) would have a time that's measured as longer in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, actually, time dilation works both ways. Each frame sees the other's clock as running slower. But since we have the time in the ejecta's frame (t'), we need to compute the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame (t), then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nAlternatively, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity (as seen in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. But first, I need to find the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, hold on. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta has some velocity v. But according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Since they are inertial frames moving at a constant velocity relative to each other, their relative speed should be the same, but in opposite directions. Wait, but according to special relativity, the velocity addition is different. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as u. Then, from the ejecta's frame (which is moving at speed u relative to the Galaxy), the Galaxy's center is approaching at speed v' = 60,000 km/s. The question is, what is u?\n\nIn special relativity, the velocity transformation between frames is given by:\n\nv' = (u + v) / (1 + (uv)/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, but maybe I need to set this up correctly. Let me think of the Galaxy frame as S, and the ejecta frame as S', moving at velocity u relative to S. Then, in S', the Galaxy's center is approaching at v' = 60,000 km/s. The formula for the velocity in the other frame would be:\n\nv' = ( -u + 0 ) / (1 - (u*0)/c\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let me recall that if in frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so, towards the origin, say), then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving towards it at velocity v'. \n\nThe formula for transforming velocity from S to S' is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should use the standard velocity addition formula. Let me get this straight. Let me consider that in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so direction is negative if we set the center as the origin). Then in the ejecta's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity u relative to S, the center is approaching at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe velocity transformation from S to S' is given by:\n\nu' = ( (u_S - v) ) / (1 - (u_S v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the velocity of the center in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me denote:\n\nLet me denote the velocity of S' (the ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy) as v_ejecta = u (so S' is moving at +u in S's frame, if u is the speed towards the center). Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me set up coordinates properly.\n\nLet\u2019s define the Galaxy\u2019s frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (origin) in S with velocity u (a negative value if direction is considered, but let's take magnitude for now). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to S (so in S, the ejecta is moving at speed u towards the center; in S', the center is approaching at speed v'=60,000 km/s). \n\nThe formula for the velocity of the center in S' (the ejecta's frame) is given by:\n\nv' = (v_Galaxy_in_S'_frame) = (velocity of S frame as seen from S') \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that if in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so the center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u in S's terms?), no. Wait, in S, the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at speed u. So from the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is approaching at speed v', which is related to u via the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nThe formula for transforming the velocity from S to S' is:\n\nv' = ( (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c\u00b2) )\n\nWait, but in this case, in S, the center is stationary (velocity 0), so the velocity of the center in S' would be:\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame. Let me recall that the velocity addition formula states that if an object has velocity w in frame S, then its velocity in S' (moving at velocity v relative to S) is (w - v)/(1 - (w v)/c\u00b2). \n\nIn this case, the center of the Galaxy is at rest in S (so w = 0). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity u (relative to S) towards the center. Wait, the direction is important here. Let me define the direction: Let's assume that in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the origin (the center) along the positive direction. Wait, perhaps better to set coordinates so that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving along the positive x-axis towards the center (so the center is at some position, but the ejecta is moving towards it with velocity u in the positive direction). Then in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity u relative to S, the center is approaching at velocity v'. \n\nSo applying the velocity transformation formula: the center's velocity in S' is (w - u)/(1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 ), where w is the velocity of the center in S. Since the center is stationary in S, w = 0. Therefore, the velocity of the center in S' is (0 - u)/(1 - 0) = -u. But the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so the velocity in S' would be +60,000 km/s (assuming towards the ejecta is positive in S'). Wait, maybe there's a sign confusion here. Let me think again.\n\nIf in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center (say, along the negative x-direction if the center is at the origin and the ejecta is moving from positive x to origin). So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = -60,000 km/s (if that's the speed), but no, the problem states that in S', the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. Hmm, perhaps better to set u as the speed in S, so that the ejecta is moving towards the center (so direction is towards the origin). \n\nWait, perhaps I need to set the velocity in S as u (magnitude towards the center), so the velocity is -u in the coordinate system where the center is at rest. Then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is approaching at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. \n\nSo using the velocity transformation formula for the center's velocity in S':\n\nv' = ( (0 - u) ) / (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u. But the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at v' = +60,000 km/s, so perhaps the negative sign indicates direction. So the magnitude would be u = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but that would mean that u is 60,000 km/s in S's frame? But that can't be right, because if S' is moving at u relative to S, then in S', the center would have velocity -u. So if that's equal to +60,000 km/s, then u must be -60,000 km/s? Wait, maybe the direction is flipped here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity of the center in S' is v' = 60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta), so in terms of the formula:\n\nThe velocity of the center in S' is given by:\n\nv' = ( (w - u) ) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nwhere w is the velocity of the center in S (which is zero), so:\n\nv' = (0 - u) / (1 - 0) = -u. \n\nTherefore, -u = v' (the velocity in S'). But the velocity in S' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, so the sign would be positive. So -u = +60,000 km/s \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s. \n\nWait, the velocity u in S is -60,000 km/s? But that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s away from the center? That contradicts the problem statement which says the ejecta is moving towards the center. Hmm, confusion here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the direction. Let me try to set up coordinates so that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center (origin) along the positive x-axis. Wait, maybe that's conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me set the origin of S (Galaxy frame) at the center. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity in S is towards the origin. Let's choose coordinates so that the ejecta is moving along the negative x-axis towards the origin. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is -u (negative direction). But the ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity -u relative to S. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me instead use the formula properly. Let's suppose in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v = -u (towards the center). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity v = -u relative to S. The center is at rest in S. The velocity of the center in S' is given by:\n\nv' = ( (w - v) ) / (1 - (w v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. So:\n\nv' = (0 - (-u)) / (1 - 0) = u. \n\nTherefore, the velocity of the center in S' is u. The problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that velocity is +60,000 km/s (assuming towards the ejecta is positive in S'). Therefore, u = 60,000 km/s. \n\nAh! So that means the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy frame is u = 60,000 km/s. Because the velocity of the center in S' is u. So that resolves that part. So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but that can't be, because if that's the case, then the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would just be u multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. \n\nWait, so the key is that the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed (t) would be longer due to time dilation. Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. \n\nLet me compute the gamma factor first. \n\nThe velocity u is 60,000 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So the velocity as a fraction of c is v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2. \n\nTherefore, gamma (\u03b3) is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). \n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798/10 \u2248 0.9899. So 1/0.9899 \u2248 1.0101. Wait, but wait, that seems low. Wait, 0.2 squared is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is indeed about 0.9798, so 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute more accurately:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So gamma \u2248 1.0206. \n\nSo the time dilation factor is gamma. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is gamma multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame (t'). \n\nSo t = \u03b3 * t' = 1.0206 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but wait, time dilation works such that the moving clock (ejecta's frame) runs slower from the perspective of the stationary frame (Galaxy). So the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So yes, t = gamma * t'. \n\nSo the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame would be its speed (u) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t). \n\nSo distance = u * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km. \n\nHmm, but looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. So that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst, I found that the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. Because when we applied the velocity transformation, the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame is u. So that's correct. \n\nThen time dilation: t = gamma * t'. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute this more precisely. \n\nsqrt(0.96) can be calculated as follows. Let me compute 0.96:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me use a calculator approach. \n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798 as before. \n\nThus, gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nSo t = 1.020620726 * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.031. \n\nCalculating that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.031 = 61,860. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,860 = 3,061,860 km. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000\n\nB) 3,000,000\n\nC) 2,880,000\n\nD) 3,060,000\n\nSo 3,061,860 is closest to D) 3,060,000. Since the question might be expecting an exact value, perhaps I made an approximation error. Let me see if there's a better way to calculate gamma without approximating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the exact value. Let's compute gamma precisely. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \n\nv = 6e4 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s. \n\n(v/c)^2 = (6e4 / 3e5)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. \n\nSo 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 (2*2.44949)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. \n\nThus, gamma = 1 / 0.9797958976 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nThus, gamma is exactly 1/sqrt(0.96) which can also be written as sqrt(25/24) since 25/24 = 1.041666..., but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think: the problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using length contraction. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center travels towards it would be v' * t', where v' is 6e4 km/s and t' is 50 s. So that distance would be 6e4 *50 = 3,000,000 km. \n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the distance should be different because of length contraction. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the distance the center moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Lorentz transformation. Let me consider the coordinates. \n\nIn the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u = 60,000 km/s (towards the center, so let's say negative x-direction). \n\nIn the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (positive x' direction). \n\nThe distance the ejecta travels in S's frame over the time t (which is the time in S's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in S') is simply u * t. \n\nAlternatively, the proper time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. The relationship between the proper time (\u03c4) and the time in the other frame is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. Wait, the ejecta's own clock measures the proper time. So the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is related to the proper time (\u03c4 =50 s) by t = gamma * \u03c4. \n\nTherefore, t = gamma * 50 s \u2248 1.0206 *50 \u2248 51.03 s. \n\nThus, the distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, so the closest is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach where the distance is calculated in the ejecta's frame and then adjusted via length contraction. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so the distance is 60,000 *50 = 3e6 km. \n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the distance should be longer because of length contraction? Wait, length contraction is such that lengths in the direction of motion are contracted in the moving frame. \n\nWait, the distance between the ejecta and the center in the Galaxy's frame would be different. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of its own time. \n\nHmm, maybe I should stick with the first method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity? But given the high speed (60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light), so relativistic effects are non-negligible. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question where they just want you to multiply 60,000 by 50, but that would be 3,000,000 km (option B), but that would be in the ejecta's frame. The problem says the time is in the ejecta's frame, so the distance in the galaxy's frame must account for time dilation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use classical time dilation, but no, even so, the calculation still holds. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nIf I did everything correctly, the answer should be D, 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me double-check the velocity. \n\nEarlier, I thought that in the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at v'=60,000 km/s, so the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame (S) is u = v' (from the velocity transformation). \n\nWait, the velocity transformation formula gave that v' = u (when the center is stationary in S). Wait, let's re-derive that again carefully. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nIn the Galaxy frame S: the ejecta is moving at velocity u (towards the center, so let's take u as positive towards the center, so direction is positive). \n\nIn the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at velocity v'. \n\nThe velocity transformation equation is:\n\nv' = (w - u) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. \n\nTherefore, v' = (0 - u) / (1 - 0) = -u. \n\nWait, this is conflicting with my previous conclusion. \n\nWait, if in S, the ejecta is moving at +u (towards the center, which is at rest in S), then in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity +u relative to S, the center's velocity is v' = (-u) as per this formula. \n\nBut the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that would be a positive velocity in S', so the equation says -u = v', so u = -v'? \n\nWait, perhaps I have the direction reversed. Let's set coordinate systems such that in S (Galaxy), the center is at rest at the origin, and the ejecta is moving along the positive x-direction away from the center, but that can't be because it's moving towards the center. So perhaps the ejecta is moving in the negative x direction in S. \n\nWait, let me set up coordinates: \n\nLet\u2019s set the Galaxy's frame S with the center at the origin. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so in S, the ejecta has velocity u = -60,000 km/s (if we take the direction towards the center as negative). Wait, but then in S', the ejecta's frame, the center would be moving towards it. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u (towards the center, so if the center is at x=0, then the ejecta is moving in the negative x direction, so u is negative, say u = -60,000 km/s. \n\nThen in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity u relative to S (i.e., S' has velocity u = -60,000 km/s in S), the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) would be: \n\nv' = ( (w - u) ) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. \n\nThus, v' = (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - 0) = 60,000 km/s. \n\nAh, that's correct! So if the ejecta's velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), then in S', the center is approaching at +60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 60,000 km/s towards the center (so the speed is 60,000 km/s). \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation holds. \n\nThus, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is u * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t', where t' is 50 seconds. \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) with v = 6e4 km/s. \n\nAs before, gamma \u22481.02062, so t \u224851.03 seconds. \n\nThus, distance is 6e4 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which rounds to D) 3,060,000 km. \n\nSo I think D is the correct answer. The options don't have the exact value but D is the closest. \n\nWait, but let me check if perhaps the question expects a classical approach, ignoring relativity. If so, then the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But given that the speed is a significant fraction of c (20%), relativity must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the velocity of the ejecta is 60,000 km/s. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"from the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.\" \n\nIf I use the velocity addition formula correctly, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 60,000 km/s. Because as I derived, when the center is moving at v' =60,000 km/s in S', then the speed in S is u = v', but with direction considered. \n\nWait, in the calculation above, when the ejecta's velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), then the center's speed in S' is 60,000 km/s, which matches the problem's statement. \n\nTherefore, the speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. \n\nThus, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the galactic center. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem states that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. They also mention that both frames are inertial, and we can ignore gravity, rotation, etc. Hmm, so this is a relativity problem involving different frames. Since the speeds are significant (60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light, since c is about 300,000 km/s), we need to consider special relativity here.\n\nFirst, let's note the given data. The ejecta sees the galaxy's center approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds, and we need the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (which would be the proper time or not? Wait, maybe I need to think about time dilation and length contraction here).\n\nWait, the key is that the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes would be longer due to time dilation. Because when you have a moving clock, the observer in the other frame sees the moving clock's time as dilated. So the ejecta's clock (which is moving relative to the Galaxy) would have a time that's measured as longer in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, actually, time dilation works both ways. Each frame sees the other's clock as running slower. But since we have the time in the ejecta's frame (t'), we need to compute the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame (t), then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.\n\nAlternatively, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity (as seen in the Galaxy's frame) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. But first, I need to find the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, hold on. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta has some velocity v. But according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Since they are inertial frames moving at a constant velocity relative to each other, their relative speed should be the same, but in opposite directions. Wait, but according to special relativity, the velocity addition is different. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as u. Then, from the ejecta's frame (which is moving at speed u relative to the Galaxy), the Galaxy's center is approaching at speed v' = 60,000 km/s. The question is, what is u?\n\nIn special relativity, the velocity transformation between frames is given by:\n\nv' = (u + v) / (1 + (uv)/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, but maybe I need to set this up correctly. Let me think of the Galaxy frame as S, and the ejecta frame as S', moving at velocity u relative to S. Then, in S', the Galaxy's center is approaching at v' = 60,000 km/s. The formula for the velocity in the other frame would be:\n\nv' = ( -u + 0 ) / (1 - (u*0)/c\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let me recall that if in frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so, towards the origin, say), then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving towards it at velocity v'. \n\nThe formula for transforming velocity from S to S' is:\n\nu' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should use the standard velocity addition formula. Let me get this straight. Let me consider that in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so direction is negative if we set the center as the origin). Then in the ejecta's frame (S'), which is moving at velocity u relative to S, the center is approaching at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe velocity transformation from S to S' is given by:\n\nu' = ( (u_S - v) ) / (1 - (u_S v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the velocity of the center in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me denote:\n\nLet me denote the velocity of S' (the ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy) as v_ejecta = u (so S' is moving at +u in S's frame, if u is the speed towards the center). Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me set up coordinates properly.\n\nLet\u2019s define the Galaxy\u2019s frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (origin) in S with velocity u (a negative value if direction is considered, but let's take magnitude for now). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to S (so in S, the ejecta is moving at speed u towards the center; in S', the center is approaching at speed v'=60,000 km/s). \n\nThe formula for the velocity of the center in S' (the ejecta's frame) is given by:\n\nv' = (v_Galaxy_in_S'_frame) = (velocity of S frame as seen from S') \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that if in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center (so the center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u in S's terms?), no. Wait, in S, the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving towards it at speed u. So from the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is approaching at speed v', which is related to u via the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nThe formula for transforming the velocity from S to S' is:\n\nv' = ( (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c\u00b2) )\n\nWait, but in this case, in S, the center is stationary (velocity 0), so the velocity of the center in S' would be:\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame. Let me recall that the velocity addition formula states that if an object has velocity w in frame S, then its velocity in S' (moving at velocity v relative to S) is (w - v)/(1 - (w v)/c\u00b2). \n\nIn this case, the center of the Galaxy is at rest in S (so w = 0). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity u (relative to S) towards the center. Wait, the direction is important here. Let me define the direction: Let's assume that in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the origin (the center) along the positive direction. Wait, perhaps better to set coordinates so that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving along the positive x-axis towards the center (so the center is at some position, but the ejecta is moving towards it with velocity u in the positive direction). Then in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity u relative to S, the center is approaching at velocity v'. \n\nSo applying the velocity transformation formula: the center's velocity in S' is (w - u)/(1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 ), where w is the velocity of the center in S. Since the center is stationary in S, w = 0. Therefore, the velocity of the center in S' is (0 - u)/(1 - 0) = -u. But the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so the velocity in S' would be +60,000 km/s (assuming towards the ejecta is positive in S'). Wait, maybe there's a sign confusion here. Let me think again.\n\nIf in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center (say, along the negative x-direction if the center is at the origin and the ejecta is moving from positive x to origin). So the velocity of the ejecta in S is u = -60,000 km/s (if that's the speed), but no, the problem states that in S', the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. Hmm, perhaps better to set u as the speed in S, so that the ejecta is moving towards the center (so direction is towards the origin). \n\nWait, perhaps I need to set the velocity in S as u (magnitude towards the center), so the velocity is -u in the coordinate system where the center is at rest. Then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is approaching at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. \n\nSo using the velocity transformation formula for the center's velocity in S':\n\nv' = ( (0 - u) ) / (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u. But the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at v' = +60,000 km/s, so perhaps the negative sign indicates direction. So the magnitude would be u = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but that would mean that u is 60,000 km/s in S's frame? But that can't be right, because if S' is moving at u relative to S, then in S', the center would have velocity -u. So if that's equal to +60,000 km/s, then u must be -60,000 km/s? Wait, maybe the direction is flipped here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity of the center in S' is v' = 60,000 km/s (towards the ejecta), so in terms of the formula:\n\nThe velocity of the center in S' is given by:\n\nv' = ( (w - u) ) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nwhere w is the velocity of the center in S (which is zero), so:\n\nv' = (0 - u) / (1 - 0) = -u. \n\nTherefore, -u = v' (the velocity in S'). But the velocity in S' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, so the sign would be positive. So -u = +60,000 km/s \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s. \n\nWait, the velocity u in S is -60,000 km/s? But that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s away from the center? That contradicts the problem statement which says the ejecta is moving towards the center. Hmm, confusion here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the direction. Let me try to set up coordinates so that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving towards the center (origin) along the positive x-axis. Wait, maybe that's conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me set the origin of S (Galaxy frame) at the center. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity in S is towards the origin. Let's choose coordinates so that the ejecta is moving along the negative x-axis towards the origin. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is -u (negative direction). But the ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity -u relative to S. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me instead use the formula properly. Let's suppose in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v = -u (towards the center). The ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity v = -u relative to S. The center is at rest in S. The velocity of the center in S' is given by:\n\nv' = ( (w - v) ) / (1 - (w v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. So:\n\nv' = (0 - (-u)) / (1 - 0) = u. \n\nTherefore, the velocity of the center in S' is u. The problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that velocity is +60,000 km/s (assuming towards the ejecta is positive in S'). Therefore, u = 60,000 km/s. \n\nAh! So that means the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy frame is u = 60,000 km/s. Because the velocity of the center in S' is u. So that resolves that part. So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but that can't be, because if that's the case, then the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would just be u multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. \n\nWait, so the key is that the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (t') is 50 seconds, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed (t) would be longer due to time dilation. Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. \n\nLet me compute the gamma factor first. \n\nThe velocity u is 60,000 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So the velocity as a fraction of c is v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2. \n\nTherefore, gamma (\u03b3) is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). \n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798/10 \u2248 0.9899. So 1/0.9899 \u2248 1.0101. Wait, but wait, that seems low. Wait, 0.2 squared is 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is indeed about 0.9798, so 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute more accurately:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898 /5 \u2248 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So gamma \u2248 1.0206. \n\nSo the time dilation factor is gamma. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is gamma multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame (t'). \n\nSo t = \u03b3 * t' = 1.0206 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, but wait, time dilation works such that the moving clock (ejecta's frame) runs slower from the perspective of the stationary frame (Galaxy). So the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer. So yes, t = gamma * t'. \n\nSo the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame would be its speed (u) multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t). \n\nSo distance = u * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km. \n\nHmm, but looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. So that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. \n\nFirst, I found that the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. Because when we applied the velocity transformation, the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame is u. So that's correct. \n\nThen time dilation: t = gamma * t'. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute this more precisely. \n\nsqrt(0.96) can be calculated as follows. Let me compute 0.96:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me use a calculator approach. \n\nsqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798 as before. \n\nThus, gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nSo t = 1.020620726 * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.031. \n\nCalculating that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.031 = 61,860. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,860 = 3,061,860 km. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000\n\nB) 3,000,000\n\nC) 2,880,000\n\nD) 3,060,000\n\nSo 3,061,860 is closest to D) 3,060,000. Since the question might be expecting an exact value, perhaps I made an approximation error. Let me see if there's a better way to calculate gamma without approximating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the exact value. Let's compute gamma precisely. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \n\nv = 6e4 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s. \n\n(v/c)^2 = (6e4 / 3e5)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. \n\nSo 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 (2*2.44949)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. \n\nThus, gamma = 1 / 0.9797958976 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nThus, gamma is exactly 1/sqrt(0.96) which can also be written as sqrt(25/24) since 25/24 = 1.041666..., but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think: the problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using length contraction. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center travels towards it would be v' * t', where v' is 6e4 km/s and t' is 50 s. So that distance would be 6e4 *50 = 3,000,000 km. \n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the distance should be different because of length contraction. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the distance the center moves towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Lorentz transformation. Let me consider the coordinates. \n\nIn the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u = 60,000 km/s (towards the center, so let's say negative x-direction). \n\nIn the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at velocity v' = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (positive x' direction). \n\nThe distance the ejecta travels in S's frame over the time t (which is the time in S's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in S') is simply u * t. \n\nAlternatively, the proper time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. The relationship between the proper time (\u03c4) and the time in the other frame is \u03c4 = t / gamma. Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object. Wait, the ejecta's own clock measures the proper time. So the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is related to the proper time (\u03c4 =50 s) by t = gamma * \u03c4. \n\nTherefore, t = gamma * 50 s \u2248 1.0206 *50 \u2248 51.03 s. \n\nThus, the distance is 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, so the closest is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach where the distance is calculated in the ejecta's frame and then adjusted via length contraction. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so the distance is 60,000 *50 = 3e6 km. \n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, the distance should be longer because of length contraction? Wait, length contraction is such that lengths in the direction of motion are contracted in the moving frame. \n\nWait, the distance between the ejecta and the center in the Galaxy's frame would be different. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of its own time. \n\nHmm, maybe I should stick with the first method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity? But given the high speed (60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light), so relativistic effects are non-negligible. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question where they just want you to multiply 60,000 by 50, but that would be 3,000,000 km (option B), but that would be in the ejecta's frame. The problem says the time is in the ejecta's frame, so the distance in the galaxy's frame must account for time dilation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use classical time dilation, but no, even so, the calculation still holds. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nIf I did everything correctly, the answer should be D, 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me double-check the velocity. \n\nEarlier, I thought that in the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at v'=60,000 km/s, so the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame (S) is u = v' (from the velocity transformation). \n\nWait, the velocity transformation formula gave that v' = u (when the center is stationary in S). Wait, let's re-derive that again carefully. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nIn the Galaxy frame S: the ejecta is moving at velocity u (towards the center, so let's take u as positive towards the center, so direction is positive). \n\nIn the ejecta's frame S', the center is moving at velocity v'. \n\nThe velocity transformation equation is:\n\nv' = (w - u) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. \n\nTherefore, v' = (0 - u) / (1 - 0) = -u. \n\nWait, this is conflicting with my previous conclusion. \n\nWait, if in S, the ejecta is moving at +u (towards the center, which is at rest in S), then in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity +u relative to S, the center's velocity is v' = (-u) as per this formula. \n\nBut the problem states that in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that would be a positive velocity in S', so the equation says -u = v', so u = -v'? \n\nWait, perhaps I have the direction reversed. Let's set coordinate systems such that in S (Galaxy), the center is at rest at the origin, and the ejecta is moving along the positive x-direction away from the center, but that can't be because it's moving towards the center. So perhaps the ejecta is moving in the negative x direction in S. \n\nWait, let me set up coordinates: \n\nLet\u2019s set the Galaxy's frame S with the center at the origin. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so in S, the ejecta has velocity u = -60,000 km/s (if we take the direction towards the center as negative). Wait, but then in S', the ejecta's frame, the center would be moving towards it. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u (towards the center, so if the center is at x=0, then the ejecta is moving in the negative x direction, so u is negative, say u = -60,000 km/s. \n\nThen in the ejecta's frame S', which is moving at velocity u relative to S (i.e., S' has velocity u = -60,000 km/s in S), the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) would be: \n\nv' = ( (w - u) ) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, w is the velocity of the center in S, which is 0. \n\nThus, v' = (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - 0) = 60,000 km/s. \n\nAh, that's correct! So if the ejecta's velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), then in S', the center is approaching at +60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 60,000 km/s towards the center (so the speed is 60,000 km/s). \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation holds. \n\nThus, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is u * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t', where t' is 50 seconds. \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) with v = 6e4 km/s. \n\nAs before, gamma \u22481.02062, so t \u224851.03 seconds. \n\nThus, distance is 6e4 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km, which rounds to D) 3,060,000 km. \n\nSo I think D is the correct answer. The options don't have the exact value but D is the closest. \n\nWait, but let me check if perhaps the question expects a classical approach, ignoring relativity. If so, then the distance would be 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But given that the speed is a significant fraction of c (20%), relativity must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the velocity of the ejecta is 60,000 km/s. Let me think again. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says \"from the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.\" \n\nIf I use the velocity addition formula correctly, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 60,000 km/s. Because as I derived, when the center is moving at v' =60,000 km/s in S', then the speed in S is u = v', but with direction considered. \n\nWait, in the calculation above, when the ejecta's velocity in S is u = -60,000 km/s (towards the center), then the center's speed in S' is 60,000 km/s, which matches the problem's statement. \n\nTherefore, the speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. \n\nThus, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a supernova ejecta moving towards the galactic center at a significant fraction of the speed of light, requiring relativistic calculations. \n\n1. **Determine the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame**: \n   - From the ejecta's frame (S'), the center moves at 60,000 km/s. Using the velocity transformation formula, the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame (S) is found to be 60,000 km/s (towards the center).\n\n2. **Calculate time dilation**:\n   - The ejecta's frame (t') has a time of 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is longer due to time dilation. \n   - The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is calculated as \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}} \\), where \\( v = 60,000 \\) km/s and \\( c = 300,000 \\) km/s. \n   - \\( v/c = 0.2 \\), so \\( \\gamma \\approx 1.0206 \\). \n   - Galaxy frame time: \\( t = \\gamma \\times t' \\approx 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\) seconds.\n\n3. **Compute distance traveled**:\n   - Distance in the Galaxy's frame is \\( \\text{velocity} \\times \\text{time} = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,800 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n\nThe closest option to this value is **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy, and we need to find the distance it travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, right. The key here is understanding reference frames and maybe time dilation because of relativity?\n\nWait, the problem mentions both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Since the ejecta is moving at a high speed (60,000 km/s) relative to the galaxy, we might need to consider special relativity effects. The question is about distance traveled in the galaxy's frame, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, so time dilation comes into play here. \n\nFirst, let's recall that in special relativity, time measured in one frame (proper time) is related to time in another frame by the Lorentz factor. The formula is \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394t', where \u0394t is the time in the galaxy's frame, and \u0394t' is the time in the ejecta's frame (the 50 seconds here). Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc. So the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me check how that compares to the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo first, compute gamma. Let's compute v\u00b2/c\u00b2. Since v = 0.2c, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - that is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98. Hmm, so gamma would be 1/0.98 \u2248 1.0204. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. \n\nWait sqrt(0.96) is the same as sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is about 1.0206. So gamma is approximately 1.0206. \n\nSo the time in the galaxy's frame would be \u0394t = gamma * \u0394t' = 1.0206 * 50 seconds \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame would be the speed multiplied by that time. The speed in the galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Then 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total would be 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options given are A) 2,940,000; B) 3,000,000; C) 2,880,000; D) 3,060,000. \n\nWait, my calculation gives around 3,061,800, which is closest to option D) 3,060,000. But let me check my steps again to see if I made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me re-calculate gamma. \n\nv = 0.2c, so v/c = 0.2. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. \n\nThe square of 0.98 is 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0206. So my gamma was correct. \n\nSo delta t is 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nMultiply by velocity 6e4 km/s gives 6e4 * 51.03 = 6e4 *50 +6e4*1.03 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800. Hmm. The closest option is D, 3,060,000. But the problem might expect using an exact calculation. Let me see if perhaps I approximated gamma too much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use fractions. Let me compute gamma exactly. \n\nLet me compute 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me note that 0.96 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. So gamma is 5/sqrt(24). \n\nsqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(6) \u2248 2*2.449 \u2248 4.898. \n\nSo 5 divided by 4.898 is approximately 1.0206 as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to not use relativity? Wait, but the problem gives the speed in the ejecta's frame. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nWait, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's the ejecta's speed as seen from the galaxy's frame. Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that would mean that in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed? Wait, because in inertial frames, if you have two objects moving towards each other at speed v in each other's frames, then their relative speed would be different. Wait, but according to special relativity, velocities don't just add like that. \n\nWait, perhaps the speed given is already the speed of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame, but the wording is tricky. Let me re-read the problem. \n\nThe problem says: \"From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.\" \n\nSo in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So that is the relative speed between the two frames. \n\nSo the speed v here is 60,000 km/s, which is the speed of the galaxy's center as seen from ejecta's frame. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. \n\nWait, but in special relativity, if in frame S (galaxy), the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center. Then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is approaching at velocity v. The relation between u and v is given by the velocity addition formula. \n\nWait, but the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame would be (u + v')/(1 + (uv')/c\u00b2), but I might be getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the relative velocity between the two frames is such that in S (galaxy), the ejecta moves at u. Then in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy's center is moving at v = u / (1 + (u^2)/(c^2))? No, perhaps I need to use the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. \n\nWait, the velocity of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame (S') is given by v' = ( -u ) / (1 - (u*v0)/c\u00b2 ), but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps the speed in each frame is the same if they are moving directly towards each other? Wait no, that's only at non-relativistic speeds. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be assuming that the speed is the same in both frames, but that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple non-relativistic problem, but the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is 20% the speed of light, so relativistic effects can't be ignored. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you just use the given speed in the ejecta's frame and multiply by the time in their frame, but that would be wrong because the time in the galaxy's frame is different. \n\nWait, the key is that the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So the ejecta's own clock measures 50 seconds. To find the distance in the galaxy's frame, we need to compute how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that 50 seconds, then multiply by the speed. \n\nSo, using time dilation: \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t'. \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), where v is the speed of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame. \n\nWait a second, but what is v here? The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some velocity u. \n\nWe need to relate u and v. \n\nThe velocity of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame (v) is related to the velocity of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame (u) via the relativistic velocity addition formula. \n\nThe formula is: v = (u + v_galaxy's velocity in ejecta's frame) / ... Hmm, perhaps better to set up coordinates. \n\nLet me denote: \n\nLet\u2019s let the galaxy\u2019s frame be S, and the ejecta\u2019s frame be S'. \n\nIn S, the ejecta is moving at speed u towards the center (so u is positive in some coordinate system). \n\nIn S', the galaxy's center is moving at speed v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. \n\nThe velocity transformation formula between S and S' is: \n\nv' (velocity in S') = (v_S - u) / (1 - (v_S u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but in this case, the galaxy's center in S is stationary (since S is the galaxy's frame), so its velocity in S is zero. \n\nWait, the galaxy's center is at rest in S. So the velocity of the galaxy's center in S' is v' = -u / gamma, perhaps? Wait, I need to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe formula for transforming velocities between frames moving at speed u relative to each other is: \n\nIf in S, an object has velocity w, then in S' (moving at speed u relative to S along the x-axis), the velocity w' is given by: \n\nw' = (w - u) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nIn this case, the galaxy's center is at rest in S (w = 0). So in S', its velocity is w' = (0 - u)/(1 - 0) = -u. \n\nWait, but according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that velocity would be v' = 60,000 km/s. But according to this, v' = -u. So then:\n\nv' = -u = 60,000 km/s \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s. Wait, but the negative sign indicates direction. Since in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center, so u would be negative if we take the direction away as positive. Hmm, maybe direction is complicating. Let me think in magnitudes. \n\nThe magnitude of the velocity in S' (ejecta's frame) of the galaxy is u, so the problem states that v' = 60,000 km/s. So that means u (the speed of the ejecta in S) is equal to 60,000 km/s. \n\nWait, that's a key point. So the speed of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is exactly 60,000 km/s. Because when the galaxy is at rest in S, the velocity of the galaxy's center in S' is -u, which has magnitude u. So the problem's given speed is indeed the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame. \n\nSo that simplifies things. So v (the speed in S, the galaxy's frame) is 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the gamma factor is based on v = 6e4 km/s. \n\nSo, speed of light c is 3e5 km/s. \n\nv/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the galaxy's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame is speed * time = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 50 = 3e6, plus 6e4 *1.03 = 61,800 \u2192 total 3,061,800 km. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. The calculation gives approximately 3,061,800, which is very close to D, so maybe the question expects using exact fractions. Let me check with exact calculation. \n\nLet me compute gamma precisely. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. sqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(6) \u2248 2*2.44949 \u2248 4.89898. \n\nSo 1/sqrt(0.96) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) \u2192 but let me compute gamma exactly as 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using fractions:\n\ngamma squared is 1/(0.96), so gamma is sqrt(25/24) = 5/sqrt(24). \n\nSo gamma = 5/(2*sqrt(6)) \u2248 5/(2*2.44949) \u22485/4.89898\u22481.0206. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the classical approach? But that would be wrong. Let me see what would happen if someone thought that the time in both frames is the same. Then distance would be 6e4 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation. \n\nBut the problem states both frames are inertial, so relativity applies. So the correct answer should be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the galaxy's frame, the distance it travels is indeed speed multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds. So yes, the answer should be D. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C which is 2,880,000? That would be if you multiplied 6e4 *48 seconds, which would be if the time was shorter. But that would be if the galaxy's time was less, which would be if we had considered the ejecta's time as dilated, but no. Wait, maybe someone might have confused gamma? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they used length contraction? Wait, but the question is about distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. The distance is in the galaxy's frame, so we need to use the galaxy's time. So the correct approach is as I did. \n\nSo I think D is correct. The answer should be D.\n",

The formula is \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394t', where \u0394t is the time in the galaxy's frame, and \u0394t' is the time in the ejecta's frame (the 50 seconds here). Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nBut wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, etc. So the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me check how that compares to the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo first, compute gamma. Let's compute v\u00b2/c\u00b2. Since v = 0.2c, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - that is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98. Hmm, so gamma would be 1/0.98 \u2248 1.0204.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. \n\nThe square of 0.98 is 0.9604, which is a bit more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0206. So my gamma was correct. \n\nSo delta t is 50 * 1.0206 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nMultiply by velocity 6e4 km/s gives 6e4 * 51.03 = 6e4 *50 +6e4*1.03 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800. Hmm.

So that would mean that in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed? Wait, because in inertial frames, if you have two objects moving towards each other at speed v in each other's frames, then their relative speed would be different.

But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed. \n\nWait, but in special relativity, if in frame S (galaxy), the ejecta is moving at velocity u towards the center. Then in the ejecta's frame S', the center is approaching at velocity v. The relation between u and v is given by the velocity addition formula. \n\nWait, but the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame would be (u + v')/(1 + (uv')/c\u00b2), but I might be getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the relative velocity between the two frames is such that in S (galaxy), the ejecta moves at u. Then in S' (ejecta's frame), the galaxy's center is moving at v = u / (1 + (u^2)/(c^2))? No, perhaps I need to use the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. \n\nWait, the velocity of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame (S') is given by v' = ( -u ) / (1 - (u*v0)/c\u00b2 ), but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

To find the distance in the galaxy's frame, we need to compute how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that 50 seconds, then multiply by the speed. \n\nSo, using time dilation: \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394t'. \n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)), where v is the speed of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame. \n\nWait a second, but what is v here? The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some velocity u. \n\nWe need to relate u and v. \n\nThe velocity of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame (v) is related to the velocity of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame (u) via the relativistic velocity addition formula. \n\nThe formula is: v = (u + v_galaxy's velocity in ejecta's frame) / ... Hmm, perhaps better to set up coordinates. \n\nLet me denote: \n\nLet\u2019s let the galaxy\u2019s frame be S, and the ejecta\u2019s frame be S'. \n\nIn S, the ejecta is moving at speed u towards the center (so u is positive in some coordinate system). \n\nIn S', the galaxy's center is moving at speed v = 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. \n\nThe velocity transformation formula between S and S' is: \n\nv' (velocity in S') = (v_S - u) / (1 - (v_S u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but in this case, the galaxy's center in S is stationary (since S is the galaxy's frame), so its velocity in S is zero. \n\nWait, the galaxy's center is at rest in S. So the velocity of the galaxy's center in S' is v' = -u / gamma, perhaps? Wait, I need to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe formula for transforming velocities between frames moving at speed u relative to each other is: \n\nIf in S, an object has velocity w, then in S' (moving at speed u relative to S along the x-axis), the velocity w' is given by: \n\nw' = (w - u) / (1 - (w u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nIn this case, the galaxy's center is at rest in S (w = 0). So in S', its velocity is w' = (0 - u)/(1 - 0) = -u. \n\nWait, but according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that velocity would be v' = 60,000 km/s. But according to this, v' = -u. So then:\n\nv' = -u = 60,000 km/s \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s. Wait, but the negative sign indicates direction. Since in S, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center, so u would be negative if we take the direction away as positive. Hmm, maybe direction is complicating. Let me think in magnitudes. \n\nThe magnitude of the velocity in S' (ejecta's frame) of the galaxy is u, so the problem states that v' = 60,000 km/s. So that means u (the speed of the ejecta in S) is equal to 60,000 km/s. \n\nWait, that's a key point. So the speed of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is exactly 60,000 km/s. Because when the galaxy is at rest in S, the velocity of the galaxy's center in S' is -u, which has magnitude u. So the problem's given speed is indeed the ejecta's speed in the galaxy's frame. \n\nSo that simplifies things. So v (the speed in S, the galaxy's frame) is 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the gamma factor is based on v = 6e4 km/s. \n\nSo, speed of light c is 3e5 km/s. \n\nv/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2. So v = 0.2c. \n\nSo gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, the time in the galaxy's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394t' = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame is speed * time = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 6e4 * 50 = 3e6, plus 6e4 *1.03 = 61,800 \u2192 total 3,061,800 km. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. The calculation gives approximately 3,061,800, which is very close to D, so maybe the question expects using exact fractions. Let me check with exact calculation. \n\nLet me compute gamma precisely. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. sqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(6) \u2248 2*2.44949 \u2248 4.89898. \n\nSo 1/sqrt(0.96) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) \u2192 but let me compute gamma exactly as 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using fractions:\n\ngamma squared is 1/(0.96), so gamma is sqrt(25/24) = 5/sqrt(24). \n\nSo gamma = 5/(2*sqrt(6)) \u2248 5/(2*2.44949) \u22485/4.89898\u22481.0206. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the classical approach? But that would be wrong. Let me see what would happen if someone thought that the time in both frames is the same. Then distance would be 6e4 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation. \n\nBut the problem states both frames are inertial, so relativity applies. So the correct answer should be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so in the galaxy's frame, the distance it travels is indeed speed multiplied by time in the galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds. So yes, the answer should be D. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C which is 2,880,000? That would be if you multiplied 6e4 *48 seconds, which would be if the time was shorter. But that would be if the galaxy's time was less, which would be if we had considered the ejecta's time as dilated, but no. Wait, maybe someone might have confused gamma? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they used length contraction? Wait, but the question is about distance traveled in the galaxy's frame. The distance is in the galaxy's frame, so we need to use the galaxy's time. So the correct approach is as I did. \n\nSo I think D is correct. The answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the distance traveled by supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Since the ejecta's speed relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s (0.2c), relativistic effects must be considered. \n\nFirst, compute the Lorentz factor (\u03b3):\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.2^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame (\u0394t) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta t = \\gamma \\cdot \\Delta t' = 1.0206 \\cdot 50 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nThe distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = v \\cdot \\Delta t = 60,\\!000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\cdot 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,\\!061,\\!800 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **D) 3,060,000 km**. \n\nAnswer: D",
