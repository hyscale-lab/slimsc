      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom's electron transitions here. Let's see. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. The options give different paths and probabilities, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules apply. The selection rules for the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are important here. The main ones are that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l (delta l) must be \u00b11. Also, the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or \u00b11, but since the question mentions dipole transitions, maybe the m has to change by -1, 0, or +1? Wait, actually, for dipole transitions, the selection rule for m is that delta m can be 0 or \u00b11. But the question specifies two dipole transitions, so each step must obey these rules.\n\nThe initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9. The path has to go through an intermediate state. Let me look at the options. Option A goes through |2,1,0\u27e9. Option B goes through |2,1,1\u27e9. Option C through |2,1,-1\u27e9. Option D seems to have a typo maybe, but probably similar to A but with a different probability. The probabilities are given as 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, etc. Hmm, but first, let's check the allowed transitions.\n\nStarting with the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate state. The initial l is 0. So delta l must be \u00b11. So the intermediate l must be 0 \u00b11, so either l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, it has to be l=1. Wait, but the principal quantum number n. The first transition is from n=3 to some n'. The second transition is from that n' to n=1. So the intermediate state must have n=2? Because the options all have n=2 for the intermediate. Let me see. The possible transitions for the first step (3\u2192?) must satisfy the selection rules. The first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=0 to l=1. Since delta l must be \u00b11, so that's okay. Then the second transition from n=2 to n=1, l=1 to l=0. Again delta l is -1, which is allowed. So that works for the l selection rules.\n\nNow checking the m values. The initial m is 0. For the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate, the delta m must be 0 or \u00b11. Let's check each option's intermediate m. \n\nOption A: the first step goes to m=0. So delta m is 0. That's allowed. Then from the intermediate |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The delta l is -1, which is okay. The delta m here would be 0 -0 = 0. Wait, m must change by 0 or \u00b11 here as well. So going from m=0 (in the intermediate) to m=0 in the final state, that's delta m=0, which is allowed. So both transitions in A are allowed.\n\nOption B's first step goes to |2,1,1\u27e9. The initial m is 0, so delta m is +1, which is allowed. Then from m=1 to m=0 in the second step (to reach |1,0,0\u27e9). That delta m is -1, which is allowed. So both steps here are allowed. So B's path is also possible.\n\nOption C's first step goes to m=-1. So delta m is -1, which is okay. Then from m=-1 to m=0 in the second step. That's delta m +1, which is allowed. So that's also okay. So all three options (A,B,C) have paths that obey the selection rules. But the question says \"via two dipole transitions\", so all three paths are possible in terms of selection rules. But the probabilities might differ.\n\nNow the question also asks about the probabilities. The options have different probabilities. How do we calculate the probability here? Hmm. The probability of a transition depends on the matrix elements of the dipole moment, but maybe in this case, the question is referring to the number of possible paths, or the relative probabilities based on some standard values?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is related to the number of possible intermediate states. Wait, but the question specifies a particular path, so maybe each path has a certain probability. Let's think about the possible m values. For example, when going from l=0 to l=1, the m can go to m=0, +1, or -1? Wait, but the initial m is 0, so delta m must be 0, +1, or -1. So for the first transition from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m can be 0, +1, or -1. So there are three possible m states here. So each of those three options (A, B, C) corresponds to one of the possible m values (0, +1, -1). \n\nThe total probability would then be the sum over all possible paths, but the question is asking for the specific paths given. The probabilities in the options must be the relative probabilities for each path. Since each m transition (0\u21920, 0\u2192+1, 0\u2192-1) are equally probable? Or maybe the probability is proportional to some factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. But I'm not sure of the exact calculation here. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the branching ratio. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transition from 3\u21921 cannot occur in a single dipole transition because the delta n must be at least 1, but here it's going via two steps, so that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, the probabilities given in the options might be derived from the number of possible paths. Since the first step from 3,0,0 can go to three different m states (0,1,-1), each with equal probability (assuming they are equally likely), then each path would have 1/3 probability for the first step. Then the second step from each of those intermediate states would have a certain probability. Wait, but each step has its own probability. But perhaps the question is simplifying it as the total probability being the sum over all possible paths, but the options give each path's probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the parity. Wait, the hydrogen atom states have parity (-1)^l. The initial state |3,0,0\u27e9 has l=0, so parity is +1. The final state |1,0,0\u27e9 also has l=0, parity +1. But dipole transitions must change parity. Wait, the parity of the initial and final states must differ. Wait, dipole transition operator has parity -1, so the total parity must flip. So the initial and final states must have opposite parity. Wait, but here the initial and final states both have l=0, so same parity. That would mean that a direct dipole transition from 3\u21921 would be forbidden. But since the question says the decay is via two dipole transitions, then each individual step must have parity change. So each transition must have a parity change.\n\nLet me check that. For the first step from 3,0,0 (parity +1) to intermediate state. The intermediate state must have parity -1, since dipole transition flips parity. So l must be odd. So l=1, which is correct (since l=1 gives parity (-1)^1 = -1). Then the second transition must go from parity -1 (the intermediate) to the final parity +1 (since l=0). So that's okay. So each individual step is allowed in terms of parity.\n\nSo that's okay. So the selection rules are satisfied in each step.\n\nNow, the probabilities. The question gives options with different probabilities. The options A says probability 1/3, B is 1/4, etc. Maybe the probability is calculated as the square of the sum of the matrix elements? But perhaps the question is referring to the number of possible paths divided by the total number of possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the possible transitions from the initial state to the final via two steps would have multiple paths, and the probabilities are given as fractions of the total.\n\nWait, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 can go to any l=1 state with n=2. The possible m values are -1,0,+1. So three possibilities. Each of those can then go down to the final state. The second transition from |2,1,m\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 must have delta l = -1, so that's okay. The m has to go from m to 0, so delta m can be 0, +1, or -1. Wait, but the final m is 0. So for example, if the intermediate m is 0, then the second transition's delta m is 0, which is allowed. If the intermediate m is +1, then the second transition's delta m must be -1 (to get to 0). Similarly for -1, delta m +1.\n\nSo each of the three possible intermediate m states (0, +1, -1) can proceed to the final state. Therefore, there are three possible paths, each with the same probability? If that's the case, then the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path. But the question is asking for the probability of each path, so each path would have a 1/3 chance (since there are three equally probable paths). That would make option A's probability 1/3, which matches option A. Option B and C would also have 1/3 each, but the options list them as 1/4 or other fractions. Hmm, but the options don't have 1/3 for B and C. Wait, the options are each giving a specific path and its probability. So perhaps each individual path has a certain probability, but the question is which path and which probability is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are calculated based on the selection rules' matrix elements. For instance, transitions where the m doesn't change might have a different probability than when it does. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the probability for each transition step is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the angular momentum change. For instance, transitions with delta m=0 might have a different probability than delta m=\u00b11. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for the two-step process is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each step. Let's think of each step's probability. \n\nFirst, from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m. The possible m are -1,0,1. Each of these transitions may have different probabilities. For example, the transition with delta m=0 might have a different probability than delta m=\u00b11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the probability of the first transition (from n=3 to n=2, l=0\u21921) can have three possible m values, each with equal probability? Or maybe the probability is the same for all three? If so, then each has 1/3. Then, for the second transition, each of those paths would have a probability of 1 (since they can all proceed to the final state). So the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * 1 = 1/3. But the options have different probabilities. Hmm, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might involve the radial integral contributions, but since the question mentions non-relativistic theory and standard notation, maybe the probability is determined by the number of possible m transitions. Wait, maybe the first transition from l=0 to l=1 has three possible m states, so each path's probability is 1/3. Then, for each path, the second transition would also have a probability of 1 (since the m change is allowed). Therefore, each path has probability 1/3. So the correct answer would be option A (since it has 1/3) and options B and C would have the same probability. But the options list different probabilities. So perhaps the question is referring to the total probability over all possible paths? But the question says \"the corresponding probability\" for each path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities given in the options are not about the path's probability but the ratio between different paths. Or perhaps there's a different consideration. Let me think of another angle.\n\nWait, in hydrogen atom transitions, the transition probabilities also depend on the square of the matrix element, which involves integrals over the wavefunctions. The matrix element for a dipole transition is proportional to the integral over r Y_l'm'*Y_lm e^{i m' phi} ... but perhaps for the angular part, the matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' will be zero unless delta l is \u00b11 and delta m is 0, \u00b11. But the actual value of the matrix element can depend on the m values.\n\nFor example, when the transition is from m=0 to m'=0 (delta m=0), the matrix element might be different than when going to m'=\u00b11. Let's consider the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9. The matrix element for the dipole transition would involve the integral of the product of the wavefunctions and the dipole operator, which has an angular part. \n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for a dipole transition is given by the integral over angles of Y_{l'}^{m'} * r * Y_l^m * e^{i phi} (since the dipole operator has a component like x, which is proportional to sin(theta) e^{i phi}, etc). Wait, maybe more precisely, the angular part is:\n\nFor the dipole operator, the matrix element involves a vector, so each component (like the z-component) would have different selection rules, but the total probability would be the sum over all components. Alternatively, the total transition probability is proportional to the square of the sum over the dipole matrix elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability for a transition with a given delta m is proportional to (2 - delta_{m,0}) or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for the transition between l=0 and l'=1, the possible m' are 0, \u00b11. The angular integral for m'=0 would involve the integral of Y_1^0 Y_0^0, which might have a certain value, and similarly for m'=\u00b11. \n\nLet me recall that the integral over angles of Y_{l'}^{m'} Y_l^m is zero unless l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m. Wait, no, that's for the same angular momentum. Wait, the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' must satisfy delta l = \u00b11 and delta m = 0, \u00b11. The angular part of the matrix element for the dipole operator (say, the z-component) is proportional to the integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_l^m * cos(theta) (since the z-component of the dipole is proportional to r cos(theta)). \n\nThe integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} Y_l^m cos(theta) would depend on l, l', m, m'. For example, if we are going from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m'=0, then the integral would involve Y_1^0 * Y_0^0 * cos(theta). Let me compute that. \n\nY_0^0 is sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)), Y_1^0 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos(theta). So the product Y1^0 * Y0^0 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * cos(theta). Then multiplied by cos(theta), so the integral over the sphere would be proportional to integral (sin(theta) d theta d phi) of cos^2(theta). Since phi dependence is all constants here. The integral over phi is 2\u03c0. The integral over theta from 0 to pi of sin(theta) cos^2(theta) d theta. Let me compute that:\n\nLet u = sin(theta), du = cos(theta) d theta. Wait, but the integral is sin(theta) * cos\u00b2(theta) d theta. Let me set u = cos(theta), then du = -sin(theta) d theta. The integral becomes -\u222b u\u00b2 du from u=1 to u=-1. Which is \u222b from -1 to 1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. So the integral over theta gives 2/3. So overall, the angular part for m'=0 would be proportional to sqrt(3/(4\u03c0))*(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) * 2/3 * 2\u03c0. Wait, maybe I need to track constants more carefully, but the key point is that this integral is non-zero. \n\nFor the case when m'=+1, the integral would involve Y_1^1 * Y_0^0 * cos(theta). But Y_1^1 has an e^{i phi} term, so when multiplied by Y_0^0 (which has no phi dependence), the product would have an e^{i phi} term. The integral over phi would then involve integrating e^{i phi} over 0 to 2pi, which gives zero. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the dipole operator's z-component is proportional to cos(theta), which is independent of phi. So the angular integral for the z-component's matrix element between m=0 and m'=+1 would involve the product Y_1^1 (which has an e^{i phi} term) times Y_0^0 (no phi) times cos(theta). Then integrating over phi would have an e^{i phi} term, so the phi integral would be zero. Therefore, the matrix element for m'=+1 would be zero for the z-component. But perhaps we need to consider other components?\n\nAlternatively, the total dipole transition probability is the sum over the three components (x,y,z) of the dipole operator. For the m'=+1 case, maybe the x or y component would contribute. Let me think. For example, the x component of the dipole operator is proportional to sin(theta) cos(phi), which would involve a term e^{-i phi}, so when multiplied by Y_1^1 (which is ~e^{i phi}) and Y_0^0, the product would have e^{0 phi} (since cos(phi) is e^{-i phi} + e^{i phi} over 2?), so perhaps that term would have a non-zero integral. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but the key point is that transitions where delta m is 0 might have a different probability than delta m \u00b11. For instance, when going from m=0 to m'=0, the z-component matrix element is non-zero, so contributes. But for m'=+1, the z-component is zero, but the x or y components might contribute. However, the total probability would be the sum over all components. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for the transition with delta m=0 is higher than delta m=\u00b11. For example, in the case of the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the case where m'=0 might have a higher probability than m'=\u00b11. If that's the case, then the path A (with m'=0) might have a higher probability than B or C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities for the different m' values are equal, but considering the radial integrals, which depend on n. But since the principal quantum numbers are different (3 to 2, then 2 to 1), maybe the radial parts affect the probability. But the question might be simplifying things, assuming that all paths have the same radial probability, so the angular part determines it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option A with 1/3 because there are three possible m states, each contributing equally, so the probability of each path is 1/3. Since the question lists option A as having probability 1/3, that would be correct. The other options have different probabilities, so maybe they are wrong. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption A: path A\u2192B\u2192C (or the path given) with 1/3.\n\nOption B has probability 1/4, which would not fit with 1/3. So perhaps the 1/3 is correct. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) ... and 1/3\n\nB) ... and 1/4\n\nC) ... and 1/4\n\nD) ... and 2/3 (but D's path is written with a typo, maybe?)\n\nWait, the question says \"the corresponding probability are (use latex)\", so maybe the probabilities are given per path, so the correct one is the one with probability 1/3. So the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total number of possible paths is three (for the first transition's m) and then each of those can go to the final state, so three paths. The probability for each path would then be 1/3. So the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question involves determining the correct decay path and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. Key considerations are the selection rules for angular momentum and parity, and the calculation of probabilities.\n\n1. **Selection Rules**: \n   - For dipole transitions, \u0394l must be \u00b11, and \u0394m must be 0 or \u00b11.\n   - Parity must change for each transition.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom's electron transitions here. Let's see. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions.

The path has to go through an intermediate state. Let me look at the options. Option A goes through |2,1,0\u27e9. Option B goes through |2,1,1\u27e9. Option C through |2,1,-1\u27e9. Option D seems to have a typo maybe, but probably similar to A but with a different probability. The probabilities are given as 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, etc. Hmm, but first, let's check the allowed transitions.\n\nStarting with the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate state. The initial l is 0. So delta l must be \u00b11. So the intermediate l must be 0 \u00b11, so either l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, it has to be l=1. Wait, but the principal quantum number n. The first transition is from n=3 to some n'. The second transition is from that n' to n=1. So the intermediate state must have n=2? Because the options all have n=2 for the intermediate. Let me see. The possible transitions for the first step (3\u2192?) must satisfy the selection rules. The first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=0 to l=1. Since delta l must be \u00b11, so that's okay. Then the second transition from n=2 to n=1, l=1 to l=0. Again delta l is -1, which is allowed. So that works for the l selection rules.\n\nNow checking the m values. The initial m is 0. For the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate, the delta m must be 0 or \u00b11. Let's check each option's intermediate m. \n\nOption A: the first step goes to m=0. So delta m is 0. That's allowed. Then from the intermediate |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The delta l is -1, which is okay. The delta m here would be 0 -0 = 0. Wait, m must change by 0 or \u00b11 here as well. So going from m=0 (in the intermediate) to m=0 in the final state, that's delta m=0, which is allowed. So both transitions in A are allowed.\n\nOption B's first step goes to |2,1,1\u27e9. The initial m is 0, so delta m is +1, which is allowed. Then from m=1 to m=0 in the second step (to reach |1,0,0\u27e9). That delta m is -1, which is allowed. So both steps here are allowed. So B's path is also possible.\n\nOption C's first step goes to m=-1. So delta m is -1, which is okay. Then from m=-1 to m=0 in the second step. That's delta m +1, which is allowed. So that's also okay. So all three options (A,B,C) have paths that obey the selection rules. But the question says \"via two dipole transitions\", so all three paths are possible in terms of selection rules.

For the first step from 3,0,0 (parity +1) to intermediate state. The intermediate state must have parity -1, since dipole transition flips parity. So l must be odd. So l=1, which is correct (since l=1 gives parity (-1)^1 = -1). Then the second transition must go from parity -1 (the intermediate) to the final parity +1 (since l=0). So that's okay. So each individual step is allowed in terms of parity.\n\nSo that's okay. So the selection rules are satisfied in each step.\n\nNow, the probabilities. The question gives options with different probabilities. The options A says probability 1/3, B is 1/4, etc. Maybe the probability is calculated as the square of the sum of the matrix elements? But perhaps the question is referring to the number of possible paths divided by the total number of possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the possible transitions from the initial state to the final via two steps would have multiple paths, and the probabilities are given as fractions of the total.\n\nWait, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 can go to any l=1 state with n=2. The possible m values are -1,0,+1. So three possibilities. Each of those can then go down to the final state. The second transition from |2,1,m\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 must have delta l = -1, so that's okay. The m has to go from m to 0, so delta m can be 0, +1, or -1. Wait, but the final m is 0. So for example, if the intermediate m is 0, then the second transition's delta m is 0, which is allowed. If the intermediate m is +1, then the second transition's delta m must be -1 (to get to 0). Similarly for -1, delta m +1.\n\nSo each of the three possible intermediate m states (0, +1, -1) can proceed to the final state. Therefore, there are three possible paths, each with the same probability? If that's the case, then the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path. But the question is asking for the probability of each path, so each path would have a 1/3 chance (since there are three equally probable paths). That would make option A's probability 1/3, which matches option A. Option B and C would also have 1/3 each, but the options list them as 1/4 or other fractions. Hmm, but the options don't have 1/3 for B and C. Wait, the options are each giving a specific path and its probability. So perhaps each individual path has a certain probability, but the question is which path and which probability is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are calculated based on the selection rules' matrix elements. For instance, transitions where the m doesn't change might have a different probability than when it does. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the probability for each transition step is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the angular momentum change. For instance, transitions with delta m=0 might have a different probability than delta m=\u00b11. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for the two-step process is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each step. Let's think of each step's probability. \n\nFirst, from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m. The possible m are -1,0,1. Each of these transitions may have different probabilities. For example, the transition with delta m=0 might have a different probability than delta m=\u00b11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the probability of the first transition (from n=3 to n=2, l=0\u21921) can have three possible m values, each with equal probability? Or maybe the probability is the same for all three? If so, then each has 1/3. Then, for the second transition, each of those paths would have a probability of 1 (since they can all proceed to the final state). So the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * 1 = 1/3. But the options have different probabilities. Hmm, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might involve the radial integral contributions, but since the question mentions non-relativistic theory and standard notation, maybe the probability is determined by the number of possible m transitions. Wait, maybe the first transition from l=0 to l=1 has three possible m states, so each path's probability is 1/3. Then, for each path, the second transition would also have a probability of 1 (since the m change is allowed). Therefore, each path has probability 1/3. So the correct answer would be option A (since it has 1/3) and options B and C would have the same probability. But the options list different probabilities. So perhaps the question is referring to the total probability over all possible paths? But the question says \"the corresponding probability\" for each path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities given in the options are not about the path's probability but the ratio between different paths. Or perhaps there's a different consideration. Let me think of another angle.\n\nWait, in hydrogen atom transitions, the transition probabilities also depend on the square of the matrix element, which involves integrals over the wavefunctions. The matrix element for a dipole transition is proportional to the integral over r Y_l'm'*Y_lm e^{i m' phi} ... but perhaps for the angular part, the matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' will be zero unless delta l is \u00b11 and delta m is 0, \u00b11. But the actual value of the matrix element can depend on the m values.\n\nFor example, when the transition is from m=0 to m'=0 (delta m=0), the matrix element might be different than when going to m'=\u00b11. Let's consider the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9. The matrix element for the dipole transition would involve the integral of the product of the wavefunctions and the dipole operator, which has an angular part. \n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for a dipole transition is given by the integral over angles of Y_{l'}^{m'} * r * Y_l^m * e^{i phi} (since the dipole operator has a component like x, which is proportional to sin(theta) e^{i phi}, etc). Wait, maybe more precisely, the angular part is:\n\nFor the dipole operator, the matrix element involves a vector, so each component (like the z-component) would have different selection rules, but the total probability would be the sum over all components. Alternatively, the total transition probability is proportional to the square of the sum over the dipole matrix elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability for a transition with a given delta m is proportional to (2 - delta_{m,0}) or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for the transition between l=0 and l'=1, the possible m' are 0, \u00b11. The angular integral for m'=0 would involve the integral of Y_1^0 Y_0^0, which might have a certain value, and similarly for m'=\u00b11. \n\nLet me recall that the integral over angles of Y_{l'}^{m'} Y_l^m is zero unless l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m. Wait, no, that's for the same angular momentum. Wait, the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' must satisfy delta l = \u00b11 and delta m = 0, \u00b11. The angular part of the matrix element for the dipole operator (say, the z-component) is proportional to the integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_l^m * cos(theta) (since the z-component of the dipole is proportional to r cos(theta)). \n\nThe integral of Y_{l'}^{m'} Y_l^m cos(theta) would depend on l, l', m, m'. For example, if we are going from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m'=0, then the integral would involve Y_1^0 * Y_0^0 * cos(theta). Let me compute that. \n\nY_0^0 is sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)), Y_1^0 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos(theta). So the product Y1^0 * Y0^0 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * cos(theta). Then multiplied by cos(theta), so the integral over the sphere would be proportional to integral (sin(theta) d theta d phi) of cos^2(theta). Since phi dependence is all constants here. The integral over phi is 2\u03c0. The integral over theta from 0 to pi of sin(theta) cos^2(theta) d theta. Let me compute that:\n\nLet u = sin(theta), du = cos(theta) d theta. Wait, but the integral is sin(theta) * cos\u00b2(theta) d theta. Let me set u = cos(theta), then du = -sin(theta) d theta. The integral becomes -\u222b u\u00b2 du from u=1 to u=-1. Which is \u222b from -1 to 1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. So the integral over theta gives 2/3. So overall, the angular part for m'=0 would be proportional to sqrt(3/(4\u03c0))*(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) * 2/3 * 2\u03c0. Wait, maybe I need to track constants more carefully, but the key point is that this integral is non-zero. \n\nFor the case when m'=+1, the integral would involve Y_1^1 * Y_0^0 * cos(theta). But Y_1^1 has an e^{i phi} term, so when multiplied by Y_0^0 (which has no phi dependence), the product would have an e^{i phi} term. The integral over phi would then involve integrating e^{i phi} over 0 to 2pi, which gives zero. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the dipole operator's z-component is proportional to cos(theta), which is independent of phi. So the angular integral for the z-component's matrix element between m=0 and m'=+1 would involve the product Y_1^1 (which has an e^{i phi} term) times Y_0^0 (no phi) times cos(theta). Then integrating over phi would have an e^{i phi} term, so the phi integral would be zero. Therefore, the matrix element for m'=+1 would be zero for the z-component. But perhaps we need to consider other components?\n\nAlternatively, the total dipole transition probability is the sum over the three components (x,y,z) of the dipole operator. For the m'=+1 case, maybe the x or y component would contribute. Let me think. For example, the x component of the dipole operator is proportional to sin(theta) cos(phi), which would involve a term e^{-i phi}, so when multiplied by Y_1^1 (which is ~e^{i phi}) and Y_0^0, the product would have e^{0 phi} (since cos(phi) is e^{-i phi} + e^{i phi} over 2?), so perhaps that term would have a non-zero integral. \n\nThis is getting complicated, but the key point is that transitions where delta m is 0 might have a different probability than delta m \u00b11. For instance, when going from m=0 to m'=0, the z-component matrix element is non-zero, so contributes. But for m'=+1, the z-component is zero, but the x or y components might contribute. However, the total probability would be the sum over all components. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for the transition with delta m=0 is higher than delta m=\u00b11. For example, in the case of the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the case where m'=0 might have a higher probability than m'=\u00b11. If that's the case, then the path A (with m'=0) might have a higher probability than B or C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities for the different m' values are equal, but considering the radial integrals, which depend on n. But since the principal quantum numbers are different (3 to 2, then 2 to 1), maybe the radial parts affect the probability. But the question might be simplifying things, assuming that all paths have the same radial probability, so the angular part determines it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option A with 1/3 because there are three possible m states, each contributing equally, so the probability of each path is 1/3. Since the question lists option A as having probability 1/3, that would be correct. The other options have different probabilities, so maybe they are wrong. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption A: path A\u2192B\u2192C (or the path given) with 1/3.\n\nOption B has probability 1/4, which would not fit with 1/3. So perhaps the 1/3 is correct. So the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) ... and 1/3\n\nB) ... and 1/4\n\nC) ... and 1/4\n\nD) ... and 2/3 (but D's path is written with a typo, maybe?)\n\nWait, the question says \"the corresponding probability are (use latex)\", so maybe the probabilities are given per path, so the correct one is the one with probability 1/3. So the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total number of possible paths is three (for the first transition's m) and then each of those can go to the final state, so three paths. The probability for each path would then be 1/3. So the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe question involves determining the correct decay path and probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. Key considerations are the selection rules for angular momentum and parity, and the calculation of probabilities.\n\n1. **Selection Rules**: \n   - For dipole transitions, \u0394l must be \u00b11, and \u0394m must be 0 or \u00b11.\n   - Parity must change for each transition. The initial and final states both have even parity (l=0), so each intermediate step must flip parity. The intermediate state must have l=1 (odd parity).\n\n2. **Path Analysis**:\n   - The intermediate state must be |2,1,m\u27e9. Possible m-values are -1, 0, +1, each satisfying \u0394m rules.\n   - All paths in options A, B, and C obey \u0394l and \u0394m rules. However, the probability depends on the number of possible paths.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9 has three possible m-values (-1, 0, +1), each equally probable (assuming uniform angular distribution).\n   - Each path (A, B, C) corresponds to one of these m-values, so each has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Option Evaluation**:\n   - Option A specifies the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), which matches the calculated probability.\n   - Options B and C have probabilities \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), which are inconsistent with the three equally likely paths.\n   - Option D has a formatting error and an incorrect probability.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The problem is about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. I need to determine the correct transition route and the probability given the options.\n\nFirst, I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules must be followed. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions (allowed transitions) state that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number (\u0394l) must be \u00b11. Also, the magnetic quantum number (m) must remain the same or change by \u00b11, but since the final m is 0 here, maybe that plays a role.\n\nStarting with the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9. The first transition must go to an intermediate state that allows the second transition to reach |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's break it down:\n\nThe first transition from n=3 to some lower n, say n=2. The orbital angular momentum l must change by \u00b11. Since the initial l is 0, the first transition must go to l=1 (since 0+1=1; can't go to -1). So the first intermediate state should be l=1. Therefore, possible intermediate states are |2,1,m\u27e9, where m can be -1,0, or +1. \n\nNow, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 must go to |2,1, m\u27e9. The m value can change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the possible m values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, or +1. So the possible first steps are to |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9, or |2,1,-1\u27e9. \n\nThen, the second transition must go from this intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's check each possibility.\n\nCase 1: Intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. The second transition must go to |1,0,0\u27e9. For the second transition, the \u0394l here must be from 1 to 0, which is \u0394l = -1, which is allowed. The m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Since the m is 0 in both the intermediate and final state, that's okay. So this path is possible: 3\u21922\u21921 via l=1 to l=0.\n\nCase 2: If the intermediate is |2,1,1\u27e9, then going to |1,0,0\u27e9 would require a \u0394m of -1 (since m goes from 1 to 0). That's allowed. The \u0394l here is 1 to 0, so \u0394l=-1, which is okay. So this path is also possible: 3\u21922 (l=1, m=1) \u21921.\n\nSimilarly, the third case with m=-1 would also be allowed: m goes from -1 to 0 (\u0394m=+1). \n\nSo all three m values for the intermediate l=1 are possible. However, the question states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So all three options (A, B, C) might be possible in terms of allowed transitions. But the options have different probabilities, so we need to figure out which one is correct based on the probabilities given.\n\nNow, the question mentions the probability. The options give different probabilities: 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3. To find the correct probability, I need to recall how the probabilities are calculated for such transitions. The probability for a dipole transition between two states depends on the matrix element of the dipole moment operator, which involves integrals over the wavefunctions. However, the problem might be referring to the relative probabilities of the different possible paths, considering the possible m values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the total probability is distributed among the possible decay paths. Since the initial state has m=0, and the final state also has m=0, the possible intermediate states with m= -1, 0, +1 can each contribute. But the total probability must sum over all possible paths. Wait, but in the question, it says \"decays to the state |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions\" so the path must be two steps, but perhaps each possible path (like via m=0, m=1, m=-1) has a certain probability. But the options list specific paths with specific probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities here refer to the ratio of the transition probabilities between the different paths. For example, when there are multiple possible paths, each with their own probability, but the question might be asking which path has the given probability. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, and the probabilities are given based on the number of possible m transitions. \n\nLet me think again. The initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9. The first transition must go to a state with l=1 (since \u0394l=\u00b11 from l=0). So the possible m values for the intermediate are m= -1, 0, or +1. So three possible intermediate states. Then, each of these can proceed to the final state. \n\nHowever, when going from the intermediate state to the final |1,0,0\u27e9, the second transition must also satisfy the dipole selection rules. Let's check for each intermediate:\n\nFor the intermediate |2,1,0\u27e9: the second transition is from l=1 to l=0. The \u0394l is -1, allowed. The m goes from 0 to 0, which is allowed (\u0394m=0). So that's valid.\n\nFor |2,1,1\u27e9: going to l=0, m=0. The \u0394m is -1, which is allowed. \n\nSimilarly for |2,1,-1\u27e9, \u0394m is +1, which is okay. \n\nSo all three paths are allowed. \n\nNow, the total number of possible paths is three. If the probabilities are equally likely, then each would have a probability of 1/3. But maybe the actual probabilities depend on the matrix elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the first transition from 3\u21922 has certain selection rules. Wait, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount, as long as the l condition is met. But in dipole transitions, the parity must change. The parity of a state is (-1)^l. The initial state has l=0, so parity is +1. The final state (n=1) is also l=0, parity +1. So the overall parity must change each time. \n\nWait, that might be important. Let me check parity for each transition step.\n\nFirst transition from 3 (l=0, parity +1) to the intermediate state. The intermediate state must have parity opposite to the initial. Since parity changes with each dipole transition. So the intermediate state must have parity -1. Since parity is (-1)^l, so l must be odd. Which it is (l=1). So that's okay. Then, the second transition from l=1 (parity -1) to l=0 (parity +1). So that also changes parity. So that's okay. So all those transitions are okay.\n\nBut how does parity affect the probabilities? Maybe not directly here. \n\nAlternatively, the probability for each transition path is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the integral of the wavefunctions. For the first transition, the matrix element for the dipole moment operator between |3,0,0\u27e9 and |2,1,m\u27e9. The matrix element's magnitude depends on the angular part and radial part. \n\nThe angular part for the first transition between l=0 to l=1. The angular integral is \u27e81 m | r Y\u2081\u1d50 |0 0\u27e9. The Y\u2081\u1d50 spherical harmonics have certain properties. The integral might be non-zero only for certain m values. Wait, but the dipole operator is proportional to r times a component of the position vector, which relates to the Y\u2081\u1d50 terms. \n\nActually, the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' requires that the sum l + l' + 1 must be even (or something like that?), but maybe I'm mixing up with other rules. Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition between |nlm\u27e9 and |n'l'm'\u27e9 is non-zero only if \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. Which we already considered. But the actual value of the matrix element (and hence the probability) can depend on the specific m values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities here are given by the number of possible paths. Since there are three possible m values for the intermediate (m=-1,0,+1), each of these would contribute equally, so each path has a probability of 1/3. However, in the options, option A gives 1/3, but the path in A is via m=0. Option B is via m=1, and C via m=-1, both with 1/4 and 1/4? Wait, the probabilities in the options are different. So perhaps the probabilities aren't equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition from 3\u21922 has certain probabilities. Let me think of the selection rules again. The first transition from n=3 to n=2 must also satisfy the \u0394n condition. There's no restriction on n except that the states must be different. So that's fine. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is simplified, and the probabilities are given by the number of possible m transitions. For the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m: the m can be 0, \u00b11, so three possibilities. Each of those can then transition to 1,0,0. So the total number of paths is 3. Therefore, each path would have a probability of 1/3, so the answer would be A or B or C with probability 1/3. But looking at the options, A has 1/3, B has 1/4, C has 1/4, D has 2/3. Hmm, so the answer might be A with 1/3. But why are the other options different?\n\nWait, perhaps the m=0 path has a different probability than the m=\u00b11 paths. Let me think. The matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,0\u27e9 might be different from the transitions to m=\u00b11. \n\nThe angular part of the dipole matrix element between l=0 and l'=1 requires that the integral over the spherical harmonics Y\u2081\u1d50(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6). The integral \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 is zero unless m=0, because Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric. \n\nWait, the dipole transition matrix element is proportional to \u27e82,1,m | r | 3,0,0\u27e9. The radial part depends on n, but the angular part is \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9. Wait, actually the dipole operator is proportional to the position vector components, so the matrix element for a dipole transition between states with angular momentum l and l' must involve the product of Y\u2081\u1d50 (since the dipole operator has l=1) and the wavefunctions.\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for the transition from l=0 to l'=1 would be:\n\n\u27e81 m | Y\u2081\u1d50' | 0 0\u27e9 \n\nWait, maybe more precisely, the matrix element involves the integral over angles of Y\u2081\u1d50*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) multiplied by some function. \n\nThe product Y\u2081\u1d50 Y\u2080\u2070 can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/\u221a(4\u03c0), and Y\u2081\u1d50 is proportional to sin\u03b8 e^{i\u03c6 m} for m=\u00b11, or cos\u03b8 for m=0. \n\nThe integral over the sphere of Y\u2081\u1d50 Y\u2080\u2070 is:\n\nFor m=0: Y\u2081\u2070 is proportional to cos\u03b8. The integral over Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 would be \u222b Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 d\u03a9. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric, when multiplied by cos\u03b8, the integral over \u03c6 would not vanish. Let me compute that. \n\nThe integral \u222b Y\u2081\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0), and Y\u2081\u2070 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. So the integral becomes (sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \u222b cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. The \u03c6 integral is \u222b0 to 2\u03c0 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral is \u222b0 to \u03c0 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. The integral becomes \u222b0 to 0 (since u goes from 0 to 0?) Wait, no, wait. Wait, sin\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0: when \u03b8 goes from 0 to \u03c0, u = sin\u03b8 goes from 0 to 0, but the integral of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 is (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/2 evaluated from 0 to \u03c0. Which is (0 - 0)/2 = 0. Wait, so that integral is zero. Wait, but that contradicts?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up. Let me re-calculate. The integral over \u03b8 is \u222b0 to \u03c0 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let me set u = sin\u03b8, then du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. The limits when \u03b8=0, u=0; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=0. So the integral becomes \u222b0^0 u du = 0. So the integral is zero. So the angular part for m=0 is zero? That can't be right. Hmm, but that would mean that the transition to m=0 is forbidden? But that can't be, because the selection rules allow m=0 as \u0394m=0. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dipole operator isn't just the radial part but a vector component. The dipole operator is e r, but the matrix element is for the vector component. For instance, the dipole moment is in a particular direction, say the z-component. Wait, the total matrix element would involve the sum over the components. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the dipole operator's components.\n\nThe dipole transition matrix element between two states |i\u27e9 and |f\u27e9 is proportional to \u27e8f | r | i\u27e9, where r is the position vector. To compute this, we can consider the components. The matrix element for the dipole transition can be written using the spherical harmonics. The radial part is separate, but the angular part must be considered. \n\nThe angular part of the transition from l=0 to l'=1 must satisfy that the angular integral \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 must be non-zero. But as we saw for m=0, that integral was zero. Wait, that would mean that the transition to m=0 is actually forbidden? But that contradicts the selection rules. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dipole operator has components in different directions. For example, the dipole operator is a vector, so the transition can occur via any of its components. The total matrix element squared would be the sum over the squares of the matrix elements for each component. But for the angular part, maybe for m=0, the transition is allowed via the z-component, but the integral for the z-component might be non-zero.\n\nWait, let me think again. The dipole operator in spherical coordinates has components. Let's consider the z-component, which is r cos\u03b8. The matrix element for the z-component between the initial state (l=0, m=0) and the final state (l'=1, m'=0) would be:\n\n\u27e81,0 | r cos\u03b8 | 0,0\u27e9 \n\nThe radial part is the same for all, but the angular part is \u222b Y\u2081\u2070*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nWait, the Y\u2081\u2070 is proportional to cos\u03b8, so the product Y\u2081\u2070 * cos\u03b8 would be proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. The integral over \u03c6 would still be 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 would involve cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8. Let me compute this:\n\nY\u2081\u2070 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the angular part is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 * \u222b0^{2\u03c0} d\u03c6. The \u03c6 integral gives 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral is \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u = cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1. So the integral becomes \u222b1^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (2\u03c0) * (2/3). Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) = sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0). Then multiplied by 2\u03c0*(2/3) gives sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * (4\u03c0/3) )? Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe constants: sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3)/( (4\u03c0) ).\n\nMultiply by 2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) and the \u03b8 integral result (2/3):\n\nTotal angular integral part is (sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) ) = sqrt(3) * 2\u03c0 * 2/(3 *4\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3) * (4\u03c0)/(12\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/3. So the matrix element for the z-component is non-zero. So that transition is allowed. \n\nHmm, so my previous mistake was not considering the correct components. So the transition to m=0 is allowed. Then why was the earlier calculation for the product Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 leading to zero? Because that was for a different operator, maybe. The dipole operator's z-component has the cos\u03b8 term, so when multiplied by Y\u2081\u2070 (which has cos\u03b8), the integral becomes non-zero. \n\nSo, the angular part for m=0 is allowed, and the matrix element is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for the transitions with m=\u00b11. Let's consider the m=1 case. The dipole operator's component in the x or y direction would involve terms with sin\u03b8 e^{\u00b1i\u03c6}, so maybe for m=1, the transition would involve the x or y component. \n\nThe angular integral for m=1 would be \u27e8Y\u2081\u00b9 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9. Since Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, and Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric. The integral over \u03c6 would involve e^{i\u03c6} integrated from 0 to 2\u03c0, which is zero. Therefore, the angular integral for m=1 would be zero for the dipole operator's radial part? Wait, but perhaps considering a different component of the dipole operator. \n\nWait, the dipole operator has three components. The total matrix element squared is the sum over the squares of each component's matrix elements. For the m=1 case, maybe the transition is allowed via the x or y component. \n\nFor example, the x-component of the dipole operator is (r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6). The matrix element would involve Y\u2081\u00b9 (since m'=1 requires the angular part to have that). The integral over angles would involve Y\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) times sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. \n\nThe Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. So the product with sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 would give terms like e^{i\u03c6} sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03c6. The integral over \u03c6 would involve \u222b e^{i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 d\u03c6. Let me compute that. \n\nExpress cos\u03c6 as (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6}) / 2. Then the integrand becomes e^{i\u03c6} * (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6}) / 2 = [e^{i2\u03c6} + 1]/2. Integrating over \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0:\n\n\u222b0^{2\u03c0} [e^{i2\u03c6} +1]/2 d\u03c6 = (1/2)(0 + 2\u03c0) = \u03c0. But wait, that's for the e^{i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 part. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step:\n\nThe angular part for m=1 and x-component:\n\nThe angular integral is \u222b Y\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) [sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6] Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nY\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) is proportional to e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the angular integral becomes proportional to \u222b [e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8] [sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6] [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe terms involving \u03c6: e^{-i\u03c6} cos\u03c6. Let's write cos\u03c6 = (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6})/2. Then e^{-i\u03c6} * cos\u03c6 = [e^{-i\u03c6} e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6} e^{-i\u03c6}]/2 = [1 + e^{-i2\u03c6}]/2. \n\nSo integrating over \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0, the integral of [1 + e^{-i2\u03c6}]/2 d\u03c6 is (2\u03c0)/2 [1 + 0] = \u03c0. \n\nThe \u03b8 terms: sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = sin\u00b3\u03b8. So the \u03b8 integral is \u222b0^\u03c0 sin^3\u03b8 d\u03b8. The integral of sin^3\u03b8 is (2/3). \n\nPutting it all together, the angular integral would be proportional to (some constants) * \u03c0 * (2/3). \n\nTherefore, the angular part for m=1 is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for m=-1, the same logic applies (since cos\u03c6 is even in \u03c6, and sin terms would involve similar integrals). \n\nTherefore, all three m values (0,1,-1) are allowed for the first transition. \n\nNow, the probabilities for each of these paths would depend on the square of the matrix elements. The matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 may have different magnitudes, leading to different probabilities. \n\nLet me assume that the radial parts are the same for all three transitions (since they are between n=3 to n=2, but different l's). The angular parts would determine the relative probabilities. \n\nEarlier, for the m=0 case, the angular part's squared contribution was (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nFor m=1, let's see. Let me compute the squared angular part for the m=1 case. \n\nThe angular integral for m=1 (using the x-component) had a factor of \u03c0 in \u03c6 and (2/3) in \u03b8. The constants from the spherical harmonics need to be considered. Let me try to compute the normalization constants properly. \n\nThe Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. Wait, the exact expression for Y\u2081\u00b9 is:\n\nY\u2081\u00b9 = -sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0).\n\nThe angular integral (for the x-component matrix element) would be:\n\n\u27e8Y\u2081\u00b9 | sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 \n\nThe integral is:\n\n\u222b Y\u2081\u00b9* sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 Y\u2080\u2070 sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 \n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\nY\u2081\u00b9* = -sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8\n\nY\u2080\u2070 = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)\n\nSo:\n\n- sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) / sqrt(4\u03c0) * \u222b e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 * sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 \n\nWait, the integrand terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (from Y\u2081\u00b9) * sin\u03b8 (from the operator's sin\u03b8) * cos\u03c6 (from the operator's cos\u03c6) * sin\u03b8 (from the volume element sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6). \n\nWait, the operator's component is r times the position component, so the angular part is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe integrand becomes:\n\ne^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 * sin\u03b8 \n\n= e^{-i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 sin^3\u03b8 \n\nMultiply by the constants:\n\n- sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) / sqrt(4\u03c0) = - sqrt(3) / (sqrt(8\u03c0) * sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) \n\n= - sqrt(3) / (sqrt(32 \u03c0\u00b2)) )\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the squared matrix elements for m=1 and m=-1 are the same, and the total contribution from m=\u00b11 is twice that of m=0, or something else. \n\nAlternatively, since the m=0 transition's angular part had a value proportional to sqrt(3)/3, while for m=1 it might be proportional to another term. Let's suppose that the squared matrix elements for m=1 and m=-1 are equal and let's denote their squared values as A, and for m=0 as B. \n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path. The probability for each path is proportional to the square of the matrix element for the first transition multiplied by the square of the matrix element for the second transition. \n\nAssuming that the second transition's matrix elements are the same for all three intermediate states (since going from l=1 to l=0, with m changing appropriately), then the probabilities would be proportional to the squares of the first transition's matrix elements. \n\nIf the first transition's matrix elements squared are B for m=0 and A for m=\u00b11, then the total probability is B + 2A (since m=+1 and -1 are two paths). \n\nAssuming that the matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 have different magnitudes, let's suppose that the m=0 transition has a matrix element squared of B, and each of the m=\u00b11 transitions have A each. \n\nIf the angular parts for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are such that B = 1/3 and each A is 1/6 (for example), then the total would be 1/3 + 2*(1/6) = 2/3, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the angular parts for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are equal. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part for m=0 is the same as for m=\u00b11. Let me think. The squared angular part for m=0 was (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nFor m=1, let's see. The angular integral for the x-component was proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * ... \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total squared matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability is equally distributed among the three possible paths. If that's the case, each path would have a probability of 1/3. So option A would be correct. \n\nBut in the options, option A is |3\u21922,1,0\u21921\u27e9 with 1/3, and option D is the same path but with 2/3. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition has different probabilities. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe possible intermediate states are three (m=-1,0,+1). However, the second transition must go to m=0. For the second transition from the intermediate states, the possible m changes must also follow \u0394m=0, \u00b11. \n\nFor the intermediate state |2,1,0\u27e9, the second transition can have \u0394m=0 (to m=0), which is allowed. \n\nFor the intermediate state |2,1,1\u27e9, the second transition must have \u0394m=-1 (from m=1 to 0). \n\nSimilarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1. \n\nThe probabilities for these second transitions may also contribute. \n\nBut the problem states that the total decay occurs via two dipole transitions. The probability given in the options is probably the total probability for the entire path. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the ratio of the probabilities between different paths, but since the options give specific probabilities, perhaps the answer is A with 1/3 because there are three possible paths and each is equally probable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the m=0 path has a higher probability because the angular matrix element is larger. \n\nWait, let me think again about the angular matrix elements. For the first transition (3\u21922):\n\nThe angular part for m=0 had a squared value of (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nFor the m=1 case, let's compute the squared angular part. Let's take the example of the x-component:\n\nThe angular integral for m=1 was:\n\nThe integral over angles gave us a result proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * ... but I'm getting lost. Alternatively, maybe the total squared angular part for m=1 is the same as for m=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum over all possible m values for the first transition must give a certain total. The total probability for the first transition (from 3,0,0 to any possible intermediate state) would be the sum over m of the probabilities for each path. \n\nSuppose that the squared matrix elements for the first transition are the same for all three m values (m=-1,0,+1). Then each would have equal probability, so 1/3 each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the m=0 transition has a different probability. Let's think about the selection rules. \n\nWait, the parity is okay, but perhaps the angular momentum coupling. The dipole transition's angular part requires that the initial and final angular momenta couple with the dipole's angular momentum (l=1). \n\nThe matrix element for a transition from l_i to l_f must satisfy |l_f - l_i| \u2264 1 \u2264 l_f + l_i. Since l_i=0 and l_f=1, that's okay. \n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem might help here. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 * \u27e8l', m' | 1, 0 \u27e9 l, m\u27e9 \n\nWait, the dipole operator is a vector, so the matrix element for the transition must involve the vector coupling. \n\nSpecifically, the matrix element for the dipole transition between states |n,l,m\u27e9 and |n',l',m'\u27e9 is given by:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r_z | n, l, m\u27e9 = [some radial integral] * \u27e8l, m | l', m' | 1, 0 \u27e9 \n\nThe angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l, m; 1, 0 | l', m'\u27e9. \n\nBecause the dipole operator's z-component is proportional to r_z = r cos\u03b8, which corresponds to the l=1, m=0 component of the spherical harmonics. \n\nTherefore, the angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l and 1 (from the dipole) to get l', m'. \n\nFor the first transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m':\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80,0;1,0 |1, m'\u27e9 must be non-zero. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l1,m1; l2,m2 | L,M\u27e9 where L = l1 + l2 and M = m1 + m2. Here, l1=0, l2=1, so L must be 1, and M = m' = m1 + m2. Since m1=0 and m2=0 (since the dipole's m is 0 for the z-component), then M = 0. \n\nTherefore, the CG coefficient is \u27e80,0;1,0 |1, m'\u27e9. For this to be non-zero, m' must equal M = 0. Wait, but that would imply that m'=0. That contradicts earlier conclusions where m'=\u00b11 were allowed. \n\nWait, this is a key point. If the dipole operator's z-component (r_z) corresponds to m=0 (since it's proportional to cos\u03b8, which is Y\u2081\u2070), then the transition via the z-component can only change m by 0. Therefore, the m' must be m_initial + 0 = m_initial. Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the final m must be 0? \n\nWait, that can't be right because we have transitions to m=\u00b11. \n\nAh, perhaps I need to consider that the dipole operator has components with different m values. The dipole operator as a vector has components with m=0 (z), m=+1 (x+iy), and m=-1 (x-iy). \n\nTherefore, to get m'=1, you would need to use the component of the dipole operator with m_dipole=+1. \n\nThus, the angular part for a transition from |0,0\u27e9 to |1,1\u27e9 would involve the dipole's m=+1 component. \n\nThe general formula for the matrix element is:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r_+ | n, l, m\u27e9 = [radial integral] * \u27e8l, m | l', m' -1 |1, +1\u27e9 \n\nWait, the dipole's x and y components can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics with m=\u00b11. \n\nThe operator r_+ = r_x + i r_y is proportional to the Y\u2081\u00b9 component. \n\nTherefore, to compute the matrix element for a transition to m'=1, you would use the r_+ component, which has m_dipole=+1. \n\nThus, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would be \u27e8l_initial, m_initial; l_dipole=1, m_dipole=+1 | l_final, m_final\u27e9. \n\nFor the initial state (l=0, m=0), and dipole l=1, m=+1, the final m_final must be m_initial + m_dipole = 0 +1 =1. So the CG coefficient is \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9. \n\nThe CG coefficient for combining l1=0, l2=1, m1=0, m2=1 gives L=1, M=1. The value of \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * \u27e81,1 |1,1\u27e9? \n\nWait, the formula for CG coefficients when adding angular momenta. For l1=0 and l2=1, the only possible L is 1. The CG coefficient \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9 is 1, because when you add 0 and 1, the only way to get M=1 is by taking the m2=1 component. \n\nSo the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nTherefore, the angular part for the transition to m'=1 via the r_+ component is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for m'= -1, you would use the r_- component (m_dipole=-1), leading to m_final = 0 + (-1) = -1. \n\nSo, the angular part for transitions to m'=0, \u00b11 are all allowed via different components of the dipole operator. \n\nThe squared matrix elements would then depend on the radial integrals and the squares of the CG coefficients. Since the CG coefficients for m'=0 (using z-component) and m'=\u00b11 (using \u00b1 components) are all 1 (for the angular part), the angular parts are equal. \n\nThus, the angular parts contribute equally to each of the three possible m transitions. \n\nTherefore, the total probability is distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states (m=-1,0,+1). Hence, each path (A, B, C) has a probability of 1/3. \n\nLooking at the options, option A has the path through m=0 with probability 1/3. Option B and C have 1/4, which doesn't match. Option D has 2/3, which also doesn't fit. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"two dipole transitions\". The options for B and C also involve transitions with m=1 and m=-1. But according to this analysis, all three paths have equal probability, so A is the correct one with 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another angle. \n\nWait, the question says \"the corresponding probability are (use latex)\". Maybe the probabilities given are for the total transition, not per path. But the options list probabilities like 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability is the sum over all paths, so each path's probability is (1/3) * (probability of second transition). \n\nWait, the second transition from the intermediate to the final state might have different probabilities. Let's consider that. \n\nFor example, the first transition to |2,1,0\u27e9 has probability 1/3 (since three paths), then the second transition from there to |1,0,0\u27e9 must also be considered. \n\nThe second transition from |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 must satisfy \u0394l = -1 (okay), and \u0394m =0 (okay). The angular matrix element here would involve going from l=1 to l=0. \n\nSimilarly, the transition from |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 requires \u0394m =-1. \n\nThe angular parts for these second transitions may also affect the probabilities. \n\nLet me analyze the second transition's matrix element. \n\nFirst, for the path through m=0 (option A):\n\nSecond transition is from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0. \n\nUsing the same approach as before, the angular part for this transition is:\n\nThe dipole operator's z-component (since final m is 0). \n\nThe matrix element is \u27e81,0 | r_z | 0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part would be \u27e80,0 | l=0; l_dipole=1, m_dipole=0 |1,0\u27e9. Wait, similar to the first transition. \n\nWait, the initial state here is l=1, m=0. The final is l=0, m=0. \n\nUsing the Wigner-Eckart theorem again, the angular part is \u27e81,0 |1,0; 1,0 |0,0\u27e9? \n\nWait, no. The dipole transition from l=1 to l=0 must involve the dipole operator's component that can reduce l by 1. \n\nThe angular part would be the CG coefficient for combining l_initial=1, m_initial=0 with the dipole's m_dipole=0 (for z-component) to get l_final=0, m_final=0. \n\nWait, but l_final=0, so the total angular momentum L must be 0. The dipole operator's l=1, so the combination of l_initial=1 and l_dipole=1 must have L=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is \u27e81,0; 1,0 |0,0\u27e9. \n\nThis is non-zero because 1+1 can combine to L=0 (since |1-1| \u2264 L \u2264 1+1 \u2192 0 \u2264 L \u22642). \n\nThe CG coefficient is \u27e81,0;1,0 |0,0\u27e9 = -sqrt(1/(3)). \n\nBecause the formula for CG coefficients when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L=0:\n\n\u27e8l1, m1; l2, m2 |0,0\u27e9 = \u03b4_{m1, -m2} * sqrt( (2l2 +1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) * something... Wait, perhaps better to recall that for L=0, the CG coefficient is proportional to the Wigner 3j symbol. \n\nThe 3j symbol for:\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 0 0 \n\nis (-1)^{1+1+0} * sqrt( ( (2*0 +1) ) / ( (2*1+1)(2*1+1) )) ) \n\nWait, the 3j symbol \u27e81 1 0 | 0 0 0\u27e9 = (-1)^{0} * sqrt( ( (2*0+1)! ) / ( (2*1+1)! (2*1+1)! )^{1/2} } ... Hmm, maybe this is getting too complex. Alternatively, the value is known to be 1/sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the angular part squared would be (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. \n\nFor the second transition from |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9, the angular part would involve going from m=1 to m=0, so \u0394m =-1. This would require using the dipole's m_dipole=-1 component (since m_initial + m_dipole = m_final \u2192 1 + (-1) =0). \n\nThe CG coefficient would be \u27e81,1;1,-1 |0,0\u27e9. \n\nThis is the same as the previous case but with m's. The 3j symbol would be \u27e81 1 0 |1 -1 0\u27e9? Not sure, but the CG coefficient here would also have a magnitude of 1/sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the squared angular parts for both the second transitions from m=0 and m=\u00b11 would be the same (1/3). \n\nTherefore, the total probability for each path is (angular part of first transition) * (angular part of second transition) multiplied by the radial parts squared. \n\nAssuming the radial parts for all transitions are the same (since they are between n=3 to n=2 and n=2 to n=1), the total probability for each path is proportional to (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for each. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the angular parts for the first transition (from 3\u21922) each have a squared value of 1/3 (for m=0 and m=\u00b11). The angular parts for the second transition (from 2\u21921) also each have 1/3. So the total for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But since there are three paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path, so each path's probability is (angular part first * angular part second) * radial parts squared. If the radial parts are the same for all paths, then each path's probability is proportional to (angular part first * angular part second). \n\nSince each angular part for first and second transitions is 1/3, the product is 1/9. But then each path has probability 1/9, totaling 3*(1/9) = 1/3. But that would mean the total probability for all paths is 1/3, which doesn't make sense because the decay must have a total probability of 1. \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe the radial integrals are different. The radial matrix elements between n=3 to 2 and n=2 to 1 might have different values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, and the probabilities are just based on the number of possible paths. Since there are three possible paths (m=-1,0,1), each has equal probability of 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option A, since it's one of the paths with probability 1/3. \n\nLooking at the options again: \n\nA) ... and 1/3\n\nB) ... and 1/4\n\nC) ... and 1/4\n\nD) ... and 2/3 (but D's path is missing the initial state?)\n\nWait, option D's first arrow is missing the initial state: it says \"|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9\" but the initial state should be |3,0,0\u27e9. So D's transition route is incomplete, so probably not correct. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe decay of the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions must adhere to the selection rules.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The problem is about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. I need to determine the correct transition route and the probability given the options.\n\nFirst, I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules must be followed. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions (allowed transitions) state that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number (\u0394l) must be \u00b11. Also, the magnetic quantum number (m) must remain the same or change by \u00b11, but since the final m is 0 here, maybe that plays a role.\n\nStarting with the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9. The first transition must go to an intermediate state that allows the second transition to reach |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's break it down:\n\nThe first transition from n=3 to some lower n, say n=2. The orbital angular momentum l must change by \u00b11. Since the initial l is 0, the first transition must go to l=1 (since 0+1=1; can't go to -1). So the first intermediate state should be l=1. Therefore, possible intermediate states are |2,1,m\u27e9, where m can be -1,0, or +1. \n\nNow, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 must go to |2,1, m\u27e9. The m value can change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the possible m values for the intermediate state are -1, 0, or +1. So the possible first steps are to |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9, or |2,1,-1\u27e9. \n\nThen, the second transition must go from this intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's check each possibility.\n\nCase 1: Intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. The second transition must go to |1,0,0\u27e9. For the second transition, the \u0394l here must be from 1 to 0, which is \u0394l = -1, which is allowed. The m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Since the m is 0 in both the intermediate and final state, that's okay. So this path is possible: 3\u21922\u21921 via l=1 to l=0.\n\nCase 2: If the intermediate is |2,1,1\u27e9, then going to |1,0,0\u27e9 would require a \u0394m of -1 (since m goes from 1 to 0). That's allowed. The \u0394l here is 1 to 0, so \u0394l=-1, which is okay. So this path is also possible: 3\u21922 (l=1, m=1) \u21921.\n\nSimilarly, the third case with m=-1 would also be allowed: m goes from -1 to 0 (\u0394m=+1). \n\nSo all three m values for the intermediate l=1 are possible. However, the question states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So all three options (A, B, C) might be possible in terms of allowed transitions. But the options have different probabilities, so we need to figure out which one is correct based on the probabilities given.\n\nNow, the question mentions the probability. The options give different probabilities: 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3. To find the correct probability, I need to recall how the probabilities are calculated for such transitions. The probability for a dipole transition between two states depends on the matrix element of the dipole moment operator, which involves integrals over the wavefunctions. However, the problem might be referring to the relative probabilities of the different possible paths, considering the possible m values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the total probability is distributed among the possible decay paths. Since the initial state has m=0, and the final state also has m=0, the possible intermediate states with m= -1, 0, +1 can each contribute. But the total probability must sum over all possible paths. Wait, but in the question, it says \"decays to the state |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions\" so the path must be two steps, but perhaps each possible path (like via m=0, m=1, m=-1) has a certain probability. But the options list specific paths with specific probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities here refer to the ratio of the transition probabilities between the different paths. For example, when there are multiple possible paths, each with their own probability, but the question might be asking which path has the given probability. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, and the probabilities are given based on the number of possible m transitions. \n\nLet me think again. The initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9. The first transition must go to a state with l=1 (since \u0394l=\u00b11 from l=0). So the possible m values for the intermediate are m= -1, 0, or +1. So three possible intermediate states. Then, each of these can proceed to the final state. \n\nHowever, when going from the intermediate state to the final |1,0,0\u27e9, the second transition must also satisfy the dipole selection rules. Let's check for each intermediate:\n\nFor the intermediate |2,1,0\u27e9: the second transition is from l=1 to l=0. The \u0394l is -1, allowed. The m goes from 0 to 0, which is allowed (\u0394m=0). So that's valid.\n\nFor |2,1,1\u27e9: going to l=0, m=0. The \u0394m is -1, which is allowed. \n\nSimilarly for |2,1,-1\u27e9, \u0394m is +1, which is okay. \n\nSo all three paths are allowed. \n\nNow, the total number of possible paths is three. If the probabilities are equally likely, then each would have a probability of 1/3. But maybe the actual probabilities depend on the matrix elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the first transition from 3\u21922 has certain selection rules. Wait, the principal quantum number n can change by any amount, as long as the l condition is met. But in dipole transitions, the parity must change. The parity of a state is (-1)^l. The initial state has l=0, so parity is +1. The final state (n=1) is also l=0, parity +1. So the overall parity must change each time. \n\nWait, that might be important. Let me check parity for each transition step.\n\nFirst transition from 3 (l=0, parity +1) to the intermediate state. The intermediate state must have parity opposite to the initial. Since parity changes with each dipole transition. So the intermediate state must have parity -1. Since parity is (-1)^l, so l must be odd. Which it is (l=1). So that's okay. Then, the second transition from l=1 (parity -1) to l=0 (parity +1). So that also changes parity. So that's okay. So all those transitions are okay.\n\nBut how does parity affect the probabilities? Maybe not directly here. \n\nAlternatively, the probability for each transition path is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the integral of the wavefunctions. For the first transition, the matrix element for the dipole moment operator between |3,0,0\u27e9 and |2,1,m\u27e9. The matrix element's magnitude depends on the angular part and radial part. \n\nThe angular part for the first transition between l=0 to l=1. The angular integral is \u27e81 m | r Y\u2081\u1d50 |0 0\u27e9. The Y\u2081\u1d50 spherical harmonics have certain properties. The integral might be non-zero only for certain m values. Wait, but the dipole operator is proportional to r times a component of the position vector, which relates to the Y\u2081\u1d50 terms. \n\nActually, the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' requires that the sum l + l' + 1 must be even (or something like that?), but maybe I'm mixing up with other rules. Alternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition between |nlm\u27e9 and |n'l'm'\u27e9 is non-zero only if \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. Which we already considered. But the actual value of the matrix element (and hence the probability) can depend on the specific m values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities here are given by the number of possible paths. Since there are three possible m values for the intermediate (m=-1,0,+1), each of these would contribute equally, so each path has a probability of 1/3. However, in the options, option A gives 1/3, but the path in A is via m=0. Option B is via m=1, and C via m=-1, both with 1/4 and 1/4? Wait, the probabilities in the options are different. So perhaps the probabilities aren't equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition from 3\u21922 has certain probabilities. Let me think of the selection rules again. The first transition from n=3 to n=2 must also satisfy the \u0394n condition. There's no restriction on n except that the states must be different. So that's fine. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is simplified, and the probabilities are given by the number of possible m transitions. For the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m: the m can be 0, \u00b11, so three possibilities. Each of those can then transition to 1,0,0. So the total number of paths is 3. Therefore, each path would have a probability of 1/3, so the answer would be A or B or C with probability 1/3. But looking at the options, A has 1/3, B has 1/4, C has 1/4, D has 2/3. Hmm, so the answer might be A with 1/3. But why are the other options different?\n\nWait, perhaps the m=0 path has a different probability than the m=\u00b11 paths. Let me think. The matrix element for the transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,0\u27e9 might be different from the transitions to m=\u00b11. \n\nThe angular part of the dipole matrix element between l=0 and l'=1 requires that the integral over the spherical harmonics Y\u2081\u1d50(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6). The integral \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 is zero unless m=0, because Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric. \n\nWait, the dipole transition matrix element is proportional to \u27e82,1,m | r | 3,0,0\u27e9. The radial part depends on n, but the angular part is \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9. Wait, actually the dipole operator is proportional to the position vector components, so the matrix element for a dipole transition between states with angular momentum l and l' must involve the product of Y\u2081\u1d50 (since the dipole operator has l=1) and the wavefunctions.\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for the transition from l=0 to l'=1 would be:\n\n\u27e81 m | Y\u2081\u1d50' | 0 0\u27e9 \n\nWait, maybe more precisely, the matrix element involves the integral over angles of Y\u2081\u1d50*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) multiplied by some function. \n\nThe product Y\u2081\u1d50 Y\u2080\u2070 can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/\u221a(4\u03c0), and Y\u2081\u1d50 is proportional to sin\u03b8 e^{i\u03c6 m} for m=\u00b11, or cos\u03b8 for m=0. \n\nThe integral over the sphere of Y\u2081\u1d50 Y\u2080\u2070 is:\n\nFor m=0: Y\u2081\u2070 is proportional to cos\u03b8. The integral over Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 would be \u222b Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 d\u03a9. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric, when multiplied by cos\u03b8, the integral over \u03c6 would not vanish. Let me compute that. \n\nThe integral \u222b Y\u2081\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9. Since Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0), and Y\u2081\u2070 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. So the integral becomes (sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \u222b cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. The \u03c6 integral is \u222b0 to 2\u03c0 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral is \u222b0 to \u03c0 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. The integral becomes \u222b0 to 0 (since u goes from 0 to 0?) Wait, no, wait. Wait, sin\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0: when \u03b8 goes from 0 to \u03c0, u = sin\u03b8 goes from 0 to 0, but the integral of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 is (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/2 evaluated from 0 to \u03c0. Which is (0 - 0)/2 = 0. Wait, so that integral is zero. Wait, but that contradicts?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up. Let me re-calculate. The integral over \u03b8 is \u222b0 to \u03c0 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let me set u = sin\u03b8, then du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. The limits when \u03b8=0, u=0; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=0. So the integral becomes \u222b0^0 u du = 0. So the integral is zero. So the angular part for m=0 is zero? That can't be right. Hmm, but that would mean that the transition to m=0 is forbidden? But that can't be, because the selection rules allow m=0 as \u0394m=0. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dipole operator isn't just the radial part but a vector component. The dipole operator is e r, but the matrix element is for the vector component. For instance, the dipole moment is in a particular direction, say the z-component. Wait, the total matrix element would involve the sum over the components. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the dipole operator's components.\n\nThe dipole transition matrix element between two states |i\u27e9 and |f\u27e9 is proportional to \u27e8f | r | i\u27e9, where r is the position vector. To compute this, we can consider the components. The matrix element for the dipole transition can be written using the spherical harmonics. The radial part is separate, but the angular part must be considered. \n\nThe angular part of the transition from l=0 to l'=1 must satisfy that the angular integral \u27e8Y\u2081\u1d50 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 must be non-zero. But as we saw for m=0, that integral was zero. Wait, that would mean that the transition to m=0 is actually forbidden? But that contradicts the selection rules. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dipole operator has components in different directions. For example, the dipole operator is a vector, so the transition can occur via any of its components. The total matrix element squared would be the sum over the squares of the matrix elements for each component. But for the angular part, maybe for m=0, the transition is allowed via the z-component, but the integral for the z-component might be non-zero.\n\nWait, let me think again. The dipole operator in spherical coordinates has components. Let's consider the z-component, which is r cos\u03b8. The matrix element for the z-component between the initial state (l=0, m=0) and the final state (l'=1, m'=0) would be:\n\n\u27e81,0 | r cos\u03b8 | 0,0\u27e9 \n\nThe radial part is the same for all, but the angular part is \u222b Y\u2081\u2070*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nWait, the Y\u2081\u2070 is proportional to cos\u03b8, so the product Y\u2081\u2070 * cos\u03b8 would be proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. The integral over \u03c6 would still be 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 would involve cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8. Let me compute this:\n\nY\u2081\u2070 is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the angular part is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 * \u222b0^{2\u03c0} d\u03c6. The \u03c6 integral gives 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral is \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u = cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1. So the integral becomes \u222b1^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (2\u03c0) * (2/3). Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) = sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0). Then multiplied by 2\u03c0*(2/3) gives sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * (4\u03c0/3) )? Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe constants: sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3)/( (4\u03c0) ).\n\nMultiply by 2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) and the \u03b8 integral result (2/3):\n\nTotal angular integral part is (sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) ) = sqrt(3) * 2\u03c0 * 2/(3 *4\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3) * (4\u03c0)/(12\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/3. So the matrix element for the z-component is non-zero. So that transition is allowed. \n\nHmm, so my previous mistake was not considering the correct components. So the transition to m=0 is allowed. Then why was the earlier calculation for the product Y\u2081\u2070 Y\u2080\u2070 leading to zero? Because that was for a different operator, maybe. The dipole operator's z-component has the cos\u03b8 term, so when multiplied by Y\u2081\u2070 (which has cos\u03b8), the integral becomes non-zero. \n\nSo, the angular part for m=0 is allowed, and the matrix element is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for the transitions with m=\u00b11. Let's consider the m=1 case. The dipole operator's component in the x or y direction would involve terms with sin\u03b8 e^{\u00b1i\u03c6}, so maybe for m=1, the transition would involve the x or y component. \n\nThe angular integral for m=1 would be \u27e8Y\u2081\u00b9 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9. Since Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, and Y\u2080\u2070 is spherically symmetric. The integral over \u03c6 would involve e^{i\u03c6} integrated from 0 to 2\u03c0, which is zero. Therefore, the angular integral for m=1 would be zero for the dipole operator's radial part? Wait, but perhaps considering a different component of the dipole operator. \n\nWait, the dipole operator has three components. The total matrix element squared is the sum over the squares of each component's matrix elements. For the m=1 case, maybe the transition is allowed via the x or y component. \n\nFor example, the x-component of the dipole operator is (r sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6). The matrix element would involve Y\u2081\u00b9 (since m'=1 requires the angular part to have that). The integral over angles would involve Y\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) times sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. \n\nThe Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. So the product with sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 would give terms like e^{i\u03c6} sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03c6. The integral over \u03c6 would involve \u222b e^{i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 d\u03c6. Let me compute that. \n\nExpress cos\u03c6 as (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6}) / 2. Then the integrand becomes e^{i\u03c6} * (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6}) / 2 = [e^{i2\u03c6} + 1]/2. Integrating over \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0:\n\n\u222b0^{2\u03c0} [e^{i2\u03c6} +1]/2 d\u03c6 = (1/2)(0 + 2\u03c0) = \u03c0. But wait, that's for the e^{i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 part. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step:\n\nThe angular part for m=1 and x-component:\n\nThe angular integral is \u222b Y\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) [sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6] Y\u2080\u2070(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nY\u2081\u00b9*(\u03b8,\u03c6) is proportional to e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the angular integral becomes proportional to \u222b [e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8] [sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6] [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe terms involving \u03c6: e^{-i\u03c6} cos\u03c6. Let's write cos\u03c6 = (e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6})/2. Then e^{-i\u03c6} * cos\u03c6 = [e^{-i\u03c6} e^{i\u03c6} + e^{-i\u03c6} e^{-i\u03c6}]/2 = [1 + e^{-i2\u03c6}]/2. \n\nSo integrating over \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0, the integral of [1 + e^{-i2\u03c6}]/2 d\u03c6 is (2\u03c0)/2 [1 + 0] = \u03c0. \n\nThe \u03b8 terms: sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = sin\u00b3\u03b8. So the \u03b8 integral is \u222b0^\u03c0 sin^3\u03b8 d\u03b8. The integral of sin^3\u03b8 is (2/3). \n\nPutting it all together, the angular integral would be proportional to (some constants) * \u03c0 * (2/3). \n\nTherefore, the angular part for m=1 is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for m=-1, the same logic applies (since cos\u03c6 is even in \u03c6, and sin terms would involve similar integrals). \n\nTherefore, all three m values (0,1,-1) are allowed for the first transition. \n\nNow, the probabilities for each of these paths would depend on the square of the matrix elements. The matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 may have different magnitudes, leading to different probabilities. \n\nLet me assume that the radial parts are the same for all three transitions (since they are between n=3 to n=2, but different l's). The angular parts would determine the relative probabilities. \n\nEarlier, for the m=0 case, the angular part's squared contribution was (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nFor m=1, let's see. Let me compute the squared angular part for the m=1 case. \n\nThe angular integral for m=1 (using the x-component) had a factor of \u03c0 in \u03c6 and (2/3) in \u03b8. The constants from the spherical harmonics need to be considered. Let me try to compute the normalization constants properly. \n\nThe Y\u2081\u00b9 is proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. Wait, the exact expression for Y\u2081\u00b9 is:\n\nY\u2081\u00b9 = -sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, Y\u2080\u2070 is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0).\n\nThe angular integral (for the x-component matrix element) would be:\n\n\u27e8Y\u2081\u00b9 | sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 | Y\u2080\u2070\u27e9 \n\nThe integral is:\n\n\u222b Y\u2081\u00b9* sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 Y\u2080\u2070 sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 \n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\nY\u2081\u00b9* = -sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8\n\nY\u2080\u2070 = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)\n\nSo:\n\n- sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) / sqrt(4\u03c0) * \u222b e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 * sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 \n\nWait, the integrand terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 (from Y\u2081\u00b9) * sin\u03b8 (from the operator's sin\u03b8) * cos\u03c6 (from the operator's cos\u03c6) * sin\u03b8 (from the volume element sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6). \n\nWait, the operator's component is r times the position component, so the angular part is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe integrand becomes:\n\ne^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6 * sin\u03b8 \n\n= e^{-i\u03c6} cos\u03c6 sin^3\u03b8 \n\nMultiply by the constants:\n\n- sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) / sqrt(4\u03c0) = - sqrt(3) / (sqrt(8\u03c0) * sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) \n\n= - sqrt(3) / (sqrt(32 \u03c0\u00b2)) )\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the squared matrix elements for m=1 and m=-1 are the same, and the total contribution from m=\u00b11 is twice that of m=0, or something else. \n\nAlternatively, since the m=0 transition's angular part had a value proportional to sqrt(3)/3, while for m=1 it might be proportional to another term. Let's suppose that the squared matrix elements for m=1 and m=-1 are equal and let's denote their squared values as A, and for m=0 as B. \n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path. The probability for each path is proportional to the square of the matrix element for the first transition multiplied by the square of the matrix element for the second transition. \n\nAssuming that the second transition's matrix elements are the same for all three intermediate states (since going from l=1 to l=0, with m changing appropriately), then the probabilities would be proportional to the squares of the first transition's matrix elements. \n\nIf the first transition's matrix elements squared are B for m=0 and A for m=\u00b11, then the total probability is B + 2A (since m=+1 and -1 are two paths). \n\nAssuming that the matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 have different magnitudes, let's suppose that the m=0 transition has a matrix element squared of B, and each of the m=\u00b11 transitions have A each. \n\nIf the angular parts for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are such that B = 1/3 and each A is 1/6 (for example), then the total would be 1/3 + 2*(1/6) = 2/3, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the angular parts for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are equal. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part for m=0 is the same as for m=\u00b11. Let me think. The squared angular part for m=0 was (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3. \n\nFor m=1, let's see. The angular integral for the x-component was proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * ... \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total squared matrix elements for m=0 and m=\u00b11 are the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability is equally distributed among the three possible paths. If that's the case, each path would have a probability of 1/3. So option A would be correct. \n\nBut in the options, option A is |3\u21922,1,0\u21921\u27e9 with 1/3, and option D is the same path but with 2/3. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition has different probabilities. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe possible intermediate states are three (m=-1,0,+1). However, the second transition must go to m=0. For the second transition from the intermediate states, the possible m changes must also follow \u0394m=0, \u00b11. \n\nFor the intermediate state |2,1,0\u27e9, the second transition can have \u0394m=0 (to m=0), which is allowed. \n\nFor the intermediate state |2,1,1\u27e9, the second transition must have \u0394m=-1 (from m=1 to 0). \n\nSimilarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1. \n\nThe probabilities for these second transitions may also contribute. \n\nBut the problem states that the total decay occurs via two dipole transitions. The probability given in the options is probably the total probability for the entire path. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the ratio of the probabilities between different paths, but since the options give specific probabilities, perhaps the answer is A with 1/3 because there are three possible paths and each is equally probable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the m=0 path has a higher probability because the angular matrix element is larger. \n\nWait, let me think again about the angular matrix elements. For the first transition (3\u21922):\n\nThe angular part for m=0 had a squared value of (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1/3.\n\nFor the m=1 case, let's compute the squared angular part. Let's take the example of the x-component:\n\nThe angular integral for m=1 was:\n\nThe integral over angles gave us a result proportional to sqrt(3/(8\u03c0)) * sqrt(1/(4\u03c0)) * ... but I'm getting lost. Alternatively, maybe the total squared angular part for m=1 is the same as for m=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum over all possible m values for the first transition must give a certain total. The total probability for the first transition (from 3,0,0 to any possible intermediate state) would be the sum over m of the probabilities for each path. \n\nSuppose that the squared matrix elements for the first transition are the same for all three m values (m=-1,0,+1). Then each would have equal probability, so 1/3 each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the m=0 transition has a different probability. Let's think about the selection rules. \n\nWait, the parity is okay, but perhaps the angular momentum coupling. The dipole transition's angular part requires that the initial and final angular momenta couple with the dipole's angular momentum (l=1). \n\nThe matrix element for a transition from l_i to l_f must satisfy |l_f - l_i| \u2264 1 \u2264 l_f + l_i. Since l_i=0 and l_f=1, that's okay. \n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem might help here. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 * \u27e8l', m' | 1, 0 \u27e9 l, m\u27e9 \n\nWait, the dipole operator is a vector, so the matrix element for the transition must involve the vector coupling. \n\nSpecifically, the matrix element for the dipole transition between states |n,l,m\u27e9 and |n',l',m'\u27e9 is given by:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r_z | n, l, m\u27e9 = [some radial integral] * \u27e8l, m | l', m' | 1, 0 \u27e9 \n\nThe angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l, m; 1, 0 | l', m'\u27e9. \n\nBecause the dipole operator's z-component is proportional to r_z = r cos\u03b8, which corresponds to the l=1, m=0 component of the spherical harmonics. \n\nTherefore, the angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l and 1 (from the dipole) to get l', m'. \n\nFor the first transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m':\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80,0;1,0 |1, m'\u27e9 must be non-zero. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l1,m1; l2,m2 | L,M\u27e9 where L = l1 + l2 and M = m1 + m2. Here, l1=0, l2=1, so L must be 1, and M = m' = m1 + m2. Since m1=0 and m2=0 (since the dipole's m is 0 for the z-component), then M = 0. \n\nTherefore, the CG coefficient is \u27e80,0;1,0 |1, m'\u27e9. For this to be non-zero, m' must equal M = 0. Wait, but that would imply that m'=0. That contradicts earlier conclusions where m'=\u00b11 were allowed. \n\nWait, this is a key point. If the dipole operator's z-component (r_z) corresponds to m=0 (since it's proportional to cos\u03b8, which is Y\u2081\u2070), then the transition via the z-component can only change m by 0. Therefore, the m' must be m_initial + 0 = m_initial. Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the final m must be 0? \n\nWait, that can't be right because we have transitions to m=\u00b11. \n\nAh, perhaps I need to consider that the dipole operator has components with different m values. The dipole operator as a vector has components with m=0 (z), m=+1 (x+iy), and m=-1 (x-iy). \n\nTherefore, to get m'=1, you would need to use the component of the dipole operator with m_dipole=+1. \n\nThus, the angular part for a transition from |0,0\u27e9 to |1,1\u27e9 would involve the dipole's m=+1 component. \n\nThe general formula for the matrix element is:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r_+ | n, l, m\u27e9 = [radial integral] * \u27e8l, m | l', m' -1 |1, +1\u27e9 \n\nWait, the dipole's x and y components can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics with m=\u00b11. \n\nThe operator r_+ = r_x + i r_y is proportional to the Y\u2081\u00b9 component. \n\nTherefore, to compute the matrix element for a transition to m'=1, you would use the r_+ component, which has m_dipole=+1. \n\nThus, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would be \u27e8l_initial, m_initial; l_dipole=1, m_dipole=+1 | l_final, m_final\u27e9. \n\nFor the initial state (l=0, m=0), and dipole l=1, m=+1, the final m_final must be m_initial + m_dipole = 0 +1 =1. So the CG coefficient is \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9. \n\nThe CG coefficient for combining l1=0, l2=1, m1=0, m2=1 gives L=1, M=1. The value of \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * \u27e81,1 |1,1\u27e9? \n\nWait, the formula for CG coefficients when adding angular momenta. For l1=0 and l2=1, the only possible L is 1. The CG coefficient \u27e80,0;1,1 |1,1\u27e9 is 1, because when you add 0 and 1, the only way to get M=1 is by taking the m2=1 component. \n\nSo the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nTherefore, the angular part for the transition to m'=1 via the r_+ component is non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, for m'= -1, you would use the r_- component (m_dipole=-1), leading to m_final = 0 + (-1) = -1. \n\nSo, the angular part for transitions to m'=0, \u00b11 are all allowed via different components of the dipole operator. \n\nThe squared matrix elements would then depend on the radial integrals and the squares of the CG coefficients. Since the CG coefficients for m'=0 (using z-component) and m'=\u00b11 (using \u00b1 components) are all 1 (for the angular part), the angular parts are equal. \n\nThus, the angular parts contribute equally to each of the three possible m transitions. \n\nTherefore, the total probability is distributed equally among the three possible intermediate states (m=-1,0,+1). Hence, each path (A, B, C) has a probability of 1/3. \n\nLooking at the options, option A has the path through m=0 with probability 1/3. Option B and C have 1/4, which doesn't match. Option D has 2/3, which also doesn't fit. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"two dipole transitions\". The options for B and C also involve transitions with m=1 and m=-1. But according to this analysis, all three paths have equal probability, so A is the correct one with 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another angle. \n\nWait, the question says \"the corresponding probability are (use latex)\". Maybe the probabilities given are for the total transition, not per path. But the options list probabilities like 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability is the sum over all paths, so each path's probability is (1/3) * (probability of second transition). \n\nWait, the second transition from the intermediate to the final state might have different probabilities. Let's consider that. \n\nFor example, the first transition to |2,1,0\u27e9 has probability 1/3 (since three paths), then the second transition from there to |1,0,0\u27e9 must also be considered. \n\nThe second transition from |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 must satisfy \u0394l = -1 (okay), and \u0394m =0 (okay). The angular matrix element here would involve going from l=1 to l=0. \n\nSimilarly, the transition from |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 requires \u0394m =-1. \n\nThe angular parts for these second transitions may also affect the probabilities. \n\nLet me analyze the second transition's matrix element. \n\nFirst, for the path through m=0 (option A):\n\nSecond transition is from l=1, m=0 to l=0, m=0. \n\nUsing the same approach as before, the angular part for this transition is:\n\nThe dipole operator's z-component (since final m is 0). \n\nThe matrix element is \u27e81,0 | r_z | 0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part would be \u27e80,0 | l=0; l_dipole=1, m_dipole=0 |1,0\u27e9. Wait, similar to the first transition. \n\nWait, the initial state here is l=1, m=0. The final is l=0, m=0. \n\nUsing the Wigner-Eckart theorem again, the angular part is \u27e81,0 |1,0; 1,0 |0,0\u27e9? \n\nWait, no. The dipole transition from l=1 to l=0 must involve the dipole operator's component that can reduce l by 1. \n\nThe angular part would be the CG coefficient for combining l_initial=1, m_initial=0 with the dipole's m_dipole=0 (for z-component) to get l_final=0, m_final=0. \n\nWait, but l_final=0, so the total angular momentum L must be 0. The dipole operator's l=1, so the combination of l_initial=1 and l_dipole=1 must have L=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is \u27e81,0; 1,0 |0,0\u27e9. \n\nThis is non-zero because 1+1 can combine to L=0 (since |1-1| \u2264 L \u2264 1+1 \u2192 0 \u2264 L \u22642). \n\nThe CG coefficient is \u27e81,0;1,0 |0,0\u27e9 = -sqrt(1/(3)). \n\nBecause the formula for CG coefficients when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L=0:\n\n\u27e8l1, m1; l2, m2 |0,0\u27e9 = \u03b4_{m1, -m2} * sqrt( (2l2 +1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) * something... Wait, perhaps better to recall that for L=0, the CG coefficient is proportional to the Wigner 3j symbol. \n\nThe 3j symbol for:\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 0 0 \n\nis (-1)^{1+1+0} * sqrt( ( (2*0 +1) ) / ( (2*1+1)(2*1+1) )) ) \n\nWait, the 3j symbol \u27e81 1 0 | 0 0 0\u27e9 = (-1)^{0} * sqrt( ( (2*0+1)! ) / ( (2*1+1)! (2*1+1)! )^{1/2} } ... Hmm, maybe this is getting too complex. Alternatively, the value is known to be 1/sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the angular part squared would be (1/sqrt(3))\u00b2 = 1/3. \n\nFor the second transition from |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9, the angular part would involve going from m=1 to m=0, so \u0394m =-1. This would require using the dipole's m_dipole=-1 component (since m_initial + m_dipole = m_final \u2192 1 + (-1) =0). \n\nThe CG coefficient would be \u27e81,1;1,-1 |0,0\u27e9. \n\nThis is the same as the previous case but with m's. The 3j symbol would be \u27e81 1 0 |1 -1 0\u27e9? Not sure, but the CG coefficient here would also have a magnitude of 1/sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the squared angular parts for both the second transitions from m=0 and m=\u00b11 would be the same (1/3). \n\nTherefore, the total probability for each path is (angular part of first transition) * (angular part of second transition) multiplied by the radial parts squared. \n\nAssuming the radial parts for all transitions are the same (since they are between n=3 to n=2 and n=2 to n=1), the total probability for each path is proportional to (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for each. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the angular parts for the first transition (from 3\u21922) each have a squared value of 1/3 (for m=0 and m=\u00b11). The angular parts for the second transition (from 2\u21921) also each have 1/3. So the total for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But since there are three paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path, so each path's probability is (angular part first * angular part second) * radial parts squared. If the radial parts are the same for all paths, then each path's probability is proportional to (angular part first * angular part second). \n\nSince each angular part for first and second transitions is 1/3, the product is 1/9. But then each path has probability 1/9, totaling 3*(1/9) = 1/3. But that would mean the total probability for all paths is 1/3, which doesn't make sense because the decay must have a total probability of 1. \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe the radial integrals are different. The radial matrix elements between n=3 to 2 and n=2 to 1 might have different values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, and the probabilities are just based on the number of possible paths. Since there are three possible paths (m=-1,0,1), each has equal probability of 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option A, since it's one of the paths with probability 1/3. \n\nLooking at the options again: \n\nA) ... and 1/3\n\nB) ... and 1/4\n\nC) ... and 1/4\n\nD) ... and 2/3 (but D's path is missing the initial state?)\n\nWait, option D's first arrow is missing the initial state: it says \"|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9\" but the initial state should be |3,0,0\u27e9. So D's transition route is incomplete, so probably not correct. \n\nThus, the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe decay of the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions must adhere to the selection rules. The first transition must change \\( l \\) by \u00b11, so the intermediate state must have \\( l = 1 \\). The possible intermediate states are |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,1\u27e9, or |2,1,-1\u27e9. Each of these can transition to |1,0,0\u27e9, as their \\( l \\) values change by -1, satisfying \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\). \n\nThe angular parts of the matrix elements for transitions involving \\( m = 0 \\), \\( +1 \\), or \\( -1 \\) are all allowed and equally probable due to symmetry considerations. The probability for each path is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) since there are three equally likely paths. \n\nOption A corresponds to the path \\( |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle \\) with probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), which matches the analysis. \n\nAnswer: A",
