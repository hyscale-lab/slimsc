      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question is about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst part of the question (A): Which compound does NOT show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone vs. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nI remember that tautomerism involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond. Like keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached. Wait, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Or maybe it's more stable in its current form. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. But maybe that's so unstable that it tautomerizes? Or perhaps the trione form can rearrange into enol forms? Wait, trione might have some tautomeric forms. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is a diketone but can't tautomerize because the positions are too far apart? Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, I think benzoquinone (which is 1,4-benzoquinone) is actually the diketone form, and it can tautomerize to hydroquinone, which is the enol form. So the keto-enol tautomerism here would mean benzoquinone can switch to hydroquinone. Therefore, benzoquinone does show tautomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is trione, maybe it's more stable as the diketone? Or perhaps it can't tautomerize because of the arrangement. Wait, maybe when you have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, the molecule can't tautomerize because the enol form would require moving hydrogens, but maybe the positions are such that the tautomerization isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe the trione is a stable form and doesn't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the same as benzene-1,3,5-trione? Wait, no, benzene would be a benzene ring, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring but not aromatic. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. But in such a case, maybe the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But maybe the three ketone groups make it too strained or the tautomerism isn't feasible. Alternatively, perhaps it can form enol tautomers but they are not stable? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is pointing out that benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism (since it can turn into hydroquinone), so the one that does NOT show tautomerism would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) can indeed tautomerize to hydroquinone. That's a classic example. So if the question is asking which one does NOT show tautomerism, then maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the answer for A. Because maybe that compound can't tautomerize? Or perhaps it can, but maybe the question states that one of them does not. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the same as benzene-1,3,5-triketone (if it were aromatic), but that's actually a different compound. Wait, no, the question says cyclohexane, so it's not aromatic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a trione that can't tautomerize because the enol form would have three hydroxyl groups and double bonds, but maybe the arrangement isn't possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the trione form is more stable and doesn't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer for A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. So A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nMoving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism? \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or a plane of symmetry. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse the structure. The formula would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl group's carbon) is connected to four different groups: the adjacent CH3 (from the first carbon), the hydroxyl group, the COOCH3 group (from the third carbon), and the central carbon's other substituent. Wait, let me draw it out. \n\nThe molecule is: \n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nThe second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to: \n- CH3 (the first carbon),\n- OH,\n- COOCH3 (the third carbon),\n- and the central carbon's other substituent would be the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid. Wait, the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. Let me see: the structure is actually 2-hydroxypropanoic acid's methyl ester. \n\nBreaking it down: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. When esterified with methanol, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Or wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. \n\nWait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The methyl ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo the central carbon (the second carbon, the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: \n\n- a CH3 group (from the first carbon),\n- an OH group,\n- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),\n- and the carbon next to it (the third carbon's other group is the COOCH3). Wait, the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. Let me list its four substituents: \n\nCarbon 2 (the hydroxyl carbon):\n\n- Attached to the first carbon (CH3),\n- the hydroxyl (OH),\n- the third carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group),\n- and the hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) has bonds to: \n\n- The first carbon (CH3),\n- the OH group,\n- the third carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon in the ester group),\n- and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to two other carbons (the first and third), the OH, and another group. Wait, the second carbon is part of the chain. Let me count bonds. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 has four bonds:\n\n1. To the first carbon (CH3),\n2. To the third carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon in the ester),\n3. To the OH group,\n4. To a hydrogen? \n\nYes. So the four substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Wait, so that carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center here, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid, which is a maleic acid isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans form of butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the trans ester. The structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol to form dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acids are esterified, so it would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. Wait, fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups on either end of the double bond. So the structure would be O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Let me correct. \n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is: \n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid. Wait no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, fumaric is trans. Wait, but but-2-enedioic acid would have the two carboxylic acids on either side of the double bond. So the correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So in dimethyl fumarate, both COOH groups are replaced by COOCH3. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would only have one ester group. Wait no, both ends are esterified. Wait, the molecule has two carboxylic acid groups, so both would become esters. So it's actually O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? No, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, which is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me check. \n\nWait but-2-enedioic acid would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The carboxylic acids are on carbons 1 and 4. So the structure is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's actually maleic acid (cis) and fumaric is trans. Wait, no. Wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The groups on carbons 1 and 4 are both COOH. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH (trans). So when esterified, both COOH groups become COOCH3. Wait, but the molecule has two COOH groups. So the dimethyl fumarate would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. So the structure would be O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait no, that would be the cis version. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid (trans) is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's the cis. Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it as the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the molecule is:\n\nCarbonyl group (COOH) on carbon 1, then CH2, then CH2 (with a double bond?), no. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:\n\nThe but-2-enedioic acid has the structure:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The trans (fumaric) would have the two carboxyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo, when esterified to form dimethyl fumarate, both carboxyl groups are replaced with methoxy groups (COOCH3). So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends must be esterified. Wait, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the correct structure would be O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would be the cis form. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on either end of the double bond, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends are ester groups? So both the first and fourth carbons (in a four-carbon chain) have the ester groups. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the molecule would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with the double bond between the middle two carbons. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both carboxylic acids are esterified with methanol, it becomes OMe-CH=CH-COOMe (where OMe is OCH3). So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3 but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the actual structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe (trans isomer). \n\nNow, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see each carbon:\n\nThe carbons in the chain are:\n\n1: OOC-\n2: CH (attached to double bond)\n3: CH (attached to double bond)\n4: COOMe\n\nCarbon 2 and 3 are connected via a double bond. So carbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to carbon 3, a hydrogen (since it's CH?), and the other group? Wait, maybe the carbons in the double bond are each connected to two other groups. \n\nWait, the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the double bond) is connected to:\n\n- The OOC- group (from carbon 1),\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n- a hydrogen (since it's CH),\n- and the other group? Wait, maybe that's all. Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds: one to OOC-, one double bond to C3, and two single bonds (one H and the other? Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon has two bonds involved. Let me think of the structure as:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC- (carboxylate ester)\nCarbon 2: CH2 (but part of a double bond? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to count the bonds properly. \n\nWait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nCarbon 2: bonded to OOC- (from carbon 1), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen? So the substituents on C2 would be OOC-, =C (the double bond), and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds from the double bond, plus the OOC- and one more bond. Wait, carbon 2 must have four bonds. So the structure would be:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? Because in the CH= group, the CH has two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let me think of the actual structure. \n\nWait, the double bond between C2 and C3 would mean each has two bonds in the double bond. So for carbon 2: the double bond to C3, a single bond to the OOC- group, and a single bond to a hydrogen? That gives four bonds. So substituents on C2 are OOC-, =C (the double bond), H, and the other? Wait, no, that would only be three bonds. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the carbons in the double bond are actually CH groups. Let me think of the actual formula:\n\nThe molecule is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would require rearrangement. Alternatively, the correct structure of fumarate's ester would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, so each of those carbons has two single bonds. \n\nWait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. Let me think again. \n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both ends are esterified, it's OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each of the CH groups in the double bond (C2 and C3) are CH, so they each have two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nCarbon 2: connected to OOC- (from C1), the double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? But then the double bond would account for two bonds, so the remaining two bonds are OOC- and two H? Wait that's three bonds, which can't be. Wait, perhaps carbon 2 is CH2? No, that would not form a double bond. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the molecule as having no chiral centers. Because in the trans isomer (fumarate), the two CH groups in the double bond are each connected to two H atoms. So, for example, the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) each have two hydrogens. So each of those carbons has two H's, making them symmetrical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the structure is symmetrical along the double bond. Let's see: the left side is OOC-CH= and the right is CH-COOMe. If the double bond is trans, then each CH group has their substituents on the same side? Wait, no, trans would mean the groups are opposite. Wait, the double bond's substituents: the OOC- and the H on C2 would be on one side, and the COOMe and H on C3 on the other? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule may be symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would require a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. \n\nIn this case, each of the CH= groups would have one H. For example, carbon 2 is CH (with one H), and carbon 3 is CH (with one H), but arranged in the trans configuration. \n\nCarbon 2 has substituents: OOC- (from C1), double bond to C3, H, and another bond. Wait, maybe another H? That would make four bonds. Wait, carbon 2 would have two bonds from the double bond (so two bonds to C3), one bond to OOC-, and one bond to H. That's four bonds. Similarly, carbon 3 has two bonds to C2 (the double bond), one bond to COOMe, and one H. So each of these carbons has two H's? Wait, no, each has one H. \n\nIn any case, if the molecule is symmetrical, then there's a plane of symmetry through the double bond. For instance, the molecule would be symmetric left and right across the double bond axis. If that's the case, then it doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, dimethyl maleate (the cis isomer) would have a chiral center? Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer. The structure would be OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe (but with the double bond between C2 and C3 in cis configuration). Wait, but even in cis, maybe it still has symmetry. Alternatively, maybe in the cis form, there is a chiral center. \n\nWait, let me think again. The trans isomer (fumarate) is symmetric, so no chiral centers. The cis (maleate) would have a chiral center? Let me check. \n\nTake cis-but-2-enedioic acid (maleic acid). The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH2OOC-)? No, wait. Let me think of the cis form: the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is OOC-CH(CH2OOC-) ? No, more accurately, OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents on the same side (cis). \n\nWait, in the cis form, each of the CH groups in the double bond would have the substituents on the same side, but does that create a chiral center? \n\nWait, the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) are each part of the double bond. Since the double bond doesn't allow rotation, the groups attached to each carbon can be arranged in a way that might create a chiral center. Wait, but each of those carbons has two groups. Let me think of the cis structure: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to COOH, a double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. In the cis configuration, the two H's on C2 and C3 are on the same side of the double bond. However, each carbon (C2 and C3) only has two substituents (other than the double bond). \n\nWait, perhaps the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry even in the cis form? For example, if the two CH groups are arranged symmetrically. Wait, if the cis form has both substituents on the same side, but mirrored, maybe it's still symmetric? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the cis isomer, the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think of the actual structure. \n\nIn the case of dimethyl maleate (cis), the structure would be OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe with the double bond between C2 and C3 in cis configuration. Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. The groups on each carbon would be:\n\nCarbon 2: OOC-, double bond to C3, and two H's (if it's CH2?), but that can't form a double bond. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the possibility that dimethyl fumarate (trans) does not have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism, while dimethyl maleate (cis) would have a chiral center. But the question is about fumarate, the trans isomer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism. The other compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, does have a chiral center (the carbon with four different groups), so it does have optical isomerism. \n\nSo part B's answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the first option) shows optical isomerism, so B is methyl... \n\nPutting this together, for part A, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Wait earlier I thought that maybe benzoquinone does show tautomerism (since it can go to hydroquinone), so the one that doesn't would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nThen for B, the answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl... (this matches my conclusion). \n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone (which would mean benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, which contradicts my earlier thought). \n\nOption C: A = cyclohexane..., B = dimethyl fumarate (but dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism). \n\nOption D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl... \n\nSo the correct option should be A. Wait the options given are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 this matches my conclusion.\n\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl ... \u2192 but A here would be benzoquinone, which I thought does show tautomerism, so this is wrong.\n\nC) A = cyclo..., B = dimethyl fumarate \u2192 but B is wrong.\n\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl \u2192 both wrong.\n\nSo the answer should be option A. \n\nWait but wait, wait, I thought that benzoquinone does show tautomerism (keto-enol), so the compound that does NOT is the other one (cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione). So option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the first part. \n\nBenzoquinone: 1,4-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It can undergo enol tautomerism to form hydroquinone, which is the enol form. So yes, it does show tautomerism. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. I'm not sure if this can tautomerize. Wait, maybe it can, but perhaps the question states that one of them does not. Alternatively, maybe the trione form is too unstable and cannot tautomerize, or maybe it does. \n\nWait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually a known compound called \"triketone\", and it's a tautomeric form. Wait, maybe it can lose water to form a more stable form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it can't tautomerize because of the arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that benzoquinone can tautomerize but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't. So the correct A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, the first option (A) has B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate which is correct. \n\nSo the final answer should be option A. \n\nWait but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as benzene-1,3,5-triketone? No, that would be a benzene ring with three ketones, but that's impossible because the benzene ring can't have three ketone groups without being conjugated. Wait, maybe the question is referring to cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring but not aromatic, so having three ketone groups (each is a carbonyl group) on alternate positions (1,3,5). In such a case, maybe each ketone can tautomerize, but the molecule might have some symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the enol forms would be in a way that they can't exist due to steric hindrance or other factors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the correct answer is benzoquinone not showing tautomerism. Wait, but I'm pretty sure benzoquinone does tautomerize. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (does not show tautomerism), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (has optical isomerism).\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the correct answers for parts A and B:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**  \nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form hydroquinone, so it does exhibit tautomerism.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question is about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst part of the question (A): Which compound does NOT show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone vs. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nI remember that tautomerism involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond. Like keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached. Wait, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Or maybe it's more stable in its current form. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. But maybe that's so unstable that it tautomerizes? Or perhaps the trione form can rearrange into enol forms? Wait, trione might have some tautomeric forms. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is a diketone but can't tautomerize because the positions are too far apart? Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, I think benzoquinone (which is 1,4-benzoquinone) is actually the diketone form, and it can tautomerize to hydroquinone, which is the enol form. So the keto-enol tautomerism here would mean benzoquinone can switch to hydroquinone. Therefore, benzoquinone does show tautomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is trione, maybe it's more stable as the diketone? Or perhaps it can't tautomerize because of the arrangement. Wait, maybe when you have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, the molecule can't tautomerize because the enol form would require moving hydrogens, but maybe the positions are such that the tautomerization isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe the trione is a stable form and doesn't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the same as benzene-1,3,5-trione? Wait, no, benzene would be a benzene ring, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring but not aromatic. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. But in such a case, maybe the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But maybe the three ketone groups make it too strained or the tautomerism isn't feasible.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) can indeed tautomerize to hydroquinone. That's a classic example. So if the question is asking which one does NOT show tautomerism, then maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the answer for A. Because maybe that compound can't tautomerize? Or perhaps it can, but maybe the question states that one of them does not. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the same as benzene-1,3,5-triketone (if it were aromatic), but that's actually a different compound. Wait, no, the question says cyclohexane, so it's not aromatic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a trione that can't tautomerize because the enol form would have three hydroxyl groups and double bonds, but maybe the arrangement isn't possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the trione form is more stable and doesn't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer for A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism. So A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nMoving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism? \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or a plane of symmetry. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse the structure. The formula would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl group's carbon) is connected to four different groups: the adjacent CH3 (from the first carbon), the hydroxyl group, the COOCH3 group (from the third carbon), and the central carbon's other substituent. Wait, let me draw it out. \n\nThe molecule is: \n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nThe second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to: \n- CH3 (the first carbon),\n- OH,\n- COOCH3 (the third carbon),\n- and the central carbon's other substituent would be the carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid. Wait, the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. Let me see: the structure is actually 2-hydroxypropanoic acid's methyl ester. \n\nBreaking it down: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. When esterified with methanol, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, the structure would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Or wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. \n\nWait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. The formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The methyl ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo the central carbon (the second carbon, the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to: \n\n- a CH3 group (from the first carbon),\n- an OH group,\n- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),\n- and the carbon next to it (the third carbon's other group is the COOCH3). Wait, the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl. Let me list its four substituents: \n\nCarbon 2 (the hydroxyl carbon):\n\n- Attached to the first carbon (CH3),\n- the hydroxyl (OH),\n- the third carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group),\n- and the hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) has bonds to: \n\n- The first carbon (CH3),\n- the OH group,\n- the third carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon in the ester group),\n- and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to two other carbons (the first and third), the OH, and another group. Wait, the second carbon is part of the chain. Let me count bonds. \n\nWait, the carbon at position 2 has four bonds:\n\n1. To the first carbon (CH3),\n2. To the third carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon in the ester),\n3. To the OH group,\n4. To a hydrogen? \n\nYes. So the four substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Wait, so that carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, that's a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center here, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid, which is a maleic acid isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans form of butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the trans ester. The structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol to form dimethyl fumarate, both carboxylic acids are esterified, so it would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends would be esterified. Wait, fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups on either end of the double bond. So the structure would be O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Let me correct. \n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is: \n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid. Wait no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, fumaric is trans. Wait, but but-2-enedioic acid would have the two carboxylic acids on either side of the double bond. So the correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So in dimethyl fumarate, both COOH groups are replaced by COOCH3. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would only have one ester group. Wait no, both ends are esterified. Wait, the molecule has two carboxylic acid groups, so both would become esters. So it's actually O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? No, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, which is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me check. \n\nWait but-2-enedioic acid would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The carboxylic acids are on carbons 1 and 4. So the structure is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's actually maleic acid (cis) and fumaric is trans. Wait, no. Wait the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The groups on carbons 1 and 4 are both COOH. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOH (trans). So when esterified, both COOH groups become COOCH3. Wait, but the molecule has two COOH groups. So the dimethyl fumarate would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. So the structure would be O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait no, that would be the cis version. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe correct structure for fumaric acid (trans) is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's the cis. Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it as the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the molecule is:\n\nCarbonyl group (COOH) on carbon 1, then CH2, then CH2 (with a double bond?), no. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:\n\nThe but-2-enedioic acid has the structure:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The trans (fumaric) would have the two carboxyl groups on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo, when esterified to form dimethyl fumarate, both carboxyl groups are replaced with methoxy groups (COOCH3). So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends must be esterified. Wait, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the correct structure would be O2CCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that would be the cis form. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on either end of the double bond, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but both ends are ester groups? So both the first and fourth carbons (in a four-carbon chain) have the ester groups. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the molecule would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but with the double bond between the middle two carbons. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both carboxylic acids are esterified with methanol, it becomes OMe-CH=CH-COOMe (where OMe is OCH3). So the structure is OOCCH2CH2COOCH3 but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the actual structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe (trans isomer). \n\nNow, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see each carbon:\n\nThe carbons in the chain are:\n\n1: OOC-\n2: CH (attached to double bond)\n3: CH (attached to double bond)\n4: COOMe\n\nCarbon 2 and 3 are connected via a double bond. So carbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to carbon 3, a hydrogen (since it's CH?), and the other group? Wait, maybe the carbons in the double bond are each connected to two other groups. \n\nWait, the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the double bond) is connected to:\n\n- The OOC- group (from carbon 1),\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n- a hydrogen (since it's CH),\n- and the other group? Wait, maybe that's all. Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds: one to OOC-, one double bond to C3, and two single bonds (one H and the other? Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon has two bonds involved. Let me think of the structure as:\n\nCarbon 1: OOC- (carboxylate ester)\nCarbon 2: CH2 (but part of a double bond? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to count the bonds properly. \n\nWait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nCarbon 2: bonded to OOC- (from carbon 1), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen? So the substituents on C2 would be OOC-, =C (the double bond), and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds from the double bond, plus the OOC- and one more bond. Wait, carbon 2 must have four bonds. So the structure would be:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? Because in the CH= group, the CH has two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let me think of the actual structure. \n\nWait, the double bond between C2 and C3 would mean each has two bonds in the double bond. So for carbon 2: the double bond to C3, a single bond to the OOC- group, and a single bond to a hydrogen? That gives four bonds. So substituents on C2 are OOC-, =C (the double bond), H, and the other? Wait, no, that would only be three bonds. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the carbons in the double bond are actually CH groups. Let me think of the actual formula:\n\nThe molecule is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would require rearrangement. Alternatively, the correct structure of fumarate's ester would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, so each of those carbons has two single bonds. \n\nWait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. Let me think again. \n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when both ends are esterified, it's OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. Each of the CH groups in the double bond (C2 and C3) are CH, so they each have two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nCarbon 2: connected to OOC- (from C1), the double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? But then the double bond would account for two bonds, so the remaining two bonds are OOC- and two H? Wait that's three bonds, which can't be. Wait, perhaps carbon 2 is CH2? No, that would not form a double bond. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the molecule as having no chiral centers. Because in the trans isomer (fumarate), the two CH groups in the double bond are each connected to two H atoms. So, for example, the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) each have two hydrogens. So each of those carbons has two H's, making them symmetrical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the structure is symmetrical along the double bond. Let's see: the left side is OOC-CH= and the right is CH-COOMe. If the double bond is trans, then each CH group has their substituents on the same side? Wait, no, trans would mean the groups are opposite. Wait, the double bond's substituents: the OOC- and the H on C2 would be on one side, and the COOMe and H on C3 on the other? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the molecule may be symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would require a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOMe. \n\nIn this case, each of the CH= groups would have one H. For example, carbon 2 is CH (with one H), and carbon 3 is CH (with one H), but arranged in the trans configuration. \n\nCarbon 2 has substituents: OOC- (from C1), double bond to C3, H, and another bond. Wait, maybe another H? That would make four bonds. Wait, carbon 2 would have two bonds from the double bond (so two bonds to C3), one bond to OOC-, and one bond to H. That's four bonds. Similarly, carbon 3 has two bonds to C2 (the double bond), one bond to COOMe, and one H. So each of these carbons has two H's? Wait, no, each has one H. \n\nIn any case, if the molecule is symmetrical, then there's a plane of symmetry through the double bond. For instance, the molecule would be symmetric left and right across the double bond axis. If that's the case, then it doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomerism. \n\nOn the other hand, dimethyl maleate (the cis isomer) would have a chiral center? Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer. The structure would be OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe (but with the double bond between C2 and C3 in cis configuration). Wait, but even in cis, maybe it still has symmetry. Alternatively, maybe in the cis form, there is a chiral center. \n\nWait, let me think again. The trans isomer (fumarate) is symmetric, so no chiral centers. The cis (maleate) would have a chiral center? Let me check. \n\nTake cis-but-2-enedioic acid (maleic acid). The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH2OOC-)? No, wait. Let me think of the cis form: the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is OOC-CH(CH2OOC-) ? No, more accurately, OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents on the same side (cis). \n\nWait, in the cis form, each of the CH groups in the double bond would have the substituents on the same side, but does that create a chiral center? \n\nWait, the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) are each part of the double bond. Since the double bond doesn't allow rotation, the groups attached to each carbon can be arranged in a way that might create a chiral center. Wait, but each of those carbons has two groups. Let me think of the cis structure: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to OOC-, a double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to COOH, a double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. In the cis configuration, the two H's on C2 and C3 are on the same side of the double bond. However, each carbon (C2 and C3) only has two substituents (other than the double bond). \n\nWait, perhaps the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry even in the cis form? For example, if the two CH groups are arranged symmetrically. Wait, if the cis form has both substituents on the same side, but mirrored, maybe it's still symmetric? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the cis isomer, the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think of the actual structure. \n\nIn the case of dimethyl maleate (cis), the structure would be OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe with the double bond between C2 and C3 in cis configuration. Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. The groups on each carbon would be:\n\nCarbon 2: OOC-, double bond to C3, and two H's (if it's CH2?), but that can't form a double bond. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the possibility that dimethyl fumarate (trans) does not have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism, while dimethyl maleate (cis) would have a chiral center. But the question is about fumarate, the trans isomer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism. The other compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, does have a chiral center (the carbon with four different groups), so it does have optical isomerism. \n\nSo part B's answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the first option) shows optical isomerism, so B is methyl... \n\nPutting this together, for part A, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Wait earlier I thought that maybe benzoquinone does show tautomerism (since it can go to hydroquinone), so the one that doesn't would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nThen for B, the answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl... (this matches my conclusion). \n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone (which would mean benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, which contradicts my earlier thought). \n\nOption C: A = cyclohexane..., B = dimethyl fumarate (but dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism). \n\nOption D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl... \n\nSo the correct option should be A. Wait the options given are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate \u2192 this matches my conclusion.\n\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl ... \u2192 but A here would be benzoquinone, which I thought does show tautomerism, so this is wrong.\n\nC) A = cyclo..., B = dimethyl fumarate \u2192 but B is wrong.\n\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl \u2192 both wrong.\n\nSo the answer should be option A. \n\nWait but wait, wait, I thought that benzoquinone does show tautomerism (keto-enol), so the compound that does NOT is the other one (cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione). So option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the first part. \n\nBenzoquinone: 1,4-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It can undergo enol tautomerism to form hydroquinone, which is the enol form. So yes, it does show tautomerism. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. I'm not sure if this can tautomerize. Wait, maybe it can, but perhaps the question states that one of them does not. Alternatively, maybe the trione form is too unstable and cannot tautomerize, or maybe it does. \n\nWait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually a known compound called \"triketone\", and it's a tautomeric form. Wait, maybe it can lose water to form a more stable form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it can't tautomerize because of the arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that benzoquinone can tautomerize but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't. So the correct A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, the first option (A) has B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate which is correct. \n\nSo the final answer should be option A. \n\nWait but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as benzene-1,3,5-triketone? No, that would be a benzene ring with three ketones, but that's impossible because the benzene ring can't have three ketone groups without being conjugated. Wait, maybe the question is referring to cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring but not aromatic, so having three ketone groups (each is a carbonyl group) on alternate positions (1,3,5). In such a case, maybe each ketone can tautomerize, but the molecule might have some symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize because the enol forms would be in a way that they can't exist due to steric hindrance or other factors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the correct answer is benzoquinone not showing tautomerism. Wait, but I'm pretty sure benzoquinone does tautomerize. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (does not show tautomerism), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (has optical isomerism).\n\n\nTo determine the correct answers for parts A and B:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**  \nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form hydroquinone, so it does exhibit tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, likely does not undergo tautomerism due to structural constraints or stability, making it the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**  \nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon (the second carbon with four different substituents: CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H), enabling optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate (trans isomer) lacks a chiral center and has a plane of symmetry, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Correct Options**:  \nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (no tautomerism), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (optical isomerism).  \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to tackle this question step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question has two parts: part A is about which compound (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism. Part B is which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nStarting with part A. Tautomerism involves the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms through the movement of a proton and a double bond. For example, keto-enol tautomerism. I remember that benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached at positions 1 and 4, right? So the structure would be O=C6H4-C=O. Wait, actually benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. \n\nHmm, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Let me think. The structure has two ketone groups. If there's a possibility of the carbonyl groups moving around, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are fixed on the benzene ring. Benzene rings are aromatic and planar. The resonance structures would involve the double bonds moving around the ring, but that's resonance, not tautomerism. Tautomerism requires the actual movement of a proton, leading to different connectivity. For example, if there's an enol form, where a hydrogen moves from one oxygen to another with a double bond shift. But benzoquinone's structure is stable with two ketones. I don't think it can tautomerize. Wait, maybe in some cases, but maybe not under normal conditions. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If it has three ketones at 1,3,5 positions, that might lead to some tautomeric forms. Alternatively, maybe the ring can open and close, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ketones can form enol tautomers. Let me think. For example, in a ketone, the enol form would have a double bond between two carbons and a hydroxyl group. But with three ketones on a cyclohexane ring, maybe there's some possibility of tautomerism here. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism where one of the carbonyl groups converts to an enol form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't because of the aromatic ring's stability, but the cyclohexane trione can. So the compound that does NOT show tautomerism would be benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone (since the question asks for which one does not show tautomerism). \n\nNow part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me parse the name. The formula would be something like CH3-C(OOCH2CH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, maybe better to write the structure. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent chain is propanoic acid. The 2-hydroxy group is on carbon 2, so the structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (since it's the ester part: propanoate would be -COO-, and methyl ester makes that part). Wait, maybe better: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid. The methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure would be: \n\nThe molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the CH(OH)) has substituents: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, COOCH3 (the carboxylate ester group), and the hydrogen on the carbon itself? Wait, the second carbon in the chain (since propanoate is three carbons). Wait, maybe the structure is:\n\nThe propanoate group: the carboxylic acid is at carbon 1, then carbon 2 is the hydroxyl. So the structure would be:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (the ester), Carbon 2: CH(OH), and Carbon 3: CH3. Wait, the formula would be CH2(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I need to think again. Let me structure it properly. \n\nThe name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate is the acid (three carbons). The 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure would be:\n\nThe carboxylic acid group (COOH) becomes COOCH3 (since it's the methyl ester). The second carbon (next to the COO group) has an OH group. The third carbon is a CH3. So the structure is: \n\nCH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Let me count again. The parent chain is propanoic acid (three carbons). The 2-hydroxy is on carbon 2. So the chain is:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (the ester), Carbon 2: CH(OH), and Carbon 3: CH3. Wait, so Carbon 2 has four groups: the COOCH3 is on Carbon 1, so Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 and 3, plus the OH and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Carbon 2 would be between the COOCH3 (Carbon 1) and Carbon 3 (which is CH3). So Carbon 2 has substituents: OH, H, and the two carbons (Carbon 1 and 3). Wait, but Carbon 2 has four substituents: the OH group, the hydrogen (since it's a CH group), the adjacent carbons. Wait, so Carbon 2 has four different groups? Let's see:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which is part of the COOCH3 group),\n\n- Carbon 3 (the CH3),\n\n- The OH group,\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's a CH(OH) group).\n\nWait, so the four groups are: COOCH3 (via the adjacent carbon?), no, Carbon 2 is directly attached to Carbon 1 (the COOCH3 is on Carbon 1). So Carbon 2 has groups: \n\n- A single bond to Carbon 1 (which has the COOCH3 group),\n\n- A single bond to Carbon 3 (which is CH3),\n\n- The OH group,\n\n- And a hydrogen (since it's a CH(OH) group, so the other substituent is H). \n\nTherefore, all four groups around Carbon 2 are different: the COOCH3 is on the adjacent carbon, but Carbon 2's substituents are: the COOCH3 via the chain? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Wait, Carbon 2's substituents are:\n\nThe group attached to Carbon 1 (which is the COOCH3's carbon, so the bond is C1-C2). So Carbon 2 is connected to C1 (which is part of the COOCH3 group), the CH3 (Carbon 3), the OH group, and a hydrogen. So those are four different groups. Therefore, Carbon 2 is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center here, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid, which is a trans-diacid. The dimethyl ester would have both carboxylic acid groups esterified with methyl. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically the trans isomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is CH2(COO-)CH2 but in trans configuration. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is:\n\nO=C-(CH2)-C(=O) with the two CH2 groups in trans. Wait, more precisely, the structure is:\n\nThe molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4, arranged trans. The dimethyl ester would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. \n\nLooking for chiral centers here. Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, but the molecule is symmetric. Let's see: the structure would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COO (but in trans). Wait, no. Let me draw it properly. The fumarate structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The structure would be:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that would be maleic acid (cis). Wait, no. For fumaric acid, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two COOH groups are on the same side (cis) in maleic, but trans in fumaric. Wait, no, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. The structure is:\n\nThe molecule is CH2(COOH)CH=CH(COOH), but arranged trans. Wait, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each carboxyl group is on a different side. So the structure is:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid again. Let me think again. The actual structure of fumaric acid is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are attached to carbons 1 and 4. The arrangement is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, there are no chiral centers here. Because the molecule is symmetric, any plane or axis of symmetry would mean no chiral centers. Since the two ends are the same, each carbon (positions 1 and 4) have the same substituents. So the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (the ester form) would not have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but what about the double bond? Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, but the molecule is symmetric. So there's no chiral center here. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo for part B, the one that does show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (since it has a chiral center), while dimethyl fumarate does not. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (so A is the one that does not show tautomerism, which matches my thought that benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for optical isomerism). So option B would be the correct one. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Option D says A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate, but B in D is wrong. Option C has B as dimethyl fumarate, which is not correct. Option A has A as cyclohexane-trione, but I thought that's the one that does show tautomerism. So the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but I should confirm the tautomerism part again. \n\nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups. Since they are on a benzene ring, the structure is fixed. The aromatic ring's stability would prevent any keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity, so that's not favorable. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Maybe it can undergo some tautomerism. For example, in such a structure, perhaps the ring can open or the carbonyl groups can rearrange. Alternatively, maybe it can form enol forms. Since there are three carbonyl groups on the cyclohexane, perhaps the molecule can undergo tautomerism. For instance, the ring might open, allowing a proton to shift, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in some cases, such a trione might be unstable and prone to rearrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to a different form. Since the question is about which does NOT show tautomerism, then the one that doesn't would be benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nWait, but wait another thought on the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think of its structure. A cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone is a carbonyl group attached to the ring. The positions are every other carbon. Since cyclohexane has six carbons, 1,3,5 would be three carbons each separated by one carbon. So each of those carbons has a carbonyl group. \n\nIn such a case, perhaps the molecule is highly strained. Maybe it can undergo some tautomerism to relieve strain. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the arrangement is too fixed. Alternatively, perhaps it can form enol forms. For example, the ketone groups could convert to enol forms by moving a hydrogen. If one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol, that might allow some rearrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this compound is known to exhibit tautomerism. For example, in some cases, triones can undergo tautomerism between different forms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but the benzene ring's aromaticity would prevent that. So I think my initial thought holds. \n\nThus, the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we analyze each part step by step:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**  \nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The aromatic stability of the benzene ring prevents keto-enol tautomerism, as such a shift would disrupt aromaticity. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to tackle this question step by step. Let me read it again carefully. The question has two parts: part A is about which compound (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism. Part B is which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nStarting with part A. Tautomerism involves the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms through the movement of a proton and a double bond. For example, keto-enol tautomerism. I remember that benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached at positions 1 and 4, right? So the structure would be O=C6H4-C=O. Wait, actually benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. \n\nHmm, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Let me think. The structure has two ketone groups. If there's a possibility of the carbonyl groups moving around, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are fixed on the benzene ring. Benzene rings are aromatic and planar. The resonance structures would involve the double bonds moving around the ring, but that's resonance, not tautomerism. Tautomerism requires the actual movement of a proton, leading to different connectivity. For example, if there's an enol form, where a hydrogen moves from one oxygen to another with a double bond shift. But benzoquinone's structure is stable with two ketones. I don't think it can tautomerize. Wait, maybe in some cases, but maybe not under normal conditions. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If it has three ketones at 1,3,5 positions, that might lead to some tautomeric forms. Alternatively, maybe the ring can open and close, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ketones can form enol tautomers. Let me think. For example, in a ketone, the enol form would have a double bond between two carbons and a hydroxyl group. But with three ketones on a cyclohexane ring, maybe there's some possibility of tautomerism here. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism where one of the carbonyl groups converts to an enol form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't because of the aromatic ring's stability, but the cyclohexane trione can. So the compound that does NOT show tautomerism would be benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone (since the question asks for which one does not show tautomerism). \n\nNow part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me parse the name. The formula would be something like CH3-C(OOCH2CH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, maybe better to write the structure. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent chain is propanoic acid. The 2-hydroxy group is on carbon 2, so the structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (since it's the ester part: propanoate would be -COO-, and methyl ester makes that part). Wait, maybe better: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid. The methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure would be: \n\nThe molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon at position 2 (the CH(OH)) has substituents: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, COOCH3 (the carboxylate ester group), and the hydrogen on the carbon itself? Wait, the second carbon in the chain (since propanoate is three carbons). Wait, maybe the structure is:\n\nThe propanoate group: the carboxylic acid is at carbon 1, then carbon 2 is the hydroxyl. So the structure would be:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (the ester), Carbon 2: CH(OH), and Carbon 3: CH3. Wait, the formula would be CH2(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I need to think again. Let me structure it properly. \n\nThe name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate is the acid (three carbons). The 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure would be:\n\nThe carboxylic acid group (COOH) becomes COOCH3 (since it's the methyl ester). The second carbon (next to the COO group) has an OH group. The third carbon is a CH3. So the structure is: \n\nCH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Let me count again. The parent chain is propanoic acid (three carbons). The 2-hydroxy is on carbon 2. So the chain is:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (the ester), Carbon 2: CH(OH), and Carbon 3: CH3. Wait, so Carbon 2 has four groups: the COOCH3 is on Carbon 1, so Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 and 3, plus the OH and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Carbon 2 would be between the COOCH3 (Carbon 1) and Carbon 3 (which is CH3). So Carbon 2 has substituents: OH, H, and the two carbons (Carbon 1 and 3). Wait, but Carbon 2 has four substituents: the OH group, the hydrogen (since it's a CH group), the adjacent carbons. Wait, so Carbon 2 has four different groups? Let's see:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which is part of the COOCH3 group),\n\n- Carbon 3 (the CH3),\n\n- The OH group,\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's a CH(OH) group).\n\nWait, so the four groups are: COOCH3 (via the adjacent carbon?), no, Carbon 2 is directly attached to Carbon 1 (the COOCH3 is on Carbon 1). So Carbon 2 has groups: \n\n- A single bond to Carbon 1 (which has the COOCH3 group),\n\n- A single bond to Carbon 3 (which is CH3),\n\n- The OH group,\n\n- And a hydrogen (since it's a CH(OH) group, so the other substituent is H). \n\nTherefore, all four groups around Carbon 2 are different: the COOCH3 is on the adjacent carbon, but Carbon 2's substituents are: the COOCH3 via the chain? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Wait, Carbon 2's substituents are:\n\nThe group attached to Carbon 1 (which is the COOCH3's carbon, so the bond is C1-C2). So Carbon 2 is connected to C1 (which is part of the COOCH3 group), the CH3 (Carbon 3), the OH group, and a hydrogen. So those are four different groups. Therefore, Carbon 2 is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center here, so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid, which is a trans-diacid. The dimethyl ester would have both carboxylic acid groups esterified with methyl. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically the trans isomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is CH2(COO-)CH2 but in trans configuration. Wait, actually, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is:\n\nO=C-(CH2)-C(=O) with the two CH2 groups in trans. Wait, more precisely, the structure is:\n\nThe molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4, arranged trans. The dimethyl ester would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. \n\nLooking for chiral centers here. Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, but the molecule is symmetric. Let's see: the structure would be:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COO (but in trans). Wait, no. Let me draw it properly. The fumarate structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The structure would be:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that would be maleic acid (cis). Wait, no. For fumaric acid, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two COOH groups are on the same side (cis) in maleic, but trans in fumaric. Wait, no, actually, fumaric acid is the trans isomer. The structure is:\n\nThe molecule is CH2(COOH)CH=CH(COOH), but arranged trans. Wait, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two carboxyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So each carboxyl group is on a different side. So the structure is:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid again. Let me think again. The actual structure of fumaric acid is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are attached to carbons 1 and 4. The arrangement is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, there are no chiral centers here. Because the molecule is symmetric, any plane or axis of symmetry would mean no chiral centers. Since the two ends are the same, each carbon (positions 1 and 4) have the same substituents. So the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (the ester form) would not have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but what about the double bond? Since the double bond is in the trans configuration, but the molecule is symmetric. So there's no chiral center here. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo for part B, the one that does show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (since it has a chiral center), while dimethyl fumarate does not. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (so A is the one that does not show tautomerism, which matches my thought that benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for optical isomerism). So option B would be the correct one. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Option D says A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate, but B in D is wrong. Option C has B as dimethyl fumarate, which is not correct. Option A has A as cyclohexane-trione, but I thought that's the one that does show tautomerism. So the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but I should confirm the tautomerism part again. \n\nBenzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups. Since they are on a benzene ring, the structure is fixed. The aromatic ring's stability would prevent any keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity, so that's not favorable. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Maybe it can undergo some tautomerism. For example, in such a structure, perhaps the ring can open or the carbonyl groups can rearrange. Alternatively, maybe it can form enol forms. Since there are three carbonyl groups on the cyclohexane, perhaps the molecule can undergo tautomerism. For instance, the ring might open, allowing a proton to shift, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in some cases, such a trione might be unstable and prone to rearrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to a different form. Since the question is about which does NOT show tautomerism, then the one that doesn't would be benzoquinone. So A is benzoquinone. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nWait, but wait another thought on the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think of its structure. A cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone is a carbonyl group attached to the ring. The positions are every other carbon. Since cyclohexane has six carbons, 1,3,5 would be three carbons each separated by one carbon. So each of those carbons has a carbonyl group. \n\nIn such a case, perhaps the molecule is highly strained. Maybe it can undergo some tautomerism to relieve strain.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. Hmm, so the question is about isomerism and tautomerism. The problem has two parts, A and B. I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism for part A, and which of the two given compounds shows optical isomerism for part B. \n\nStarting with part A: The options are benzoquinone versus cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, often involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. Like keto-enol tautomerism, for example. \n\nBenzoquinone is a compound with two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Its structure is C6H4O2, right? Each ketone is on a carbon of the benzene. Wait, actually, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups (C=O) on adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. So maybe it's something like O=C-CH-O-... but arranged on the benzene. \n\nThen cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl group. Hmm. Now, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to recall. Benzoquinone is a stable compound. Wait, maybe in some conditions it can tautomerize? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is prone to tautomerism. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups. Since it's a triketone, perhaps it can undergo some tautomeric shifts. Alternatively, maybe it can form enol forms? Let me think. \n\nWait, enol tautomerism requires that a hydrogen can move between two positions with a double bond shift. For example, in a ketone, the enol form would have a double bond next to an -OH group. If the molecule has multiple ketones, maybe they can interconvert. But if all the carbonyls are in a ring, maybe the structure is fixed. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure with three carbonyl groups on alternate carbons of a six-membered ring. Since the ring is cyclohexane, but with three ketones, maybe that's a very strained structure? Wait, but maybe it's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If one of them could form an enol, but then maybe the other would not. Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can exist in a form where one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it can't because of the aromatic stabilization? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that does not show tautomerism. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think of examples. \n\nWait, maybe benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) is known to exist in enol form under certain conditions. For instance, sometimes quinones can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, maybe the triketone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, can undergo tautomerism. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as triketohexane, which might be a tautomeric form. Wait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo enolization, but maybe benzoquinone can't because of the aromatic ring? \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't tautomerize. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look up some facts. Wait, but since I can't do that, I'll have to think again. \n\nWait, another approach: Tautomerism often requires the molecule to have a structure where a hydrogen can move between two positions with a double bond shift. For benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups (each is a carbonyl), perhaps it can form an enol. Let me draw the structure in my mind. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups on carbons 1 and 4 (assuming 1,4 positions). The structure would be O=C-C6H4-O=C. Wait, actually, maybe it's more like the benzene ring with two carbonyl groups on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. 1,4-benzoquinone would have the two carbonyl groups separated by two carbons on the benzene ring. \n\nWait, if benzoquinone has two ketone groups, maybe each can form an enol. But then the enol form would have a double bond and an -OH. But maybe in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are in such a way that they can't tautomerize without disrupting the aromatic ring? Because the benzene ring is aromatic, so if the tautomerism would break that, maybe it's not possible. Wait, but the carbonyl groups are part of the benzene ring? Wait, no. The carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring. Wait, actually, benzoquinone is a substituted benzene where two of the hydrogens are replaced by carbonyl groups. Wait, no. The structure is more like each carbonyl is on the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has two ketone groups. So, the structure is like O=C-CH2-? Wait no. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4. So the benzene ring has two carbonyl groups. So the actual structure would have two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring. In that case, each of those carbonyl groups could potentially form an enol. But would that disrupt the aromaticity? Because if you have an enol form, that would involve a double bond between two carbons and an -OH group. If the benzene ring loses a double bond, then the aromaticity would be lost. Since aromatic compounds are more stable, maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would be less stable. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism because that would destroy the aromatic ring. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Since there's no aromatic ring here, maybe the molecule can undergo tautomerism more easily. The cyclohexane ring isn't aromatic, so forming an enol might be possible. For example, one of the carbonyl groups could become an enol, shifting a double bond and moving an -OH. But since there are three ketone groups, perhaps they can interconvert in some way. \n\nWait, but if all three carbonyls are in the 1,3,5 positions, maybe the molecule is in a form where tautomerism isn't possible because of symmetry? Or maybe the molecule is too strained? Alternatively, maybe it can't tautomerize because the arrangement doesn't allow for the necessary movement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as triketohexane, which is known to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), and the other option would be the opposite. Wait, the question says: \"the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)\". So, if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then A is benzoquinone. But if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't, then A would be that. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of specific examples. For instance, I know that enol tautomerism is common in compounds like ketones and aldehydes. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. But if the benzene ring is aromatic, then the enol form would have to break the aromaticity. Since aromaticity is a big stabilizer, the keto form is preferred. So benzoquinone would not undergo tautomerism. \n\nAlternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a triketone on a cyclohexane ring, might not have such a barrier. Let's think of another example: cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That can exist in enol form, right? Because it's not aromatic. So a triketone might also have tautomers. But perhaps the triketone is so highly substituted that it can't tautomerize? Or maybe it can. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually a tautomer of another structure. Wait, maybe it can form a 1,3-diketone with an enol form? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triketone can't tautomerize because all three carbonyls are in positions that prevent the movement of the hydrogen. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again. \n\nLooking at the options for A: \n\nOption A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So that would mean that it does not show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does. \n\nOption D says A is benzoquinone (so that's the one that doesn't show tautomerism), so the other one (the triketone) does. \n\nSo between those, which is correct? \n\nWait, I recall that benzoquinone is a stable compound and doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because of the aromatic stabilization. So it doesn't show tautomerism. So the answer for part A would be benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nThen looking at the options, the correct A part would be either B or D. \n\nNow moving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. The structure would be: \n\nThe name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nBreaking it down: \n\nPropanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is:\n\nThe acid group is on the third carbon (propanoate), and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. \n\nWait, the full structure would be: \n\nThe formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo the second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to a methyl (from the first carbon), an -OH, a -COOCH3 group, and the hydrogen. Wait, let's see: \n\nCarbon 1: CH3- \n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)- \n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 has substituents: CH3 (from carbon 1?), wait no, carbon 2 is between carbons 1 and 3. So carbon 2's groups are: \n\n- attached to carbon 1: a single bond (so that's a CH2 group?), wait no, let me clarify. \n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. \n\nSo the structure is: \n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 is the CH(OH) group. The substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- attached to carbon 1: a CH2 group? Wait, no. Let's count the carbons. \n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)- \n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 is connected to: \n\n- carbon 1 (CH3-CH(OH)), so that's a CH2 group? Wait, the carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group and is connected to carbon 1 (which is CH3) and carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group). \n\nWait, carbon 2's four substituents would be:\n\n- a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)), but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the carbon 2 is CH(OH). The structure is:\n\nCarbon 2 is bonded to:\n\n- Carbon 1: which is CH3- (so that's a single bond, so the carbon 2's first bond is to the methyl group's carbon (carbon 1)).\n\n- The hydroxyl group (OH).\n\n- The carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon).\n\n- The fourth bond is a hydrogen?\n\nWait, that would make the carbon 2 have four groups: CH3 (from carbon 1?), no, wait. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nThe 2-hydroxypropanoate ester with methyl. \n\nSo the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 2 (the middle carbon) is attached to:\n\n- Carbon 1: which is CH3 (so that's one substituent).\n\n- The OH group (second substituent).\n\n- Carbon 3: which is the COOCH3 group (third substituent).\n\n- The fourth substituent is a hydrogen atom. \n\nSo all four groups on carbon 2 are different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. \n\nTherefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and thus can have optical isomers (enantiomers). \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester: \n\nO2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both carboxylic groups are esterified. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, dimethyl fumarate would have both COOH groups replaced with methoxy groups. So:\n\nStructure: O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxylic acid groups are esterified. So the correct structure is:\n\nOOC(CH2) ? Wait no. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the dimethyl ester would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxylic groups are esterified with methyl. So it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait no, both ends. \n\nWait, the two carboxylic acid groups (each on carbons 1 and 4 of the four-carbon chain) are converted to esters. So:\n\nThe structure would be O2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, we look for chiral centers. In this molecule, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Since it's a trans double bond (fumarate is trans), the molecule has no chiral centers. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (carbons 1 and 4) each have two oxygen atoms (the ester groups) and the other substituents. \n\nCarbon 1: connected to O2C (the ester group), a double bond to C2, and the other substituents? Wait, carbon 1 is part of the carboxyl ester group. Let me see:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's malonic acid's ester. Wait, no. \n\nWait, the correct structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Let me confirm. \n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo when esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3. \n\nThus, the dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. The molecule would have two ester groups. So the correct structure is:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be one ester and one acid. Wait, no, both are esters. So both ends are OOC- (but connected via the double bond). \n\nWait, the correct structure would be:\n\nThe two carboxylic acid groups are replaced by methoxy groups. So:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be esters. \n\nWait, actually, each carboxylic acid group (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would mean one is still an acid. Wait no. Let me think again. \n\nThe original fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups: \n\nPositions 1 and 4 (if numbered as 1-4):\n\n1: COOH\n\n2: CH2 (but actually, the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nWait, the correct numbering is:\n\nThe molecule is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nSo when making the dimethyl ester, both COOH groups become COOCH3. \n\nSo the structure becomes:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends are esters, so:\n\nThe correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that would have one COOCH3 and one COO? Wait, no. Wait, each COOH is replaced by COOCH3. \n\nSo the molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be two esters. Wait, the first COOH becomes COOCH3 and the second becomes COOCH3. \n\nSo the molecule is:\n\nOOCCH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, because the double bond is there. \n\nWait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the structure is:\n\nThe first carbon (position 1) has a COOCH3 group, then the double bond between 2-3, and the fourth carbon (position 4) has another COOCH3 group. \n\nThus the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be a single bond. \n\nWait, sorry, the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester, which is:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that would have a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the first carbon as OOC- and the fourth as -COOCH3. \n\nWait, the first carbon is OOC-, connected to the second carbon via a single bond? No, because the double bond is between 2 and 3. \n\nLet me write it properly: \n\nThe structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's the malonic ester. But fumarate has the double bond. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The correct structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? \n\nWait, no. Let me see. The fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would replace both -COOH groups with -COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon (the one with the first COOH) is connected via a single bond to the second carbon, which is double-bonded to the third, which is connected via a single bond to the fourth carbon. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe first carbon (position 1) has the group -COOCH3, connected via a single bond to carbon 2 (which is double-bonded to carbon 3), and carbon 4 (position 4) has the other -COOCH3. \n\nThus the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would have the first carbon as OOC-, then CH=CH, then COOCH3. But the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the first carbon (1) is connected via a single bond to carbon 2 (which is double-bonded to carbon 3), and carbon 4 is connected via a single bond to carbon 3. \n\nWait, the molecule is actually:\n\nThe four carbons are arranged as:\n\n1: OOC-\n\n2: CH-\n\n3: CH-\n\n4: OOCCH3?\n\nNo, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. \n\nIn the structure of dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer), the molecule has a double bond, but the two ester groups are on either end. Since the double bond is trans, there are no chiral centers. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have only two different groups each. \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which has the OOC- group)\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3\n\n- A hydrogen (since it's a CH group? Wait, in the structure of fumaric acid, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH2 groups? Wait no. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3) are each connected to two hydrogens? No. Let me see:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is:\n\nCarbon 1: -COOH\n\nCarbon 2: -CH2-\n\nBut wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, the formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 1: -COOH\n\nCarbon 2: CH (since it's connected via a double bond to carbon 3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH (same as carbon 2, double bond between them)\n\nCarbon 4: -COOH\n\nWait, so each of carbons 2 and 3 have two substituents: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (COO-), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen (since it's CH). \n\nWait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- one single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group),\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's CH). \n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- a double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a single bond to carbon 4 (which has the other COO group),\n\n- and a hydrogen. \n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have only two different groups: the double bond, the single bond to the COO group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but carbon 2 has a single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group) and a double bond to carbon 3, plus a hydrogen. So substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- COO- (from carbon 1),\n\n- CH (the double bond to carbon 3),\n\n- H,\n\n- and another H? Wait, no, wait, the carbon 2 is part of the double bond. \n\nWait, actually, in a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, each of those carbons has two substituents besides the double bond. \n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- One single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group),\n\n- One double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? \n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the double bond) has two hydrogens? Or one?\n\nLet me count the bonds. Carbon 2 is connected via a double bond to carbon 3, so it has two bonds to carbon 3. Then, it has a single bond to carbon 1 (which is the COOH group), and another single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nSo carbon 2 has:\n\n- one single bond to carbon 1 (the COO group),\n\n- two bonds (double) to carbon 3,\n\n- and one single bond to H. \n\nWait, that's four bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon has four bonds. The double bond counts as two bonds. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- a single bond to carbon 1,\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3 (counts as two bonds),\n\n- and one single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nWait, that's four bonds total. \n\nWait, actually, each carbon in a double bond has two bonds to the adjacent carbon. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- a single bond to carbon 1,\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3 (so two bonds there),\n\n- and a single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nWait, but that's 1 (C1) + 2 (C3 double) +1 (H) = 4 bonds. \n\nYes, so the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- COOH group (via carbon 1),\n\n- the double bond,\n\n- and a hydrogen. \n\nBut the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo, the substituents on carbon 2 are: \n\n- COO- (from carbon 1),\n\n- a CH (the carbon 3 side),\n\n- and two hydrogens? No, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have only two substituents besides the double bond. For example, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (COO-) and a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to carbon 4 (COO-) and a hydrogen. \n\nIn that case, each of carbons 2 and 3 have only two different groups (the COO- group and H). So they are not chiral centers. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer) has no chiral centers. \n\nMeanwhile, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at carbon 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nOption D says B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, but according to my analysis, B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nNow, looking back at part A, if benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), then the correct option is either B or D. \n\nOption B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so that would mean it does not show tautomerism, but I thought benzoquinone is the one that doesn't), so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, let's re-examine part A again. \n\nEarlier analysis: \n\nIf benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (because of aromatic stabilization), then A is benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at the options, option B and D have A as benzoquinone. \n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone (so that's correct for part A?), and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for part B). \n\nOption D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, so the correct answer would be option B? \n\nWait but I need to confirm part A again. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about benzoquinone. Let me think again. \n\nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Can it tautomerize? \n\nIn keto-enol tautomerism, the carbonyl group (C=O) can become an enol (with a double bond and an -OH group). For each ketone group in benzoquinone, could that happen? \n\nSuppose one of the carbonyl groups converts to an enol form. That would involve forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons and an -OH group. But since the benzene ring is aromatic, breaking the conjugation might not be favorable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two ketone groups in benzoquinone are arranged in such a way that they can't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Wait, maybe in solution, benzoquinone can exist as an enol form. Let me think of the structure. \n\nIf one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol, then the benzene ring would lose a double bond. Since benzene's aromaticity requires all the double bonds, this would break the aromaticity. So the enol form would be much less stable. Therefore, the keto form is favored, and thus benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. \n\nTherefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone). \n\nThen the correct option for part A is benzoquinone (so options B and D). \n\nNow, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is that), so the correct option is B. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (which would mean that it does not show tautomerism, but we thought A is benzoquinone). Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, hold on. The options are: \n\nOption B says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which would mean that is the one that does not show tautomerism. But according to my analysis, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so option B is wrong for A. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the question: \n\nThe first part says \"the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)\" between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nIf my conclusion was that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), then the correct option must have A as benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at the options, option D says A = benzoquinone, and B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nBut I thought B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so option B would have A as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (wrong for A) and B correct. \n\nWait, no. Let me check the options again: \n\nOptions:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nSo if my analysis is that A is benzoquinone (so correct A is benzoquinone), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the correct option is B (option B). \n\nYes, that's option B. \n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought option B has A as benzoquinone and B correct. \n\nSo the answer should be option B? \n\nBut let me recheck the tautomerism part again. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think again. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Each of those could potentially tautomerize. But with three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triketone can undergo tautomerism. For example, in some cases, such triketones can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a meso compound or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it, so the correct answer for part A is benzoquinone (so option B or D). \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B, because option B has A as benzoquinone and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nYes, so the final answer is B. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure about the tautomerism of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think of an example. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as triketohexane. I recall that some triketones can undergo tautomerism. For example, in some cases, they can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is in an equilibrium between different tautomers. \n\nIf that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT is benzoquinone. \n\nSo the answer for part A is benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nThus, option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the correct answers for parts A and B:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**  \nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Due to the aromatic stabilization of the benzene ring, tautomerization (which would disrupt the aromaticity) is not favored. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, lacking aromaticity, can undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to the flexibility of its cyclohexane ring structure. Hence, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**  \nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon (connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H), allowing for optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being the trans isomer of a double bond, lacks chiral centers because the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are symmetric. Therefore, the compound showing optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Correct Option**:  \nThe options matching these conclusions are **Option B**:  \nA = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. Hmm, so the question is about isomerism and tautomerism. The problem has two parts, A and B. I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism for part A, and which of the two given compounds shows optical isomerism for part B. \n\nStarting with part A: The options are benzoquinone versus cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, often involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. Like keto-enol tautomerism, for example. \n\nBenzoquinone is a compound with two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. Its structure is C6H4O2, right? Each ketone is on a carbon of the benzene. Wait, actually, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups (C=O) on adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. So maybe it's something like O=C-CH-O-... but arranged on the benzene. \n\nThen cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So each of the 1,3,5 positions has a carbonyl group. Hmm. Now, does benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to recall. Benzoquinone is a stable compound. Wait, maybe in some conditions it can tautomerize? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is prone to tautomerism. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups. Since it's a triketone, perhaps it can undergo some tautomeric shifts. Alternatively, maybe it can form enol forms? Let me think. \n\nWait, enol tautomerism requires that a hydrogen can move between two positions with a double bond shift. For example, in a ketone, the enol form would have a double bond next to an -OH group. If the molecule has multiple ketones, maybe they can interconvert. But if all the carbonyls are in a ring, maybe the structure is fixed. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure with three carbonyl groups on alternate carbons of a six-membered ring. Since the ring is cyclohexane, but with three ketones, maybe that's a very strained structure? Wait, but maybe it's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. If one of them could form an enol, but then maybe the other would not. Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can exist in a form where one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it can't because of the aromatic stabilization? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that does not show tautomerism. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think of examples. \n\nWait, maybe benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) is known to exist in enol form under certain conditions. For instance, sometimes quinones can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, maybe the triketone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, can undergo tautomerism. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as triketohexane, which might be a tautomeric form. Wait, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo enolization, but maybe benzoquinone can't because of the aromatic ring? \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't tautomerize. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look up some facts. Wait, but since I can't do that, I'll have to think again. \n\nWait, another approach: Tautomerism often requires the molecule to have a structure where a hydrogen can move between two positions with a double bond shift. For benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups (each is a carbonyl), perhaps it can form an enol. Let me draw the structure in my mind. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups on carbons 1 and 4 (assuming 1,4 positions). The structure would be O=C-C6H4-O=C. Wait, actually, maybe it's more like the benzene ring with two carbonyl groups on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. 1,4-benzoquinone would have the two carbonyl groups separated by two carbons on the benzene ring. \n\nWait, if benzoquinone has two ketone groups, maybe each can form an enol. But then the enol form would have a double bond and an -OH. But maybe in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are in such a way that they can't tautomerize without disrupting the aromatic ring? Because the benzene ring is aromatic, so if the tautomerism would break that, maybe it's not possible. Wait, but the carbonyl groups are part of the benzene ring? Wait, no. The carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring. Wait, actually, benzoquinone is a substituted benzene where two of the hydrogens are replaced by carbonyl groups. Wait, no. The structure is more like each carbonyl is on the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has two ketone groups. So, the structure is like O=C-CH2-? Wait no. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4. So the benzene ring has two carbonyl groups. So the actual structure would have two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring. In that case, each of those carbonyl groups could potentially form an enol. But would that disrupt the aromaticity? Because if you have an enol form, that would involve a double bond between two carbons and an -OH group. If the benzene ring loses a double bond, then the aromaticity would be lost. Since aromatic compounds are more stable, maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form would be less stable. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism because that would destroy the aromatic ring. \n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Since there's no aromatic ring here, maybe the molecule can undergo tautomerism more easily. The cyclohexane ring isn't aromatic, so forming an enol might be possible. For example, one of the carbonyl groups could become an enol, shifting a double bond and moving an -OH. But since there are three ketone groups, perhaps they can interconvert in some way. \n\nWait, but if all three carbonyls are in the 1,3,5 positions, maybe the molecule is in a form where tautomerism isn't possible because of symmetry? Or maybe the molecule is too strained? Alternatively, maybe it can't tautomerize because the arrangement doesn't allow for the necessary movement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as triketohexane, which is known to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), and the other option would be the opposite. Wait, the question says: \"the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)\". So, if benzoquinone doesn't show it, then A is benzoquinone. But if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't, then A would be that. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of specific examples. For instance, I know that enol tautomerism is common in compounds like ketones and aldehydes. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. But if the benzene ring is aromatic, then the enol form would have to break the aromaticity. Since aromaticity is a big stabilizer, the keto form is preferred. So benzoquinone would not undergo tautomerism. \n\nAlternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a triketone on a cyclohexane ring, might not have such a barrier. Let's think of another example: cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That can exist in enol form, right? Because it's not aromatic. So a triketone might also have tautomers. But perhaps the triketone is so highly substituted that it can't tautomerize? Or maybe it can. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually a tautomer of another structure. Wait, maybe it can form a 1,3-diketone with an enol form? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triketone can't tautomerize because all three carbonyls are in positions that prevent the movement of the hydrogen. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again. \n\nLooking at the options for A: \n\nOption A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So that would mean that it does not show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does. \n\nOption D says A is benzoquinone (so that's the one that doesn't show tautomerism), so the other one (the triketone) does. \n\nSo between those, which is correct? \n\nWait, I recall that benzoquinone is a stable compound and doesn't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because of the aromatic stabilization. So it doesn't show tautomerism. So the answer for part A would be benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nThen looking at the options, the correct A part would be either B or D. \n\nNow moving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. The structure would be: \n\nThe name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nBreaking it down: \n\nPropanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is:\n\nThe acid group is on the third carbon (propanoate), and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. \n\nWait, the full structure would be: \n\nThe formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo the second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to a methyl (from the first carbon), an -OH, a -COOCH3 group, and the hydrogen. Wait, let's see: \n\nCarbon 1: CH3- \n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)- \n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 has substituents: CH3 (from carbon 1?), wait no, carbon 2 is between carbons 1 and 3. So carbon 2's groups are: \n\n- attached to carbon 1: a single bond (so that's a CH2 group?), wait no, let me clarify. \n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. \n\nSo the structure is: \n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 is the CH(OH) group. The substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- attached to carbon 1: a CH2 group? Wait, no. Let's count the carbons. \n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)- \n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3. \n\nSo carbon 2 is connected to: \n\n- carbon 1 (CH3-CH(OH)), so that's a CH2 group? Wait, the carbon 2 has a hydroxyl group and is connected to carbon 1 (which is CH3) and carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group). \n\nWait, carbon 2's four substituents would be:\n\n- a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)), but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the carbon 2 is CH(OH). The structure is:\n\nCarbon 2 is bonded to:\n\n- Carbon 1: which is CH3- (so that's a single bond, so the carbon 2's first bond is to the methyl group's carbon (carbon 1)).\n\n- The hydroxyl group (OH).\n\n- The carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon).\n\n- The fourth bond is a hydrogen?\n\nWait, that would make the carbon 2 have four groups: CH3 (from carbon 1?), no, wait. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nThe 2-hydroxypropanoate ester with methyl. \n\nSo the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 2 (the middle carbon) is attached to:\n\n- Carbon 1: which is CH3 (so that's one substituent).\n\n- The OH group (second substituent).\n\n- Carbon 3: which is the COOCH3 group (third substituent).\n\n- The fourth substituent is a hydrogen atom. \n\nSo all four groups on carbon 2 are different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. \n\nTherefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and thus can have optical isomers (enantiomers). \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester: \n\nO2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both carboxylic groups are esterified. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, dimethyl fumarate would have both COOH groups replaced with methoxy groups. So:\n\nStructure: O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxylic acid groups are esterified. So the correct structure is:\n\nOOC(CH2) ? Wait no. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the dimethyl ester would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both carboxylic groups are esterified with methyl. So it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait no, both ends. \n\nWait, the two carboxylic acid groups (each on carbons 1 and 4 of the four-carbon chain) are converted to esters. So:\n\nThe structure would be O2C-CH=CH-CO2CH3. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, we look for chiral centers. In this molecule, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Since it's a trans double bond (fumarate is trans), the molecule has no chiral centers. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (carbons 1 and 4) each have two oxygen atoms (the ester groups) and the other substituents. \n\nCarbon 1: connected to O2C (the ester group), a double bond to C2, and the other substituents? Wait, carbon 1 is part of the carboxyl ester group. Let me see:\n\nThe molecule is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's malonic acid's ester. Wait, no. \n\nWait, the correct structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Let me confirm. \n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo when esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3. \n\nThus, the dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. The molecule would have two ester groups. So the correct structure is:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be one ester and one acid. Wait, no, both are esters. So both ends are OOC- (but connected via the double bond). \n\nWait, the correct structure would be:\n\nThe two carboxylic acid groups are replaced by methoxy groups. So:\n\nThe structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends must be esters. \n\nWait, actually, each carboxylic acid group (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would mean one is still an acid. Wait no. Let me think again. \n\nThe original fumaric acid has two carboxylic acid groups: \n\nPositions 1 and 4 (if numbered as 1-4):\n\n1: COOH\n\n2: CH2 (but actually, the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nWait, the correct numbering is:\n\nThe molecule is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nSo the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (if the double bond is between 2 and 3). \n\nSo when making the dimethyl ester, both COOH groups become COOCH3. \n\nSo the structure becomes:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends are esters, so:\n\nThe correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that would have one COOCH3 and one COO? Wait, no. Wait, each COOH is replaced by COOCH3. \n\nSo the molecule is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be two esters. Wait, the first COOH becomes COOCH3 and the second becomes COOCH3. \n\nSo the molecule is:\n\nOOCCH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, because the double bond is there. \n\nWait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the structure is:\n\nThe first carbon (position 1) has a COOCH3 group, then the double bond between 2-3, and the fourth carbon (position 4) has another COOCH3 group. \n\nThus the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be a single bond. \n\nWait, sorry, the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester, which is:\n\nOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that would have a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the first carbon as OOC- and the fourth as -COOCH3. \n\nWait, the first carbon is OOC-, connected to the second carbon via a single bond? No, because the double bond is between 2 and 3. \n\nLet me write it properly: \n\nThe structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's the malonic ester. But fumarate has the double bond. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The correct structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? \n\nWait, no. Let me see. The fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would replace both -COOH groups with -COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The first carbon (the one with the first COOH) is connected via a single bond to the second carbon, which is double-bonded to the third, which is connected via a single bond to the fourth carbon. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe first carbon (position 1) has the group -COOCH3, connected via a single bond to carbon 2 (which is double-bonded to carbon 3), and carbon 4 (position 4) has the other -COOCH3. \n\nThus the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would have the first carbon as OOC-, then CH=CH, then COOCH3. But the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the first carbon (1) is connected via a single bond to carbon 2 (which is double-bonded to carbon 3), and carbon 4 is connected via a single bond to carbon 3. \n\nWait, the molecule is actually:\n\nThe four carbons are arranged as:\n\n1: OOC-\n\n2: CH-\n\n3: CH-\n\n4: OOCCH3?\n\nNo, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. \n\nIn the structure of dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer), the molecule has a double bond, but the two ester groups are on either end. Since the double bond is trans, there are no chiral centers. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have only two different groups each. \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which has the OOC- group)\n\n- The double bond to carbon 3\n\n- A hydrogen (since it's a CH group? Wait, in the structure of fumaric acid, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH2 groups? Wait no. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3) are each connected to two hydrogens? No. Let me see:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is:\n\nCarbon 1: -COOH\n\nCarbon 2: -CH2-\n\nBut wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, the formula is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 1: -COOH\n\nCarbon 2: CH (since it's connected via a double bond to carbon 3)\n\nCarbon 3: CH (same as carbon 2, double bond between them)\n\nCarbon 4: -COOH\n\nWait, so each of carbons 2 and 3 have two substituents: \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (COO-), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen (since it's CH). \n\nWait, carbon 2 has:\n\n- one single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group),\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's CH). \n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- a double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a single bond to carbon 4 (which has the other COO group),\n\n- and a hydrogen. \n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have only two different groups: the double bond, the single bond to the COO group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but carbon 2 has a single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group) and a double bond to carbon 3, plus a hydrogen. So substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- COO- (from carbon 1),\n\n- CH (the double bond to carbon 3),\n\n- H,\n\n- and another H? Wait, no, wait, the carbon 2 is part of the double bond. \n\nWait, actually, in a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, each of those carbons has two substituents besides the double bond. \n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- One single bond to carbon 1 (which has the COO group),\n\n- One double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? \n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the double bond) has two hydrogens? Or one?\n\nLet me count the bonds. Carbon 2 is connected via a double bond to carbon 3, so it has two bonds to carbon 3. Then, it has a single bond to carbon 1 (which is the COOH group), and another single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nSo carbon 2 has:\n\n- one single bond to carbon 1 (the COO group),\n\n- two bonds (double) to carbon 3,\n\n- and one single bond to H. \n\nWait, that's four bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon has four bonds. The double bond counts as two bonds. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- a single bond to carbon 1,\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3 (counts as two bonds),\n\n- and one single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nWait, that's four bonds total. \n\nWait, actually, each carbon in a double bond has two bonds to the adjacent carbon. So carbon 2 has:\n\n- a single bond to carbon 1,\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3 (so two bonds there),\n\n- and a single bond to a hydrogen. \n\nWait, but that's 1 (C1) + 2 (C3 double) +1 (H) = 4 bonds. \n\nYes, so the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- COOH group (via carbon 1),\n\n- the double bond,\n\n- and a hydrogen. \n\nBut the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo, the substituents on carbon 2 are: \n\n- COO- (from carbon 1),\n\n- a CH (the carbon 3 side),\n\n- and two hydrogens? No, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) each have only two substituents besides the double bond. For example, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (COO-) and a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to carbon 4 (COO-) and a hydrogen. \n\nIn that case, each of carbons 2 and 3 have only two different groups (the COO- group and H). So they are not chiral centers. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (the trans isomer) has no chiral centers. \n\nMeanwhile, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at carbon 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nOption D says B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, but according to my analysis, B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nNow, looking back at part A, if benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), then the correct option is either B or D. \n\nOption B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so that would mean it does not show tautomerism, but I thought benzoquinone is the one that doesn't), so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, let's re-examine part A again. \n\nEarlier analysis: \n\nIf benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (because of aromatic stabilization), then A is benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at the options, option B and D have A as benzoquinone. \n\nOption B: A = benzoquinone (so that's correct for part A?), and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for part B). \n\nOption D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, so the correct answer would be option B? \n\nWait but I need to confirm part A again. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about benzoquinone. Let me think again. \n\nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Can it tautomerize? \n\nIn keto-enol tautomerism, the carbonyl group (C=O) can become an enol (with a double bond and an -OH group). For each ketone group in benzoquinone, could that happen? \n\nSuppose one of the carbonyl groups converts to an enol form. That would involve forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons and an -OH group. But since the benzene ring is aromatic, breaking the conjugation might not be favorable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two ketone groups in benzoquinone are arranged in such a way that they can't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Wait, maybe in solution, benzoquinone can exist as an enol form. Let me think of the structure. \n\nIf one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol, then the benzene ring would lose a double bond. Since benzene's aromaticity requires all the double bonds, this would break the aromaticity. So the enol form would be much less stable. Therefore, the keto form is favored, and thus benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. \n\nTherefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone). \n\nThen the correct option for part A is benzoquinone (so options B and D). \n\nNow, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is that), so the correct option is B. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (which would mean that it does not show tautomerism, but we thought A is benzoquinone). Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, hold on. The options are: \n\nOption B says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which would mean that is the one that does not show tautomerism. But according to my analysis, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so option B is wrong for A. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the question: \n\nThe first part says \"the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)\" between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nIf my conclusion was that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone), then the correct option must have A as benzoquinone. \n\nLooking at the options, option D says A = benzoquinone, and B = dimethyl fumarate. \n\nBut I thought B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so option B would have A as cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (wrong for A) and B correct. \n\nWait, no. Let me check the options again: \n\nOptions:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nSo if my analysis is that A is benzoquinone (so correct A is benzoquinone), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the correct option is B (option B). \n\nYes, that's option B. \n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought option B has A as benzoquinone and B correct. \n\nSo the answer should be option B? \n\nBut let me recheck the tautomerism part again. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think again. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Each of those could potentially tautomerize. But with three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, perhaps the molecule can't tautomerize. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triketone can undergo tautomerism. For example, in some cases, such triketones can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a meso compound or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it, so the correct answer for part A is benzoquinone (so option B or D). \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B, because option B has A as benzoquinone and B as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nYes, so the final answer is B. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure about the tautomerism of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think of an example. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as triketohexane. I recall that some triketones can undergo tautomerism. For example, in some cases, they can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is in an equilibrium between different tautomers. \n\nIf that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, so the compound that does NOT is benzoquinone. \n\nSo the answer for part A is benzoquinone (so A = benzoquinone). \n\nThus, option B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the correct answers for parts A and B:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**  \nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Due to the aromatic stabilization of the benzene ring, tautomerization (which would disrupt the aromaticity) is not favored. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, lacking aromaticity, can undergo keto-enol tautomerism due to the flexibility of its cyclohexane ring structure. Hence, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**  \nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the second carbon (connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H), allowing for optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, being the trans isomer of a double bond, lacks chiral centers because the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are symmetric. Therefore, the compound showing optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Correct Option**:  \nThe options matching these conclusions are **Option B**:  \nA = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question has two parts, A and B. Let's start with part A, which asks which compound does not show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nFirst, I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomers are structural isomers that interconvert by the movement of a proton and a double bond. Common examples are keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nBenzoquinone is a quinone, so its structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, actually, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on carbons 1 and 4? Or maybe it's 1,4-substituted? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, right? So the structure has two carbonyl groups on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. Now, does this structure undergo tautomerism? Well, in some triones, the ketones can shift to form enol forms. For example, in the case of a triketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, there's enolization. Wait, maybe in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure might have tautomeric forms where the ketones convert to enol forms. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the ketones makes it impossible? \n\nAlternatively, benzoquinone's structure might not have the flexibility for enol tautomerism. Let me think. In benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are fixed in position. Since they are on the benzene ring, which is aromatic, maybe the resonance makes it stable and doesn't allow tautomerization. But wait, enol tautomerism in quinones? For example, in some cases, quinones can undergo enol tautomerism, but maybe benzoquinone specifically doesn't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a tautomer because having three ketone groups in a ring allows for some kind of rearrangement. Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo enol tautomerism where two of the ketone groups become enol forms. For example, in a trione, maybe it's possible for two of the carbonyls to become enols, but then the third might still be a ketone? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of three ketones in the ring makes it stable and prevents tautomerism. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Let me think of the structure. The benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The enol form would involve moving a hydrogen from one position to another. Let's see, for example, in a quinone like 1,4-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4. If an enol form occurs, the double bond might shift. Wait, but in benzene, the aromaticity would require that the ring remains conjugated. Maybe the enol form would disrupt the aromaticity? Because the enol would have a double bond and an OH group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the quinone doesn't tautomerize because the keto form is more stable. \n\nAlternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might be the one that does not show tautomerism. Wait, maybe the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is such that the three ketone groups are arranged in a way that they can't form an enol form. For example, in a cyclic trione, like 1,3,5-triketones, maybe they can't form enol tautomers because of the ring strain. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. \n\nHmm, I need to recall specific examples. For instance, maleic acid and fumaric acid are geometric isomers (stereoisomers), but that's different. Wait, another thought: Tautomers of compounds often involve the shifting of a proton. For example, in the case of acetylacetone, which is a diketone, it can form an enol tautomer. \n\nWait, maybe benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so the answer for part A would be benzoquinone? Let me think again. If the question is asking which does NOT show tautomerism, then if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it, then A would be benzoquinone. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is the one that does not show tautomerism. Let me search my memory. I recall that quinones are generally in the keto form and don't tautomerize to enol because the keto form is stabilized by aromaticity and conjugation. So the enol form would lose that. So benzoquinone (which is a quinone) would not tautomerize. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a cyclic triketone. Maybe in this case, the molecule can undergo tautomerism. For example, each carbonyl group can potentially form an enol. However, with three ketones, maybe there's some equilibrium where two of them form enols and one remains a ketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring structure makes it impossible. Wait, perhaps in the case of 1,3,5-triketones, they are prone to tautomerism. For instance, if you have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, maybe they can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as 1,3,5-trioxane? Wait, no, trioxane is a cyclic ether. Wait, maybe it's a trione, which is three ketones. Let me think of the structure. The cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups on alternate positions. Maybe this leads to some resonance stabilization but doesn't allow tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it can't form enol tautomers because the positions are too close. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The question says that among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does NOT show tautomerism. So if one of them doesn't, which is it? \n\nAnother angle: Tautomerism requires that the molecule can shift a proton and a double bond. So for benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring. The aromaticity is maintained in the keto form. If the enol form were to form, would that break the aromaticity? Let me see. Suppose one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol (like a hydroxyl and a double bond). Then the ring would lose that conjugation, so the aromaticity would be disrupted. Since aromaticity is a strong stabilizer, the keto form is favored, so the enol form is not present. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is not aromatic. It's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. So, maybe it can form enol tautomers because the ring isn't aromatic. For example, each of the carbonyl groups could potentially form enol structures. So, the trione would have tautomers. Therefore, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A). So for part A, the correct answer would be the option where A is benzoquinone. \n\nNow moving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism? \n\nOptical isomerism (chirality) requires a chiral center, which is a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break down the name. The structure is: \n\nThe parent chain is propanoic acid. The 2-hydroxypropanoate means there's a hydroxyl group on carbon 2, and it's the ester form with methyl. So, the structure would be: \n\nCH3-C(OOCH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:\n\nThe acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). The ester with methanol would be CH3-C(O)-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, maybe I need to draw it step by step. \n\nWait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbons: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2, and the ester group is on carbon 3. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl) has substituents: the adjacent carbons. Let's look for a chiral center. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl (carbon 2) is connected to: \n\nCarbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group), an OH group, and the hydrogen (since it's the second carbon in propanoate). Wait, carbon 2 in the structure has: \n\nCarbon 2 is CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, carbon 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is bonded to: \n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3), \n\n- Carbon 3 (the carbonyl carbon of the ester), \n\n- OH, \n\n- and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3 \n\nSo carbon 2 is connected to: \n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3), \n\n- Carbon 3 (the carbonyl carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group), \n\n- an OH group, \n\n- and a hydrogen? Because the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-. So carbon 2 (the middle carbon) has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon at position 2 is part of the chain. Let me count the bonds. \n\nThe carbon in position 2 (the hydroxyl carbon) has:\n\n- One bond to the methyl group (CH3 on C1),\n\n- One bond to the carbonyl carbon (C3),\n\n- One bond to the OH group,\n\n- And the fourth bond must be a hydrogen. Wait, but then that carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that's four different substituents, making it a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl), so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is maleic acid's trans isomer. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans form of butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The trans form would have the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (CH3OOC)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3) in trans configuration? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (but that's actually maleic acid if it's cis). Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of fumaric acid (trans) is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4, arranged trans to each other. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid has the structure: \n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So in the trans form (fumaric acid), the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each carboxylic acid is esterified with methanol. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two COOH groups are both esterified. So it's (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), arranged in the trans configuration. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. Let's look at the structure of dimethyl fumarate. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the carbons adjacent to the double bond (carbons 1 and 4) have the ester groups. Since the double bond is in a trans configuration, can there be any chiral centers here? \n\nLooking at each carbon in the structure:\n\nCarbon 1: connected to the first carbonyl (O2C-), a CH2 group (but actually, in the double bond structure, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each connected to two substituents. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but that's not right because of the double bond. Wait, the correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (since the two COOCH3 groups are on either side of the double bond in trans). Wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So each of those carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents. Let me think again.\n\nThe structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: O2C-\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (the other side of the double bond), and also has a hydrogen (since it's CH2 in the trans form? Wait no, because it's a double bond, so carbon 2 and 3 are connected via a double bond. Wait, the actual structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH (fumaric acid). When esterified to dimethyl fumarate, it becomes O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (but the other COOH is also esterified, so actually, both ends are O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both carboxylic acids are esterified. So it would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). \n\nEach carbon adjacent to the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) are part of the double bond. Carbon 2 is connected to O2C- and the double bond, and has a hydrogen (since it's CH2 in the trans? Wait, no. Wait, the double bond structure is such that each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. For example, in the trans configuration:\n\nCarbon 1: O2C-\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 via double bond. The other two substituents on Carbon 2 are a hydrogen and maybe another group? Wait, let's get this right. The structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. \n\nThe structure would be:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, butenedioic acid has the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The correct structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have two substituents. For example, Carbon 2 is bonded to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (the other side of the double bond), and also has two hydrogens? Wait no. Wait, Carbon 2 in the double bond has a double bond to Carbon 3, and each has two substituents. Let me think of each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: has two oxygens (from the carboxyl group) and a single bond to Carbon 2.\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, double bond to Carbon 3, and has a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a double bond and a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps Carbon 2 has a single bond to Carbon 1 (since the double bond is between 2 and 3). Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So Carbon 2 is connected via a double bond to Carbon 3, and via a single bond to Carbon 1. So Carbon 2 has:\n\n- Single bond to Carbon 1 (which is the COO group),\n\n- Double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? No, because the valence would be exceeded. Wait, Carbon 2 in the double bond (as part of the but-2-ene) has:\n\nEach carbon in a double bond has two substituents. For example, in but-2-ene, the carbons 2 and 3 form the double bond, each connected to two other groups. \n\nIn the case of fumaric acid:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the CH=CH):\n\nCarbon 2 is bonded to:\n\n- The COO group (from Carbon 1),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And has a hydrogen? Wait, Carbon 2 must have four bonds. The double bond counts as two bonds, so Carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to Carbon 1 (which is O2C-),\n\n- One double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two single bonds. Wait, that would only account for three bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me write it as:\n\nEach carbon in the double bond (2 and 3) has two substituents. So Carbon 2 has:\n\n- A single bond to Carbon 1 (the COO group),\n\n- A double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And one more bond, which would be a hydrogen? So Carbon 2 has:\n\nGroups: COO-, double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, Carbon 2 has:\n\n- The COO- group (from Carbon 1),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? That would make four bonds. \n\nWait, Carbon 2 would then have two hydrogens. Similarly, Carbon 3 would have two hydrogens. \n\nIn that case, each of the carbons adjacent to the double bond (2 and 3) has two hydrogens. Therefore, in the dimethyl ester, the structure would have no chiral centers because the carbons adjacent to the double bond are symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chiral center elsewhere. \n\nWait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetric. The two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. Since it's trans, the groups on each side are arranged in a way that the molecule is not chiral. Because if you look at it, the two sides are mirror images, but since it's trans, the molecule is actually symmetrical. Wait, perhaps it's meso? \n\nWait, let me consider the structure again. Suppose the molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), with the groups trans. Then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. The double bond is in the middle, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical. So there are no chiral centers because any chiral centers would be canceled out by the symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each carbon in the double bond is a chiral center. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond can't be a chiral center because they are part of the double bond (which restricts rotation), but their substituents must be different for chirality. Let's see: \n\nCarbon 2 (adjacent to the COOCH3 group):\n\nSubstituents: \n\n- The COOCH3 group (on Carbon 1 side),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- and two hydrogens. Wait, if Carbon 2 has two hydrogens, then its substituents are: \n\nOne group from Carbon 1 (the ester), the double bond to Carbon 3, and two hydrogens. So that's three different groups? Wait, no, two hydrogens are the same. \n\nSo Carbon 2 has substituents: \n\n1. The ester group (CH2-OOCCH3?), \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try to draw it again. \n\nThe structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nCarbon 1: O2C-CH2-?\n\nNo, wait. The correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (with both ends esterified). Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have the ester groups. \n\nSo Carbon 1: O2C-,\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 via double bond,\n\nCarbon 3: connected to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4,\n\nCarbon 4: COOCH3. \n\nWait, no. Carbon 4 would be the other end. The structure is actually:\n\nO2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (via double bond), and also has a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 (double bond) and Carbon 4 (the COOCH3), plus another hydrogen. \n\nWait, so Carbon 2 has:\n\n- O2C- (from Carbon 1),\n\n- Double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- Two hydrogens? \n\nWait, Carbon 2's bonds:\n\nSingle bond to Carbon 1 (the COOCH3 group? Wait, no. Wait Carbon 1 is the COO group. Let me count the bonds properly. \n\nCarbon 2 in the double bond must have two bonds (the double bond) plus two single bonds. So if it's bonded to Carbon 1 (COO-) and has a double bond to Carbon 3, then the other two bonds must be hydrogens. So Carbon 2 has two hydrogens. Similarly, Carbon 3 has two hydrogens. \n\nIn that case, the molecule is symmetrical. The two ends are mirror images, so the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Therefore, there are no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nBut wait, what about the double bond itself? The trans configuration is a geometric isomer, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but geometric isomers are not optical isomers. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because there's no chiral center. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, on the other hand, has a chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl group), so it does have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone (which we thought is correct for not showing tautomerism), and B = dimethyl fumarate (which is wrong because it doesn't have optical isomerism). \n\nWait, let's check the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so A is the one that does not show tautomerism?), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for B).\n\nWait, the first part of option A says that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (meaning that this compound does NOT show tautomerism). But earlier, we thought that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so the correct A should be benzoquinone, which is in options B and D. \n\nSo let me recheck the first part. \n\nWe concluded that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A should be benzoquinone). The options where A is benzoquinone are options B and D. \n\nThen for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so among the options, options B and C have that. \n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (correct), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct). \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone (correct), B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the first part again. \n\nEarlier analysis: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so the correct A is benzoquinone). \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism (so it's the one that does show, hence the question asks for which does NOT show, so the answer is benzoquinone). \n\nTherefore, option B is correct (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). \n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A), we analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a quinone with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Its aromaticity stabilizes the keto form, making enol tautomerism unfavorable due to loss of aromaticity. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, a non-aromatic cyclic triketone, can undergo enol tautomerism as its structure allows proton and double bond shifts without disrupting aromaticity. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**, so A = benzoquinone.\n\nFor optical isomerism (B), methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (four distinct substituents: CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H). Dimethyl fumarate, derived from the trans isomer of fumaric acid, lacks chiral centers due to its symmetrical structure, resulting in geometric isomerism rather than optical isomerism. Hence, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism**.\n\nThe correct options are **A = benzoquinone** and **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question has two parts, A and B. Let's start with part A, which asks which compound does not show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. \n\nFirst, I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomers are structural isomers that interconvert by the movement of a proton and a double bond. Common examples are keto-enol tautomerism. \n\nBenzoquinone is a quinone, so its structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (C=O) attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, actually, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on carbons 1 and 4? Or maybe it's 1,4-substituted? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, right? So the structure has two carbonyl groups on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. Now, does this structure undergo tautomerism? Well, in some triones, the ketones can shift to form enol forms. For example, in the case of a triketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, there's enolization. Wait, maybe in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure might have tautomeric forms where the ketones convert to enol forms. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the ketones makes it impossible? \n\nAlternatively, benzoquinone's structure might not have the flexibility for enol tautomerism. Let me think. In benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are fixed in position. Since they are on the benzene ring, which is aromatic, maybe the resonance makes it stable and doesn't allow tautomerization. But wait, enol tautomerism in quinones? For example, in some cases, quinones can undergo enol tautomerism, but maybe benzoquinone specifically doesn't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a tautomer because having three ketone groups in a ring allows for some kind of rearrangement. Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo enol tautomerism where two of the ketone groups become enol forms. For example, in a trione, maybe it's possible for two of the carbonyls to become enols, but then the third might still be a ketone? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of three ketones in the ring makes it stable and prevents tautomerism. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. Let me think of the structure. The benzene ring with two carbonyl groups. The enol form would involve moving a hydrogen from one position to another. Let's see, for example, in a quinone like 1,4-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4. If an enol form occurs, the double bond might shift. Wait, but in benzene, the aromaticity would require that the ring remains conjugated. Maybe the enol form would disrupt the aromaticity? Because the enol would have a double bond and an OH group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the quinone doesn't tautomerize because the keto form is more stable. \n\nAlternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might be the one that does not show tautomerism. Wait, maybe the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is such that the three ketone groups are arranged in a way that they can't form an enol form. For example, in a cyclic trione, like 1,3,5-triketones, maybe they can't form enol tautomers because of the ring strain. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism. \n\nHmm, I need to recall specific examples. For instance, maleic acid and fumaric acid are geometric isomers (stereoisomers), but that's different. Wait, another thought: Tautomers of compounds often involve the shifting of a proton. For example, in the case of acetylacetone, which is a diketone, it can form an enol tautomer. \n\nWait, maybe benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so the answer for part A would be benzoquinone? Let me think again. If the question is asking which does NOT show tautomerism, then if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show it, then A would be benzoquinone. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is the one that does not show tautomerism. Let me search my memory. I recall that quinones are generally in the keto form and don't tautomerize to enol because the keto form is stabilized by aromaticity and conjugation. So the enol form would lose that. So benzoquinone (which is a quinone) would not tautomerize. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a cyclic triketone. Maybe in this case, the molecule can undergo tautomerism. For example, each carbonyl group can potentially form an enol. However, with three ketones, maybe there's some equilibrium where two of them form enols and one remains a ketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring structure makes it impossible. Wait, perhaps in the case of 1,3,5-triketones, they are prone to tautomerism. For instance, if you have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, maybe they can form enol forms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is actually the same as 1,3,5-trioxane? Wait, no, trioxane is a cyclic ether. Wait, maybe it's a trione, which is three ketones. Let me think of the structure. The cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups on alternate positions. Maybe this leads to some resonance stabilization but doesn't allow tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it can't form enol tautomers because the positions are too close. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The question says that among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does NOT show tautomerism. So if one of them doesn't, which is it? \n\nAnother angle: Tautomerism requires that the molecule can shift a proton and a double bond. So for benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring. The aromaticity is maintained in the keto form. If the enol form were to form, would that break the aromaticity? Let me see. Suppose one of the carbonyl groups becomes an enol (like a hydroxyl and a double bond). Then the ring would lose that conjugation, so the aromaticity would be disrupted. Since aromaticity is a strong stabilizer, the keto form is favored, so the enol form is not present. Therefore, benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism. \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is not aromatic. It's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. So, maybe it can form enol tautomers because the ring isn't aromatic. For example, each of the carbonyl groups could potentially form enol structures. So, the trione would have tautomers. Therefore, the one that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A). So for part A, the correct answer would be the option where A is benzoquinone. \n\nNow moving to part B: Which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism? \n\nOptical isomerism (chirality) requires a chiral center, which is a carbon with four different substituents. \n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break down the name. The structure is: \n\nThe parent chain is propanoic acid. The 2-hydroxypropanoate means there's a hydroxyl group on carbon 2, and it's the ester form with methyl. So, the structure would be: \n\nCH3-C(OOCH3)-CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:\n\nThe acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). The ester with methanol would be CH3-C(O)-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, maybe I need to draw it step by step. \n\nWait, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbons: the hydroxyl is on carbon 2, and the ester group is on carbon 3. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl) has substituents: the adjacent carbons. Let's look for a chiral center. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl (carbon 2) is connected to: \n\nCarbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (which is the COOCH3 group), an OH group, and the hydrogen (since it's the second carbon in propanoate). Wait, carbon 2 in the structure has: \n\nCarbon 2 is CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, carbon 2 (the one with the hydroxyl) is bonded to: \n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3), \n\n- Carbon 3 (the carbonyl carbon of the ester), \n\n- OH, \n\n- and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, the structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\n\nCarbon 3: COOCH3 \n\nSo carbon 2 is connected to: \n\n- Carbon 1 (CH3), \n\n- Carbon 3 (the carbonyl carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group), \n\n- an OH group, \n\n- and a hydrogen? Because the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-. So carbon 2 (the middle carbon) has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a single hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the carbon at position 2 is part of the chain. Let me count the bonds. \n\nThe carbon in position 2 (the hydroxyl carbon) has:\n\n- One bond to the methyl group (CH3 on C1),\n\n- One bond to the carbonyl carbon (C3),\n\n- One bond to the OH group,\n\n- And the fourth bond must be a hydrogen. Wait, but then that carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So that's four different substituents, making it a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl), so it can have optical isomers. \n\nNow, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is maleic acid's trans isomer. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is the trans form of butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The trans form would have the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (CH3OOC)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3) in trans configuration? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the structure is O2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (but that's actually maleic acid if it's cis). Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of fumaric acid (trans) is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxylic acid groups are on carbons 1 and 4, arranged trans to each other. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid has the structure: \n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So in the trans form (fumaric acid), the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. \n\nSo, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester where each carboxylic acid is esterified with methanol. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two COOH groups are both esterified. So it's (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), arranged in the trans configuration. \n\nNow, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. Let's look at the structure of dimethyl fumarate. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the carbons adjacent to the double bond (carbons 1 and 4) have the ester groups. Since the double bond is in a trans configuration, can there be any chiral centers here? \n\nLooking at each carbon in the structure:\n\nCarbon 1: connected to the first carbonyl (O2C-), a CH2 group (but actually, in the double bond structure, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each connected to two substituents. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe structure of fumaric acid's dimethyl ester is:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 but that's not right because of the double bond. Wait, the correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (since the two COOCH3 groups are on either side of the double bond in trans). Wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So each of those carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents. Let me think again.\n\nThe structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: O2C-\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (the other side of the double bond), and also has a hydrogen (since it's CH2 in the trans form? Wait no, because it's a double bond, so carbon 2 and 3 are connected via a double bond. Wait, the actual structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH (fumaric acid). When esterified to dimethyl fumarate, it becomes O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (but the other COOH is also esterified, so actually, both ends are O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both carboxylic acids are esterified. So it would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3). \n\nEach carbon adjacent to the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) are part of the double bond. Carbon 2 is connected to O2C- and the double bond, and has a hydrogen (since it's CH2 in the trans? Wait, no. Wait, the double bond structure is such that each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. For example, in the trans configuration:\n\nCarbon 1: O2C-\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 via double bond. The other two substituents on Carbon 2 are a hydrogen and maybe another group? Wait, let's get this right. The structure of fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. \n\nThe structure would be:\n\nO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, butenedioic acid has the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The correct structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have two substituents. For example, Carbon 2 is bonded to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (the other side of the double bond), and also has two hydrogens? Wait no. Wait, Carbon 2 in the double bond has a double bond to Carbon 3, and each has two substituents. Let me think of each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: has two oxygens (from the carboxyl group) and a single bond to Carbon 2.\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, double bond to Carbon 3, and has a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is part of the double bond, so it can't have a double bond and a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps Carbon 2 has a single bond to Carbon 1 (since the double bond is between 2 and 3). Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So Carbon 2 is connected via a double bond to Carbon 3, and via a single bond to Carbon 1. So Carbon 2 has:\n\n- Single bond to Carbon 1 (which is the COO group),\n\n- Double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? No, because the valence would be exceeded. Wait, Carbon 2 in the double bond (as part of the but-2-ene) has:\n\nEach carbon in a double bond has two substituents. For example, in but-2-ene, the carbons 2 and 3 form the double bond, each connected to two other groups. \n\nIn the case of fumaric acid:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH in the CH=CH):\n\nCarbon 2 is bonded to:\n\n- The COO group (from Carbon 1),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And has a hydrogen? Wait, Carbon 2 must have four bonds. The double bond counts as two bonds, so Carbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to Carbon 1 (which is O2C-),\n\n- One double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two single bonds. Wait, that would only account for three bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me write it as:\n\nEach carbon in the double bond (2 and 3) has two substituents. So Carbon 2 has:\n\n- A single bond to Carbon 1 (the COO group),\n\n- A double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And one more bond, which would be a hydrogen? So Carbon 2 has:\n\nGroups: COO-, double bond to C3, and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, Carbon 2 has:\n\n- The COO- group (from Carbon 1),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- And two hydrogens? That would make four bonds. \n\nWait, Carbon 2 would then have two hydrogens. Similarly, Carbon 3 would have two hydrogens. \n\nIn that case, each of the carbons adjacent to the double bond (2 and 3) has two hydrogens. Therefore, in the dimethyl ester, the structure would have no chiral centers because the carbons adjacent to the double bond are symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chiral center elsewhere. \n\nWait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetric. The two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. Since it's trans, the groups on each side are arranged in a way that the molecule is not chiral. Because if you look at it, the two sides are mirror images, but since it's trans, the molecule is actually symmetrical. Wait, perhaps it's meso? \n\nWait, let me consider the structure again. Suppose the molecule is (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(COOCH3), with the groups trans. Then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. The double bond is in the middle, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical. So there are no chiral centers because any chiral centers would be canceled out by the symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each carbon in the double bond is a chiral center. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond can't be a chiral center because they are part of the double bond (which restricts rotation), but their substituents must be different for chirality. Let's see: \n\nCarbon 2 (adjacent to the COOCH3 group):\n\nSubstituents: \n\n- The COOCH3 group (on Carbon 1 side),\n\n- The double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- and two hydrogens. Wait, if Carbon 2 has two hydrogens, then its substituents are: \n\nOne group from Carbon 1 (the ester), the double bond to Carbon 3, and two hydrogens. So that's three different groups? Wait, no, two hydrogens are the same. \n\nSo Carbon 2 has substituents: \n\n1. The ester group (CH2-OOCCH3?), \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try to draw it again. \n\nThe structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\nThe double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. \n\nCarbon 1: O2C-CH2-?\n\nNo, wait. The correct structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3 (with both ends esterified). Wait, the first and fourth carbons each have the ester groups. \n\nSo Carbon 1: O2C-,\n\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3 via double bond,\n\nCarbon 3: connected to Carbon 2 and Carbon 4,\n\nCarbon 4: COOCH3. \n\nWait, no. Carbon 4 would be the other end. The structure is actually:\n\nO2C-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nCarbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (O2C-) and Carbon 3 (via double bond), and also has a hydrogen. Carbon 3 is connected to Carbon 2 (double bond) and Carbon 4 (the COOCH3), plus another hydrogen. \n\nWait, so Carbon 2 has:\n\n- O2C- (from Carbon 1),\n\n- Double bond to Carbon 3,\n\n- Two hydrogens? \n\nWait, Carbon 2's bonds:\n\nSingle bond to Carbon 1 (the COOCH3 group? Wait, no. Wait Carbon 1 is the COO group. Let me count the bonds properly. \n\nCarbon 2 in the double bond must have two bonds (the double bond) plus two single bonds. So if it's bonded to Carbon 1 (COO-) and has a double bond to Carbon 3, then the other two bonds must be hydrogens. So Carbon 2 has two hydrogens. Similarly, Carbon 3 has two hydrogens. \n\nIn that case, the molecule is symmetrical. The two ends are mirror images, so the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Therefore, there are no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nBut wait, what about the double bond itself? The trans configuration is a geometric isomer, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but geometric isomers are not optical isomers. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because there's no chiral center. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, on the other hand, has a chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl group), so it does have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, for part B, the answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone (which we thought is correct for not showing tautomerism), and B = dimethyl fumarate (which is wrong because it doesn't have optical isomerism). \n\nWait, let's check the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (so A is the one that does not show tautomerism?), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for B).\n\nWait, the first part of option A says that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (meaning that this compound does NOT show tautomerism). But earlier, we thought that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so the correct A should be benzoquinone, which is in options B and D. \n\nSo let me recheck the first part. \n\nWe concluded that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so A should be benzoquinone). The options where A is benzoquinone are options B and D. \n\nThen for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so among the options, options B and C have that. \n\nOption B says A = benzoquinone (correct), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct). \n\nOption D says A = benzoquinone (correct), B = dimethyl fumarate (wrong). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, but let me recheck the first part again. \n\nEarlier analysis: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (so the correct A is benzoquinone). \n\nCyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism (so it's the one that does show, hence the question asks for which does NOT show, so the answer is benzoquinone). \n\nTherefore, option B is correct (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). \n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A), we analyze the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a quinone with two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Its aromaticity stabilizes the keto form, making enol tautomerism unfavorable due to loss of aromaticity. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, a non-aromatic cyclic triketone, can undergo enol tautomerism as its structure allows proton and double bond shifts without disrupting aromaticity. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**, so A = benzoquinone.\n\nFor optical isomerism (B), methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (four distinct substituents: CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H). Dimethyl fumarate, derived from the trans isomer of fumaric acid, lacks chiral centers due to its symmetrical structure, resulting in geometric isomerism rather than optical isomerism. Hence, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism**.\n\nThe correct options are **A = benzoquinone** and **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
