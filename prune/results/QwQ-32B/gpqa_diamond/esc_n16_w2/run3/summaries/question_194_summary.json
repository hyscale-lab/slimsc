      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out all the possible configurations of the three spins. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. For each of these states, I have to compute the energy E, then calculate e^{-\u03b2E}, and sum them all up.\n\nLet me list all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1. Let's denote each state as (S1, S2, S3). The states are:\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow, for each of these, compute the energy E. The energy formula is E = -J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nStarting with state 1: all spins +1.\n\nE1 = -J*( (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ) = -J*(1 +1 +1) = -3J. So the exponent term would be e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nState 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n\nCompute each product:\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1\n\nThus E = -J*(-1) = J. So exponent is e^{-\u03b2*J}? Wait no, wait. Wait, the energy is E = -J*(sum), so the sum here is (1 -1 -1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Therefore, the exponent is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{-\u03b2*J}.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me check another state. Maybe state 3: (+1, -1, +1)\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J again. So exponent is e^{-\u03b2J} again.\n\nState 4: (+1, -1, -1)\n\nCompute:\n\nS1S2 = +1*-1 = -1\n\nS1S3 = +1*-1 = -1\n\nS2S3 = -1*-1 = +1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = J again. Exponent e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nHmm, so state 4 also gives the same exponent as 2 and 3.\n\nMoving on to state 5: (-1, +1, +1)\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 \u2192 E = J again. So exponent same as before.\n\nState 6: (-1, +1, -1)\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E = J. So exponent again e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nState 7: (-1, -1, +1)\n\nProducts:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1) = +1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1 \u2192 E = J again. Exponent same.\n\nState 8: all -1: (-1, -1, -1)\n\nProducts:\n\nEach pair is (-1)(-1) = 1. So sum is 1+1+1 =3. Thus E = -J*(3) = -3J. So exponent is e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nSo, summarizing all the energies:\n\nState 1 and 8 have E = -3J \u2192 exponent e^{3J\u03b2}\n\nThe other 6 states (2-7) have E = J \u2192 exponent e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, let me recount. Let's see:\n\nWait for each of the 8 states:\n\nState 1: E = -3J \u2192 exponent e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nState 2: E = J \u2192 exponent e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nState3: same as state2 \u2192 exponent same\n\nState4: same \u2192 exponent same\n\nState5: same \u2192 exponent same\n\nState6: same \u2192 exponent same\n\nState7: same \u2192 exponent same\n\nState8: same as state1 \u2192 exponent e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nSo total:\n\nThere are 2 states with E = -3J, giving 2 * e^{3J\u03b2}\n\nThe remaining 6 states have E = J \u2192 each contributes e^{-\u03b2J}, so total of 6 * e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z would be the sum: 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6 e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nLooking at the options, option B says 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} which matches. Option A is 2e^{-3J\u03b2} +6e^{J\u03b2} which is the opposite exponents, so probably not. Option B is the correct one.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the energy correctly?\n\nWait, the energy is E = -J*(sum of products). For state1, all spins +1, so each product is +1. The sum is 3, so E = -J*(3) \u2192 -3J. So exponent is e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3\u03b2J} \u2192 correct.\n\nFor the other states, like state2, sum of products was (1 + (-1) + (-1)) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = +J. So exponent is e^{-\u03b2*(J)} \u2192 yes. So the exponents are correct.\n\nSo the partition function Z is indeed 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which is option B. Wait but looking at the options:\n\nOption B is written as Z=2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2). So yes, exactly that. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nYes, B is correct. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each spin can be +1 or -1. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right?\n\nFirst, I should figure out all possible configurations of the spins. Since each spin has two states, there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, I need to calculate the energy E and then compute e^{-\u03b2E}, then sum them all up.\n\nHmm, maybe I can categorize the configurations based on their energy. Let's see. The energy depends on the products of the spins. Let's think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term S_iS_j is either +1 or -1. The sum can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Wait, because each term is \u00b11, so three terms add up to 3 (if all +1), or down to -3 (all -1). So the possible sums could be -3, -1, +1, +3? Wait, maybe other possibilities?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of all possible combinations. Let's try enumerating the possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of enumerating all 8 cases, I can find how many configurations have a given value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each term:\n\nThe energy E = -J*(sum of three terms). So the exponent in the partition function would be \u03b2E = -\u03b2J*(sum of the three terms). Therefore, each term in the partition function is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{\u03b2J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. So the partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{\u03b2J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}.\n\nSo I need to compute that sum. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find all possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and count how many configurations give each value.\n\nLet me try to list all 8 configurations:\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let's list them as triples (S1, S2, S3):\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow for each, compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet's start with case 1: all spins +1.\n\nEach product is 1*1 =1. So sum is 1+1+1 =3. So exponent term is 3\u03b2J. So the contribution to Z is e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nCase 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nS1S2 = 1*1 =1\n\nS1S3 =1*(-1) =-1\n\nS2S3 =1*(-1) =-1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. So exponent is -1*\u03b2J. So e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase3: (+1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1) =-1\n\nS1S3=1*1=1\n\nS2S3= (-1)*1 =-1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 =-1 \u2192 same as case 2. So contribution e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase4: (+1, -1, -1)\n\nS1S2 =-1\n\nS1S3= (1)(-1) =-1\n\nS2S3= (-1)(-1) =1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 =-1 \u2192 again -1. So e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase5: (-1, +1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1)= -1\n\nS1S3= (-1)(1) =-1\n\nS2S3=1*1 =1 \u2192 sum: -1-1+1 =-1 \u2192 same as before.\n\nCase6: (-1, +1, -1):\n\nS1S2 =-1*1 =-1\n\nS1S3= -1*(-1)=1\n\nS2S3=1*(-1) =-1 \u2192 sum: -1+1-1 =-1 \u2192 exponent -\u03b2J.\n\nCase7: (-1, -1, +1):\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(1) =-1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(1)= -1 \u2192 sum 1-1-1 =-1 \u2192 exponent -\u03b2J.\n\nCase8: all -1. So each product is (-1)(-1)=1. So sum is 3 again. So exponent 3\u03b2J. Contribution e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nWait, let me check that case8:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum 3. So yes, same as case1.\n\nSo now, let's count the number of configurations that give each sum:\n\nSum=3: occurs in cases 1 and 8 \u2192 2 configurations. Each contributes e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nSum=-1: occurs in cases 2,3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 that's 6 configurations. Each contributes e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nWait, let me count again: cases 2-7 except the first and last. So 6 cases. Yes.\n\nWait case2,3,4,5,6,7 are 6 cases, each with sum -1. So total contributions:\n\n2*e^{3\u03b2J} + 6*e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nSo the partition function Z is 2e^{3\u03b2J} +6e^{-\u03b2J}, which is option B?\n\nWait the options are given as:\n\nOption B is 2e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{J\u03b2}?

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each spin can be +1 or -1. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right?\n\nFirst, I should figure out all possible configurations of the spins. Since each spin has two states, there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. For each configuration, I need to calculate the energy E and then compute e^{-\u03b2E}, then sum them all up.\n\nHmm, maybe I can categorize the configurations based on their energy. Let's see. The energy depends on the products of the spins. Let's think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nEach term S_iS_j is either +1 or -1. The sum can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Wait, because each term is \u00b11, so three terms add up to 3 (if all +1), or down to -3 (all -1). So the possible sums could be -3, -1, +1, +3? Wait, maybe other possibilities?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of all possible combinations. Let's try enumerating the possible cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of enumerating all 8 cases, I can find how many configurations have a given value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each term:\n\nThe energy E = -J*(sum of three terms). So the exponent in the partition function would be \u03b2E = -\u03b2J*(sum of the three terms). Therefore, each term in the partition function is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{\u03b2J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}. So the partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{\u03b2J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}.\n\nSo I need to compute that sum. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find all possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and count how many configurations give each value.\n\nLet me try to list all 8 configurations:\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let's list them as triples (S1, S2, S3):\n\n1. (+1, +1, +1)\n2. (+1, +1, -1)\n3. (+1, -1, +1)\n4. (+1, -1, -1)\n5. (-1, +1, +1)\n6. (-1, +1, -1)\n7. (-1, -1, +1)\n8. (-1, -1, -1)\n\nNow for each, compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.\n\nLet's start with case 1: all spins +1.\n\nEach product is 1*1 =1. So sum is 1+1+1 =3. So exponent term is 3\u03b2J. So the contribution to Z is e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nCase 2: (+1, +1, -1)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nS1S2 = 1*1 =1\n\nS1S3 =1*(-1) =-1\n\nS2S3 =1*(-1) =-1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. So exponent is -1*\u03b2J. So e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase3: (+1, -1, +1)\n\nS1S2=1*(-1) =-1\n\nS1S3=1*1=1\n\nS2S3= (-1)*1 =-1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 =-1 \u2192 same as case 2. So contribution e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase4: (+1, -1, -1)\n\nS1S2 =-1\n\nS1S3= (1)(-1) =-1\n\nS2S3= (-1)(-1) =1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 =-1 \u2192 again -1. So e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nCase5: (-1, +1, +1)\n\nS1S2= (-1)(1)= -1\n\nS1S3= (-1)(1) =-1\n\nS2S3=1*1 =1 \u2192 sum: -1-1+1 =-1 \u2192 same as before.\n\nCase6: (-1, +1, -1):\n\nS1S2 =-1*1 =-1\n\nS1S3= -1*(-1)=1\n\nS2S3=1*(-1) =-1 \u2192 sum: -1+1-1 =-1 \u2192 exponent -\u03b2J.\n\nCase7: (-1, -1, +1):\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(1) =-1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(1)= -1 \u2192 sum 1-1-1 =-1 \u2192 exponent -\u03b2J.\n\nCase8: all -1. So each product is (-1)(-1)=1. So sum is 3 again. So exponent 3\u03b2J. Contribution e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nWait, let me check that case8:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1 \u2192 sum 3. So yes, same as case1.\n\nSo now, let's count the number of configurations that give each sum:\n\nSum=3: occurs in cases 1 and 8 \u2192 2 configurations. Each contributes e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nSum=-1: occurs in cases 2,3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 that's 6 configurations. Each contributes e^{-\u03b2J}.\n\nWait, let me count again: cases 2-7 except the first and last. So 6 cases. Yes.\n\nWait case2,3,4,5,6,7 are 6 cases, each with sum -1. So total contributions:\n\n2*e^{3\u03b2J} + 6*e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nSo the partition function Z is 2e^{3\u03b2J} +6e^{-\u03b2J}, which is option B?\n\nWait the options are given as:\n\nOption B is 2e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{J\u03b2}?
