      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the problem is about choosing between two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to observe for transits. The goal is to pick the one with the higher transit probability. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars' masses differ. The host stars have the same radius but different masses. \n\nFirst, I remember that the transit probability depends on several factors. The main formula I recall is that the transit probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet)/a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are probably negligible compared to the star, so maybe that simplifies to just R_star divided by a. Wait, but actually, the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (1/e), where e is the orbital eccentricity, but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so maybe that part isn't needed here. Wait, no, actually, the transit probability formula when the orbit is circular is approximately (R_star / a), but adjusted by the cosine of the orbital inclination. Wait, actually, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that we see it transit. The probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is such that the planet passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. \n\nAlternatively, I think the standard formula for transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - e\u00b2)), but since e=0 (circular orbits), that term becomes 1. So it simplifies to R_star / a. Since both planets have circular orbits, that term is just R_star divided by the semi-major axis a. \n\nSo the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. \n\nBut how do we find a, the semi-major axis, for each planet? Since we know the orbital periods and the masses of the stars, we can use Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law in the form (a\u00b3)/(M_star) = (P\u00b2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G\u00b3) ), but maybe in some other units? Wait, more precisely, for a planet orbiting a star of mass M, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P by:\n\na\u00b3 = (G(M + m_p)) P\u00b2 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)\n\nBut since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, we can approximate M + m_p \u2248 M. \n\nSo, rearranged, a \u2248 [ (G M P\u00b2) / (4\u03c0\u00b2) ]^(1/3)\n\nBut since we are comparing the two planets, maybe we can express the ratio of a1 to a2. Let me denote the subscript 1 for Planet_1 and 2 for Planet_2.\n\nGiven that Planet_1's orbital period P1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, the problem says \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\". So P1 = P2 / 3. Because three times shorter would mean P1 is 1/3 of P2. Wait, sometimes people get confused with \"three times as long\" vs \"three times shorter\". Let me confirm: If Planet_1 has a period three times shorter, then yes, P1 = P2 / 3.\n\nNow, the host star of Planet_1 has a mass that's twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2*M2.\n\nSo, let's compute the ratio of a1/a2. \n\nFrom Kepler's law:\n\na \u221d ( (M P\u00b2) )^(1/3 )\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 = ( (M1 / M2) * (P1 / P2)^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM1/M2 = 2\n\nP1/P2 = 1/3\n\nSo the ratio inside the cube root becomes 2 * (1/3)^2 = 2 * 1/9 = 2/9.\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) \n\nLet me compute that numerically. Let's see, 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of that is approximately (0.2222)^(1/3). Since 0.27 is the cube root of 0.02, but wait. Let me think. Let me compute 0.2222^(1/3):\n\nCube of 0.6 is 0.216, so 0.6^3 = 0.216. So cube root of 0.2222 is a bit more than 0.6. Maybe approximately 0.605? Let's see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.605^3 \u2248 0.605 * 0.605 is ~0.366, then times 0.605 gives ~0.221. So yes, cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.605. So a1/a2 \u2248 0.605. \n\nTherefore, a1 \u2248 0.605 * a2.\n\nNow, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since both stars have the same radius (given in the problem: \"both host stars have the same radii\"), so R1 = R2 = R.\n\nThus, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1), and for Planet_2 is (R/a2). The ratio of their probabilities (P1_prob / P2_prob) would be (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1.\n\nSince a2/a1 = 1/0.605 \u2248 1.653. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and Planet_2 is (R/a2), so the ratio is a2/a1 \u2248 1.653. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R/a2). Therefore, Planet_2's probability is (R/a2) and Planet_1's is (R/a1). Therefore, the ratio of Planet_1's probability to Planet_2's is (R/a1) / (R/a2) = (a2/a1) \u2248 1.653. So Planet_1's transit probability is ~1.65 times that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the ratio is approximately 1.65. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability\", which matches. Option D says ~2.7 times higher, which would be different. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me redo the ratio step. \n\nWe have a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers: M1 is 2*M2, so M1/M2 =2. \n\nP1/P2 is 1/3, so squared is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. \n\nMultiply those: 2 * 1/9 = 2/9. \n\nSo (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nCube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So (2/9)^(1/3) is (2)^(1/3)/(9)^(1/3) \u2248 1.26 / 2.08 \u2248 0.606. So yes, that's correct. \n\nThus, a1 is about 0.606 a2. \n\nSo the transit probability for Planet_1 is R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606)*(R/a2) \u2248 1.65*(R/a2). \n\nWhich means Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nWait, but the question says the researchers chose to observe which one. Since Planet_1 has higher probability, they should choose Planet_1, so options C or D. Since the ratio is ~1.65, C is the correct one. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we found. So the answer is C.\n",

Let me denote the subscript 1 for Planet_1 and 2 for Planet_2.\n\nGiven that Planet_1's orbital period P1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, the problem says \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\". So P1 = P2 / 3. Because three times shorter would mean P1 is 1/3 of P2. Wait, sometimes people get confused with \"three times as long\" vs \"three times shorter\". Let me confirm: If Planet_1 has a period three times shorter, then yes, P1 = P2 / 3.\n\nNow, the host star of Planet_1 has a mass that's twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2*M2.\n\nSo, let's compute the ratio of a1/a2. \n\nFrom Kepler's law:\n\na \u221d ( (M P\u00b2) )^(1/3 )\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 = ( (M1 / M2) * (P1 / P2)^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nM1/M2 = 2\n\nP1/P2 = 1/3\n\nSo the ratio inside the cube root becomes 2 * (1/3)^2 = 2 * 1/9 = 2/9.\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) \n\nLet me compute that numerically. Let's see, 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of that is approximately (0.2222)^(1/3). Since 0.27 is the cube root of 0.02, but wait. Let me think. Let me compute 0.2222^(1/3):\n\nCube of 0.6 is 0.216, so 0.6^3 = 0.216. So cube root of 0.2222 is a bit more than 0.6. Maybe approximately 0.605? Let's see, 0.6^3 is 0.216, so 0.605^3 \u2248 0.605 * 0.605 is ~0.366, then times 0.605 gives ~0.221. So yes, cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.605. So a1/a2 \u2248 0.605. \n\nTherefore, a1 \u2248 0.605 * a2.\n\nNow, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a. Since both stars have the same radius (given in the problem: \"both host stars have the same radii\"), so R1 = R2 = R.\n\nThus, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1), and for Planet_2 is (R/a2). The ratio of their probabilities (P1_prob / P2_prob) would be (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1.\n\nSince a2/a1 = 1/0.605 \u2248 1.653. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and Planet_2 is (R/a2), so the ratio is a2/a1 \u2248 1.653. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R/a2). Therefore, Planet_2's probability is (R/a2) and Planet_1's is (R/a1). Therefore, the ratio of Planet_1's probability to Planet_2's is (R/a1) / (R/a2) = (a2/a1) \u2248 1.653. So Planet_1's transit probability is ~1.65 times that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the ratio is approximately 1.65. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability\", which matches. Option D says ~2.7 times higher, which would be different. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me redo the ratio step. \n\nWe have a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2 )^(1/3 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers: M1 is 2*M2, so M1/M2 =2. \n\nP1/P2 is 1/3, so squared is (1/3)^2 = 1/9. \n\nMultiply those: 2 * 1/9 = 2/9. \n\nSo (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nCube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So (2/9)^(1/3) is (2)^(1/3)/(9)^(1/3) \u2248 1.26 / 2.08 \u2248 0.606. So yes, that's correct. \n\nThus, a1 is about 0.606 a2. \n\nSo the transit probability for Planet_1 is R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606)*(R/a2) \u2248 1.65*(R/a2). \n\nWhich means Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nWait, but the question says the researchers chose to observe which one.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about determining which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can choose the better candidate. Both planets are Earth-like, with the same masses. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. \n\nHmm, right, the transit probability depends on certain factors. I remember that the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/e), where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'e' is the orbital eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, eccentricity is zero, but maybe the formula simplifies to something else. Wait, actually, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), but maybe multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe the exact formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by sqrt(1 - e\u00b2), but since e is zero, that term becomes 1. So the transit probability is proportional to R_star divided by the semi-major axis. \n\nWait, so transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a), assuming the orbital inclination is random. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be edge-on enough for the transit to occur. So the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), right?\n\nSo to find which planet has a higher probability, we need to compute R_star / a for each. But since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R. So the ratio of their probabilities would be (R1/a1) / (R2/a2) = (a2/a1), since R1/R2 is 1. Wait, no, actually, the probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R/a2), so the ratio is (a2/a1). So whichever has a smaller a (semi-major axis) would have a higher probability, since R is the same. \n\nWait, but how does the semi-major axis relate to the orbital period? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the star's mass. So P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G M_star) * a^3. So rearranged, a^3 = (P^2 G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). Since G and \u03c0 are constants, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^1/3. \n\nWait, let me write that more clearly. Let's write Kepler's third law as (a^3)/(M_star) = (P^2) * (some constants). Wait, actually, the exact form is (a^3)/(M_star) = (P^2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G). So for each planet, a^3 is proportional to P\u00b2 * M_star. Therefore, a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3). \n\nSo for Planet_1, let's denote:\n\na1 \u221d (P1\u00b2 * M1)^(1/3)\n\nSimilarly, a2 \u221d (P2\u00b2 * M2)^(1/3)\n\nGiven that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3. \n\nThe mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's. So M1 = 2*M2.\n\nTherefore, let's plug in:\n\na1 \u221d [( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2 M2) ]^(1/3)\n\na2 \u221d [ (P2)^2 * M2 ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo let's compute the ratio a1/a2.\n\nLet me write a1/a2 = [ ( (P2\u00b2/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2\u00b2 M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\nThe numerator inside is (P2\u00b2 * 2 M2 ) /9 \n\nDenominator inside is P2\u00b2 M2 \n\nSo the ratio inside is (2/9) \n\nSo (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nSo a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) \n\nWait, 9 is 3 squared, so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, 2/9 = 2/(3^2), so (2/3^2)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3)/3^(2/3). \n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is (2)^(1/3) / 3^(2/3). \n\nHmm. Let's compute that. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the transit probabilities. Since transit probability is proportional to R/a (since R is same for both stars, R1=R2=R), then the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1. \n\nSo P1/P2 = a2/a1. \n\nSo if a2/a1 is greater than 1, then Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSince a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3), then a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) \n\nWhich is (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3). \n\nCalculating 4.5^(1/3). Let me approximate. \n\n3^3 is 27, so cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 27 is 3. \n\n4.5 is between 1 and 8? Wait, 4.5 is between 1 and 8? Wait no, 4.5 is between 1 and 8, but cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, since 1.6^3 = 4.096, and 1.65^3 is (1.6*1.6=2.56; 2.56*1.65=4.224). Hmm, maybe 1.65^3 = 1.65 * 1.65 *1.65. Let me compute 1.65^2 first: 2.7225, then multiply by 1.65: 2.7225 *1.65 \u2248 4.4906, which is close to 4.5. So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. \n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 1.65. \n\nTherefore, P1/P2 = 1.65, so the transit probability of Planet 1 is 1.65 times higher than Planet 2. Wait, but the question is asking which planet is preferred. Since the probability is higher for Planet 1, the researchers should choose Planet 1. \n\nLooking at the options, let's check the options. \n\nOption C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. \n\nOption D says ~2.7 times. \n\nHmm, so my calculation gives 1.65, so C would be correct. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps again. \n\nFirst, transit probability is proportional to R/a. \n\nSince both stars have the same R, so the ratio is (a2/a1). \n\nThen, using Kepler's law. \n\nThe semi-major axis a is proportional to ( (P^2 * M) )^(1/3). \n\nSo for Planet 1: \n\na1 ~ ( ( (P1)^2 * M1 ) )^(1/3 )\n\nPlanet 2: \n\na2 ~ ( (P2)^2 * M2 )^(1/3 )\n\nWe have P1 = P2 /3. \n\nM1 = 2*M2. \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\na1 ~ [ ( (P2/3)^2 * 2*M2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\na2 ~ [ ( P2^2 * M2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, the ratio a1/a2 is [ ( ( (P2^2 /9 ) * 2*M2 ) / ( P2^2 M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nInside the brackets: numerator is (P2\u00b2/9 * 2 M2) and denominator is P2\u00b2 M2. \n\nDividing numerator by denominator gives (2/9). So the ratio a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nThus, a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) \u2248 1.65. \n\nSo the transit probability for Planet 1 is (R/a1) and for Planet 2 is (R/a2). \n\nTherefore, the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1 \u2248 1.65. \n\nSo Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the factor is ~1.65 times. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\" That matches. \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the ratio right. Because sometimes when I see transit probability, the formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by sqrt(1 - e\u00b2), but since e is zero, it's just R/a. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes the transit probability is calculated as (R_star + R_planet)/a, but since the planets are Earth-like and the star's radius is much larger, maybe that term is negligible. So the main term is R/a. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion should be correct. \n\nSo the answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about determining which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can choose the better candidate. Both planets are Earth-like, with the same masses. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. \n\nHmm, right, the transit probability depends on certain factors. I remember that the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1/e), where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'e' is the orbital eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, eccentricity is zero, but maybe the formula simplifies to something else. Wait, actually, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), but maybe multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe the exact formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by sqrt(1 - e\u00b2), but since e is zero, that term becomes 1. So the transit probability is proportional to R_star divided by the semi-major axis. \n\nWait, so transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a), assuming the orbital inclination is random. Because the planet's orbital plane has to be edge-on enough for the transit to occur. So the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), right?\n\nSo to find which planet has a higher probability, we need to compute R_star / a for each. But since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R. So the ratio of their probabilities would be (R1/a1) / (R2/a2) = (a2/a1), since R1/R2 is 1. Wait, no, actually, the probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1) and for Planet_2 it's (R/a2), so the ratio is (a2/a1). So whichever has a smaller a (semi-major axis) would have a higher probability, since R is the same. \n\nWait, but how does the semi-major axis relate to the orbital period? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the star's mass. So P^2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/G M_star) * a^3. So rearranged, a^3 = (P^2 G M_star)/(4\u03c0\u00b2). Since G and \u03c0 are constants, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^1/3. \n\nWait, let me write that more clearly. Let's write Kepler's third law as (a^3)/(M_star) = (P^2) * (some constants). Wait, actually, the exact form is (a^3)/(M_star) = (P^2) * (4\u03c0\u00b2/G). So for each planet, a^3 is proportional to P\u00b2 * M_star. Therefore, a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3). \n\nSo for Planet_1, let's denote:\n\na1 \u221d (P1\u00b2 * M1)^(1/3)\n\nSimilarly, a2 \u221d (P2\u00b2 * M2)^(1/3)\n\nGiven that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3. \n\nThe mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's. So M1 = 2*M2.\n\nTherefore, let's plug in:\n\na1 \u221d [( (P2/3)^2 ) * (2 M2) ]^(1/3)\n\na2 \u221d [ (P2)^2 * M2 ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo let's compute the ratio a1/a2.\n\nLet me write a1/a2 = [ ( (P2\u00b2/9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2\u00b2 M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\nThe numerator inside is (P2\u00b2 * 2 M2 ) /9 \n\nDenominator inside is P2\u00b2 M2 \n\nSo the ratio inside is (2/9) \n\nSo (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nSo a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) \n\nWait, 9 is 3 squared, so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, 2/9 = 2/(3^2), so (2/3^2)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3)/3^(2/3). \n\nSo the ratio a1/a2 is (2)^(1/3) / 3^(2/3). \n\nHmm. Let's compute that. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the transit probabilities. Since transit probability is proportional to R/a (since R is same for both stars, R1=R2=R), then the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1. \n\nSo P1/P2 = a2/a1. \n\nSo if a2/a1 is greater than 1, then Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSince a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3), then a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) \n\nWhich is (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3). \n\nCalculating 4.5^(1/3). Let me approximate. \n\n3^3 is 27, so cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 27 is 3. \n\n4.5 is between 1 and 8? Wait, 4.5 is between 1 and 8? Wait no, 4.5 is between 1 and 8, but cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65, since 1.6^3 = 4.096, and 1.65^3 is (1.6*1.6=2.56; 2.56*1.65=4.224). Hmm, maybe 1.65^3 = 1.65 * 1.65 *1.65. Let me compute 1.65^2 first: 2.7225, then multiply by 1.65: 2.7225 *1.65 \u2248 4.4906, which is close to 4.5. So cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. \n\nSo a2/a1 \u2248 1.65. \n\nTherefore, P1/P2 = 1.65, so the transit probability of Planet 1 is 1.65 times higher than Planet 2. Wait, but the question is asking which planet is preferred. Since the probability is higher for Planet 1, the researchers should choose Planet 1. \n\nLooking at the options, let's check the options. \n\nOption C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. \n\nOption D says ~2.7 times. \n\nHmm, so my calculation gives 1.65, so C would be correct. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the steps again. \n\nFirst, transit probability is proportional to R/a. \n\nSince both stars have the same R, so the ratio is (a2/a1). \n\nThen, using Kepler's law. \n\nThe semi-major axis a is proportional to ( (P^2 * M) )^(1/3). \n\nSo for Planet 1: \n\na1 ~ ( ( (P1)^2 * M1 ) )^(1/3 )\n\nPlanet 2: \n\na2 ~ ( (P2)^2 * M2 )^(1/3 )\n\nWe have P1 = P2 /3. \n\nM1 = 2*M2. \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\na1 ~ [ ( (P2/3)^2 * 2*M2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\na2 ~ [ ( P2^2 * M2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nSo, the ratio a1/a2 is [ ( ( (P2^2 /9 ) * 2*M2 ) / ( P2^2 M2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nInside the brackets: numerator is (P2\u00b2/9 * 2 M2) and denominator is P2\u00b2 M2. \n\nDividing numerator by denominator gives (2/9). So the ratio a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). \n\nThus, a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) \u2248 1.65. \n\nSo the transit probability for Planet 1 is (R/a1) and for Planet 2 is (R/a2). \n\nTherefore, the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) = a2/a1 \u2248 1.65. \n\nSo Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the factor is ~1.65 times. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says \"Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\" That matches. \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the ratio right.
