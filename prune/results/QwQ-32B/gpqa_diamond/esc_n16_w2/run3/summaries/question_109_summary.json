      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is not allowed based on the given conditions. Let's start by recalling the problem statement again. The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We also have to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nFirst, let's break down the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L_J. So here, the S (total spin) is 0 because the subscript is 0. The L here is S, which stands for L=0. The 2S+1 part is 1, so that checks out. So the initial NN system has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0. Therefore, the total angular momentum J_initial is L + S = 0 + 0 = 0. That's why the term is 1S0.\n\nNow, when they emit particle X, the final NN state must have T(NN) = 0. The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is 0, then S(NN) + L(NN) +1 must be even, so S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. So S(NN) and L(NN) must be one even and one odd. \n\nWe also need to consider conservation of angular momentum. The total angular momentum before and after must be the same. The initial total angular momentum J_initial is 0. The final state will have the NN system plus the emitted particle X. The total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. So the total angular momentum of the NN system plus the angular momentum of X must combine to give 0. Let's think about how that works.\n\nLet me note that the angular momentum of the NN system in the final state is J_NN_final = L_NN + S_NN, and the angular momentum of particle X is L_X (since its spin isn't mentioned here, maybe we can assume it's a spinless particle? Or maybe we need to consider its spin? Wait, the problem says the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X. Hmm. Wait, the question says \"the angular momentum state of X\" so probably the L_X is given by the letter (like p is l=1, etc.), and the particle's spin might not be considered here? Or perhaps we need to account for both?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particle X has its own angular momentum. Wait, but the problem mentions the partial wave of X, so the angular momentum of X is L_X, which is given by the letter (like s is l=0, p is l=1, d=2, f=3). The particle's spin is not specified here. So maybe we can assume that the total angular momentum of X is just its orbital angular momentum (since maybe its spin is zero?), but perhaps not. Hmm, perhaps we need to consider that the total angular momentum of the emitted particle X must combine with the NN's angular momentum to give the initial total angular momentum (0). \n\nAlternatively, the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial angular momentum (0). So the total angular momentum of NN plus X's angular momentum must add to 0. Wait, but angular momentum conservation requires that the total J_initial (0) equals the total J_final. The total J_final is the combination of J_NN (the NN system's angular momentum) plus J_X (the particle X's angular momentum). But how exactly does that work? The NN system's angular momentum is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN, and the particle X has its own angular momentum, which is L_X (its orbital angular momentum?) or its total angular momentum?\n\nHmm, maybe I should think in terms of the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X? Wait, perhaps the emission process involves the NN system going to a new state with some orbital angular momentum relative to the emitted particle X. In that case, the total angular momentum would be the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum of X (which would include its own spin and orbital angular momentum). But I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the particle X is emitted in a partial wave with angular momentum l (given by the letter like s, p, d, f), so that the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X is l. Then the total angular momentum of X would be its orbital angular momentum l, but perhaps we also need to consider its spin. But the problem might be simplifying it, so that the angular momentum of X's state is just l. Wait, but particles can have spin. For example, a pion (which is a possible X here?) has spin 0. But if X is a proton, it has spin 1/2. Hmm, the question doesn't specify what X is, just that it has parity -1. So maybe we can assume that the spin of X is zero, so that its angular momentum is just its orbital angular momentum l. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the total angular momentum of X is just l (since the problem states \"angular momentum state of X\" which might refer to the orbital part). Maybe in this context, the angular momentum of X is just l, so the total angular momentum for X is l.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the total angular momentum conservation requires that the NN's angular momentum (J_NN = L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum of X (l) must combine to give 0. Since the initial J is 0, the final total J must be 0. So, the vector sum of J_NN and l must be 0. Which implies that J_NN must equal l, and their vectors must be opposite. But for the total to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal and opposite direction. But since angular momentum is quantized, the only way that the total can be zero is if J_NN = l, and the projection is opposite. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, the possible condition is that J_NN = l. Wait, but actually, for two angular momenta to add to zero, their magnitudes must be equal, and their vectors exactly opposite. So, the magnitude of J_NN must equal the magnitude of l. So J_NN must be equal to l. Therefore, J_NN = L_NN + S_NN = l. \n\nWait, but actually, the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN and l. For that total to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal and opposite in direction. Since the initial total was zero, the final must also have zero. Therefore, the magnitudes must be equal, so J_NN must equal l, but their vectors must be antiparallel. However, since we're dealing with quantum numbers, perhaps the only way this can happen is if J_NN and l are the same magnitude, but then their combination can give a total of 0? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial angular momentum (0). So the total angular momentum J_total_final = J_NN + J_X (the angular momentum of X). Wait, but J_X is the angular momentum of the X particle, which is the combination of its orbital angular momentum (relative to the NN system) and its spin. But perhaps in this problem, the angular momentum of X is just its orbital angular momentum l (as given by the letter s, p, etc.), and its spin is zero. So J_X = l. Therefore, the total angular momentum would be J_NN + l must combine to 0. So the possible way is that J_NN and l must be equal in magnitude, and their vectors are opposite. But since they are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if they are exactly opposite. But since we are dealing with quantum numbers, the magnitudes must be equal. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. So J_NN = l. \n\nTherefore, the angular momentum of the NN system (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum of the emitted particle (l). \n\nSo that's one condition. \n\nAdditionally, parity must be conserved. The parity of the initial state is determined by the orbital angular momentum L_initial. Since the initial state is 1S0, L_initial is 0 (S corresponds to L=0). The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1. \n\nThe final parity must also be +1 (since parity is conserved). The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of the emitted particle X. The parity of the NN system is determined by its orbital angular momentum L_NN: (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. \n\nWait, the problem says particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1, but also, the emitted particle would have an orbital angular momentum l (given by the letter in the options), so the parity from X's orbital angular momentum is (-1)^l. Wait, no. Wait, the parity of the emitted particle is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum. Wait, actually, the parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. So the total parity of the final state (NN + X) is [parity of NN system] \u00d7 [parity of X]. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of X is [intrinsic parity of X] \u00d7 (-1)^{l}, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X (the one given in the options). \n\nWait, the problem says \"the angular momentum state of X\" refers to the angular momentum of X, which would be its orbital angular momentum l. So the parity of X's state is [intrinsic parity] \u00d7 (-1)^l. So putting this all together:\n\nInitial parity is +1. The final parity must also be +1. \n\nFinal parity = [parity of NN system] \u00d7 [parity of X's state] \n\nParity of NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nParity of X's state is [intrinsic parity of X] \u00d7 (-1)^l. Since the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1, that would be (-1) \u00d7 (-1)^l = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nFinal parity = (-1)^{L_NN} \u00d7 (-1)^{l +1} \n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1. So,\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l + 1} = +1 \n\nTherefore,\n\nL_NN + l + 1 must be even. \n\nWhich implies L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo that's the parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo now, let's recap the conditions we have for each option:\n\n1. T(NN) = 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. \n\n2. Angular momentum condition: J_NN (which is L_NN + S_NN) must equal l (the angular momentum of X given in the option). \n\n3. Parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, for each option, we have the final NN state's term symbol given. Let's parse each option step by step.\n\nLet me note that the final NN state's term symbol is given in the form like 3S1 + p. Wait, the options are written as 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, etc. Wait, each option has the form initial state (1S0) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) + particle X's partial wave (like p). \n\nSo for each option, the final NN state has a term symbol (like 7D1), which tells us S_NN, L_NN, and J_NN. Let me break down each term symbol:\n\nThe term symbol is (2S+1)^L_J. So for example, 7D1 would have 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, L is D which is L=2, and J=1. Wait, but J must equal L + S. Wait, but L is 2, S is 3, so L + S = 5. Hmm, but J is 1 here. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term symbol here. Wait, the term symbol for the NN system must have J = L_NN + S_NN? Or is it possible that they have some other combination?\n\nWait, no, the total angular momentum J for a system is L + S only if they are aligned. But in general, J can range from |L - S| to L + S in integer steps. But the term symbol's J is the actual value of the total angular momentum. So in the term symbol, J is given as the subscript. So for example, in 7D1, the J is 1. So L_NN is 2 (D), S_NN is (7-1)/2 = 3. So S_NN = 3. Then J can be |L - S| to L + S, so |2-3|=1 up to 5. So J=1 is allowed here. \n\nSo, for each term symbol of the NN final state, we can get S_NN and L_NN from the term symbol. Let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. So S_NN is (7-1)/2 = 3, L_NN is D \u2192 2, and J_NN is 1. \n\nNow, check T(NN) = 0. The problem states that in the final state, T(NN) is 0. We need to confirm that this term symbol's T is 0? Wait, but T is the isospin. Hmm, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so that's given. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted given the conditions. But the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so each option's final NN state must have T=0. Wait, but the question is asking which option is not allowed. So perhaps the options might have NN states with T\u22600? But the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So maybe all options have T=0, but we need to check other conditions. Wait, perhaps the T(NN) is determined by the given term symbol? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN must have T(NN)=0, but the options are different possible final states. So for each option, the final NN's term symbol must correspond to T=0? Or is the T given by the term symbol's isospin? Wait, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So all options must have that, but maybe one of them can't satisfy the other conditions (angular momentum and parity). The question is asking which option is not permitted, so we need to check each option against the conditions.\n\nWait, but also, the Pauli statistics condition must be met: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. So for each option, we can check that.\n\nLet's proceed step by step for each option:\n\nStarting with Option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nFirst, the final NN's term symbol is 7D1. Let's get S_NN and L_NN:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3. \n\nL is D \u2192 L=2.\n\nJ=1 (but J can be anything here, but the important part is S and L for our conditions).\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition: S + L must be odd.\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So that's okay. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, check the angular momentum condition: J_NN (the NN's total angular momentum) must equal l (the angular momentum of X given in the option). Here, the particle X is p, which is l=1. \n\nJ_NN is given by the term symbol's J, which is 1. So J_NN =1. The l here is p (l=1). So J_NN = l \u2192 1 = 1 \u2192 that's okay. So angular momentum condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, the parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. L_NN is 2 (D), l is 1 (p). 2 +1 =3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied. \n\nSo all conditions are met for option A. So A is allowed. \n\nMoving to Option B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3S1.\n\nSo, 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 L=0. J=1.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1+0=1, which is odd. So that's okay.\n\nAngular momentum condition: J_NN is 1 (from term symbol's J=1). The X's l is p (l=1). So J_NN =1 equals l=1. That works. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l (1) =1 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nThus, B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3D3.\n\n2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 L=2. J=3.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L = 1 +2 =3 \u2192 odd. Okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3. The X's partial wave is f, which is l=3. So J_NN (3) equals l (3). So that's okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l (3) =5 \u2192 odd. 5 is odd, so that's okay. \n\nSo all conditions are met here. C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3P0.\n\n2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u2192 L=1. J=0. \n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. \n\nWait, but the condition requires that T(NN)=0 = S + L +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, S + L must be odd. Here S + L = 2 \u2192 even. That violates the Pauli condition. \n\nWait a minute! This is a problem. Let's check again. \n\nPauli condition: T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1. Their sum is 2, even. Which is not allowed. So this violates the Pauli condition. \n\nTherefore, this option is not permitted. \n\nBut before confirming, let's check the other conditions as well, just to be thorough. \n\nAngular momentum condition: J_NN (from the term symbol's J=0) must equal l (s is l=0). So 0 equals 0. That's okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l (0) =1 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nBut since the Pauli condition is violated (S + L is even), this option is invalid. \n\nWait, but the problem says the final NN has T(NN)=0, which requires S + L must be odd. Since this option's S + L is even, it's not allowed. So D is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, for option D, the final NN's term is 3P0. Let me recheck the term symbol. 3P0:\n\n2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. \n\nL is P (L=1). \n\nJ is 0. \n\nSo S=1, L=1. \n\nS + L = 2 \u2192 even. So T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 2 +1 mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that the final NN has T=0. So T(NN) would be 1 here, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, this is invalid. \n\nThus, option D is the one that's not permitted. \n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

Wait, but actually, for two angular momenta to add to zero, their magnitudes must be equal, and their vectors exactly opposite. So, the magnitude of J_NN must equal the magnitude of l. So J_NN must be equal to l. Therefore, J_NN = L_NN + S_NN = l. \n\nWait, but actually, the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN and l. For that total to be zero, their magnitudes must be equal and opposite in direction. Since the initial total was zero, the final must also have zero. Therefore, the magnitudes must be equal, so J_NN must equal l, but their vectors must be antiparallel. However, since we're dealing with quantum numbers, perhaps the only way this can happen is if J_NN and l are the same magnitude, but then their combination can give a total of 0? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial angular momentum (0). So the total angular momentum J_total_final = J_NN + J_X (the angular momentum of X). Wait, but J_X is the angular momentum of the X particle, which is the combination of its orbital angular momentum (relative to the NN system) and its spin. But perhaps in this problem, the angular momentum of X is just its orbital angular momentum l (as given by the letter s, p, etc.), and its spin is zero. So J_X = l. Therefore, the total angular momentum would be J_NN + l must combine to 0. So the possible way is that J_NN and l must be equal in magnitude, and their vectors are opposite. But since they are vectors, the only way their sum is zero is if they are exactly opposite. But since we are dealing with quantum numbers, the magnitudes must be equal. Therefore, J_NN must equal l. So J_NN = l. \n\nTherefore, the angular momentum of the NN system (J_NN) must equal the angular momentum of the emitted particle (l). \n\nSo that's one condition. \n\nAdditionally, parity must be conserved. The parity of the initial state is determined by the orbital angular momentum L_initial. Since the initial state is 1S0, L_initial is 0 (S corresponds to L=0). The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1. \n\nThe final parity must also be +1 (since parity is conserved). The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of the emitted particle X. The parity of the NN system is determined by its orbital angular momentum L_NN: (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. \n\nWait, the problem says particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1, but also, the emitted particle would have an orbital angular momentum l (given by the letter in the options), so the parity from X's orbital angular momentum is (-1)^l. Wait, no. Wait, the parity of the emitted particle is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum. Wait, actually, the parity of a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum l is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l. So the total parity of the final state (NN + X) is [parity of NN system] \u00d7 [parity of X]. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of X is [intrinsic parity of X] \u00d7 (-1)^{l}, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X (the one given in the options). \n\nWait, the problem says \"the angular momentum state of X\" refers to the angular momentum of X, which would be its orbital angular momentum l. So the parity of X's state is [intrinsic parity] \u00d7 (-1)^l. So putting this all together:\n\nInitial parity is +1. The final parity must also be +1. \n\nFinal parity = [parity of NN system] \u00d7 [parity of X's state] \n\nParity of NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}.\n\nParity of X's state is [intrinsic parity of X] \u00d7 (-1)^l. Since the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1, that would be (-1) \u00d7 (-1)^l = (-1)^{l+1}.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nFinal parity = (-1)^{L_NN} \u00d7 (-1)^{l +1} \n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1. So,\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l + 1} = +1 \n\nTherefore,\n\nL_NN + l + 1 must be even. \n\nWhich implies L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo that's the parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nSo now, let's recap the conditions we have for each option:\n\n1. T(NN) = 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. \n\n2. Angular momentum condition: J_NN (which is L_NN + S_NN) must equal l (the angular momentum of X given in the option). \n\n3. Parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, for each option, we have the final NN state's term symbol given. Let's parse each option step by step.\n\nLet me note that the final NN state's term symbol is given in the form like 3S1 + p. Wait, the options are written as 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, etc. Wait, each option has the form initial state (1S0) \u2192 final NN state (like 7D1) + particle X's partial wave (like p). \n\nSo for each option, the final NN state has a term symbol (like 7D1), which tells us S_NN, L_NN, and J_NN. Let me break down each term symbol:\n\nThe term symbol is (2S+1)^L_J. So for example, 7D1 would have 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3, L is D which is L=2, and J=1. Wait, but J must equal L + S. Wait, but L is 2, S is 3, so L + S = 5. Hmm, but J is 1 here. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term symbol here. Wait, the term symbol for the NN system must have J = L_NN + S_NN? Or is it possible that they have some other combination?\n\nWait, no, the total angular momentum J for a system is L + S only if they are aligned. But in general, J can range from |L - S| to L + S in integer steps. But the term symbol's J is the actual value of the total angular momentum. So in the term symbol, J is given as the subscript. So for example, in 7D1, the J is 1. So L_NN is 2 (D), S_NN is (7-1)/2 = 3. So S_NN = 3. Then J can be |L - S| to L + S, so |2-3|=1 up to 5. So J=1 is allowed here. \n\nSo, for each term symbol of the NN final state, we can get S_NN and L_NN from the term symbol. Let's parse each option:\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. So S_NN is (7-1)/2 = 3, L_NN is D \u2192 2, and J_NN is 1. \n\nNow, check T(NN) = 0. The problem states that in the final state, T(NN) is 0. We need to confirm that this term symbol's T is 0? Wait, but T is the isospin. Hmm, the problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so that's given. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted given the conditions. But the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\", so each option's final NN state must have T=0. Wait, but the question is asking which option is not allowed. So perhaps the options might have NN states with T\u22600? But the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So maybe all options have T=0, but we need to check other conditions. Wait, perhaps the T(NN) is determined by the given term symbol? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem states that the final NN must have T(NN)=0, but the options are different possible final states. So for each option, the final NN's term symbol must correspond to T=0? Or is the T given by the term symbol's isospin? Wait, the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So all options must have that, but maybe one of them can't satisfy the other conditions (angular momentum and parity). The question is asking which option is not permitted, so we need to check each option against the conditions.\n\nWait, but also, the Pauli statistics condition must be met: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. So for each option, we can check that.\n\nLet's proceed step by step for each option:\n\nStarting with Option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nFirst, the final NN's term symbol is 7D1. Let's get S_NN and L_NN:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3. \n\nL is D \u2192 L=2.\n\nJ=1 (but J can be anything here, but the important part is S and L for our conditions).\n\nNow, check the Pauli condition: S + L must be odd.\n\nS=3, L=2 \u2192 3+2=5 \u2192 which is odd. So that's okay. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, check the angular momentum condition: J_NN (the NN's total angular momentum) must equal l (the angular momentum of X given in the option). Here, the particle X is p, which is l=1. \n\nJ_NN is given by the term symbol's J, which is 1. So J_NN =1. The l here is p (l=1). So J_NN = l \u2192 1 = 1 \u2192 that's okay. So angular momentum condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, the parity condition: L_NN + l must be odd. L_NN is 2 (D), l is 1 (p). 2 +1 =3, which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied. \n\nSo all conditions are met for option A. So A is allowed. \n\nMoving to Option B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3S1.\n\nSo, 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S \u2192 L=0. J=1.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1+0=1, which is odd. So that's okay.\n\nAngular momentum condition: J_NN is 1 (from term symbol's J=1). The X's l is p (l=1). So J_NN =1 equals l=1. That works. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l (1) =1 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nThus, B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3D3.\n\n2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D \u2192 L=2. J=3.\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L = 1 +2 =3 \u2192 odd. Okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3. The X's partial wave is f, which is l=3. So J_NN (3) equals l (3). So that's okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l (3) =5 \u2192 odd. 5 is odd, so that's okay. \n\nSo all conditions are met here. C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN term symbol: 3P0.\n\n2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P \u2192 L=1. J=0. \n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. \n\nWait, but the condition requires that T(NN)=0 = S + L +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, S + L must be odd. Here S + L = 2 \u2192 even. That violates the Pauli condition. \n\nWait a minute! This is a problem. Let's check again. \n\nPauli condition: T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u22611 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1. Their sum is 2, even. Which is not allowed. So this violates the Pauli condition. \n\nTherefore, this option is not permitted. \n\nBut before confirming, let's check the other conditions as well, just to be thorough. \n\nAngular momentum condition: J_NN (from the term symbol's J=0) must equal l (s is l=0). So 0 equals 0. That's okay. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l (0) =1 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nBut since the Pauli condition is violated (S + L is even), this option is invalid. \n\nWait, but the problem says the final NN has T(NN)=0, which requires S + L must be odd. Since this option's S + L is even, it's not allowed. So D is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, for option D, the final NN's term is 3P0. Let me recheck the term symbol. 3P0:\n\n2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. \n\nL is P (L=1). \n\nJ is 0. \n\nSo S=1, L=1. \n\nS + L = 2 \u2192 even. So T = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 2 +1 mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that the final NN has T=0. So T(NN) would be 1 here, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, this is invalid. \n\nThus, option D is the one that's not permitted. \n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze each option based on the given conditions:\n\n1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: \\( T(NN) = 0 \\) requires \\( S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\), so \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) must be odd.\n2. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum of the final NN system (\\( J_{NN} = L_{NN} + S_{NN} \\)) must equal the angular momentum of the emitted particle \\( l \\).\n3. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity must remain \\( +1 \\). The parity of the NN system is \\( (-1)^{L_{NN}} \\), and the parity of particle \\( X \\) (with intrinsic parity \\( -1 \\)) is \\( (-1)^{l+1} \\). Thus, \\( (-1)^{L_{NN} + l + 1} = +1 \\), requiring \\( L_{NN} + l \\) to be odd.\n\n**Option A (1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p)**:\n- Final NN term: \\( 7D_1 \\) \u2192 \\( S_{NN} = 3 \\), \\( L_{NN} = 2 \\).\n- Pauli: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Angular momentum: \\( J_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l = 1 \\) (equal \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Parity: \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- **Allowed**.\n\n**Option B (1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p)**:\n- Final NN term: \\( 3S_1 \\) \u2192 \\( S_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( L_{NN} = 0 \\).\n- Pauli: \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Angular momentum: \\( J_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l = 1 \\) (equal \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Parity: \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- **Allowed**.\n\n**Option C (1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f)**:\n- Final NN term: \\( 3D_3 \\) \u2192 \\( S_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( L_{NN} = 2 \\).\n- Pauli: \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Angular momentum: \\( J_{NN} = 3 \\), \\( l = 3 \\) (equal \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Parity: \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- **Allowed**.\n\n**Option D (1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s)**:\n- Final NN term: \\( 3P_0 \\) \u2192 \\( S_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( L_{NN} = 1 \\).\n- Pauli: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (even \u2716\ufe0f, violates the condition).\n- Angular momentum: \\( J_{NN} = 0 \\), \\( l = 0 \\) (equal \u2714\ufe0f).\n- Parity: \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (odd \u2714\ufe0f).\n- **Violates Pauli condition**, so **not permitted**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The question is about which of the given partial waves isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, and parity. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and there's that equation involving T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics. For two nucleons, each has isospin 1/2. The total isospin T can be 0 or 1. Since the final state has T(NN) = 0, that means the two nucleons are in a singlet state. The given condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 must hold. Since T is 0, substituting gives 0 \u2261 S + L + 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L must be odd. So S(NN) + L(NN) must be an odd integer.\n\nNow, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The term symbol is 2S+1^L_J. Here, 1S0 means that the spin S is 0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0), the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since the letter is S, which corresponds to L=0), and the total angular momentum J is 0 (since the subscript is 0). So initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0.\n\nThe particle X is emitted, so we have an initial NN system plus X. Since it's a decay, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state is the NN system plus the particle X. The total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. The NN system has some angular momentum J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (since their spins and orbital angular momentum combine), and the particle X has angular momentum L_X (since the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X, like p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.). Wait, actually, the angular momentum of X is its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system? Or is it the particle's own spin?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify. The term in the options like \"7D1 + p\" probably refers to the final NN state's term symbol (like 7D1 would be 2S+1 =7? Wait, no, D would be L=2, so maybe the first number is 2S+1, then L, then J. So 7D1 would mean S=3 (since 2*3+1=7?), L=2 (D), J=1? Wait, that can't be right because for a two-nucleon system, the maximum spin would be 1 (since each has spin 1/2, so total S could be 0 or 1). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term symbols here. Let me think again. For two nucleons, each has spin 1/2. The total spin S can be 0 or 1. So the 2S+1 would be either 1 or 3. So a term symbol like 3D3 would have 2S+1=3, so S=1, L=2 (since D is L=2), and J = L + S? Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of L and S, but they can couple in different ways. Wait, J can be |L-S| to L+S in integer steps. Hmm, but the term symbol's J is the total angular momentum of the NN system. So for example, if the NN system has L=2 (D) and S=1, then J could be 1, 2, or 3. But the term symbol would have J written as the subscript. So in the option C, 3D3 would have J=3, which would require L=2 and S=1, so J = L + S? Well, 2 +1 =3, so that's possible.\n\nBut maybe I should not get bogged down here yet. Let's get back to the problem.\n\nThe key points to check for each option are:\n\n1. Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum before (0) must equal the total after. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and the particle X's angular momentum (which would be its orbital angular momentum, since its spin is part of its own properties but here maybe considered as part of the emitted particle's state? Wait, maybe the particle X has some angular momentum, but when considering the emission, the total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The NN system's angular momentum plus the emitted particle's angular momentum (its orbital angular momentum, since the particle's spin is fixed?) must add up to the initial 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the particle X has its own angular momentum, which includes both spin and orbital angular momentum. But I think in these types of problems, when you have a two-body decay like NN \u2192 NN + X, the angular momentum conservation requires that the total angular momentum of the initial state (0) equals the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (J_X). But J_X is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum (l) and its spin (s). But the problem might be simplifying things, perhaps considering only the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle? Or maybe the problem is treating the emitted particle's angular momentum as its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the partial wave of the emitted particle (like p, s, f) corresponds to its orbital angular momentum l. So the angular momentum of the emitted particle X is its orbital angular momentum l_X. So the total angular momentum conservation would require that J_NN + l_X must be 0? But that might not be exactly right. Wait, no, because when you have a two-body decay, the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial J is 0. The final state has the NN system with J_NN and the emitted particle with J_X. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN and J_X. Since the initial is 0, the final must also be 0. Therefore, J_NN + J_X must combine to give 0. But the only way that can happen is if J_NN = J_X, and they are pointing in opposite directions. However, the magnitude must be equal, so J_NN must equal J_X. Wait, but the vector sum must be zero, so their magnitudes must be equal and their vectors opposite. Therefore, J_NN must equal J_X, and their vectors are opposite. But since angular momentum can only be integers or half-integers, but here we are dealing with nucleons, which have integer spins? Wait, nucleons have spin 1/2 each, so their total spin could be 0 or 1. Hmm, but the problem is about the NN system's angular momentum. The NN system's total angular momentum J_NN is L_NN + S_NN (but actually, it's the vector sum of their individual spins and orbital angular momenta). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angular momentum conservation is considered such that the total angular momentum of the NN plus the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum must be zero. Because the particle's spin is fixed, perhaps? Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the emitted particle's spin is part of its own properties, and the orbital angular momentum is the l_X given by the lowercase letter (p, s, f). So the total angular momentum of the system would require that the NN's J (which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ... )? Wait, no, the total angular momentum J_NN is the sum of their orbital angular momentum L_NN and their total spin S_NN. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum of the NN system is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN? Or is it the vector sum? The total angular momentum J_NN is the combination of L_NN (orbital) and S_NN (total spin of the two nucleons). So J_NN can range from |L_NN - S_NN| to L_NN + S_NN in integer steps. But the problem gives the term symbol for the final NN state, which includes J. So, for example, in option A, the final NN is 7D1. Wait, but 7 would imply S = 3, which is impossible for two nucleons (since each has spin 1/2, so their total spin can be only 0 or 1). So that term symbol must be incorrect. Wait a minute, this might be a key point. Let me check each option's term symbol for the NN state.\n\nWait, for two nucleons (each spin 1/2), their total spin S can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the 2S+1 term must be either 1 or 3. So any term symbol with a coefficient like 7 is impossible. So looking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: The final NN state is 7D1. Since 2S+1=7 would require S=3, which can't be. So this term symbol is invalid. But maybe the options are correct, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the first number is not 2S+1? Wait, the problem says \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J)\". So yes, the first number is 2S+1, so 7 would require S=3, which is impossible. So that term symbol is impossible, so option A is not a permitted state. But the question says \"which is not permitted\", so maybe A is the answer? But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check all the options first.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p. The NN term is 3S1. So 2S+1=3 implies S=1, which is okay. The L is S (so L=0). Then J is 1. Since S=1 and L=0, J would be sqrt(S^2 + L^2 + ...) but actually, J can be L + S or |L - S| etc. Wait, since L is 0 and S is 1, then J can only be 1. So that's okay. So 3S1 is possible.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f. The term symbol is 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is D (L=2), and J=3. Since S=1 and L=2, the possible J values are 1+2=3, 1, and 3. So 3 is possible. So that's okay.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s. 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is P (L=1), and J=0. Wait, S=1 and L=1. The possible J values are 0,1,2. So J=0 is allowed. So that term is okay.\n\nWait, so the only term symbol that's impossible is in option A (7D1), because 2S+1=7 would require S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, option A is invalid, so it's not permitted. But the question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". Wait, but the problem also has other constraints. The question is which partial wave is not permitted, considering the conditions given, including parity and Pauli's statistics (the equation with T, S, L).\n\nWait, but maybe I should check all constraints for each option, even if the term symbol is valid. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each option, let's check the term symbol validity first. If the term symbol is impossible (like A's 7D1), then that's automatically invalid, so the answer is A. But maybe the question expects us to consider all constraints, including parity and the T(NN) equation.\n\nSo let's go through each option:\n\nStarting with Option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN term is 7D1. Since two nucleons can't have S=3, this term is impossible. So regardless of other factors, this is invalid. So A is the answer? But the question might have other options where the term is valid but other constraints are violated. Let me check the other options just to confirm.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nThe NN final state is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1), L=0 (S state), and J=1. The parity conservation also needs to be considered. The parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. The parity of a state is (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial is 0 \u21d2 parity is (+1)^0 = +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The total parity must be conserved. The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity (since parity is multiplicative). Wait, the total initial parity is the NN's parity (since it's the initial state). The final parity must equal that. So:\n\nInitial parity: (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nFinal parity must also be +1. The final parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X). The parity of the NN is (-1)^L_NN (since L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system). The parity of X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l_X, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (since the particle's orbital angular momentum contributes to its spatial parity). Wait, the particle X's parity is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^l_X. So total final parity is [(-1)^L_NN] * [intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^l_X].\n\nThe initial parity must equal the final parity. So:\n\n(-1)^0 = [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ] (since intrinsic parity is -1).\n\nWait, let's write that out:\n\nInitial parity: +1 = Final parity: [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)^{intrinsic_parity?} ] Wait, intrinsic parity is a sign. So intrinsic parity of X is -1, so the term is (-1). So:\n\nTotal final parity: (parity_NN) * (parity_X) = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) ].\n\nSo set equal to +1:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = +1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = +1.\n\nThus:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 must be even \u21d2 L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_NN + l_X is odd.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check the angular momentum conservation.\n\nAlso, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = 0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2 \u21d2 S_NN + L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo let's process each option step by step.\n\nStarting with Option A (even though I think it's invalid due to term symbol):\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nBut the term symbol 7D1 is impossible. So this is invalid, so regardless of other factors, the answer is A. But let's check others just in case.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nFirst, check term symbol validity: 3S1 is okay (S=1, L=0, J=1). Good.\n\nNow, parity check.\n\nL_NN here is L=0 (since it's S state). The emitted particle's angular momentum (lowercase letter is p, which is l=1).\n\nSo L_NN + l_X = 0 +1=1, which is odd. So the parity equation requires L_NN + l_X +1 = 0+1+1=2, which is even, so (-1)^2 =1, so that's okay. Parity is conserved.\n\nAngular momentum conservation: The total angular momentum must be 0. The NN's J is 1 (from the term symbol's subscript). The emitted particle's angular momentum (J_X) is l_X (orbital) plus its spin? Wait, but the problem says the particle X's angular momentum state is denoted by the lowercase letter. Maybe the angular momentum of X is just l_X, so its orbital angular momentum. Then J_X is l_X. Since it's a particle, like a pion (assuming X is a pion?), but the problem doesn't specify. But for angular momentum conservation, the NN's J (which is 1) plus the particle's l (1) must combine to give total J=0. But J_NN (1) and l_X (1). The vector sum can be 0 only if they are opposite. Since 1 +1 can give 0, 1, or 2. Wait, J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. The total angular momentum can range from |1-1| to 1+1, i.e., 0 to 2. So 0 is possible. So that's okay. So angular momentum is conserved.\n\nNow check the Pauli condition: T(NN)=0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2.\n\nHere S_NN is 1 (since term symbol's 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1). L_NN is 0 (S state). So 1 +0 +1 mod2 = 2 mod2=0. Which matches T(NN)=0. So that's okay. So B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\nTerm symbol 3D3: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L=D (L=2), J=3. That's okay because S=1 and L=2, so J can be 3 (since 1+2=3). So term is valid.\n\nParity check:\n\nL_NN = 2 (D state). The emitted particle's l_X is f, which is l=3 (since f corresponds to L=3). So L_NN + l_X =2 +3=5, which is odd. So L_NN + l_X +1 =6, even \u21d2 parity okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol). The particle's l_X is 3. So total angular momentum must be 0. The sum of 3 (J_NN) and 3 (l_X) can give 0? The possible total J values are from |3-3| to 3+3, so 0 to 6. So 0 is possible. So angular momentum is conserved.\n\nPauli condition: S_NN=1, L_NN=2. S + L = 3, which mod2 is 1. So 1 mod2 =1, which equals T(NN)=0? Wait, no. Wait the condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. Wait the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, so 0 \u2261 1+2 +1 mod2 \u21d2 4 mod2=0. Which holds. Wait, 1 (S) + 2 (L) +1 =4, mod2 is 0. So yes, that's okay. So C is allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\nTerm symbol 3P0: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L=P (L=1). J=0. Since S=1 and L=1, J can be 0,1,2. So J=0 is okay. So term is valid.\n\nParity check: L_NN is 1 (P). The emitted particle's l_X is s (l=0). So L_NN + l_X =1+0=1, which is odd. So L_NN + l_X +1 =2 \u21d2 even. Parity okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0 (from the term's subscript). The emitted particle has l=0. The total angular momentum must be 0. So 0 +0 =0. That's okay.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1. S + L =2 \u21d2 2 mod2=0. Then T(NN)=0 = 0 +1 mod2? Wait, the equation is T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2. So S + L +1 =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1. But T(NN)=0, so 0 \u22611 mod2? That's a contradiction. Wait, hold on, this is a problem.\n\nWait, let's compute for option D:\n\nPauli condition: T(NN)=0 must equal S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nHere S=1, L=1. So 1 +1 +1 =3 mod2=1. But T(NN)=0. So 0 \u22611 mod2? That's not true. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this option is invalid?\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait the condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nGiven T(NN)=0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u21d2 since mod2, -1 \u22611. So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2, which is even. So that's not allowed. So the Pauli condition is violated here. \n\nOh! So option D also violates the Pauli condition. But then the question is asking which is not permitted, so maybe both A and D are invalid? But the options are A to D, and the question probably has only one correct answer. Wait, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait let's check again:\n\nFor option D, the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so according to the condition, S + L +1 mod2 must equal T(NN)=0. So S + L must be even? Wait:\n\nWait the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So T is 0 \u21d2 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 rearranged: S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u21d2 which is S + L \u22611 mod2 (since -1 mod2 is 1). So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1: sum is 2, even \u21d2 violates the condition. So D is invalid. But the term symbol was okay, and the parity and angular momentum also okay? Wait parity check was okay, angular momentum also okay, but the Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. \n\nSo now I have two options that might be invalid: A and D. But the question says \"which is not permitted\". Hmm. Let's see.\n\nWait, in option D, the term symbol is 3P0. The term is valid (since S=1, L=1, J=0). The parity and angular momentum are okay, but the Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. But the question might have only one correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in another step.\n\nLooking back, in option A, the term symbol 7D1 is impossible (since S=3 is impossible). So A is invalid. So why is D also invalid? The problem says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", so maybe both A and D are invalid? But the options are single choice. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Pauli condition for D?\n\nWait let me recheck the Pauli condition for D:\n\nPauli condition: T(NN)=0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nSo S + L +1 must be even (since T=0). So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn D, S=1, L=1: sum is 2, which is even \u21d2 2+1=3 mod2=1, so T would be 1, not 0. Therefore, this is invalid. So D's final state has T=1, but the question states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. Wait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the question's scenario is considering that the final state has T=0, so any option where the final state's T is not 0 would be invalid. Wait, but the options give the NN final state's term symbol. Since T is part of the isospin, the term symbol's T must be 0. Wait, but in the term symbol, the isospin is not part of the term symbol notation. The term symbol (2S+1)LJ refers to spin and orbital angular momentum, not isospin. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the given options must have final NN states with T=0. Wait, but the T value isn't part of the term symbol given. The term symbol's 2S+1 is spin, not isospin. So the isospin T is a separate quantum number. So in each option, the final NN state must have T=0, but the term symbol (which includes spin) must also satisfy the Pauli condition which relates T, S, and L. \n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, this requires S + L must be odd. \n\nSo in option D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 violates the condition. Therefore, the final NN state in D cannot have T=0. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, option D's NN state would have T=1, which contradicts the given condition. So D is invalid. \n\nSo now I have two options, A and D, that are invalid. But the options are A-D, and the problem states \"which is not permitted\". The question must have only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the term symbol of option D again. The final NN term is 3P0. The 2S+1 is 3 \u21d2 S=1. The problem requires that T(NN)=0. The relation between isospin and spin here? The Pauli condition given is T = S + L +1 mod2. Since T must be 0, then S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 T would be 1 mod2 \u21d2 T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So the final state in D cannot have T=0. Therefore, D is invalid. \n\nBut the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the question is about scenarios where the final state is supposed to have T=0, so any option where the NN final state's T is not 0 is invalid. Thus, D is invalid. \n\nMeanwhile, option A's final state has a term symbol that's impossible (7D1 \u21d2 S=3 impossible), so that's invalid regardless of other factors. \n\nSo the question is asking which is not permitted, so both A and D are invalid. But the options probably have only one correct answer, so maybe I made an error in one of them.\n\nWait the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So in each option, the final NN state's T is 0. But in D, according to the Pauli condition, the T would have to be 1, so that can't be. So D is invalid. \n\nThe question is which of the options is not permitted. So both A and D are invalid. But the options are A to D, so perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbols?\n\nWait let me recheck the term symbols for each option again:\n\nOption A: 7D1. Since two nucleons have spin S=0 or 1, so 2S+1 can only be 1 or 3. So 7 is impossible. Thus, the final NN state in A cannot exist, so that option is invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0. Here, 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. So that's okay. The term is valid. The problem is that the Pauli condition isn't met, so the final state can't have T=0. Therefore, the scenario described in D can't happen because the final state would require T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So D is invalid.\n\nSo the question is asking which is not permitted. Both A and D are invalid. But the options are A-D. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the question is about the possible transitions where the final NN has T=0. So the options must have final NN states with T=0. \n\nIn option A, the final NN state's term symbol is impossible (due to S=3), so it can't exist. So that transition isn't permitted. \n\nIn option D, the final NN state's term symbol is possible (3P0 with S=1, L=1), but according to the Pauli condition, T would have to be 1. Since the problem states T=0, this transition would require the final state to have T=0, which isn't possible. So the transition in D is invalid because the final state can't have T=0 with those S and L. \n\nTherefore, both A and D are invalid. But the options don't allow for two answers. Maybe I made a mistake in one of them.\n\nWait the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the question is asking which of the given options (each of which specifies a final NN state and an emitted particle's partial wave) is not allowed. So the answer must be one of them. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition for option D. Let me recalculate the Pauli condition:\n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nFor D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 1+1 +1 =3 mod2 =1 \u21d2 T(NN)=1. But the problem requires T(NN)=0. So D's final state cannot have T=0. Therefore, D is invalid. \n\nSimilarly, A's final state can't exist (term symbol impossible). So both are invalid. \n\nBut looking at the options again, the question might have a trick. Let me check the angular momentum conservation for option D again. \n\nThe initial J is 0. The final J_NN is 0 (from the term symbol 3P0's J=0). The emitted particle has l_X =0 (s state). So the total angular momentum is 0 +0 =0. So that's okay. \n\nBut the problem says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the issue with D is that the Pauli condition isn't met, making the final NN state impossible to have T=0. So the transition described in D is invalid because the final NN's T would be 1, not 0. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid. But since the options are single choice, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the problem's exact wording again: \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". The question is about the partial waves (the emitted particle's l) that are not permitted given that the final NN has T=0. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we have to see if the final NN state can have T=0, and if the angular momentum and parity are conserved. \n\nIn option A: The term symbol is impossible, so that's invalid. \n\nIn option D: The final NN can't have T=0, so that's invalid. \n\nBut the options probably have only one correct answer. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe question is from an exam, likely only one answer is correct. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition for option D. Let me recheck:\n\nThe condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nGiven T=0, so 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nIn D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2, which mod2 is 0 \u21d2 not equal to 1. So violates. \n\nThus D is invalid. \n\nBut then why is the question giving four options with two invalid? That can't be. Maybe the error is elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term symbol for D is allowed but the Pauli condition is satisfied differently. Wait, maybe the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait maybe I misapplied the equation. The equation says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait, the equation is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. So if T(NN)=0, then 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L must be odd. \n\nIn D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2 (even) \u21d2 violates. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nIn A, the term is impossible, so invalid. \n\nSo the problem must have an error, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the angular momentum conservation in option A is also violated? Let me check.\n\nOption A: 7D1 (impossible term), but assuming it's valid, let's see:\n\nThe final NN state would have J=1 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l is p (l=1). \n\nTotal angular momentum must be 0. So J_NN =1 and l_X=1. Their vector sum can be 0 (since 1+1 can give 0 via opposite directions). So that's okay. \n\nBut the term symbol is impossible, so A is invalid. \n\nThe question might be designed so that the answer is A and D, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity calculation for one of them. \n\nLet me recheck the parity for D:\n\nParity: L_NN is 1 (P), l_X is 0 (s). \n\nThe initial parity is +1. \n\nFinal parity: (-1)^L_NN * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) (intrinsic parity of X) ]\n\nSo (-1)^1 * [ (-1)^0 * (-1) ] = (-1) * (1 * -1) = (-1)*(-1)=+1. Which matches the initial parity. So parity is okay. \n\nPauli condition is the issue here. \n\nThus, between A and D, both are invalid. \n\nWait the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for the options, the question is asking which transition is not allowed when the final NN has T=0. \n\nSo for D, the final NN can't have T=0 with the given S and L, so the transition is invalid. \n\nFor A, the final NN can't exist (term symbol impossible), so the transition is invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are A-D, so maybe the correct answer is A because it's impossible regardless of other factors. \n\nThe question says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the problem may consider that the term symbol being impossible makes A invalid, whereas D's issue is with the Pauli condition. \n\nSince the question requires using the Pauli condition given (T = S + L +1 mod2), which is a condition for the final state to have T=0, D's scenario violates that condition, so it can't occur. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid, but the options likely have only one correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake in another option. \n\nLooking at option C: 3D3 + f. \n\nThe Pauli condition: S=1, L=2. Sum is 3 (odd), so T=0 is okay. \n\nParity: L_NN (2) + l_X (3) =5 (odd). So parity okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN=3, l_X=3. Their sum can be 0 (3-3=0). So okay. \n\nSo C is okay. \n\nOption B: 3S1 + p. \n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u21d2 1+0=1 (odd). T=0 okay. \n\nParity: L_NN=0 + l_X=1 \u21d2 1 (odd). So parity okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J=1 and l=1 can give 0. \n\nSo B is okay. \n\nThus, the invalid options are A and D. \n\nSince the problem is likely expecting one answer, perhaps the question's condition that the final NN has T=0 is already given, so we must choose the one that violates the Pauli condition (D) and the term symbol (A). \n\nBut since the question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\", perhaps the answer is D because it violates the Pauli condition, but the term symbol in A is impossible. \n\nWait the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the problem states that the final NN has T=0, so the options must have final NN states that can have T=0. \n\nThus, option D's final NN can't have T=0 (since T would be 1), so it's invalid. \n\nOption A's final NN can't exist (term symbol invalid), so also invalid. \n\nBut the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave is the emitted particle's l. \n\nThe question might consider that the term symbol being impossible (A) is the answer because the NN can't be in that state. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that D is the answer because even though the final NN term is possible, the Pauli condition isn't met, so the T can't be 0. \n\nSince both A and D are invalid, but the options don't allow that, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol for D. Let me check again:\n\nThe term symbol for D is 3P0. The J is 0. \n\nThe possible J values for S=1 and L=1 are J=0,1,2. So J=0 is allowed. \n\nThus, the term is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be both A and D. But since this is a single-answer question, perhaps the question expects A as the answer because the term symbol is impossible, making it automatically invalid. \n\nThe problem says \"partial waves is not permitted\". The partial wave is the emitted particle's l. So for option A, even if the term is impossible, the question is about the partial wave (p in this case) being allowed or not. \n\nWait no, the question is asking which of the given options (each consisting of a transition to a certain NN state and emitting a certain l) is not permitted. \n\nSince option A's final NN state can't exist, that entire transition is invalid. \n\nSimilarly, D's transition is invalid because the final NN can't have T=0. \n\nThus, both are invalid. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is A because it's a term symbol impossibility, which is a more fundamental issue. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo and D is the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the Pauli condition for option D. Let me check once again:\n\nThe equation: T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nGiven T=0, so 0 = (S + L) +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L must be 1 mod2. \n\nIn D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2 \u21d2 2 mod2 is 0 \u21d2 0+1 mod2? No, the equation is S+L+1 mod2 = T. \n\nWait, no. The equation is T = (S + L +1) mod2. \n\nSo for D: (1+1+1) mod2 = 3 mod2 =1. So T=1, but the problem says T=0. Thus, invalid. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nTherefore, since the options have both A and D as invalid, but the question is from an exam, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, looking back to the original problem statement: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\"\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is written as T = S + L + 1 mod2. \n\nThus, when T is 0, S + L +1 must be even \u21d2 S + L is odd. \n\nIn D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 violates. \n\nIn A, since the term is impossible, T can't be 0 there either. \n\nThus, the answer is both A and D. But since the options don't allow that, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait the problem might have a different interpretation. The lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X (the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l). \n\nThe question asks which partial wave (i.e., which l) is not permitted. \n\nIn option A, the partial wave is p (l=1). \n\nBut since the final NN state in A can't exist (term symbol invalid), the transition is impossible, so the partial wave p in this case is not permitted. \n\nSimilarly, in D, the partial wave is s (l=0), but the transition is impossible because the final NN can't have T=0. So the partial wave s in this case is not permitted. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. \n\nHowever, since the options are single-answer, perhaps the answer is A because the term symbol is impossible, making it the most obvious invalid choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the parity for option D. Let me check again:\n\nParity conservation requires that the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity equals the initial parity (+1). \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^L_NN = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L=1 for P state). \n\nThe X's parity is its intrinsic parity (-1) multiplied by (-1)^l_X. \n\nX's l is s (l=0), so (-1)^0=1. So X's parity contribution is (-1) * 1 = -1. \n\nTotal final parity: (-1) * (-1) = +1, which matches. \n\nSo parity is okay. \n\nThus, D's issue is solely the Pauli condition. \n\nSince the question requires using the Pauli condition given, D is invalid. \n\nBut then why is A also invalid? \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So if the final NN can't exist (like in A), then that option is invalid. \n\nThe problem is likely expecting the answer to be A because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Pauli condition is applied to the initial and final states? Wait no, the condition is for the final NN state. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck between A and D. \n\nWait, looking at the options again: \n\nThe question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nThe partial wave refers to the emitted particle's l (given by the lowercase letter). \n\nSo, for option A, even if the final NN term is impossible, the partial wave p is still part of the transition. Since the transition is impossible, the partial wave p in this case is not permitted. \n\nSimilarly, D's transition is impossible because of the Pauli condition, so the partial wave s is not permitted. \n\nThus, both are invalid. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with single answer, I'll have to choose based on the most obvious mistake. \n\nThe term symbol in A is impossible (7D1), so that's a clear no-go. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nIf T is 0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L = -1 mod2 \u21d2 1 mod2. \n\nThus, S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 2 \u21d2 even \u21d2 invalid. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nBut if the question expects only one answer, perhaps the correct answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that in option D, even though the Pauli condition isn't met, the question's condition is given (the final has T=0), so we must assume that the transition is possible and find which violates parity or angular momentum. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So perhaps we are to assume that the final state has T=0, and check if the other conditions are met. \n\nIn that case, for option D, even though the Pauli condition would require T=1, but the problem says T=0, so perhaps we have to proceed under that assumption and see if other conditions are met. \n\nWait no, the Pauli condition is a requirement for the final state. If the final state has T=0, then the Pauli condition must be satisfied. So if the Pauli condition isn't satisfied, that transition can't occur. \n\nThus, the answer must be D. \n\nBut then why is A also invalid? \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the term symbol for option A. Let me recheck:\n\n7D1 would mean 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. But two nucleons can have isospin T=0 or 1, but the spin S can be 0 or 1. So S=3 is impossible. Therefore, the final NN state in A cannot exist, so the transition is invalid. \n\nTherefore, A is invalid. \n\nThus, the question has two answers, but since it's multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's Pauli condition equation is different. Let me read again: \n\n\"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nSo for A's final state (if it existed), S would be (from 7D1: 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3), L=2 (D). \n\nThen T would be 3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u21d2 T=0. \n\nAh! Wait! \n\nWait, if the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2, then for option A's impossible final state:\n\nIf S=3 and L=2 (for D state), then T would be 3+2+1 =6 mod2=0. So T=0. \n\nBut the problem states that the final state has T=0, so that would satisfy it. \n\nHowever, the issue is that S=3 is impossible for two nucleons. \n\nSo the equation allows T=0 for that impossible state, but the spin S=3 is impossible, making the term symbol invalid. \n\nThus, option A is invalid because the final state can't exist (due to spin). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, because the final state's term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe Pauli condition for option A, assuming the term symbol were valid, would give T=0, but since the term is impossible, the transition is invalid. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The question is about which of the given partial waves isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics, angular momentum conservation, and parity. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and there's that equation involving T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics. For two nucleons, each has isospin 1/2. The total isospin T can be 0 or 1. Since the final state has T(NN) = 0, that means the two nucleons are in a singlet state. The given condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 must hold. Since T is 0, substituting gives 0 \u2261 S + L + 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L must be odd. So S(NN) + L(NN) must be an odd integer.\n\nNow, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The term symbol is 2S+1^L_J. Here, 1S0 means that the spin S is 0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0), the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since the letter is S, which corresponds to L=0), and the total angular momentum J is 0 (since the subscript is 0). So initial state has S_initial = 0, L_initial = 0, J_initial = 0.\n\nThe particle X is emitted, so we have an initial NN system plus X. Since it's a decay, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state is the NN system plus the particle X. The total angular momentum of the final state must also be 0. The NN system has some angular momentum J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (since their spins and orbital angular momentum combine), and the particle X has angular momentum L_X (since the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X, like p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.). Wait, actually, the angular momentum of X is its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system? Or is it the particle's own spin?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify. The term in the options like \"7D1 + p\" probably refers to the final NN state's term symbol (like 7D1 would be 2S+1 =7? Wait, no, D would be L=2, so maybe the first number is 2S+1, then L, then J. So 7D1 would mean S=3 (since 2*3+1=7?), L=2 (D), J=1? Wait, that can't be right because for a two-nucleon system, the maximum spin would be 1 (since each has spin 1/2, so total S could be 0 or 1). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term symbols here. Let me think again. For two nucleons, each has spin 1/2. The total spin S can be 0 or 1. So the 2S+1 would be either 1 or 3. So a term symbol like 3D3 would have 2S+1=3, so S=1, L=2 (since D is L=2), and J = L + S? Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of L and S, but they can couple in different ways. Wait, J can be |L-S| to L+S in integer steps. Hmm, but the term symbol's J is the total angular momentum of the NN system. So for example, if the NN system has L=2 (D) and S=1, then J could be 1, 2, or 3. But the term symbol would have J written as the subscript. So in the option C, 3D3 would have J=3, which would require L=2 and S=1, so J = L + S? Well, 2 +1 =3, so that's possible.\n\nBut maybe I should not get bogged down here yet. Let's get back to the problem.\n\nThe key points to check for each option are:\n\n1. Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum before (0) must equal the total after. The final state's total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and the particle X's angular momentum (which would be its orbital angular momentum, since its spin is part of its own properties but here maybe considered as part of the emitted particle's state? Wait, maybe the particle X has some angular momentum, but when considering the emission, the total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The NN system's angular momentum plus the emitted particle's angular momentum (its orbital angular momentum, since the particle's spin is fixed?) must add up to the initial 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the particle X has its own angular momentum, which includes both spin and orbital angular momentum. But I think in these types of problems, when you have a two-body decay like NN \u2192 NN + X, the angular momentum conservation requires that the total angular momentum of the initial state (0) equals the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's total angular momentum (J_X). But J_X is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum (l) and its spin (s). But the problem might be simplifying things, perhaps considering only the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle? Or maybe the problem is treating the emitted particle's angular momentum as its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN system?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the partial wave of the emitted particle (like p, s, f) corresponds to its orbital angular momentum l. So the angular momentum of the emitted particle X is its orbital angular momentum l_X. So the total angular momentum conservation would require that J_NN + l_X must be 0? But that might not be exactly right. Wait, no, because when you have a two-body decay, the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial J is 0. The final state has the NN system with J_NN and the emitted particle with J_X. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of J_NN and J_X. Since the initial is 0, the final must also be 0. Therefore, J_NN + J_X must combine to give 0. But the only way that can happen is if J_NN = J_X, and they are pointing in opposite directions. However, the magnitude must be equal, so J_NN must equal J_X. Wait, but the vector sum must be zero, so their magnitudes must be equal and their vectors opposite. Therefore, J_NN must equal J_X, and their vectors are opposite. But since angular momentum can only be integers or half-integers, but here we are dealing with nucleons, which have integer spins? Wait, nucleons have spin 1/2 each, so their total spin could be 0 or 1. Hmm, but the problem is about the NN system's angular momentum. The NN system's total angular momentum J_NN is L_NN + S_NN (but actually, it's the vector sum of their individual spins and orbital angular momenta). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angular momentum conservation is considered such that the total angular momentum of the NN plus the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum must be zero. Because the particle's spin is fixed, perhaps? Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the emitted particle's spin is part of its own properties, and the orbital angular momentum is the l_X given by the lowercase letter (p, s, f). So the total angular momentum of the system would require that the NN's J (which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ... )? Wait, no, the total angular momentum J_NN is the sum of their orbital angular momentum L_NN and their total spin S_NN. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum of the NN system is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN? Or is it the vector sum? The total angular momentum J_NN is the combination of L_NN (orbital) and S_NN (total spin of the two nucleons). So J_NN can range from |L_NN - S_NN| to L_NN + S_NN in integer steps. But the problem gives the term symbol for the final NN state, which includes J. So, for example, in option A, the final NN is 7D1. Wait, but 7 would imply S = 3, which is impossible for two nucleons (since each has spin 1/2, so their total spin can be only 0 or 1). So that term symbol must be incorrect. Wait a minute, this might be a key point. Let me check each option's term symbol for the NN state.\n\nWait, for two nucleons (each spin 1/2), their total spin S can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the 2S+1 term must be either 1 or 3. So any term symbol with a coefficient like 7 is impossible. So looking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p: The final NN state is 7D1. Since 2S+1=7 would require S=3, which can't be. So this term symbol is invalid. But maybe the options are correct, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the first number is not 2S+1? Wait, the problem says \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J)\". So yes, the first number is 2S+1, so 7 would require S=3, which is impossible. So that term symbol is impossible, so option A is not a permitted state. But the question says \"which is not permitted\", so maybe A is the answer? But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check all the options first.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p. The NN term is 3S1. So 2S+1=3 implies S=1, which is okay. The L is S (so L=0). Then J is 1. Since S=1 and L=0, J would be sqrt(S^2 + L^2 + ...) but actually, J can be L + S or |L - S| etc. Wait, since L is 0 and S is 1, then J can only be 1. So that's okay. So 3S1 is possible.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f. The term symbol is 3D3. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is D (L=2), and J=3. Since S=1 and L=2, the possible J values are 1+2=3, 1, and 3. So 3 is possible. So that's okay.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s. 3P0. 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is P (L=1), and J=0. Wait, S=1 and L=1. The possible J values are 0,1,2. So J=0 is allowed. So that term is okay.\n\nWait, so the only term symbol that's impossible is in option A (7D1), because 2S+1=7 would require S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, option A is invalid, so it's not permitted. But the question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\". Wait, but the problem also has other constraints. The question is which partial wave is not permitted, considering the conditions given, including parity and Pauli's statistics (the equation with T, S, L).\n\nWait, but maybe I should check all constraints for each option, even if the term symbol is valid. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each option, let's check the term symbol validity first. If the term symbol is impossible (like A's 7D1), then that's automatically invalid, so the answer is A. But maybe the question expects us to consider all constraints, including parity and the T(NN) equation.\n\nSo let's go through each option:\n\nStarting with Option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN term is 7D1. Since two nucleons can't have S=3, this term is impossible. So regardless of other factors, this is invalid. So A is the answer? But the question might have other options where the term is valid but other constraints are violated. Let me check the other options just to confirm.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nThe NN final state is 3S1. So S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1), L=0 (S state), and J=1. The parity conservation also needs to be considered. The parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. The parity of a state is (-1)^L. The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial is 0 \u21d2 parity is (+1)^0 = +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The total parity must be conserved. The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity (since parity is multiplicative). Wait, the total initial parity is the NN's parity (since it's the initial state). The final parity must equal that. So:\n\nInitial parity: (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nFinal parity must also be +1. The final parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X). The parity of the NN is (-1)^L_NN (since L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system). The parity of X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l_X, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (since the particle's orbital angular momentum contributes to its spatial parity). Wait, the particle X's parity is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^l_X. So total final parity is [(-1)^L_NN] * [intrinsic_parity_X * (-1)^l_X].\n\nThe initial parity must equal the final parity. So:\n\n(-1)^0 = [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ] (since intrinsic parity is -1).\n\nWait, let's write that out:\n\nInitial parity: +1 = Final parity: [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)^{intrinsic_parity?} ] Wait, intrinsic parity is a sign. So intrinsic parity of X is -1, so the term is (-1). So:\n\nTotal final parity: (parity_NN) * (parity_X) = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) ].\n\nSo set equal to +1:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = +1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = +1.\n\nThus:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 must be even \u21d2 L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, check if L_NN + l_X is odd.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check the angular momentum conservation.\n\nAlso, the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = 0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2 \u21d2 S_NN + L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo let's process each option step by step.\n\nStarting with Option A (even though I think it's invalid due to term symbol):\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nBut the term symbol 7D1 is impossible. So this is invalid, so regardless of other factors, the answer is A. But let's check others just in case.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p.\n\nFirst, check term symbol validity: 3S1 is okay (S=1, L=0, J=1). Good.\n\nNow, parity check.\n\nL_NN here is L=0 (since it's S state). The emitted particle's angular momentum (lowercase letter is p, which is l=1).\n\nSo L_NN + l_X = 0 +1=1, which is odd. So the parity equation requires L_NN + l_X +1 = 0+1+1=2, which is even, so (-1)^2 =1, so that's okay. Parity is conserved.\n\nAngular momentum conservation: The total angular momentum must be 0. The NN's J is 1 (from the term symbol's subscript). The emitted particle's angular momentum (J_X) is l_X (orbital) plus its spin? Wait, but the problem says the particle X's angular momentum state is denoted by the lowercase letter. Maybe the angular momentum of X is just l_X, so its orbital angular momentum. Then J_X is l_X. Since it's a particle, like a pion (assuming X is a pion?), but the problem doesn't specify. But for angular momentum conservation, the NN's J (which is 1) plus the particle's l (1) must combine to give total J=0. But J_NN (1) and l_X (1). The vector sum can be 0 only if they are opposite. Since 1 +1 can give 0, 1, or 2. Wait, J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. The total angular momentum can range from |1-1| to 1+1, i.e., 0 to 2. So 0 is possible. So that's okay. So angular momentum is conserved.\n\nNow check the Pauli condition: T(NN)=0 = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2.\n\nHere S_NN is 1 (since term symbol's 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1). L_NN is 0 (S state). So 1 +0 +1 mod2 = 2 mod2=0. Which matches T(NN)=0. So that's okay. So B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f.\n\nTerm symbol 3D3: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L=D (L=2), J=3. That's okay because S=1 and L=2, so J can be 3 (since 1+2=3). So term is valid.\n\nParity check:\n\nL_NN = 2 (D state). The emitted particle's l_X is f, which is l=3 (since f corresponds to L=3). So L_NN + l_X =2 +3=5, which is odd. So L_NN + l_X +1 =6, even \u21d2 parity okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol). The particle's l_X is 3. So total angular momentum must be 0. The sum of 3 (J_NN) and 3 (l_X) can give 0? The possible total J values are from |3-3| to 3+3, so 0 to 6. So 0 is possible. So angular momentum is conserved.\n\nPauli condition: S_NN=1, L_NN=2. S + L = 3, which mod2 is 1. So 1 mod2 =1, which equals T(NN)=0? Wait, no. Wait the condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. Wait the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, so 0 \u2261 1+2 +1 mod2 \u21d2 4 mod2=0. Which holds. Wait, 1 (S) + 2 (L) +1 =4, mod2 is 0. So yes, that's okay. So C is allowed.\n\nOption D: 3P0 + s.\n\nTerm symbol 3P0: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L=P (L=1). J=0. Since S=1 and L=1, J can be 0,1,2. So J=0 is okay. So term is valid.\n\nParity check: L_NN is 1 (P). The emitted particle's l_X is s (l=0). So L_NN + l_X =1+0=1, which is odd. So L_NN + l_X +1 =2 \u21d2 even. Parity okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0 (from the term's subscript). The emitted particle has l=0. The total angular momentum must be 0. So 0 +0 =0. That's okay.\n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=1. S + L =2 \u21d2 2 mod2=0. Then T(NN)=0 = 0 +1 mod2? Wait, the equation is T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2. So S + L +1 =1 +1 +1=3 mod2=1. But T(NN)=0, so 0 \u22611 mod2? That's a contradiction. Wait, hold on, this is a problem.\n\nWait, let's compute for option D:\n\nPauli condition: T(NN)=0 must equal S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nHere S=1, L=1. So 1 +1 +1 =3 mod2=1. But T(NN)=0. So 0 \u22611 mod2? That's not true. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this option is invalid?\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait the condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nGiven T(NN)=0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u21d2 since mod2, -1 \u22611. So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2, which is even. So that's not allowed. So the Pauli condition is violated here. \n\nOh! So option D also violates the Pauli condition. But then the question is asking which is not permitted, so maybe both A and D are invalid? But the options are A to D, and the question probably has only one correct answer. Wait, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait let's check again:\n\nFor option D, the final NN state has T(NN)=0, so according to the condition, S + L +1 mod2 must equal T(NN)=0. So S + L must be even? Wait:\n\nWait the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So T is 0 \u21d2 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 rearranged: S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u21d2 which is S + L \u22611 mod2 (since -1 mod2 is 1). So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1: sum is 2, even \u21d2 violates the condition. So D is invalid. But the term symbol was okay, and the parity and angular momentum also okay? Wait parity check was okay, angular momentum also okay, but the Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. \n\nSo now I have two options that might be invalid: A and D. But the question says \"which is not permitted\". Hmm. Let's see.\n\nWait, in option D, the term symbol is 3P0. The term is valid (since S=1, L=1, J=0). The parity and angular momentum are okay, but the Pauli condition is violated. So D is invalid. But the question might have only one correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in another step.\n\nLooking back, in option A, the term symbol 7D1 is impossible (since S=3 is impossible). So A is invalid. So why is D also invalid? The problem says \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted\", so maybe both A and D are invalid? But the options are single choice. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Pauli condition for D?\n\nWait let me recheck the Pauli condition for D:\n\nPauli condition: T(NN)=0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.\n\nSo S + L +1 must be even (since T=0). So S + L must be odd. \n\nIn D, S=1, L=1: sum is 2, which is even \u21d2 2+1=3 mod2=1, so T would be 1, not 0. Therefore, this is invalid. So D's final state has T=1, but the question states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. Wait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the question's scenario is considering that the final state has T=0, so any option where the final state's T is not 0 would be invalid. Wait, but the options give the NN final state's term symbol. Since T is part of the isospin, the term symbol's T must be 0. Wait, but in the term symbol, the isospin is not part of the term symbol notation. The term symbol (2S+1)LJ refers to spin and orbital angular momentum, not isospin. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the given options must have final NN states with T=0. Wait, but the T value isn't part of the term symbol given. The term symbol's 2S+1 is spin, not isospin. So the isospin T is a separate quantum number. So in each option, the final NN state must have T=0, but the term symbol (which includes spin) must also satisfy the Pauli condition which relates T, S, and L. \n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, this requires S + L must be odd. \n\nSo in option D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 violates the condition. Therefore, the final NN state in D cannot have T=0. Since the problem states that the final NN has T=0, option D's NN state would have T=1, which contradicts the given condition. So D is invalid. \n\nSo now I have two options, A and D, that are invalid. But the options are A-D, and the problem states \"which is not permitted\". The question must have only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the term symbol of option D again. The final NN term is 3P0. The 2S+1 is 3 \u21d2 S=1. The problem requires that T(NN)=0. The relation between isospin and spin here? The Pauli condition given is T = S + L +1 mod2. Since T must be 0, then S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 T would be 1 mod2 \u21d2 T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So the final state in D cannot have T=0. Therefore, D is invalid. \n\nBut the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the question is about scenarios where the final state is supposed to have T=0, so any option where the NN final state's T is not 0 is invalid. Thus, D is invalid. \n\nMeanwhile, option A's final state has a term symbol that's impossible (7D1 \u21d2 S=3 impossible), so that's invalid regardless of other factors. \n\nSo the question is asking which is not permitted, so both A and D are invalid. But the options probably have only one correct answer, so maybe I made an error in one of them.\n\nWait the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So in each option, the final NN state's T is 0. But in D, according to the Pauli condition, the T would have to be 1, so that can't be. So D is invalid. \n\nThe question is which of the options is not permitted. So both A and D are invalid. But the options are A to D, so perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbols?\n\nWait let me recheck the term symbols for each option again:\n\nOption A: 7D1. Since two nucleons have spin S=0 or 1, so 2S+1 can only be 1 or 3. So 7 is impossible. Thus, the final NN state in A cannot exist, so that option is invalid.\n\nOption D: 3P0. Here, 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. So that's okay. The term is valid. The problem is that the Pauli condition isn't met, so the final state can't have T=0. Therefore, the scenario described in D can't happen because the final state would require T=1, which contradicts the given T=0. So D is invalid.\n\nSo the question is asking which is not permitted. Both A and D are invalid. But the options are A-D. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the question is about the possible transitions where the final NN has T=0. So the options must have final NN states with T=0. \n\nIn option A, the final NN state's term symbol is impossible (due to S=3), so it can't exist. So that transition isn't permitted. \n\nIn option D, the final NN state's term symbol is possible (3P0 with S=1, L=1), but according to the Pauli condition, T would have to be 1. Since the problem states T=0, this transition would require the final state to have T=0, which isn't possible. So the transition in D is invalid because the final state can't have T=0 with those S and L. \n\nTherefore, both A and D are invalid. But the options don't allow for two answers. Maybe I made a mistake in one of them.\n\nWait the problem says \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". So the question is asking which of the given options (each of which specifies a final NN state and an emitted particle's partial wave) is not allowed. So the answer must be one of them. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition for option D. Let me recalculate the Pauli condition:\n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nFor D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 1+1 +1 =3 mod2 =1 \u21d2 T(NN)=1. But the problem requires T(NN)=0. So D's final state cannot have T=0. Therefore, D is invalid. \n\nSimilarly, A's final state can't exist (term symbol impossible). So both are invalid. \n\nBut looking at the options again, the question might have a trick. Let me check the angular momentum conservation for option D again. \n\nThe initial J is 0. The final J_NN is 0 (from the term symbol 3P0's J=0). The emitted particle has l_X =0 (s state). So the total angular momentum is 0 +0 =0. So that's okay. \n\nBut the problem says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the issue with D is that the Pauli condition isn't met, making the final NN state impossible to have T=0. So the transition described in D is invalid because the final NN's T would be 1, not 0. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid. But since the options are single choice, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the problem's exact wording again: \"the final NN state has T(NN) = 0\". The question is about the partial waves (the emitted particle's l) that are not permitted given that the final NN has T=0. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we have to see if the final NN state can have T=0, and if the angular momentum and parity are conserved. \n\nIn option A: The term symbol is impossible, so that's invalid. \n\nIn option D: The final NN can't have T=0, so that's invalid. \n\nBut the options probably have only one correct answer. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe question is from an exam, likely only one answer is correct. \n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition for option D. Let me recheck:\n\nThe condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.\n\nGiven T=0, so 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L \u22611 mod2.\n\nIn D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2, which mod2 is 0 \u21d2 not equal to 1. So violates. \n\nThus D is invalid. \n\nBut then why is the question giving four options with two invalid? That can't be. Maybe the error is elsewhere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term symbol for D is allowed but the Pauli condition is satisfied differently. Wait, maybe the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait maybe I misapplied the equation. The equation says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait, the equation is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. So if T(NN)=0, then 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L must be odd. \n\nIn D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2 (even) \u21d2 violates. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nIn A, the term is impossible, so invalid. \n\nSo the problem must have an error, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the angular momentum conservation in option A is also violated? Let me check.\n\nOption A: 7D1 (impossible term), but assuming it's valid, let's see:\n\nThe final NN state would have J=1 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l is p (l=1). \n\nTotal angular momentum must be 0. So J_NN =1 and l_X=1. Their vector sum can be 0 (since 1+1 can give 0 via opposite directions). So that's okay. \n\nBut the term symbol is impossible, so A is invalid. \n\nThe question might be designed so that the answer is A and D, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity calculation for one of them. \n\nLet me recheck the parity for D:\n\nParity: L_NN is 1 (P), l_X is 0 (s). \n\nThe initial parity is +1. \n\nFinal parity: (-1)^L_NN * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) (intrinsic parity of X) ]\n\nSo (-1)^1 * [ (-1)^0 * (-1) ] = (-1) * (1 * -1) = (-1)*(-1)=+1. Which matches the initial parity. So parity is okay. \n\nPauli condition is the issue here. \n\nThus, between A and D, both are invalid. \n\nWait the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So for the options, the question is asking which transition is not allowed when the final NN has T=0. \n\nSo for D, the final NN can't have T=0 with the given S and L, so the transition is invalid. \n\nFor A, the final NN can't exist (term symbol impossible), so the transition is invalid. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. But the options are A-D, so maybe the correct answer is A because it's impossible regardless of other factors. \n\nThe question says \"partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X\". So the problem may consider that the term symbol being impossible makes A invalid, whereas D's issue is with the Pauli condition. \n\nSince the question requires using the Pauli condition given (T = S + L +1 mod2), which is a condition for the final state to have T=0, D's scenario violates that condition, so it can't occur. \n\nSo both A and D are invalid, but the options likely have only one correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake in another option. \n\nLooking at option C: 3D3 + f. \n\nThe Pauli condition: S=1, L=2. Sum is 3 (odd), so T=0 is okay. \n\nParity: L_NN (2) + l_X (3) =5 (odd). So parity okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN=3, l_X=3. Their sum can be 0 (3-3=0). So okay. \n\nSo C is okay. \n\nOption B: 3S1 + p. \n\nPauli condition: S=1, L=0 \u21d2 1+0=1 (odd). T=0 okay. \n\nParity: L_NN=0 + l_X=1 \u21d2 1 (odd). So parity okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J=1 and l=1 can give 0. \n\nSo B is okay. \n\nThus, the invalid options are A and D. \n\nSince the problem is likely expecting one answer, perhaps the question's condition that the final NN has T=0 is already given, so we must choose the one that violates the Pauli condition (D) and the term symbol (A). \n\nBut since the question says \"make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\", perhaps the answer is D because it violates the Pauli condition, but the term symbol in A is impossible. \n\nWait the question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the problem states that the final NN has T=0, so the options must have final NN states that can have T=0. \n\nThus, option D's final NN can't have T=0 (since T would be 1), so it's invalid. \n\nOption A's final NN can't exist (term symbol invalid), so also invalid. \n\nBut the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave is the emitted particle's l. \n\nThe question might consider that the term symbol being impossible (A) is the answer because the NN can't be in that state. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that D is the answer because even though the final NN term is possible, the Pauli condition isn't met, so the T can't be 0. \n\nSince both A and D are invalid, but the options don't allow that, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbol for D. Let me check again:\n\nThe term symbol for D is 3P0. The J is 0. \n\nThe possible J values for S=1 and L=1 are J=0,1,2. So J=0 is allowed. \n\nThus, the term is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be both A and D. But since this is a single-answer question, perhaps the question expects A as the answer because the term symbol is impossible, making it automatically invalid. \n\nThe problem says \"partial waves is not permitted\". The partial wave is the emitted particle's l. So for option A, even if the term is impossible, the question is about the partial wave (p in this case) being allowed or not. \n\nWait no, the question is asking which of the given options (each consisting of a transition to a certain NN state and emitting a certain l) is not permitted. \n\nSince option A's final NN state can't exist, that entire transition is invalid. \n\nSimilarly, D's transition is invalid because the final NN can't have T=0. \n\nThus, both are invalid. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is A because it's a term symbol impossibility, which is a more fundamental issue. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo and D is the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the Pauli condition for option D. Let me check once again:\n\nThe equation: T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nGiven T=0, so 0 = (S + L) +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L must be 1 mod2. \n\nIn D, S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is 2 \u21d2 2 mod2 is 0 \u21d2 0+1 mod2? No, the equation is S+L+1 mod2 = T. \n\nWait, no. The equation is T = (S + L +1) mod2. \n\nSo for D: (1+1+1) mod2 = 3 mod2 =1. So T=1, but the problem says T=0. Thus, invalid. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nTherefore, since the options have both A and D as invalid, but the question is from an exam, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, looking back to the original problem statement: \"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\"\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is written as T = S + L + 1 mod2. \n\nThus, when T is 0, S + L +1 must be even \u21d2 S + L is odd. \n\nIn D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 sum is even \u21d2 violates. \n\nIn A, since the term is impossible, T can't be 0 there either. \n\nThus, the answer is both A and D. But since the options don't allow that, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait the problem might have a different interpretation. The lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X (the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l). \n\nThe question asks which partial wave (i.e., which l) is not permitted. \n\nIn option A, the partial wave is p (l=1). \n\nBut since the final NN state in A can't exist (term symbol invalid), the transition is impossible, so the partial wave p in this case is not permitted. \n\nSimilarly, in D, the partial wave is s (l=0), but the transition is impossible because the final NN can't have T=0. So the partial wave s in this case is not permitted. \n\nThus, both A and D are invalid. \n\nHowever, since the options are single-answer, perhaps the answer is A because the term symbol is impossible, making it the most obvious invalid choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the parity for option D. Let me check again:\n\nParity conservation requires that the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity equals the initial parity (+1). \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^L_NN = (-1)^1 = -1 (since L=1 for P state). \n\nThe X's parity is its intrinsic parity (-1) multiplied by (-1)^l_X. \n\nX's l is s (l=0), so (-1)^0=1. So X's parity contribution is (-1) * 1 = -1. \n\nTotal final parity: (-1) * (-1) = +1, which matches. \n\nSo parity is okay. \n\nThus, D's issue is solely the Pauli condition. \n\nSince the question requires using the Pauli condition given, D is invalid. \n\nBut then why is A also invalid? \n\nThe question says \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So if the final NN can't exist (like in A), then that option is invalid. \n\nThe problem is likely expecting the answer to be A because the term symbol is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Pauli condition is applied to the initial and final states? Wait no, the condition is for the final NN state. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck between A and D. \n\nWait, looking at the options again: \n\nThe question says \"which of the following partial waves is not permitted\". \n\nThe partial wave refers to the emitted particle's l (given by the lowercase letter). \n\nSo, for option A, even if the final NN term is impossible, the partial wave p is still part of the transition. Since the transition is impossible, the partial wave p in this case is not permitted. \n\nSimilarly, D's transition is impossible because of the Pauli condition, so the partial wave s is not permitted. \n\nThus, both are invalid. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with single answer, I'll have to choose based on the most obvious mistake. \n\nThe term symbol in A is impossible (7D1), so that's a clear no-go. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nThe equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nIf T is 0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u21d2 S + L = -1 mod2 \u21d2 1 mod2. \n\nThus, S + L must be odd. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u21d2 2 \u21d2 even \u21d2 invalid. \n\nSo D is invalid. \n\nBut if the question expects only one answer, perhaps the correct answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that in option D, even though the Pauli condition isn't met, the question's condition is given (the final has T=0), so we must assume that the transition is possible and find which violates parity or angular momentum. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So perhaps we are to assume that the final state has T=0, and check if the other conditions are met. \n\nIn that case, for option D, even though the Pauli condition would require T=1, but the problem says T=0, so perhaps we have to proceed under that assumption and see if other conditions are met. \n\nWait no, the Pauli condition is a requirement for the final state. If the final state has T=0, then the Pauli condition must be satisfied. So if the Pauli condition isn't satisfied, that transition can't occur. \n\nThus, the answer must be D. \n\nBut then why is A also invalid? \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the term symbol for option A. Let me recheck:\n\n7D1 would mean 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. But two nucleons can have isospin T=0 or 1, but the spin S can be 0 or 1. So S=3 is impossible. Therefore, the final NN state in A cannot exist, so the transition is invalid. \n\nTherefore, A is invalid. \n\nThus, the question has two answers, but since it's multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's Pauli condition equation is different. Let me read again: \n\n\"Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nSo for A's final state (if it existed), S would be (from 7D1: 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3), L=2 (D). \n\nThen T would be 3+2+1=6 mod2=0 \u21d2 T=0. \n\nAh! Wait! \n\nWait, if the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2, then for option A's impossible final state:\n\nIf S=3 and L=2 (for D state), then T would be 3+2+1 =6 mod2=0. So T=0. \n\nBut the problem states that the final state has T=0, so that would satisfy it. \n\nHowever, the issue is that S=3 is impossible for two nucleons. \n\nSo the equation allows T=0 for that impossible state, but the spin S=3 is impossible, making the term symbol invalid. \n\nThus, option A is invalid because the final state can't exist (due to spin). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, because the final state's term symbol is impossible. \n\nThe Pauli condition for option A, assuming the term symbol were valid, would give T=0, but since the term is impossible, the transition is invalid. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze each option based on term symbol validity, parity conservation, angular momentum conservation, and the Pauli statistics condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\mod 2 \\).\n\n**Option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p**  \n- **Term Symbol Validity**: The final NN term \\( 7D1 \\) implies \\( 2S + 1 = 7 \\), requiring \\( S = 3 \\).

Parity conservation holds as \\( (-1)^{0 + 1 + 1} = +1 \\).  \n- **Angular Momentum**: \\( J_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l_X = 1 \\). Total \\( J = 0 \\) is achievable.  \n- **Pauli Condition**: \\( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (odd), satisfying \\( T = 0 \\).  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n**Option C: 1S0 \u2192 3D3 + f**  \n- **Term Symbol Validity**: \\( 3D3 \\) has \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), and \\( J = 3 \\), which is valid.  \n- **Parity**: \\( L_{NN} = 2 \\), \\( l_X = 3 \\).

Total \\( J = 0 \\) is achievable.  \n- **Pauli Condition**: \\( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \\) (odd), satisfying \\( T = 0 \\).  \n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n**Option D: 1S0 \u2192 3P0 + s**  \n- **Term Symbol Validity**: \\( 3P0 \\) has \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 1 \\), and \\( J = 0 \\), which is valid.  \n- **Parity**: \\( L_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l_X = 0 \\). Parity conservation holds as \\( (-1)^{1 + 0 + 1} = +1 \\).  \n- **Angular Momentum**: \\( J_{NN} = 0 \\), \\( l_X = 0 \\). Total \\( J = 0 \\).  \n- **Pauli Condition**: \\( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (even), which contradicts \\( T = 0 \\) (requires odd).  \n- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to violating the Pauli condition.\n\n**Final Determination**:  \nOption A is invalid due to an impossible term symbol, and Option D is invalid due to violating the Pauli condition. However, since the question asks for the partial wave (emitted particle's \\( l \\)) not permitted, the most straightforward invalidity is the impossible term symbol in **A**, making it the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the given options is not allowed based on the conditions given. The question is about the decay of a NN system in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition given by T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, where the final state has T(NN) = 0. \n\nFirst, let me recall what each part of the term symbol means. The initial state is 1S0, so that's (2S+1)L_J. Here, the spin S for the initial state must be such that 2S+1 = 1, so S = 0. The orbital angular momentum L is S (as per the letter S), which corresponds to L=0. The total angular momentum J is the last number, which is 0 here. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, when the NN system emits particle X, the final state must conserve angular momentum. So the total angular momentum of the initial system (0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final NN system plus the angular momentum of particle X. But since we are dealing with partial waves, maybe I need to look at the orbital angular momentum between the NN pair and the emitted particle. Wait, actually, the term symbols for the transitions probably involve the final NN state's L and S, and the emitted particle's angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the angular momentum conservation between the initial and final states.\n\nThe problem mentions that the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The \"p\" here probably refers to the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum? Wait, but maybe the particle X's spin and orbital angular momentum? Or maybe the emitted particle's angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. Let me think. The notation might be that the final NN state is in a certain partial wave (like 7D1) and the emitted particle X has an orbital angular momentum denoted by the letter (like s, p, d, f etc). Wait, but the particle X itself has a spin. Since the problem mentions that X has intrinsic parity -1. Parity is important here.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is calculated as (-1)^L_initial. Since the initial state is S (L=0), so parity is (+1). The final state's parity must be equal to the initial parity multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle's state. The parity of the emitted particle's state would involve the orbital angular momentum (l) of X and its intrinsic parity. The formula for the parity of the emitted particle is (-1)^l * intrinsic parity. Since intrinsic parity of X is -1, the total parity of the X's contribution is (-1)^l * (-1). \n\nThe final NN system's parity is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the total parity conservation requires that:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final(NN) * Parity_X.\n\nSo:\n\n(+1) = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ]\n\nBecause the NN system's parity is (-1)^L_NN and the X's parity is (-1)^l_X * (-1). \n\nSo rearranged:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l_X * (-1) = +1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = +1 \n\nTherefore:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 must be even, so L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me write the equation:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X\n\nSo 1 = [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ]\n\nSo 1 = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)^1 \n\nWhich can be written as 1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1}\n\nThus, exponent must be even:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 their sum must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nNext, the Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is given as 0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 their sum is odd.\n\nAlso, angular momentum conservation. The initial state has total angular momentum J_initial = 0. The final state must have the NN's total angular momentum J_NN plus the emitted particle's angular momentum l_X (since the particle's spin is part of its own angular momentum, but maybe here the problem treats the emitted particle's angular momentum as l_X? Hmm, perhaps the total angular momentum of the NN and X must add up to zero. Wait, the problem says the NN system is in a certain state and emits X. The total angular momentum before (0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum (including its spin and orbital angular momentum). This might be more complicated, but perhaps in the context of partial waves, the angular momentum of the emitted particle is considered as its orbital angular momentum l_X, and its spin is fixed? Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the emitted particle's spin is zero, or maybe it's part of the term symbol?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol for the emitted particle's state is given by the lowercase letter, which is its orbital angular momentum. For instance, in option A, the emitted particle is a \"p\" which is l=1. Then the emitted particle's spin might be considered as part of its own properties but not part of the angular momentum being conserved here? Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the partial wave of the emitted particle, which is its orbital angular momentum l_X. The total angular momentum conservation would require that the initial angular momentum (0) is equal to the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l_X). But since they are vectors, their magnitudes must satisfy triangle inequalities, but since the initial is 0, J_NN and l_X must add up such that their vector sum can be zero. That would require that J_NN = l_X, and their vectors are opposite. But maybe for the purposes of this question, we can just consider that the total angular momentum must be conserved, so the magnitudes must satisfy J_NN + l_X \u2265 0 (which they always do), but since the total is zero, perhaps J_NN must equal l_X and their directions must be opposite. But since we are dealing with just the quantum numbers here, maybe the key is that J_NN must be equal to l_X? Because if the total is zero, then the only way is if J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. But in terms of the possible values, the magnitude of J_NN must be equal to l_X. So J_NN must equal l_X. Therefore, the J_NN must equal l_X. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the emitted particle's angular momentum (its l) plus the NN's angular momentum must add to zero. But since angular momentum is a vector, the only way the total can be zero is if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But their magnitudes must satisfy |J_NN - l_X| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l_X, so the only possibility is J_NN = l_X. Therefore, J_NN must equal l_X. So that's a key point.\n\nSo for each option, I need to check:\n\n1. The NN's final state has T(NN) = 0. The Pauli condition requires that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd (since T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2).\n\n2. The parity condition requires that L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\n3. Angular momentum conservation requires that J_NN = l_X (since the total must be zero, so their magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite, so J_NN must equal l_X).\n\nAdditionally, the term symbol for the NN final state gives us their S and L. Let me parse each option:\n\nLet's go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So 7D1: 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S = 3. The L is D (L=2), and J=1. \n\nWait, but J must be L + S or something? Wait, J can be |L - S|, ..., L + S. So for L=2 and S=3, possible J values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here J is 1. That's possible, but okay.\n\nFirst, check the Pauli condition. T(NN) =0. So according to the given condition T = S + L +1 mod2. Here S=3, L=2. 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1. Then T = 1 mod2? But the problem states that T(NN)=0. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So 0 \u2261 3 + 2 +1 mod2 \u2192 6 mod2 =0. Wait, 3+2 is 5, plus 1 is 6. 6 mod2 is 0. So that's okay. So that's allowed. So the Pauli condition is satisfied here.\n\nNext, parity condition: L_NN (which is 2 for D) plus l_X (the emitted particle's l, which here is p (l=1)). So L_NN + l_X = 2+1=3 \u2192 which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l_X is 1 (p). So J_NN (1) must equal l_X (1). So that's okay. So all conditions are satisfied. So A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nThe final NN term is 3S1. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S (L=0). J=1. \n\nCheck Pauli condition: T=0. So S + L +1 mod2: 1 +0 +1 =2 mod2=0 \u2192 so T=0. That's good.\n\nParity: L_NN is 0 (since S orbital). The emitted particle's l is p (1). So 0 +1 =1, which is odd. Good.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1. The emitted particle's l is 1. So J=1 equals l=1. So that's okay. So all conditions met. So B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nThe final NN term is 3D3. Let's parse: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D (L=2). J=3.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 mod2=1. So T=1 mod2? But T must be 0. Wait, the problem states the final NN has T=0. So this would violate the Pauli condition. Wait, so this would be invalid? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Here T(NN) is supposed to be 0. So 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2. Plugging in S=1, L=2: 1+2 +1=4 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The formula is T = S + L +1 mod2, so the sum S + L +1 must be even. Wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nThe condition is T = (S + L +1) mod2. Since T=0, then (S + L +1) must be even. So S + L must be odd (since adding 1 to an odd gives even). For this case: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 (odd). So 3 +1=4 mod2 0. So that's okay. So T=0 is satisfied here. Okay, so my mistake earlier. So the Pauli condition holds here.\n\nParity: L_NN is 2 (D), emitted particle's l is f (which is l=3). So 2 +3=5 \u2192 odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l is 3 (f). So J_NN must equal l_X (3). So that's okay. So all conditions are met. So C is allowed?\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which is NOT permitted. Hmm, so maybe I need to check again. Let me check all again for C:\n\nWait, the term is 3D3. The J is 3, which must be equal to l_X (3). So that's okay. So C is allowed. So maybe the answer is another option.\n\nOption D: 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe final NN term is 3P0. Let's parse: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P (L=1). J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=1. 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1. But T is supposed to be 0. So 3 mod2 is 1, so T would be 1, which contradicts the given T=0. Therefore, this violates the Pauli condition. So this is not allowed. But wait let me check again:\n\nWait, the given condition says T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. So T is supposed to be 0. So (S + L +1) mod2 must be 0. \n\nFor D: S=1, L=1. So 1+1 +1 =3 \u2192 mod2=1. So T would be 1 mod2, which is not 0. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this is not permitted. \n\nBut let's check the other conditions for completeness.\n\nParity: L_NN is 1 (P), emitted particle's l is s (l=0). So 1+0 =1 \u2192 odd. So parity is okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0. The emitted particle's l is 0. So J must equal l. 0 equals 0. So that's okay. \n\nBut the Pauli condition is violated here, so D is invalid. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which is not permitted. So between the options, D is the one that's not allowed. Let me check the other options again to confirm.\n\nWait, let me recheck option C again because I thought initially there was a problem but corrected myself. \n\nIn option C, the NN final state is 3D3. The S is 1, L is 2. T= S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1+2 +1=4 mod2=0. Correct. So that's okay. \n\nSo the only one that fails is D. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nWait, so option D's Pauli condition fails. So the answer is D? But let me check angular momentum for D again. The J_NN is 0, the emitted particle's l is 0 (s). So J_NN must equal l_X, which is 0. So that's okay. So angular momentum is okay, parity is okay (since L_NN (1) + l_X (0) =1, which is odd). But Pauli condition fails here. So D is not allowed. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check the term symbol for D. The final term is 3P0. The J is 0. The possible J values for L=1 and S=1 would be 0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. So that's okay. \n\nYes, so the problem is only with the Pauli condition in D. Hence, the answer is D. But wait the options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"which is not permitted\".\n\nWait, but let me check option C again. The angular momentum: the emitted particle has l=3 (f), and the NN has J=3. So that's okay. \n\nYes, so the only invalid one is D. So the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but I should check all options again for any other possible mistakes.\n\nWait, the problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So for each option, we must confirm that the given final state's T(NN) is indeed 0. Wait, but how do we know T(NN) for each option? Wait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". Wait, no, the question says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So all the options are under the condition that the final NN has T=0, so the Pauli condition must hold for the final state. So in option D, the final NN state would have T=1 (as per calculation) but the problem states that the final NN has T=0. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, that transition is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So all the options are possibilities where the final NN has T=0? Or are the options giving different final NN states, and we have to pick the one that can't have T=0? Wait the question is phrased as \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted...\" So each option's final NN state must have T=0. Therefore, any option where the final NN state would require T\u22600 is invalid. So in option D, the final NN's T would be 1, so that's not allowed. So D is the answer.\n\nYes, so I think the answer is D. \n\nWait but let me check the Pauli condition again for each option:\n\nOption D's final NN state: 3P0. The term symbol is 3P0. The S here is (3-1)/2 =1. L is 1 (P). So T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1. So T would be 1 mod2, which is not 0. So that's the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which of the given options is not allowed based on the conditions given. The question is about the decay of a NN system in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the Pauli statistics condition given by T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2, where the final state has T(NN) = 0. \n\nFirst, let me recall what each part of the term symbol means. The initial state is 1S0, so that's (2S+1)L_J. Here, the spin S for the initial state must be such that 2S+1 = 1, so S = 0. The orbital angular momentum L is S (as per the letter S), which corresponds to L=0. The total angular momentum J is the last number, which is 0 here. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.\n\nNow, when the NN system emits particle X, the final state must conserve angular momentum. So the total angular momentum of the initial system (0) must equal the total angular momentum of the final NN system plus the angular momentum of particle X. But since we are dealing with partial waves, maybe I need to look at the orbital angular momentum between the NN pair and the emitted particle. Wait, actually, the term symbols for the transitions probably involve the final NN state's L and S, and the emitted particle's angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the angular momentum conservation between the initial and final states.\n\nThe problem mentions that the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The \"p\" here probably refers to the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum? Wait, but maybe the particle X's spin and orbital angular momentum? Or maybe the emitted particle's angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. Let me think. The notation might be that the final NN state is in a certain partial wave (like 7D1) and the emitted particle X has an orbital angular momentum denoted by the letter (like s, p, d, f etc). Wait, but the particle X itself has a spin. Since the problem mentions that X has intrinsic parity -1. Parity is important here.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is calculated as (-1)^L_initial. Since the initial state is S (L=0), so parity is (+1). The final state's parity must be equal to the initial parity multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle's state. The parity of the emitted particle's state would involve the orbital angular momentum (l) of X and its intrinsic parity. The formula for the parity of the emitted particle is (-1)^l * intrinsic parity. Since intrinsic parity of X is -1, the total parity of the X's contribution is (-1)^l * (-1). \n\nThe final NN system's parity is (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the total parity conservation requires that:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final(NN) * Parity_X.\n\nSo:\n\n(+1) = (-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ]\n\nBecause the NN system's parity is (-1)^L_NN and the X's parity is (-1)^l_X * (-1). \n\nSo rearranged:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^l_X * (-1) = +1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = +1 \n\nTherefore:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 must be even, so L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me write the equation:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X\n\nSo 1 = [ (-1)^L_NN ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ]\n\nSo 1 = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1)^1 \n\nWhich can be written as 1 = (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1}\n\nThus, exponent must be even:\n\nL_NN + l_X + 1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 their sum must be odd.\n\nSo that's one condition.\n\nNext, the Pauli statistics condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is given as 0, so:\n\n0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 their sum is odd.\n\nAlso, angular momentum conservation. The initial state has total angular momentum J_initial = 0. The final state must have the NN's total angular momentum J_NN plus the emitted particle's angular momentum l_X (since the particle's spin is part of its own angular momentum, but maybe here the problem treats the emitted particle's angular momentum as l_X? Hmm, perhaps the total angular momentum of the NN and X must add up to zero. Wait, the problem says the NN system is in a certain state and emits X. The total angular momentum before (0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum and the emitted particle's angular momentum (including its spin and orbital angular momentum). This might be more complicated, but perhaps in the context of partial waves, the angular momentum of the emitted particle is considered as its orbital angular momentum l_X, and its spin is fixed? Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the emitted particle's spin is zero, or maybe it's part of the term symbol?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term symbol for the emitted particle's state is given by the lowercase letter, which is its orbital angular momentum. For instance, in option A, the emitted particle is a \"p\" which is l=1. Then the emitted particle's spin might be considered as part of its own properties but not part of the angular momentum being conserved here? Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the partial wave of the emitted particle, which is its orbital angular momentum l_X. The total angular momentum conservation would require that the initial angular momentum (0) is equal to the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (J_NN) and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l_X). But since they are vectors, their magnitudes must satisfy triangle inequalities, but since the initial is 0, J_NN and l_X must add up such that their vector sum can be zero. That would require that J_NN = l_X, and their vectors are opposite. But maybe for the purposes of this question, we can just consider that the total angular momentum must be conserved, so the magnitudes must satisfy J_NN + l_X \u2265 0 (which they always do), but since the total is zero, perhaps J_NN must equal l_X and their directions must be opposite. But since we are dealing with just the quantum numbers here, maybe the key is that J_NN must be equal to l_X? Because if the total is zero, then the only way is if J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. But in terms of the possible values, the magnitude of J_NN must be equal to l_X. So J_NN must equal l_X. Therefore, the J_NN must equal l_X. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the emitted particle's angular momentum (its l) plus the NN's angular momentum must add to zero. But since angular momentum is a vector, the only way the total can be zero is if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But their magnitudes must satisfy |J_NN - l_X| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l_X, so the only possibility is J_NN = l_X. Therefore, J_NN must equal l_X. So that's a key point.\n\nSo for each option, I need to check:\n\n1. The NN's final state has T(NN) = 0. The Pauli condition requires that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd (since T=0 = S + L +1 mod 2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod 2).\n\n2. The parity condition requires that L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\n3. Angular momentum conservation requires that J_NN = l_X (since the total must be zero, so their magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite, so J_NN must equal l_X).\n\nAdditionally, the term symbol for the NN final state gives us their S and L. Let me parse each option:\n\nLet's go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse this term symbol. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So 7D1: 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S = 3. The L is D (L=2), and J=1. \n\nWait, but J must be L + S or something? Wait, J can be |L - S|, ..., L + S. So for L=2 and S=3, possible J values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here J is 1. That's possible, but okay.\n\nFirst, check the Pauli condition. T(NN) =0. So according to the given condition T = S + L +1 mod2. Here S=3, L=2. 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1. Then T = 1 mod2? But the problem states that T(NN)=0. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So 0 \u2261 3 + 2 +1 mod2 \u2192 6 mod2 =0. Wait, 3+2 is 5, plus 1 is 6. 6 mod2 is 0. So that's okay. So that's allowed. So the Pauli condition is satisfied here.\n\nNext, parity condition: L_NN (which is 2 for D) plus l_X (the emitted particle's l, which here is p (l=1)). So L_NN + l_X = 2+1=3 \u2192 which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l_X is 1 (p). So J_NN (1) must equal l_X (1). So that's okay. So all conditions are satisfied. So A is allowed.\n\nOption B: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nThe final NN term is 3S1. So 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is S (L=0). J=1. \n\nCheck Pauli condition: T=0. So S + L +1 mod2: 1 +0 +1 =2 mod2=0 \u2192 so T=0. That's good.\n\nParity: L_NN is 0 (since S orbital). The emitted particle's l is p (1). So 0 +1 =1, which is odd. Good.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1. The emitted particle's l is 1. So J=1 equals l=1. So that's okay. So all conditions met. So B is allowed.\n\nOption C: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nThe final NN term is 3D3. Let's parse: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is D (L=2). J=3.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 mod2=1. So T=1 mod2? But T must be 0. Wait, the problem states the final NN has T=0. So this would violate the Pauli condition. Wait, so this would be invalid? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Here T(NN) is supposed to be 0. So 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2. Plugging in S=1, L=2: 1+2 +1=4 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The formula is T = S + L +1 mod2, so the sum S + L +1 must be even. Wait, let me re-calculate:\n\nThe condition is T = (S + L +1) mod2. Since T=0, then (S + L +1) must be even. So S + L must be odd (since adding 1 to an odd gives even). For this case: S=1, L=2 \u2192 1+2=3 (odd). So 3 +1=4 mod2 0. So that's okay. So T=0 is satisfied here. Okay, so my mistake earlier. So the Pauli condition holds here.\n\nParity: L_NN is 2 (D), emitted particle's l is f (which is l=3). So 2 +3=5 \u2192 odd. So parity condition holds.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3 (from the term symbol). The emitted particle's l is 3 (f). So J_NN must equal l_X (3). So that's okay. So all conditions are met. So C is allowed?\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which is NOT permitted. Hmm, so maybe I need to check again. Let me check all again for C:\n\nWait, the term is 3D3. The J is 3, which must be equal to l_X (3). So that's okay. So C is allowed. So maybe the answer is another option.\n\nOption D: 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nThe final NN term is 3P0. Let's parse: 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1. L is P (L=1). J=0.\n\nPauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2. S=1, L=1. 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1. But T is supposed to be 0. So 3 mod2 is 1, so T would be 1, which contradicts the given T=0. Therefore, this violates the Pauli condition. So this is not allowed. But wait let me check again:\n\nWait, the given condition says T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2. So T is supposed to be 0. So (S + L +1) mod2 must be 0. \n\nFor D: S=1, L=1. So 1+1 +1 =3 \u2192 mod2=1. So T would be 1 mod2, which is not 0. So this violates the Pauli condition. Therefore, this is not permitted. \n\nBut let's check the other conditions for completeness.\n\nParity: L_NN is 1 (P), emitted particle's l is s (l=0). So 1+0 =1 \u2192 odd. So parity is okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0. The emitted particle's l is 0. So J must equal l. 0 equals 0. So that's okay. \n\nBut the Pauli condition is violated here, so D is invalid. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which is not permitted. So between the options, D is the one that's not allowed. Let me check the other options again to confirm.\n\nWait, let me recheck option C again because I thought initially there was a problem but corrected myself. \n\nIn option C, the NN final state is 3D3. The S is 1, L is 2. T= S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1+2 +1=4 mod2=0. Correct. So that's okay. \n\nSo the only one that fails is D. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nWait, so option D's Pauli condition fails. So the answer is D? But let me check angular momentum for D again. The J_NN is 0, the emitted particle's l is 0 (s). So J_NN must equal l_X, which is 0. So that's okay. So angular momentum is okay, parity is okay (since L_NN (1) + l_X (0) =1, which is odd). But Pauli condition fails here. So D is not allowed. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but let me check the term symbol for D. The final term is 3P0. The J is 0. The possible J values for L=1 and S=1 would be 0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. So that's okay. \n\nYes, so the problem is only with the Pauli condition in D. Hence, the answer is D. But wait the options are A, B, C, D. The question says \"which is not permitted\".\n\nWait, but let me check option C again. The angular momentum: the emitted particle has l=3 (f), and the NN has J=3. So that's okay. \n\nYes, so the only invalid one is D. So the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but I should check all options again for any other possible mistakes.\n\nWait, the problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So for each option, we must confirm that the given final state's T(NN) is indeed 0. Wait, but how do we know T(NN) for each option? Wait, the problem says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". Wait, no, the question says \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So all the options are under the condition that the final NN has T=0, so the Pauli condition must hold for the final state. So in option D, the final NN state would have T=1 (as per calculation) but the problem states that the final NN has T=0. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, that transition is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"the final NN state has T(NN) =0\". So all the options are possibilities where the final NN has T=0? Or are the options giving different final NN states, and we have to pick the one that can't have T=0? Wait the question is phrased as \"Suppose the final NN state has T(NN)=0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted...\" So each option's final NN state must have T=0. Therefore, any option where the final NN state would require T\u22600 is invalid. So in option D, the final NN's T would be 1, so that's not allowed. So D is the answer.\n\nYes, so I think the answer is D. \n\nWait but let me check the Pauli condition again for each option:\n\nOption D's final NN state: 3P0. The term symbol is 3P0. The S here is (3-1)/2 =1. L is 1 (P). So T(NN)= S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 1+1 +1 =3 mod2=1. So T would be 1 mod2, which is not 0. So that's the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze each option based on angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and the Pauli statistics condition \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\mod 2 \\) with \\( T(NN) = 0 \\).\n\n### Option A: \\( 1S0 \\to 7D1 + p \\)\n- **Final NN state (7D1)**: \\( S = 3 \\), \\( L = 2 \\).\n- **Pauli condition**: \\( 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Parity**: \\( L_{NN} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Angular momentum**: \\( J_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l_X = 1 \\). \\( J_{NN} = l_X \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n\n### Option B: \\( 1S0 \\to 3S1 + p \\)\n- **Final NN state (3S1)**: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 0 \\).\n- **Pauli condition**: \\( 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Parity**: \\( L_{NN} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Angular momentum**: \\( J_{NN} = 1 \\), \\( l_X = 1 \\). \\( J_{NN} = l_X \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n\n### Option C: \\( 1S0 \\to 3D3 + f \\)\n- **Final NN state (3D3)**: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\).\n- **Pauli condition**: \\( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Parity**: \\( L_{NN} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Angular momentum**: \\( J_{NN} = 3 \\), \\( l_X = 3 \\). \\( J_{NN} = l_X \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n\n### Option D: \\( 1S0 \\to 3P0 + s \\)\n- **Final NN state (3P0)**: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 1 \\).\n- **Pauli condition**: \\( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the Pauli statistics condition given, and the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which of the given options is not allowed.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Pauli statistics requirement mentioned: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is 0, that equation becomes 0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Rearranging, S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So their sum has to be odd. Therefore, S(NN) and L(NN) must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.\n\nNext, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol notation is (2S+1)L_J. So here, S_initial is the spin part. The 1S0 means that the total spin S is (since 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0). The L here is S, which corresponds to L=0 (since S in spectroscopic notation is L=0). The total angular momentum J is 0, so J = L + S? Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of L and S. But since L and S are both 0 here, J must be 0. So the initial state has L_initial = 0 and S_initial = 0. \n\nNow, when the NN system emits a particle X, the process must conserve angular momentum and parity. The final state is another NN state plus particle X. Let me think about the angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum before and after must be equal. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum of particle X (l_X, since the angular momentum of X is given by the lowercase letter in the options, like p for l=1, etc.). Wait, actually, the angular momentum of X is its orbital angular momentum here, right? Because in nuclear reactions, when a particle is emitted, its orbital angular momentum contributes to the total angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular momentum of X is considered as its own l, so that the total angular momentum conservation requires that the total J of the initial (0) equals the sum of the final NN's J_NN and the particle X's angular momentum l_X (since their spins might also contribute, but maybe here we need to consider the orbital angular momentum of X as part of the angular momentum for the final state? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final NN system has their own angular momentum (L_NN and S_NN) and the emitted particle X has angular momentum l (its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN?), and the total angular momentum must add up. Since the initial total J was 0, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. So J_NN (which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ... )? Wait, actually, the total angular momentum J for the NN final state is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (but vector addition, so actually the magnitude depends on the angle between them, but in terms of conservation, the total angular momentum must add with X's angular momentum to 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (l_X). Therefore, the sum of J_NN and l_X must be zero. But since the initial angular momentum was zero, their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN must equal l_X in magnitude, and their vectors must be opposite. But since they are magnitudes, that would require that J_NN = l_X and their directions are opposite. But the problem is that the question is giving the partial waves, which correspond to the angular momentum of the NN and X. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the partial wave notation for the emitted particle X is given by the lowercase letter (like p, f, s, etc.), which correspond to l values: s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, f is 3, etc. So in the options, for example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. Here, the emitted particle has l=1 (p). The final NN state is 7D1, which would have L_NN = 2 (since D is l=2), and the term symbol's spin part is 3? Wait, the term symbol for the final NN state is like a^(2S+1)L_J. Let's parse each option.\n\nFirst, let's break down each option's components:\n\nTake option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. The term symbol here would have:\n\nThe coefficient is 2S+1 = 7 \u2192 so S_NN = (7-1)/2 = 3. The L is D, so L_NN=2. The total angular momentum J for the NN is 1 (since the last number is 1). \n\nThe emitted particle X has l=1 (p). \n\nNow, angular momentum conservation: The total initial J is 0. The final total angular momentum must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's J_NN (which is 1 here) and the particle's angular momentum l_X (1) must be zero. The possible total angular momentum from adding 1 and 1 can be 0,1, or 2. So it's possible for them to cancel (if the vectors are opposite), so that's okay. But maybe there's another consideration here.\n\nNow, parity conservation. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L was 0 (S state), parity is (+1). The final state's parity must also be +1 (since parity is conserved). The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity. \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN + l_X} ??? Wait, no. Wait, the NN's parity would be determined by their own orbital angular momentum L_NN, and the parity of X is given as -1. Wait, the problem states that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The total parity must be conserved. \n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1. \n\nThe final parity is [parity of NN] * [parity of X]. \n\nThe parity of NN is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN). The parity of X is intrinsic parity (-1) multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} (since the particle's orbital angular momentum contributes to its parity as well). Wait, the parity of the emitted particle X would be its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum (the l_X here). \n\nTherefore, the total final parity is:\n\n[ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) ] \n\nBecause X's parity is intrinsic (-1) times (-1)^l_X. So altogether:\n\nTotal final parity = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) \n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1. \n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = +1 \n\nSo exponent must be even:\n\nL_NN + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \n\n=> L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2 \n\nSo L_NN and l_X must add to an odd number. \n\nSo for each option, we need to check this parity condition. \n\nAlso, remember the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Given T(NN)=0, so S(NN) + L(NN) must be 1 mod2 (since 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = -1 mod2 \u2192 same as 1 mod2). \n\nSo for each option, we need to check three things:\n\n1. Parity condition: L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\n2. Pauli condition: S_NN + L_NN must be odd (since T=0 requires S + L +1 even? Wait, let me recheck the equation:\n\nThe problem says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So T(NN)=0 \u2192 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 which is 1 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nYes, so S_NN + L_NN must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, we need to check the angular momentum conservation. Since the total angular momentum must be conserved (initial J=0), the final total angular momentum (J_NN + l_X) must also sum to 0. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l_X). So the total J must be zero. So the vector sum of J_NN (the NN's total angular momentum) and l_X (the particle's angular momentum) must have a resultant of 0. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of J_NN and l_X must satisfy that their sum can be zero. For example, if J_NN = l_X and their vectors are opposite. The magnitude of their sum must be zero, so the magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite. Therefore, the magnitudes must be equal, so J_NN must equal l_X. Wait, but J_NN is the magnitude of the NN's total angular momentum. \n\nWait, the total angular momentum of the NN is J_NN, which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + 2L_NN\u00b7S_NN). But for conservation, the vector sum must be zero. So the NN's J_NN and the particle's l must form a vector sum of zero. So the magnitudes must satisfy that J_NN = l_X and their directions are opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total angular momentum of the NN plus the particle's l must be zero. So the possible values are that J_NN + l_X can give a total of 0. So the allowed combinations are when |J_NN - l_X| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l_X, but for the total to be zero, the only way is that J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. So J_NN must equal l_X, and their vectors must be antiparallel. So the magnitudes must be equal. \n\nTherefore, J_NN must equal l_X. \n\nWait, but in the options, for example, in option A:\n\nThe NN's final state is 7D1. The term symbol's J is 1. So J_NN = 1. The emitted particle has l=1 (p). So J_NN equals l_X (1=1), so that works. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nLet me check each option step by step. \n\nStarting with option A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p.\n\nFirst, the NN final state:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n- The coefficient 7 = 2S+1 \u2192 S_NN = 3 (since 2*3+1=7).\n\n- The L is D \u2192 L_NN = 2.\n\n- J_NN = 1 (the last number).\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S_NN + L_NN = 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1. That's okay, since it needs to be odd. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l_X (p \u2192 l=1) \u2192 2 +1 = 3 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. Their sum must be 0. Since J_NN equals l_X, they can be antiparallel. So that works. \n\nSo A is allowed. \n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 3S1. \n\nTerm symbol: 3 = 2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nS is S, so L_NN =0 (since S in spectroscopic notation is L=0). \n\nJ_NN =1 (the last number). \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +0 =1 \u2192 odd. Good. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l_X (p=1) \u2192 0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. Again, same as before, they can add to zero. \n\nSo B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN state: 3D3.\n\nTerm symbol: 3=2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nL is D \u2192 L_NN=2. \n\nJ_NN is 3. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Good. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l_X (f \u2192 l=3). So 2 +3 =5 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3, l_X is 3 (since f is l=3). So J_NN equals l_X. So their vectors can be antiparallel. So total J can be zero. So that's okay. \n\nSo C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state: 3P0.\n\nTerm symbol: 3=2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nL is P \u2192 L_NN=1. \n\nJ_NN is 0. \n\nWait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN. Since J = L_NN + S_NN (but actually, J is the vector sum. For J to be 0, L and S must be aligned such that their vectors cancel. So L=1, S=1. The total J can be 0 only if L and S are antiparallel. \n\nWait, for L=1 and S=1, the possible J values are 0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +1 =2 \u2192 even. But the Pauli condition requires that S + L must be odd (since T=0). So 2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 even. This violates the condition. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. \n\nSo in option D, S_NN=1, L_NN=1. Their sum is 2, which is even. So T(NN)=0 would require S + L +1 mod2 = (2 +1) mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1, but T(NN)=0. Wait, wait, let me recheck the Pauli condition equation again. \n\nThe problem states: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nSo T is supposed to be 0. \n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 which is 1 mod2. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u2261 0 +1 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2? Wait no, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nWait, the equation is T(NN) = [S(NN) + L(NN) +1] mod2. \n\nSo substituting S=1, L=1, then T = (1+1 +1) mod2 = 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that T(NN)=0. Therefore, this violates the condition. \n\nSo this is the forbidden one. \n\nAdditionally, check parity and angular momentum for D. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l_X (s, l=0) \u2192 1 +0 =1, which is odd. So parity is okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0, l_X is 0 (s). So their vector sum must be zero. Since J_NN is 0 and l_X is 0, that's okay. \n\nSo the problem comes from the Pauli condition here. Since T(NN) would be 1 instead of 0. Therefore, this option is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Wait, but let me check the other conditions again to make sure. \n\nWait the angular momentum conservation here: the NN's J is 0, and the particle has l=0 (s). So their vector sum is 0 +0 =0. So that's okay. \n\nParity: The NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN}= (-1)^1 =-1. The particle's parity is intrinsic (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)*(1) = -1. So total final parity: (-1)*(-1) = +1, which matches initial parity. So parity is okay. \n\nBut the problem is that the T(NN)=1 here, but the question states that T(NN)=0. So the Pauli condition is violated here. Hence D is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again to ensure I didn't miss anything. \n\nLooking back at option C: 3D3 + f. The Pauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 sum is 3 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nOption D's problem is the Pauli condition.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The key points here are the Pauli statistics condition given, and the conservation laws of angular momentum and parity. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which of the given options is not allowed.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Pauli statistics requirement mentioned: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T(NN) is 0, that equation becomes 0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Rearranging, S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So their sum has to be odd. Therefore, S(NN) and L(NN) must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.\n\nNext, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol notation is (2S+1)L_J. So here, S_initial is the spin part. The 1S0 means that the total spin S is (since 2S+1 =1 \u2192 S=0). The L here is S, which corresponds to L=0 (since S in spectroscopic notation is L=0). The total angular momentum J is 0, so J = L + S? Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of L and S. But since L and S are both 0 here, J must be 0. So the initial state has L_initial = 0 and S_initial = 0. \n\nNow, when the NN system emits a particle X, the process must conserve angular momentum and parity. The final state is another NN state plus particle X. Let me think about the angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum before and after must be equal. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L_NN + S_NN) plus the angular momentum of particle X (l_X, since the angular momentum of X is given by the lowercase letter in the options, like p for l=1, etc.). Wait, actually, the angular momentum of X is its orbital angular momentum here, right? Because in nuclear reactions, when a particle is emitted, its orbital angular momentum contributes to the total angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular momentum of X is considered as its own l, so that the total angular momentum conservation requires that the total J of the initial (0) equals the sum of the final NN's J_NN and the particle X's angular momentum l_X (since their spins might also contribute, but maybe here we need to consider the orbital angular momentum of X as part of the angular momentum for the final state? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final NN system has their own angular momentum (L_NN and S_NN) and the emitted particle X has angular momentum l (its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN?), and the total angular momentum must add up. Since the initial total J was 0, the final total angular momentum must also be 0. So J_NN (which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + ... )? Wait, actually, the total angular momentum J for the NN final state is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (but vector addition, so actually the magnitude depends on the angle between them, but in terms of conservation, the total angular momentum must add with X's angular momentum to 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (l_X). Therefore, the sum of J_NN and l_X must be zero. But since the initial angular momentum was zero, their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN must equal l_X in magnitude, and their vectors must be opposite. But since they are magnitudes, that would require that J_NN = l_X and their directions are opposite. But the problem is that the question is giving the partial waves, which correspond to the angular momentum of the NN and X. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the partial wave notation for the emitted particle X is given by the lowercase letter (like p, f, s, etc.), which correspond to l values: s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, f is 3, etc. So in the options, for example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. Here, the emitted particle has l=1 (p). The final NN state is 7D1, which would have L_NN = 2 (since D is l=2), and the term symbol's spin part is 3? Wait, the term symbol for the final NN state is like a^(2S+1)L_J. Let's parse each option.\n\nFirst, let's break down each option's components:\n\nTake option A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 7D1. The term symbol here would have:\n\nThe coefficient is 2S+1 = 7 \u2192 so S_NN = (7-1)/2 = 3. The L is D, so L_NN=2. The total angular momentum J for the NN is 1 (since the last number is 1). \n\nThe emitted particle X has l=1 (p). \n\nNow, angular momentum conservation: The total initial J is 0. The final total angular momentum must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's J_NN (which is 1 here) and the particle's angular momentum l_X (1) must be zero. The possible total angular momentum from adding 1 and 1 can be 0,1, or 2. So it's possible for them to cancel (if the vectors are opposite), so that's okay. But maybe there's another consideration here.\n\nNow, parity conservation. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L was 0 (S state), parity is (+1). The final state's parity must also be +1 (since parity is conserved). The final parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity. \n\nThe NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN + l_X} ??? Wait, no. Wait, the NN's parity would be determined by their own orbital angular momentum L_NN, and the parity of X is given as -1. Wait, the problem states that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The total parity must be conserved. \n\nThe initial parity is (-1)^{L_initial} = (-1)^0 = +1. \n\nThe final parity is [parity of NN] * [parity of X]. \n\nThe parity of NN is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN). The parity of X is intrinsic parity (-1) multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} (since the particle's orbital angular momentum contributes to its parity as well). Wait, the parity of the emitted particle X would be its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is its orbital angular momentum (the l_X here). \n\nTherefore, the total final parity is:\n\n[ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) ] \n\nBecause X's parity is intrinsic (-1) times (-1)^l_X. So altogether:\n\nTotal final parity = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) \n\nThis must equal the initial parity of +1. \n\nSo:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = +1 \n\nSo exponent must be even:\n\nL_NN + l_X +1 \u2261 0 mod 2 \n\n=> L_NN + l_X \u2261 1 mod 2 \n\nSo L_NN and l_X must add to an odd number. \n\nSo for each option, we need to check this parity condition. \n\nAlso, remember the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Given T(NN)=0, so S(NN) + L(NN) must be 1 mod2 (since 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L = -1 mod2 \u2192 same as 1 mod2). \n\nSo for each option, we need to check three things:\n\n1. Parity condition: L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\n2. Pauli condition: S_NN + L_NN must be odd (since T=0 requires S + L +1 even? Wait, let me recheck the equation:\n\nThe problem says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So T(NN)=0 \u2192 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 which is 1 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nYes, so S_NN + L_NN must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, we need to check the angular momentum conservation. Since the total angular momentum must be conserved (initial J=0), the final total angular momentum (J_NN + l_X) must also sum to 0. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J and the emitted particle's angular momentum (l_X). So the total J must be zero. So the vector sum of J_NN (the NN's total angular momentum) and l_X (the particle's angular momentum) must have a resultant of 0. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of J_NN and l_X must satisfy that their sum can be zero. For example, if J_NN = l_X and their vectors are opposite. The magnitude of their sum must be zero, so the magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite. Therefore, the magnitudes must be equal, so J_NN must equal l_X. Wait, but J_NN is the magnitude of the NN's total angular momentum. \n\nWait, the total angular momentum of the NN is J_NN, which is sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + 2L_NN\u00b7S_NN). But for conservation, the vector sum must be zero. So the NN's J_NN and the particle's l must form a vector sum of zero. So the magnitudes must satisfy that J_NN = l_X and their directions are opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total angular momentum of the NN plus the particle's l must be zero. So the possible values are that J_NN + l_X can give a total of 0. So the allowed combinations are when |J_NN - l_X| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l_X, but for the total to be zero, the only way is that J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. So J_NN must equal l_X, and their vectors must be antiparallel. So the magnitudes must be equal. \n\nTherefore, J_NN must equal l_X. \n\nWait, but in the options, for example, in option A:\n\nThe NN's final state is 7D1. The term symbol's J is 1. So J_NN = 1. The emitted particle has l=1 (p). So J_NN equals l_X (1=1), so that works. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nLet me check each option step by step. \n\nStarting with option A: 1S0 \u21927D1 + p.\n\nFirst, the NN final state:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n- The coefficient 7 = 2S+1 \u2192 S_NN = 3 (since 2*3+1=7).\n\n- The L is D \u2192 L_NN = 2.\n\n- J_NN = 1 (the last number).\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S_NN + L_NN = 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1. That's okay, since it needs to be odd. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l_X (p \u2192 l=1) \u2192 2 +1 = 3 \u2192 odd. So parity condition is satisfied. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. Their sum must be 0. Since J_NN equals l_X, they can be antiparallel. So that works. \n\nSo A is allowed. \n\nOption B: 1S0 \u2192 3S1 + p.\n\nThe final NN state is 3S1. \n\nTerm symbol: 3 = 2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nS is S, so L_NN =0 (since S in spectroscopic notation is L=0). \n\nJ_NN =1 (the last number). \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +0 =1 \u2192 odd. Good. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l_X (p=1) \u2192 0 +1 =1 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. Again, same as before, they can add to zero. \n\nSo B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 1S0 \u21923D3 + f.\n\nFinal NN state: 3D3.\n\nTerm symbol: 3=2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nL is D \u2192 L_NN=2. \n\nJ_NN is 3. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Good. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (2) + l_X (f \u2192 l=3). So 2 +3 =5 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3, l_X is 3 (since f is l=3). So J_NN equals l_X. So their vectors can be antiparallel. So total J can be zero. So that's okay. \n\nSo C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s.\n\nFinal NN state: 3P0.\n\nTerm symbol: 3=2S+1 \u2192 S=1. \n\nL is P \u2192 L_NN=1. \n\nJ_NN is 0. \n\nWait, J is the total angular momentum of the NN. Since J = L_NN + S_NN (but actually, J is the vector sum. For J to be 0, L and S must be aligned such that their vectors cancel. So L=1, S=1. The total J can be 0 only if L and S are antiparallel. \n\nWait, for L=1 and S=1, the possible J values are 0,1,2. So J=0 is possible. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +1 =2 \u2192 even. But the Pauli condition requires that S + L must be odd (since T=0). So 2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 even. This violates the condition. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. \n\nSo in option D, S_NN=1, L_NN=1. Their sum is 2, which is even. So T(NN)=0 would require S + L +1 mod2 = (2 +1) mod2 \u2192 3 mod2=1, but T(NN)=0. Wait, wait, let me recheck the Pauli condition equation again. \n\nThe problem states: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. \n\nSo T is supposed to be 0. \n\nSo 0 \u2261 S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 -1 mod2 \u2192 which is 1 mod2. \n\nIn option D: S=1, L=1 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 0 mod2. So 0 \u2261 0 +1 mod2 \u2192 1 mod2? Wait no, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. \n\nWait, the equation is T(NN) = [S(NN) + L(NN) +1] mod2. \n\nSo substituting S=1, L=1, then T = (1+1 +1) mod2 = 3 mod2=1. But the problem states that T(NN)=0. Therefore, this violates the condition. \n\nSo this is the forbidden one. \n\nAdditionally, check parity and angular momentum for D. \n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l_X (s, l=0) \u2192 1 +0 =1, which is odd. So parity is okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 0, l_X is 0 (s). So their vector sum must be zero. Since J_NN is 0 and l_X is 0, that's okay. \n\nSo the problem comes from the Pauli condition here. Since T(NN) would be 1 instead of 0. Therefore, this option is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Wait, but let me check the other conditions again to make sure. \n\nWait the angular momentum conservation here: the NN's J is 0, and the particle has l=0 (s). So their vector sum is 0 +0 =0. So that's okay. \n\nParity: The NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN}= (-1)^1 =-1. The particle's parity is intrinsic (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)*(1) = -1. So total final parity: (-1)*(-1) = +1, which matches initial parity. So parity is okay. \n\nBut the problem is that the T(NN)=1 here, but the question states that T(NN)=0. So the Pauli condition is violated here. Hence D is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again to ensure I didn't miss anything. \n\nLooking back at option C: 3D3 + f. The Pauli condition: S=1, L=2 \u2192 sum is 3 \u2192 odd. That's okay. \n\nOption D's problem is the Pauli condition. So the answer must be D. \n\nWait the options are:\n\nA) 1S0 ->7D1 + p\n\nB) 1S0 ->3S1 + p\n\nC) 1S0 ->3D3 + f\n\nD) 1S0 ->3P0 + s\n\nSo D is the forbidden one. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum, parity, and Pauli statistics.
