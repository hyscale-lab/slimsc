      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the order of the substances from least to most para isomer yield in a monobromo substitution reaction. The question gives me six substances, each attached to a benzene ring. The key here is understanding how the substituents on the benzene ring affect the direction of electrophilic substitution. \n\nFirst, I remember that in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, the position where the new group attaches depends on the directing groups of the existing substituent. For bromination, which is an electrophilic substitution, the substituent can be either activating or deactivating, and also directing. \n\nLet me list out the substituents again:\n\n1) Methyl (CH3) \u2013 that's an activating group, and it's ortho/para directing. So it should direct the bromine to o or p positions. Since there's excess bromine, maybe the major product is para here?\n\n2) Ethyl ester (COOC2H5) \u2013 esters are deactivating, right? Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance. So esters are meta directing. Wait, esters are similar to the carbonyl groups like in ketones or carboxylic acids. So the ethyl ester (like an ester group) would be meta directing. So the bromine would go meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product here, so the weight fraction of para would be low.\n\n3) Chloro (Cl) \u2013 chlorine is a deactivating group but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, halogens like Cl are actually deactivating but ortho/para directing. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. The halogens are weakly deactivating, and they are ortho/para directors. So Cl directs to o or p. So in this case, when you brominate a chlorobenzene, the main products would be ortho and para. But since the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe the para is the major one here? Or perhaps the o and p are both possible, but the question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". Hmm, but the question says to arrange based on the para isomer's weight fraction, so if a substituent directs to both o and p, then the para would be a certain percentage. But how do I compare between different substituents?\n\n4) Nitro group (NO2) \u2013 that's a strong deactivating group and meta directing. So nitro directs meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product here, so the para fraction would be low.\n\n5) Ethyl group (C2H5) \u2013 similar to methyl, an activating group, ortho/para directing. So same as methyl but perhaps more activating? Wait, alkyl groups like methyl and ethyl are both activating and ortho/para directing. The ethyl is a larger alkyl group, but maybe the directing effect is similar. So both 1 and 5 would direct to o and p. But maybe the substituent's influence on the para vs ortho? Wait, maybe the methyl and ethyl groups (both alkyl) will favor the para position over ortho? Because sometimes in such reactions, the para is more favored than ortho when there's an activating group. But maybe the strength of the directing effect also matters. Wait, but for alkyl groups, they donate electrons via inductive effect, which makes the ring electron density higher, so the electrophile is attracted to the ring. Since they are ortho/para directing, the substituent's presence at the meta position would not be favored. Wait, but when the substituent is on the benzene ring, the electrophile adds to o or p positions. \n\nWait, but the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to either o or p. The actual ratio between o and p can depend on the substituent. For example, in toluene (methyl benzene), the methyl group directs to o and p. The major product is the para isomer, but there is some ortho. So the para isomer's fraction would be higher than 50% but less than 100%? \n\nNow, for the nitro group (option 4), since it's a meta director, the bromine would go to meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product. So the weight fraction of para here is low. \n\nThe ethyl ester (option 2) is a meta director, so similar to nitro, the bromine would go meta. So the para isomer's fraction is low here as well. \n\nThe chlorine (option 3) is an ortho/para director. Wait, but is it activating or deactivating? Chlorine is a deactivating group. Wait, the presence of a halogen like Cl makes the ring less reactive, but it's still ortho/para directing. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major products would be ortho and para. Since the substituent is deactivating, but the directing is towards o/p. But how does the deactivation affect the ratio of o vs p? Hmm. Maybe the deactivation makes the overall yield lower, but the ratio between o and p? Not sure. Wait, perhaps in cases of deactivating groups that are o/p directors, the para isomer is favored over ortho? Like in chlorobenzene, the main products are ortho and para, but which is more? I think in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is the major product. Because when the substituent is deactivating, the para position is more favored. Wait, maybe the inductive effect of Cl is electron-withdrawing, but the resonance effect might be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the directing effect for Cl is that the ortho and para positions are activated, but the para position is more favored. Let me recall: for example, in nitrobenzene, the nitro group is meta directing, so bromination would give meta. For chlorobenzene, since Cl is an ortho/para director, the bromine can go to ortho or para. The actual major isomer in chlorobromobenzene: I think that the para isomer is the major product. So for Cl (option 3), the para isomer would have a higher fraction than, say, the o/p directing but activating groups like methyl. Wait, but maybe the activating groups (like methyl) have a higher tendency for para? \n\nWait, perhaps the activating groups (like methyl) lead to a higher yield of the para isomer compared to the deactivating o/p directors. Because activating groups increase the electron density, so maybe the directing effect is stronger? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio between o and p depends on steric factors? For example, in toluene, the methyl group is small, so ortho is possible, but maybe the para isomer is still the major one. \n\nNow, the question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. That is, from the substituent that gives the least para isomer (so meta directing) to the one that gives the most para isomer. \n\nSo first, the meta directors (nitro, ester, etc.) will have the lowest para fractions. \n\nLet's list the substituents as meta or o/p directors:\n\n1. Methyl (o/p directing, activating)\n2. Ethyl ester (meta directing, deactivating)\n3. Chloro (o/p directing, deactivating)\n4. Nitro (meta directing, deactivating)\n5. Ethyl (same as methyl, o/p directing, activating)\n6. Carboxylic acid (COOH) \u2013 wait, carboxylic acid is a deactivating group (since the -COOH is electron-withdrawing via resonance) and meta directing. Because the carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivator and meta director. So option 6 is meta directing. \n\nSo the meta directing groups are 2 (ester), 4 (nitro), 6 (carboxylic acid), and also the nitro is meta. \n\nWait, so for the meta directing groups (2,4,6), their para isomer fractions would be low. The o/p directing groups (1,3,5) have higher para fractions. \n\nNow, among the meta directing groups, the nitro group (4) is a stronger deactivator than the ester (2) or the carboxylic acid (6). Wait, actually, carboxylic acid is a stronger deactivator than ester? Let me think. The order of deactivation for substituents: nitro is the strongest deactivator, then carboxylic acid (COOH) is next, then esters (COOR) are weaker than COOH but still deactivating. Wait, maybe the order is: \n\nDeactivating power: NO2 > COOH > COOR (ester) > Cl. \n\nSo for the meta directors, the order of their directing strength? Wait, all meta directors direct to meta, so their para fraction is low. But maybe between them, the ones with stronger electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) might have even less para isomer, because they are more meta directing? Wait, but all meta directing substituents would direct to meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product. The actual fraction of para would be minimal for all meta directors. So perhaps the order between them isn't as important as between the o/p and meta groups. \n\nWait, but the question wants all six in order. So first, the meta directing ones (2,4,6) will have low para fractions, but among themselves, which is the lowest? The strongest meta director would have the least para? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directing groups have para fractions in the order of their deactivating strength. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the meta directing groups (like nitro, COOH, ester) will all have bromine going to meta, so the para isomer is a minor product. The actual fraction of para would depend on how much the substituent directs away from the para position. Since they are meta directors, the para isomer is disfavored. \n\nWait, but perhaps the stronger the meta director, the less the para isomer. For example, nitro is a strong meta director, so the para isomer's fraction would be very low. Carboxylic acid (COOH) is also a strong meta director, so maybe similar to nitro, but maybe slightly less? And ester (COOC2H5) is a weaker meta director than carboxylic acid, so perhaps the para fraction is a bit higher than COOH but still low. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider the actual order. Let me think of the directing power. The nitro group is a strong meta director, so the bromine would be almost entirely meta, so the para fraction would be very low. The carboxylic acid (COOH) is also a strong meta director, so similar to nitro. The ester (COOC2H5) is a weaker meta director than COOH? Or maybe the same? Because esters are less deactivating than carboxylic acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the meta directing substituents are ordered in terms of their ability to direct to meta. The stronger the meta director, the less the para isomer. So the order from least to most para would be nitro (4) < carboxylic acid (6) < ester (2). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the order is nitro (strongest meta director) has the least para, then COOH, then ester. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directing substituents all have similar fractions, but in the options given, we have to see how they are ordered. Let me check the options. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \n\nHere, 4 (nitro) is first (lowest para), then 2 (ester), then 6 (carboxylic acid). So nitro < ester < COOH. Hmm, that would mean nitro has the least para, then ester, then COOH. But if COOH is a stronger meta director than ester, then maybe COOH would have even less para than ester. But in option A, it's 4 <2 <6, so COOH has more para than ester. Not sure. \n\nOption C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \n\nHere, nitro < COOH < ester. So COOH is weaker than nitro but stronger than ester. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct order among the meta directing groups is nitro (strongest meta director) has least para, then COOH, then ester? Because COOH is stronger than ester in directing to meta. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is nitro > COOH > ester in terms of meta directing strength, so their para fractions (since lower directing strength would mean more para isomer? Wait, no. If a substituent is a stronger meta director, then the meta product is more favored, so the para fraction is lower. So the stronger the meta director, the lower the para fraction. \n\nSo nitro (strongest meta) \u2192 least para. Then COOH (next), then ester (weakest meta director). So the order would be 4 <6 <2 for the meta directors. \n\nThen among the o/p directing substituents (1,3,5), which have higher para fractions. \n\nNow, for the o/p directing substituents:\n\nThe o/p directing groups can be activating (like methyl, ethyl) or deactivating (like Cl). \n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) are ortho/para directing, and typically, for such groups, the para isomer is the major product. However, the deactivating o/p directing group (Cl) may have a different ratio. \n\nWait, in chlorobenzene (option 3), when you brominate it, the major products are ortho and para. But which is more? I think the para isomer is more than ortho here. Because the Cl is deactivating, so maybe the electron density is lower, so the para position (which is farther from Cl) might be more favored? Or maybe the inductive effect of Cl withdraws electrons, making the para position more electron-rich? Hmm, perhaps the resonance effect plays a role here. \n\nAlternatively, in toluene (methyl benzene), the major product is para. The methyl group is activating, so the ring is more electron-rich. The directing effect is ortho/para, so the para isomer is major. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less electron-rich, but the directing is still ortho/para. The para position is less hindered than ortho? Not sure. Wait, the actual major product for chlorobromobenzene is para. Let me recall, in some examples, when a deactivating group is present, the para isomer is favored over ortho. For example, in chlorobenzene, bromination gives more para than ortho. \n\nSo between activating (methyl and ethyl) and deactivating (Cl) o/p directors, which has a higher para fraction? \n\nThe activating groups (like methyl and ethyl) would have a higher electron density, so perhaps the directing effect is stronger, leading to more para? Wait, maybe the activating groups lead to a higher yield of para isomer compared to deactivating o/p directors. \n\nAlternatively, in the case of Cl (option3), the para isomer is major, but maybe not as much as in methyl or ethyl. \n\nSo for the o/p directing substituents:\n\nThe order of their para fractions would be:\n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) have higher para fractions than the deactivating o/p director (Cl). \n\nBetween methyl (1) and ethyl (5), since they are both activating and ortho/para directing, their para fractions might be similar. Since ethyl is a larger group, maybe the steric effect makes ortho less favored? Wait, but ethyl is just a longer chain. Maybe the directing effect is the same, so their para fractions would be similar. \n\nSo among o/p directing substituents:\n\nCl (option3) has lower para fraction than methyl (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nSo the order among the o/p directors would be Cl < methyl/ethyl. \n\nPutting this all together:\n\nMeta directing groups (lowest para first):\n\n4 (nitro) <6 (COOH) <2 (ester) \n\nThen, the next would be the deactivating o/p director (Cl, option3) since it has lower para than activating groups but higher than meta directors. \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5) have the highest para fractions. \n\nSo the order from least to most para isomer fraction is:\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then Cl (3) \u2192 then methyl (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 Wait, but Cl (3) is after 1 and 5, but according to my earlier thought, Cl should be between meta and the activating groups. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn option C: The order is 4 (nitro), then 6 (COOH), then 2 (ester). That would be correct for the meta directors. Then comes 1 and 5 (methyl and ethyl), and finally 3 (Cl). But that would place Cl after the activating groups, which contradicts my earlier thought that Cl (o/p directing, deactivating) has lower para fraction than the activating o/p groups. \n\nHmm, so that can't be right. \n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 So after the meta directors (4,2,6), then comes Cl (3), then 1 and 5. That would fit if Cl has higher para than the meta directors but lower than the activating groups. \n\nWait, let me re-express the order as per my analysis:\n\nOrder from least to most para fraction:\n\n1. nitro (4) [meta director, least para]\n2. COOH (6) [meta director]\n3. ester (2) [meta director]\n4. Cl (3) [o/p deactivating]\n5. methyl (1)\n6. ethyl (5)\n\nSo the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that's not. Option A has 4<2<6<3<1<5. \n\nHmm, my analysis gives 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, which is not exactly any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the order of meta directing groups is different. Let me think again. \n\nThe strength of meta direction: Nitro is the strongest meta director (most meta directing), so the para fraction would be the smallest. Then COOH is next, then ester (COOR). \n\nSo the order of meta directors is 4 <6 <2. \n\nSo the first three are 4,6,2. Then comes Cl (3), which is an o/p director (deactivating), so its para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating o/p. \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5) have the highest para fractions. \n\nSo the full order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So after the meta directors, it's 1 and 5 before 3. That would be incorrect because Cl (3) should be before them. \n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 So after meta directors, 2 comes before 6? That would be 4 <2 <6, but according to my analysis, 6 should come after 4 but before 2? \n\nHmm, perhaps I got the order of the meta directors wrong. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the order of deactivating groups in terms of directing: \n\nThe meta directing substituents have the following directing strength (meta directing ability):\n\nNitro (NO2) is the strongest meta director, followed by carboxylic acid (COOH), then ester (COOR). \n\nTherefore, their para fractions would be in the order: \n\nNitro (least para) < COOH (next) < ester (most para among meta directors). \n\nSo meta directors: 4 <6 <2. \n\nSo the order of the first three are 4,6,2. \n\nThen comes Cl (3), which is an o/p director (deactivating, so its para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating o/p). \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5). \n\nSo the sequence is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 No, because 3 should come before 1 and 5. \n\nOption A:4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 This would have 2 (ester) before 6 (COOH), which contradicts. \n\nHmm, none of the options have the correct order. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of meta directing substituents. \n\nWait, maybe the order of meta directing substituents is different. Let me check the directing effects and deactivating strengths. \n\nThe order of meta directing substituents from strongest to weakest (i.e., most meta directing to least):\n\nNitro group (NO2) is the strongest meta director. \n\nThen comes the carboxylic acid (COOH), then the ester (COOR). \n\nSo their para fractions would be ordered as:\n\nNitro (4) has the least para, then COOH (6), then ester (2). \n\nSo the meta directors in order:4 <6 <2. \n\nTherefore, the first three in the order are 4,6,2. \n\nNow, the next is Cl (3) which is o/p directing (deactivating). \n\nThen the o/p activating substituents (1 and 5) have higher para fractions than Cl. \n\nSo the order would be:\n\n4 (lowest) <6 <2 <3 (Cl) <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, this is not present. Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, option B is 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 No. \n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4 \u2192 No. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in the deactivating o/p director (Cl). \n\nWait, maybe the Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than the activating groups? That would change things. \n\nWait, if Cl is a deactivating o/p director, but the directing effect is still o/p. So in chlorobenzene, when you add bromine, the major product is the para isomer. \n\nWait, I think in chlorobromobenzene, the major product is para. So the para isomer's fraction would be higher than in the activating groups. \n\nWait, but activating groups like methyl would make the ring more electron-rich, so the directing effect is stronger, leading to more para? Or maybe the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in activating groups (like methyl), the para isomer is the major product (say 70%), while in Cl, the para isomer is even more (like 80%). \n\nWait, maybe I have that backwards. \n\nWait, let me think of toluene (methyl benzene). The bromination gives mostly para isomer. The exact ratio is like 75% para and 25% ortho. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, when brominated, the para isomer is more than ortho. For example, maybe 80% para and 20% ortho. \n\nSo in that case, Cl would have a higher para fraction than methyl. \n\nWait, that would mean the order between activating and deactivating o/p directors is reversed. \n\nWait, that would change everything. \n\nHmm, so if Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than methyl (option1) and ethyl (option5), then my previous reasoning was wrong. \n\nSo if that's the case, then the order would be:\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) < activating o/p (1,5) < Cl (3)? \n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if Cl's para fraction is higher than activating groups, then the order would be:\n\nmeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then activating groups (1,5) \u2192 then Cl (3) which has highest? \n\nWait, but that contradicts. Wait, let me think again. \n\nIf in toluene (activating group), the para fraction is say 75%, and in chlorobenzene (Cl), it's 80%, then Cl has higher para fraction. Then the order would be: \n\nmeta directors (lowest) \u2192 activating o/p (methyl, ethyl) have lower para than Cl. \n\nWait, so the order would be:\n\nmeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then activating o/p (1,5) \u2192 then Cl (3) is highest? \n\nWait, no. Wait, if Cl has higher para than activating, then Cl is after the activating. \n\nWait, but then the order from least to most would be:\n\n4 (meta) <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 (Cl) \n\nSo Cl would be last, with highest para fraction. \n\nBut that would make option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 No, that's not. \n\nWait, let me look up actual data. \n\nWait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the bromination gives about 70-75% para and 25-30% ortho. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, the bromination gives about 80% para and 20% ortho. \n\nSo the para fraction is higher in chlorobenzene (deactivating o/p director) than in toluene (activating). \n\nTherefore, the Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than methyl (option1) and ethyl (option5). \n\nThis is a key point I had wrong earlier. So that changes the order. \n\nSo now, the order among the o/p directors would be: \n\ndeactivating o/p (Cl,3) has higher para than activating o/p (1,5). \n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, Cl gives higher para than methyl. \n\nSo the order between o/p directing substituents would be Cl (3) has the highest para fraction, then methyl (1) and ethyl (5) next. \n\nWait, no, wait. If Cl has higher para than methyl, then Cl is higher. \n\nSo the order for o/p directors from least to most para fraction would be:\n\nActivating (methyl, ethyl) have lower para than Cl? \n\nWait no, the para fraction is higher in Cl than in methyl. So the activating groups have lower para than Cl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the para fraction in Cl is higher (80%) than methyl (75%). So Cl has higher para fraction than methyl. \n\nSo the order among the o/p directors would be: \n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) have lower para fractions than Cl (deactivating o/p director). \n\nSo the overall order would be: \n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) have the lowest para fractions. \n\nThen comes the activating o/p directors (1 and5). \n\nThen comes the deactivating o/p director (Cl,3). \n\nWait, but Cl has higher para than the activating groups. \n\nWait, so the order would be: \n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then 1 and5 \u2192 then 3 (Cl) \u2192 but Cl has higher para. \n\nWait, so from least to most, the order would be:\n\n4 (lowest) \u21926 \u21922 \u21921 \u21925 \u21923 (highest). \n\nWait, but that would mean Cl is the highest. \n\nLet me structure this again:\n\nAll substituents are divided into two groups:\n\nMeta directing (4,6,2) \u2192 low para fractions.\n\nOrtho/para directing: \n\n- deactivating (Cl,3) \u2192 high para (80%)\n- activating (1,5) \u2192 lower than Cl (75% for methyl, same or similar for ethyl). \n\nSo the order of the o/p directing substituents from least to most para fraction is:\n\nActivating (1,5) \u2192 then deactivating (3). \n\nThus, overall order:\n\n4 (meta) <6 (meta) <2 (meta) <1 (activating) <5 (activating) <3 (Cl, deactivating o/p, highest para). \n\nSo the sequence is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 exactly this order! \n\nYes! So option C is the correct one. \n\nWait, let me confirm once more:\n\nThe meta directors (4,6,2) are in order 4 (nitro) <6 (COOH) <2 (ester). \n\nThen, the activating o/p (1 and5) are next. \n\nThen Cl (3) is last (highest). \n\nSo the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \u2192 which is option C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the order of the substances from least to most para isomer yield in a monobromo substitution reaction. The question gives me six substances, each attached to a benzene ring. The key here is understanding how the substituents on the benzene ring affect the direction of electrophilic substitution. \n\nFirst, I remember that in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, the position where the new group attaches depends on the directing groups of the existing substituent. For bromination, which is an electrophilic substitution, the substituent can be either activating or deactivating, and also directing. \n\nLet me list out the substituents again:\n\n1) Methyl (CH3) \u2013 that's an activating group, and it's ortho/para directing. So it should direct the bromine to o or p positions. Since there's excess bromine, maybe the major product is para here?\n\n2) Ethyl ester (COOC2H5) \u2013 esters are deactivating, right? Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance. So esters are meta directing. Wait, esters are similar to the carbonyl groups like in ketones or carboxylic acids. So the ethyl ester (like an ester group) would be meta directing. So the bromine would go meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product here, so the weight fraction of para would be low.\n\n3) Chloro (Cl) \u2013 chlorine is a deactivating group but it's ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, halogens like Cl are actually deactivating but ortho/para directing. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. The halogens are weakly deactivating, and they are ortho/para directors. So Cl directs to o or p. So in this case, when you brominate a chlorobenzene, the main products would be ortho and para. But since the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe the para is the major one here? Or perhaps the o and p are both possible, but the question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". Hmm, but the question says to arrange based on the para isomer's weight fraction, so if a substituent directs to both o and p, then the para would be a certain percentage. But how do I compare between different substituents?\n\n4) Nitro group (NO2) \u2013 that's a strong deactivating group and meta directing. So nitro directs meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product here, so the para fraction would be low.\n\n5) Ethyl group (C2H5) \u2013 similar to methyl, an activating group, ortho/para directing. So same as methyl but perhaps more activating? Wait, alkyl groups like methyl and ethyl are both activating and ortho/para directing. The ethyl is a larger alkyl group, but maybe the directing effect is similar. So both 1 and 5 would direct to o and p. But maybe the substituent's influence on the para vs ortho? Wait, maybe the methyl and ethyl groups (both alkyl) will favor the para position over ortho? Because sometimes in such reactions, the para is more favored than ortho when there's an activating group. But maybe the strength of the directing effect also matters. Wait, but for alkyl groups, they donate electrons via inductive effect, which makes the ring electron density higher, so the electrophile is attracted to the ring. Since they are ortho/para directing, the substituent's presence at the meta position would not be favored. Wait, but when the substituent is on the benzene ring, the electrophile adds to o or p positions. \n\nWait, but the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to either o or p. The actual ratio between o and p can depend on the substituent. For example, in toluene (methyl benzene), the methyl group directs to o and p. The major product is the para isomer, but there is some ortho. So the para isomer's fraction would be higher than 50% but less than 100%? \n\nNow, for the nitro group (option 4), since it's a meta director, the bromine would go to meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product. So the weight fraction of para here is low. \n\nThe ethyl ester (option 2) is a meta director, so similar to nitro, the bromine would go meta. So the para isomer's fraction is low here as well. \n\nThe chlorine (option 3) is an ortho/para director. Wait, but is it activating or deactivating? Chlorine is a deactivating group. Wait, the presence of a halogen like Cl makes the ring less reactive, but it's still ortho/para directing. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major products would be ortho and para. Since the substituent is deactivating, but the directing is towards o/p. But how does the deactivation affect the ratio of o vs p? Hmm. Maybe the deactivation makes the overall yield lower, but the ratio between o and p? Not sure. Wait, perhaps in cases of deactivating groups that are o/p directors, the para isomer is favored over ortho? Like in chlorobenzene, the main products are ortho and para, but which is more? I think in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is the major product. Because when the substituent is deactivating, the para position is more favored. Wait, maybe the inductive effect of Cl is electron-withdrawing, but the resonance effect might be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the directing effect for Cl is that the ortho and para positions are activated, but the para position is more favored. Let me recall: for example, in nitrobenzene, the nitro group is meta directing, so bromination would give meta. For chlorobenzene, since Cl is an ortho/para director, the bromine can go to ortho or para. The actual major isomer in chlorobromobenzene: I think that the para isomer is the major product. So for Cl (option 3), the para isomer would have a higher fraction than, say, the o/p directing but activating groups like methyl. Wait, but maybe the activating groups (like methyl) have a higher tendency for para? \n\nWait, perhaps the activating groups (like methyl) lead to a higher yield of the para isomer compared to the deactivating o/p directors. Because activating groups increase the electron density, so maybe the directing effect is stronger? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio between o and p depends on steric factors? For example, in toluene, the methyl group is small, so ortho is possible, but maybe the para isomer is still the major one. \n\nNow, the question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. That is, from the substituent that gives the least para isomer (so meta directing) to the one that gives the most para isomer. \n\nSo first, the meta directors (nitro, ester, etc.) will have the lowest para fractions. \n\nLet's list the substituents as meta or o/p directors:\n\n1. Methyl (o/p directing, activating)\n2. Ethyl ester (meta directing, deactivating)\n3. Chloro (o/p directing, deactivating)\n4. Nitro (meta directing, deactivating)\n5. Ethyl (same as methyl, o/p directing, activating)\n6. Carboxylic acid (COOH) \u2013 wait, carboxylic acid is a deactivating group (since the -COOH is electron-withdrawing via resonance) and meta directing. Because the carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivator and meta director. So option 6 is meta directing. \n\nSo the meta directing groups are 2 (ester), 4 (nitro), 6 (carboxylic acid), and also the nitro is meta. \n\nWait, so for the meta directing groups (2,4,6), their para isomer fractions would be low. The o/p directing groups (1,3,5) have higher para fractions. \n\nNow, among the meta directing groups, the nitro group (4) is a stronger deactivator than the ester (2) or the carboxylic acid (6). Wait, actually, carboxylic acid is a stronger deactivator than ester? Let me think. The order of deactivation for substituents: nitro is the strongest deactivator, then carboxylic acid (COOH) is next, then esters (COOR) are weaker than COOH but still deactivating. Wait, maybe the order is: \n\nDeactivating power: NO2 > COOH > COOR (ester) > Cl. \n\nSo for the meta directors, the order of their directing strength? Wait, all meta directors direct to meta, so their para fraction is low. But maybe between them, the ones with stronger electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) might have even less para isomer, because they are more meta directing? Wait, but all meta directing substituents would direct to meta, so the para isomer would be a minor product. The actual fraction of para would be minimal for all meta directors. So perhaps the order between them isn't as important as between the o/p and meta groups. \n\nWait, but the question wants all six in order. So first, the meta directing ones (2,4,6) will have low para fractions, but among themselves, which is the lowest? The strongest meta director would have the least para? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directing groups have para fractions in the order of their deactivating strength. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the meta directing groups (like nitro, COOH, ester) will all have bromine going to meta, so the para isomer is a minor product. The actual fraction of para would depend on how much the substituent directs away from the para position. Since they are meta directors, the para isomer is disfavored. \n\nWait, but perhaps the stronger the meta director, the less the para isomer. For example, nitro is a strong meta director, so the para isomer's fraction would be very low. Carboxylic acid (COOH) is also a strong meta director, so maybe similar to nitro, but maybe slightly less? And ester (COOC2H5) is a weaker meta director than carboxylic acid, so perhaps the para fraction is a bit higher than COOH but still low. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider the actual order. Let me think of the directing power. The nitro group is a strong meta director, so the bromine would be almost entirely meta, so the para fraction would be very low. The carboxylic acid (COOH) is also a strong meta director, so similar to nitro. The ester (COOC2H5) is a weaker meta director than COOH? Or maybe the same? Because esters are less deactivating than carboxylic acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the meta directing substituents are ordered in terms of their ability to direct to meta. The stronger the meta director, the less the para isomer. So the order from least to most para would be nitro (4) < carboxylic acid (6) < ester (2). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the order is nitro (strongest meta director) has the least para, then COOH, then ester. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directing substituents all have similar fractions, but in the options given, we have to see how they are ordered. Let me check the options. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \n\nHere, 4 (nitro) is first (lowest para), then 2 (ester), then 6 (carboxylic acid). So nitro < ester < COOH. Hmm, that would mean nitro has the least para, then ester, then COOH. But if COOH is a stronger meta director than ester, then maybe COOH would have even less para than ester. But in option A, it's 4 <2 <6, so COOH has more para than ester. Not sure. \n\nOption C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \n\nHere, nitro < COOH < ester. So COOH is weaker than nitro but stronger than ester. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct order among the meta directing groups is nitro (strongest meta director) has least para, then COOH, then ester? Because COOH is stronger than ester in directing to meta. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is nitro > COOH > ester in terms of meta directing strength, so their para fractions (since lower directing strength would mean more para isomer? Wait, no. If a substituent is a stronger meta director, then the meta product is more favored, so the para fraction is lower. So the stronger the meta director, the lower the para fraction. \n\nSo nitro (strongest meta) \u2192 least para. Then COOH (next), then ester (weakest meta director). So the order would be 4 <6 <2 for the meta directors. \n\nThen among the o/p directing substituents (1,3,5), which have higher para fractions. \n\nNow, for the o/p directing substituents:\n\nThe o/p directing groups can be activating (like methyl, ethyl) or deactivating (like Cl). \n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) are ortho/para directing, and typically, for such groups, the para isomer is the major product. However, the deactivating o/p directing group (Cl) may have a different ratio. \n\nWait, in chlorobenzene (option 3), when you brominate it, the major products are ortho and para. But which is more? I think the para isomer is more than ortho here. Because the Cl is deactivating, so maybe the electron density is lower, so the para position (which is farther from Cl) might be more favored? Or maybe the inductive effect of Cl withdraws electrons, making the para position more electron-rich? Hmm, perhaps the resonance effect plays a role here. \n\nAlternatively, in toluene (methyl benzene), the major product is para. The methyl group is activating, so the ring is more electron-rich. The directing effect is ortho/para, so the para isomer is major. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less electron-rich, but the directing is still ortho/para. The para position is less hindered than ortho? Not sure. Wait, the actual major product for chlorobromobenzene is para. Let me recall, in some examples, when a deactivating group is present, the para isomer is favored over ortho. For example, in chlorobenzene, bromination gives more para than ortho. \n\nSo between activating (methyl and ethyl) and deactivating (Cl) o/p directors, which has a higher para fraction? \n\nThe activating groups (like methyl and ethyl) would have a higher electron density, so perhaps the directing effect is stronger, leading to more para? Wait, maybe the activating groups lead to a higher yield of para isomer compared to deactivating o/p directors. \n\nAlternatively, in the case of Cl (option3), the para isomer is major, but maybe not as much as in methyl or ethyl. \n\nSo for the o/p directing substituents:\n\nThe order of their para fractions would be:\n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) have higher para fractions than the deactivating o/p director (Cl). \n\nBetween methyl (1) and ethyl (5), since they are both activating and ortho/para directing, their para fractions might be similar. Since ethyl is a larger group, maybe the steric effect makes ortho less favored? Wait, but ethyl is just a longer chain. Maybe the directing effect is the same, so their para fractions would be similar. \n\nSo among o/p directing substituents:\n\nCl (option3) has lower para fraction than methyl (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nSo the order among the o/p directors would be Cl < methyl/ethyl. \n\nPutting this all together:\n\nMeta directing groups (lowest para first):\n\n4 (nitro) <6 (COOH) <2 (ester) \n\nThen, the next would be the deactivating o/p director (Cl, option3) since it has lower para than activating groups but higher than meta directors. \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5) have the highest para fractions. \n\nSo the order from least to most para isomer fraction is:\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then Cl (3) \u2192 then methyl (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 Wait, but Cl (3) is after 1 and 5, but according to my earlier thought, Cl should be between meta and the activating groups. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn option C: The order is 4 (nitro), then 6 (COOH), then 2 (ester). That would be correct for the meta directors. Then comes 1 and 5 (methyl and ethyl), and finally 3 (Cl). But that would place Cl after the activating groups, which contradicts my earlier thought that Cl (o/p directing, deactivating) has lower para fraction than the activating o/p groups. \n\nHmm, so that can't be right. \n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 So after the meta directors (4,2,6), then comes Cl (3), then 1 and 5. That would fit if Cl has higher para than the meta directors but lower than the activating groups. \n\nWait, let me re-express the order as per my analysis:\n\nOrder from least to most para fraction:\n\n1. nitro (4) [meta director, least para]\n2. COOH (6) [meta director]\n3. ester (2) [meta director]\n4. Cl (3) [o/p deactivating]\n5. methyl (1)\n6. ethyl (5)\n\nSo the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that's not. Option A has 4<2<6<3<1<5. \n\nHmm, my analysis gives 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, which is not exactly any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the order of meta directing groups is different. Let me think again. \n\nThe strength of meta direction: Nitro is the strongest meta director (most meta directing), so the para fraction would be the smallest. Then COOH is next, then ester (COOR). \n\nSo the order of meta directors is 4 <6 <2. \n\nSo the first three are 4,6,2. Then comes Cl (3), which is an o/p director (deactivating), so its para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating o/p. \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5) have the highest para fractions. \n\nSo the full order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. So after the meta directors, it's 1 and 5 before 3. That would be incorrect because Cl (3) should be before them. \n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 So after meta directors, 2 comes before 6? That would be 4 <2 <6, but according to my analysis, 6 should come after 4 but before 2? \n\nHmm, perhaps I got the order of the meta directors wrong. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the order of deactivating groups in terms of directing: \n\nThe meta directing substituents have the following directing strength (meta directing ability):\n\nNitro (NO2) is the strongest meta director, followed by carboxylic acid (COOH), then ester (COOR). \n\nTherefore, their para fractions would be in the order: \n\nNitro (least para) < COOH (next) < ester (most para among meta directors). \n\nSo meta directors: 4 <6 <2. \n\nSo the order of the first three are 4,6,2. \n\nThen comes Cl (3), which is an o/p director (deactivating, so its para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating o/p). \n\nThen the activating o/p directors (1 and 5). \n\nSo the sequence is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 No, because 3 should come before 1 and 5. \n\nOption A:4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 This would have 2 (ester) before 6 (COOH), which contradicts. \n\nHmm, none of the options have the correct order. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of meta directing substituents. \n\nWait, maybe the order of meta directing substituents is different. Let me check the directing effects and deactivating strengths. \n\nThe order of meta directing substituents from strongest to weakest (i.e., most meta directing to least):\n\nNitro group (NO2) is the strongest meta director. \n\nThen comes the carboxylic acid (COOH), then the ester (COOR). \n\nSo their para fractions would be ordered as:\n\nNitro (4) has the least para, then COOH (6), then ester (2). \n\nSo the meta directors in order:4 <6 <2. \n\nTherefore, the first three in the order are 4,6,2. \n\nNow, the next is Cl (3) which is o/p directing (deactivating). \n\nThen the o/p activating substituents (1 and 5) have higher para fractions than Cl. \n\nSo the order would be:\n\n4 (lowest) <6 <2 <3 (Cl) <1 <5. \n\nLooking at the options, this is not present. Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, option B is 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 No. \n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4 \u2192 No. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in the deactivating o/p director (Cl). \n\nWait, maybe the Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than the activating groups? That would change things. \n\nWait, if Cl is a deactivating o/p director, but the directing effect is still o/p. So in chlorobenzene, when you add bromine, the major product is the para isomer. \n\nWait, I think in chlorobromobenzene, the major product is para. So the para isomer's fraction would be higher than in the activating groups. \n\nWait, but activating groups like methyl would make the ring more electron-rich, so the directing effect is stronger, leading to more para? Or maybe the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in activating groups (like methyl), the para isomer is the major product (say 70%), while in Cl, the para isomer is even more (like 80%). \n\nWait, maybe I have that backwards. \n\nWait, let me think of toluene (methyl benzene). The bromination gives mostly para isomer. The exact ratio is like 75% para and 25% ortho. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, when brominated, the para isomer is more than ortho. For example, maybe 80% para and 20% ortho. \n\nSo in that case, Cl would have a higher para fraction than methyl. \n\nWait, that would mean the order between activating and deactivating o/p directors is reversed. \n\nWait, that would change everything. \n\nHmm, so if Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than methyl (option1) and ethyl (option5), then my previous reasoning was wrong. \n\nSo if that's the case, then the order would be:\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) < activating o/p (1,5) < Cl (3)? \n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if Cl's para fraction is higher than activating groups, then the order would be:\n\nmeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then activating groups (1,5) \u2192 then Cl (3) which has highest? \n\nWait, but that contradicts. Wait, let me think again. \n\nIf in toluene (activating group), the para fraction is say 75%, and in chlorobenzene (Cl), it's 80%, then Cl has higher para fraction. Then the order would be: \n\nmeta directors (lowest) \u2192 activating o/p (methyl, ethyl) have lower para than Cl. \n\nWait, so the order would be:\n\nmeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then activating o/p (1,5) \u2192 then Cl (3) is highest? \n\nWait, no. Wait, if Cl has higher para than activating, then Cl is after the activating. \n\nWait, but then the order from least to most would be:\n\n4 (meta) <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 (Cl) \n\nSo Cl would be last, with highest para fraction. \n\nBut that would make option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 No, that's not. \n\nWait, let me look up actual data. \n\nWait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the bromination gives about 70-75% para and 25-30% ortho. \n\nIn chlorobenzene, the bromination gives about 80% para and 20% ortho. \n\nSo the para fraction is higher in chlorobenzene (deactivating o/p director) than in toluene (activating). \n\nTherefore, the Cl (option3) has a higher para fraction than methyl (option1) and ethyl (option5). \n\nThis is a key point I had wrong earlier. So that changes the order. \n\nSo now, the order among the o/p directors would be: \n\ndeactivating o/p (Cl,3) has higher para than activating o/p (1,5). \n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, Cl gives higher para than methyl. \n\nSo the order between o/p directing substituents would be Cl (3) has the highest para fraction, then methyl (1) and ethyl (5) next. \n\nWait, no, wait. If Cl has higher para than methyl, then Cl is higher. \n\nSo the order for o/p directors from least to most para fraction would be:\n\nActivating (methyl, ethyl) have lower para than Cl? \n\nWait no, the para fraction is higher in Cl than in methyl. So the activating groups have lower para than Cl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the para fraction in Cl is higher (80%) than methyl (75%). So Cl has higher para fraction than methyl. \n\nSo the order among the o/p directors would be: \n\nActivating groups (methyl and ethyl) have lower para fractions than Cl (deactivating o/p director). \n\nSo the overall order would be: \n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) have the lowest para fractions. \n\nThen comes the activating o/p directors (1 and5). \n\nThen comes the deactivating o/p director (Cl,3). \n\nWait, but Cl has higher para than the activating groups. \n\nWait, so the order would be: \n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) \u2192 then 1 and5 \u2192 then 3 (Cl) \u2192 but Cl has higher para. \n\nWait, so from least to most, the order would be:\n\n4 (lowest) \u21926 \u21922 \u21921 \u21925 \u21923 (highest). \n\nWait, but that would mean Cl is the highest. \n\nLet me structure this again:\n\nAll substituents are divided into two groups:\n\nMeta directing (4,6,2) \u2192 low para fractions.\n\nOrtho/para directing: \n\n- deactivating (Cl,3) \u2192 high para (80%)\n- activating (1,5) \u2192 lower than Cl (75% for methyl, same or similar for ethyl). \n\nSo the order of the o/p directing substituents from least to most para fraction is:\n\nActivating (1,5) \u2192 then deactivating (3). \n\nThus, overall order:\n\n4 (meta) <6 (meta) <2 (meta) <1 (activating) <5 (activating) <3 (Cl, deactivating o/p, highest para). \n\nSo the sequence is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 exactly this order! \n\nYes! So option C is the correct one. \n\nWait, let me confirm once more:\n\nThe meta directors (4,6,2) are in order 4 (nitro) <6 (COOH) <2 (ester). \n\nThen, the activating o/p (1 and5) are next. \n\nThen Cl (3) is last (highest). \n\nSo the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \u2192 which is option C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n1. **Meta-Directing Groups** (lowest para fraction):\n   - **Nitro (NO\u2082, 4)**: Strongest meta director, leading to the least para fraction.\n   - **Carboxylic Acid (COOH, 6)**: Next strongest meta director.\n   - **Ester (COOC\u2082H\u2085, 2)**: Weakest meta director among these, yielding the highest para fraction among meta-directing groups.\n\n2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups**:\n   - **Deactivating (Cl, 3)**: Chlorine directs to o/p positions with a higher para fraction (e.g., ~80% para) compared to activating groups.\n   - **Activating (CH\u2083, 1 and C\u2082H\u2085, 5)**: Methyl and ethyl groups direct to o/p but yield lower para fractions than Cl (e.g., ~75% para for methyl).\n\nArranged from **lowest to highest para fraction**:\n- Meta-directing: **4 (NO\u2082) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC\u2082H\u2085)**\n- Activating ortho/para: **1 (CH\u2083) < 5 (C\u2082H\u2085)**\n- Deactivating ortho/para: **3 (Cl)**\n\nCombining these gives the order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, matching option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with bromine. Hmm, right, electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. The question mentions that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so maybe the substituent directs the bromine to either ortho/para or meta positions. But since we're talking about the para isomer's yield, I should think about which substituents activate or deactivate the ring and their directing effects.\n\nFirst, let's list out each substance and their substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl group is an activating group and directs the incoming substituent to ortho/para positions. Since there's only one substituent, the bromine will go to either ortho or para. But the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. Wait, but in such cases, the ortho and para positions are equally likely? Or does the methyl group have a preference? Wait, maybe the meta isomer isn't possible here because the methyl is an ortho/para director. Wait, the substituent here is toluene's methyl. So when you add bromine, the major product would be ortho and para. But the question is about the para isomer's yield. The total of ortho and para would be 100%, so the para would be half? Unless there's some steric hindrance or other factors affecting the ratio. Wait, but maybe the question assumes that only one isomer is formed, but that can't be. Wait, the problem states \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe they mean that only one substitution occurs (monobromo), not that there's only one isomer. Hmm, maybe the wording is that each reaction forms only one monobromo isomer, so perhaps the substituents are such that only one position is possible? That might not make sense. Wait, maybe the question is implying that each reaction gives a single product, so perhaps the substituent directs the bromine to only one position (either meta or ortho/para but only one is possible). Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\". Oh, so each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So that must mean that for each of these, the substituent is such that the bromine can only attach in one position. That must be because the substituent is a meta director. Because if it were an ortho/para director, there would be two possible positions (ortho and para). Wait, but maybe in some cases, steric hindrance or other factors prevent one of those? Or perhaps the substituent is in a way that the meta is the only possible position? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that each reaction gives only one monosubstituted product, but not necessarily that all are meta. Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that it strongly directs to one position, so that only the major isomer is considered, and the others are negligible. Then, the \"weight fraction\" would be the proportion of the para isomer compared to the total product. Wait, the question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So if the reaction produces only the para isomer, then the fraction is 100%, but if it produces both ortho and para, then the fraction would be the proportion of para in the total. \n\nAh, right! The problem says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So for each compound, when you brominate it, the para isomer's proportion (as a fraction of all products) is calculated. We need to order them from lowest to highest of that fraction.\n\nSo the key is to figure out for each substituent, what's the ratio of para vs ortho (since meta won't be there unless the substituent is a meta director).\n\nWait, first, let's note the directing effects and activating/deactivating:\n\nSubstances:\n\n1) Toluene (methyl, -CH3): activating, ortho/para director.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester, -COOEt): ester is an electron-withdrawing group, deactivating, and meta director.\n\n3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): Cl is a deactivating group, and it's a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group, but its directing is meta? Let me recall. The halogens are meta directors except for some cases. Wait, actually, the halogens are deactivating, but they are ortho/para directors. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the halogens are deactivating but they are ortho/para directors because the halogen's lone pairs can donate into the ring via resonance. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe directing effect depends on the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate and the type of group. For example:\n\n- Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are ortho/para directors.\n\n- Deactivating groups can be either meta or ortho/para directors. For example, nitro (-NO2) is a strong deactivating group and is a meta director. Halogens (like Cl, Br) are deactivating but are ortho/para directors. Wait, yes. Wait, the halogens have a +M (mesomeric) effect but also -I (inductive). The +M effect (resonance donation) is stronger in activating the ring than the inductive effect. Wait, no, actually, the halogens are deactivating overall but can still direct to ortho/para because of their resonance effect. So Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director. Wait, but I might have to confirm that. Let me see:\n\nNitro is a meta director. Alkoxy (like -OCH3) is ortho/para. \n\nFor halogens like Cl, Br, they are deactivating but are ortho/para directors. So, in chlorobenzene (substance 3), the Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director. So when bromine is added, it can go to ortho or para. So the ratio between ortho and para would depend on other factors like steric hindrance. Wait, but in the case of a single substituent, the ortho and para positions are equally substituted? So in that case, the ortho and para would be equally probable. But maybe in some cases, like when there are other substituents, but here each has only one substituent. So for toluene (substance 1), methyl is ortho/para director, so bromine goes to ortho or para. The ratio between them would be 1:1? So the para fraction would be 50%.\n\nWait, but in some cases, the meta director would direct to only meta, so para would have 0. For meta directing groups, like nitro (substance 4, C6H5-NO2), the nitro group is a meta director, so the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para isomer's weight fraction is 0%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", which suggests that for each substituent, only one product is formed, so perhaps when a meta director is present, the bromine only goes to meta, so the para isomer isn't formed, so its fraction is 0. For ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to ortho or para, but if the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", that must mean that somehow only one position is possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question's wording. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)\". So perhaps each reaction produces only one product. That would mean that in each case, the substituent directs the bromine to a single position. So for meta directors, it would be meta, so the para isomer's fraction is 0. For ortho/para directors, but the substituent is such that only one of those is possible. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is in such a way that the meta position is blocked, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the substituent is itself in a position that makes only one position possible. Wait, but each substituent is on the benzene ring, but the question doesn't mention their positions. Maybe all substituents are in the same position (like all para to each other?), but the question doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to think that the substituent's directing effect determines the possible positions, but in such a way that only one is possible. For example, if a substituent is a meta director, then the bromine can only go to the meta position, so only one product. For ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to either ortho or para, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That would imply that in those cases, the ortho and para positions are equivalent? Wait, but in a benzene ring with one substituent, the ortho positions are two different positions (there are two ortho positions relative to the substituent), but the para is one position. Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so maybe when the substituent is an ortho/para director, the ortho and para positions are symmetric in some way, so that the bromine adds to both ortho and para but the products are the same? No, that can't be. Unless the substituent is in a position where ortho and para are equivalent, but that's only possible if the substituent is in a meta position? Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when you have an ortho/para director, the bromine can go to either ortho or para, but in the case of an excess of bromine, maybe it's a competitive process where the major product is considered. Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so perhaps the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only one position is possible. For example, maybe the substituent is a strong ortho director, so bromine only adds to ortho? But I thought ortho/para directors allow both. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that for some substituents, even though they are ortho/para directors, the actual product is only the para isomer. That would be the case if the substituent is a deactivating ortho/para director, but somehow the para position is more activated?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that activating groups (like methyl) would have a higher proportion of ortho and para, but since they are activating, maybe the meta is less likely. Wait, no, activating groups are ortho/para directors, so meta isn't an option. Wait, the meta is only directed by meta directors. \n\nLet me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, for each substituent, determine if it is a meta director or ortho/para director.\n\n1) Methyl (-CH3): ortho/para director (activating)\n\n2) Ester (-COOEt): esters are deactivating and meta directors. Because the carbonyl group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect via resonance (so +M is not present here?), making them meta directors.\n\nWait, actually, esters are -I and -M (since the carbonyl's double bond can't donate electrons into the ring via resonance?), so they are deactivating and meta directors. So yes, substance 2 (ester) is a meta director.\n\n3) Chloro (-Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para director. Because the Cl has lone pairs that can donate into the ring via resonance, making it an ortho/para director.\n\n4) Nitro (-NO2): strong deactivating, meta director. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and directs meta.\n\n5) Ethyl (-C2H5): same as methyl, so ortho/para director (activating).\n\n6) Carboxylic acid (-COOH): carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group and a meta director. Because the carbonyl and the -OH make it a strong -M and -I, so directs meta.\n\nNow, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer in the product. \n\nFor each substituent:\n\n- If it's a meta director (substances 2,4,6), then the bromine can only go to the meta position. So the para isomer's fraction is 0.\n\nWait, but if it's a meta director, the product is only the meta isomer. So the fraction of para would be zero.\n\nFor ortho/para directors (substances 1,3,5):\n\nIn these cases, the bromine can go to ortho or para positions. The ratio between ortho and para depends on the activating/deactivating nature of the substituent. \n\nWait, but for activating groups (like methyl, ethyl), the ortho and para positions are equally substituted? So the ratio between ortho and para would be 1:1, so the para fraction is 50%.\n\nBut for deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl in substance 3), the directing effect is weaker, so maybe the para position is more favored? Or the ortho?\n\nWait, I think that deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl) have a weaker activating effect, so the ortho position might be less favored because of steric hindrance? Wait, but in terms of electronic effects, maybe the para position is more activated? Let me think.\n\nThe substituent (Cl) is a deactivating group. When adding an electrophile, the Cl's resonance donation (via lone pairs) would activate the ring, but since it's deactivating overall, perhaps the ortho and para positions are activated, but not as much as with activating groups. The directing is still to ortho/para, but the ratio between ortho and para?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio depends on whether the substituent is electron-withdrawing (like Cl) or electron-donating (like methyl). \n\nFor activating groups (ortho/para directors like -CH3), the ortho and para positions are equally activated, so the ratio is 1:1, so the para fraction is 50%.\n\nFor deactivating ortho/para directors (like -Cl), the directing is still to ortho/para, but perhaps the para position is more favored. Because the electron-withdrawing group (Cl) might make the para position more activated compared to the ortho. Wait, why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para position is more substituted in terms of the substituent's influence. Wait, the Cl's resonance effect would donate electrons into the ring, but since it's a deactivating group, perhaps the ortho positions are less activated than the para? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should recall some examples.\n\nTake anisole (methoxybenzene), which is an activating ortho/para director. The product of nitration would have a 1:2 ratio between ortho and para, I think. Wait, actually, methoxy group directs to ortho/para and the major product is ortho and para, with ortho being more than para? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, perhaps the ortho is more substituted because the methoxy group is adjacent. Wait, actually, for activating groups like -OCH3, the ortho position is more activated than the para, leading to a higher yield of ortho isomer. Wait, no, I think I remember that in some cases, the ortho and para are both activated but the ratio depends on the substituent. For example, the methoxy group in anisole gives a higher yield of ortho and para products, with the ortho being more than para? Or maybe they are about equal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the case of activating groups (like -CH3), the ortho and para positions are equally activated, so they are formed in equal amounts. But in deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl), perhaps the para position is more favored.\n\nWait, let me think of the example of chlorobenzene. When bromine is added to chlorobenzene, the product is a mixture of ortho and para isomers. I think that in this case, the para isomer is more predominant. Because the chlorine's electron-withdrawing effect (inductive) might make the ortho positions less activated, so the para is more favored. Wait, but the resonance effect (the +M) from Cl's lone pairs would activate the ortho and para. Hmm, conflicting effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the case of the Cl substituent (a deactivating ortho/para director), the directing is still ortho/para but the ratio is different. For example, in chlorobenzene bromination, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. I think that's correct. Because the chlorine's inductive effect (-I) withdraws electrons, making the ring less electron-rich, so the ortho positions are adjacent to Cl, which is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho positions might be less activated. Meanwhile, the para position is farther from the Cl, so it's more activated. So in that case, the para isomer would be more than ortho. \n\nSo for chlorobenzene (substance 3), the ratio of para to ortho would be higher than 1:1, so the para fraction would be more than 50%. \n\nOn the other hand, for toluene (substance 1), which is an activating group, the ortho and para positions are both highly activated. The ortho position is adjacent to the methyl group, which is electron-donating, so maybe the ortho is even more activated than the para. So the ortho would be more than para, leading to a lower fraction of para (less than 50%). Wait, but I thought for activating groups like methyl, the ratio is 1:2 for ortho:para? Or maybe 1:1?\n\nWait, maybe I should recall specific examples. For anisole (methoxy), the product distribution is about 60% ortho and 40% para. So the ortho is more favored. Similarly, for toluene, the methyl group is a weak activating group, so maybe the ratio is similar. So the para fraction would be lower than 50% for toluene and ethylbenzene (substances 1 and 5). \n\nSo for substance 3 (chlorobenzene), the para fraction is higher than 50%, maybe like 70-80%.\n\nSubstance 5 (ethylbenzene, which is similar to toluene) would have a para fraction similar to toluene, so around 40%?\n\nWait, but I need to get precise here. Let me try to structure this:\n\nSubstances with meta directing groups (2,4,6) will have 0% para fraction.\n\nThe other three (1,3,5) have ortho/para directing groups, so their para fractions are between 0 and 100%. \n\nNow, for those three:\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): deactivating ortho/para director. The para fraction is higher than ortho. Let's say it's ~60% para (assuming para is more than ortho, so higher than 50%).\n\nSubstance 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5): activating ortho/para directors. \n\nFor activating groups, the ortho is more activated than para. For example, in anisole (methoxy), ortho is more. For toluene, the methyl group is weaker than methoxy, so maybe the ortho is still more than para, but the ratio might be less skewed. Let's say toluene has 40% para (so 60% ortho). Similarly for ethyl (substance 5, which is similar to toluene), same as toluene. \n\nSo the para fractions would be:\n\nSubstance 1 (toluene): ~40% para\n\nSubstance 3 (chlorobenzene): ~60% para\n\nSubstance 5 (ethylbenzene): same as toluene, so 40%? Or maybe a bit different? Let's assume 40% for simplicity.\n\nWait, but ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl? No, both are alkyl groups, so ethyl is similar to methyl. So their directing effects are the same. So substance 5 would have the same ratio as 1. \n\nSo now, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest among the ortho/para group (substances 1,3,5):\n\n1 and 5 (40%) < 3 (60%). \n\nSo for the total list, the meta directing substances (2,4,6) have 0% para, so they come first in the order of increasing para fraction. Then the lowest among the ortho/para are 1 and 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). \n\nWait, but the question says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So the lowest fractions first. \n\nThe meta directors (substances 2,4,6) all have 0% para, so they are the first in the order. But which comes first among them? Since they are all 0, but the options have them in different orders. Wait, but the options must have them in some order. Wait, the options list the substances in order like 4<2<6< etc. So perhaps the question expects that the meta directors have 0, so they are the lowest, then the ortho/para ones. But between the meta directors, their actual para fractions are all 0, so they can be ordered arbitrarily? But the options must have them in a specific order. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the meta directors. Let me confirm again:\n\nSubstances with meta directing substituents are 2 (ester), 4 (nitro), and 6 (carboxylic acid). \n\nFor these, the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para isomer's fraction is 0. So all three (2,4,6) have 0% para.\n\nTherefore, their order among themselves doesn't matter for the increasing order, since they are all 0. But in the options, they are ordered in different sequences. For instance, option A starts with 4<2<6<..., option C has 4<6<2..., etc. So perhaps there's an error in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that meta directors give only meta, so the para fraction is zero. But maybe the question is considering that even meta directors might have some ortho/para products? That can't be. The meta directors (like nitro group) direct the substituent to the meta position only, so there's no ortho or para product. So the para fraction is 0. \n\nTherefore, all three (2,4,6) have 0. So in the order, they must come first. But the options list them in different orders. Hmm. Wait, the options must have an order that includes all of them in the lower part. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nLooking at the options, the first three in each option are the meta directors (since they have 0% para). For example, option A starts with 4,2,6; option B starts with 6,2,4; option C starts with 4,6,2; option D starts with 3 (which is an ortho/para director, so that can't be). So option D is invalid because 3 (Cl) has a higher fraction (60%). So D is out.\n\nNow, among the meta directors (2,4,6), their order among themselves in the options can vary. Since all have 0, but the options must have a specific order, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake with the directing effect of the carboxylic acid (substance 6, COOH). The carboxylic acid is a strong meta director, so it directs to meta, so para fraction is 0. The nitro (4) is also a meta director, so 0. The ester (2) is also meta, so 0. So all three have 0. So their order between themselves doesn't matter for the increasing sequence. But the options have different orders. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong about one of the substituents' directing effects. Let me check each again:\n\nSubstance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester). The ester group (-COOR) is a meta director. Yes, because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance (so no +M), making it a meta director.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro group, definitely meta director.\n\nSubstance 6: carboxylic acid (-COOH) is a meta director. Yes, because the -COOH group is strongly electron-withdrawing and directs meta.\n\nSo all three (2,4,6) are meta directors. So their para fractions are 0. \n\nNow, the next in the order are the ortho/para directors (substances 1,3,5). \n\nFor those, their para fractions are as follows:\n\nSubstance 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5): activating ortho/para directors. The ratio of para to total (ortho + para) is less than 50%, so their para fractions are around 40% each.\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): deactivating ortho/para director. The ratio here is higher, so para fraction is ~60%.\n\nSo the order from lowest to highest among the ortho/para group is 1 and 5 (40%) < 3 (60%). \n\nPutting it all together, the overall order of increasing para fraction is:\n\nMeta directors (0%) first: 2,4,6 (in any order) \u2192 then 1 and 5 (40%) \u2192 then 3 (60%).\n\nNow, looking at the options, the first three must be the meta directors. Let's see the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 the first three are 4,2,6 (all meta, so okay). Then comes 3 (Cl, which is ortho/para, 60%), then 1 and 5 (40%). Wait, but 1 and 5 should come before 3. So in option A, the order after the meta directors is 3 (60%) before 1 and 5 (40%), which would be wrong. Because 40% is less than 60%, so 1 and 5 should come before 3.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 first three are 6,2,4 (meta). Then 5 (40%) then 1 (40%) then 3 (60%). Wait, but 5 and 1 are equal, so they can be in any order. But 5 is written before 1, but since they are equal, that's okay. Then 3 (60%) comes after. So the order after the meta directors is 5,1,3. Which is correct (since 40% < 40% < 60%? Wait no, 5 and 1 have same 40%, so they are equal, so they can be ordered as 5<1 or 1<5. But in option B, it's 5 before 1, then 3. That works. But the first three are 6,2,4. \n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 first three: 4,6,2 (meta). Then 1 (40%), 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). Correct order.\n\nOption D: starts with 3 (Cl), which is 60%, so wrong.\n\nSo between options A, B, C:\n\nOption A has after meta directors: 3 (60%), then 1 and 5 (40%). That's incorrect because 3 is higher than 1/5.\n\nOption B has after meta directors: 5,1 (40%), then 3 (60%). Correct.\n\nOption C has the same as B except the order between 5 and 1 doesn't matter. So the order in C is 4<6<2 (meta), then 1 (40%), 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). Which is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says \"increasing the weight fraction\", so the correct order should be the meta directors (0%) first, then the 40% (1 and 5), then 60% (3). So between B and C.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B's full order is 6 < 2 <4 <5 <1 <3 \u2192 which is meta directors (6,2,4) then 5 (40%), then 1 (40%), then 3 (60%). \n\nOption C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \u2192 same meta order (4,6,2) then 1 (40), 5 (40), then 3 (60). Both B and C have the correct meta first, then the 40% group, then 60%.\n\nBut the options must have the correct order. Let's check the options again.\n\nWait, the problem is in the options given. Let me recheck the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 after meta (4,2,6), the next is 3 (60%), then 1 (40%), which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 after meta (6,2,4), next is 5 (40), then 1 (40), then 3 (60). Correct.\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 same meta, then 1 (40), 5 (40), then 3 (60). Correct.\n\nOption D is invalid.\n\nNow, which of B or C is correct?\n\nThe question requires the order from lowest to highest. The meta directors are all 0. Then comes the ortho/para directors with 40% (1 and 5), then 60% (3).\n\nBetween options B and C, the difference is the order of the meta directors themselves (the first three). Since their fractions are all 0, their order among themselves doesn't affect the increasing sequence. So any order of 2,4,6 is acceptable as long as they are first.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B starts with 6,2,4 (meta) \u2192 then 5,1,3.\n\nOption C starts with 4,6,2 (meta), then 1,5,3.\n\nBoth are valid in terms of the increasing order, but the question expects one of them. \n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that all meta directors have 0. Maybe the question considers that meta directors can have some para? No, that contradicts the directing effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the directing effect of one of the substituents. Let me check substance 2 again: C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester). Is the ester group a meta director? Yes. Because the ester's carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance, so it can't donate electrons into the ring, making it a meta director. So substance 2 is meta.\n\nSubstance 6 is carboxylic acid (COOH), which is also a strong meta director.\n\nSubstance 4 is nitro, definitely meta.\n\nThus, their order among themselves can be in any order, but the options have them in different sequences. \n\nLooking at the options, let's see which of B or C is present in the choices.\n\nThe correct order after the meta directors is 1 and 5 (40%) before 3 (60%). \n\nIn option B, after meta, the next is 5 (40%) then 1 (40%). Since they are equal, that's okay. \n\nIn option C, after meta, it's 1 then 5 (same as B, just swapped). \n\nThe problem is the first three elements (the meta directors):\n\nOption B lists them as 6 < 2 <4.\n\nOption C lists them as 4 <6 <2.\n\nThe question doesn't give any reason to prefer one order of the meta directors over another, since they all have the same fraction (0). But perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.\n\nWait a second! Wait, maybe I made a mistake with substance 6 (COOH). Let me think again: carboxylic acid is a meta director, so its para fraction is 0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the carboxylic acid group again. The -COOH group has a -I effect and also a -M effect (since the oxygen's lone pairs can't donate into the ring due to the adjacent carbonyl group). So it's a strong meta director. So yes, substance 6 is meta.\n\nNow, the problem might be that the question is considering the actual yield's weight fraction, but perhaps in some cases, the para isomer is not formed at all (0), but others have some fraction. \n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, this is critical. The question says that each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So for substances with meta directors (2,4,6), the product is the meta isomer. For the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the product is either ortho or para. But the problem states that \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so in those cases (1,3,5), the substituent must direct to only one position. \n\nWait, this changes everything! Oh no! I completely misread that part. \n\nThe problem says: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\". So each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So the substituent must direct the bromine to only one position. \n\nThis means that for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one isomer is formed. \n\nTherefore, the meta directors (2,4,6) would form only the meta isomer, so their para fraction is 0. \n\nFor the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the substituent must direct to either ortho or para only. \n\nWait, but how? Because ortho/para directors usually allow both positions. Unless there's another factor. \n\nAh, perhaps the question is implying that the substituent is such that the meta is not possible (like if the substituent is already in a position that blocks meta?), but no, each substituent is on a benzene ring, and the question doesn't specify their positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in cases of ortho/para directors, the substituent's electronic effect makes one position more favorable than the other to such an extent that only that isomer is formed. \n\nFor example, in toluene (substance 1), the methyl group is an ortho/para director. But maybe the methyl group's activating effect makes the ortho position more favorable than para, so only ortho is formed? But then the para would have 0%, conflicting with the previous thought. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, the para is more favored. \n\nWait, this requires knowing for each ortho/para director whether it directs to ortho or para predominantly enough that only one product is formed. \n\nSo let's reevaluate:\n\nSubstances 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl) are ortho/para directors. \n\nFor these, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so the substituent must direct to either ortho or para exclusively. \n\nSo for each of these three, we need to determine whether the substituent directs to ortho or para.\n\nFor activating groups (methyl and ethyl):\n\nActivating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors. The directing is to ortho and para, but which is more favored?\n\nIn the case of toluene (methyl), the major product is the ortho and para isomers. However, in some cases, the para isomer might be the only one formed under certain conditions? But in reality, both are formed. \n\nWait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, implying that for each substituent, the directing is so strong that only one position is possible. \n\nPerhaps for activating groups (methyl and ethyl), the ortho position is more activated, so the bromine adds there, leading to only the ortho isomer. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. For example, in anisole (methoxy), which is an activating ortho/para director, the major products are ortho and para. If the question says only one is formed, then maybe in some cases, like with stronger activating groups, only ortho is formed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) directs to para only. \n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\n- Activating ortho/para directors (methyl and ethyl) direct to ortho only. \n\n- Deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl) direct to para only. \n\nThis would mean:\n\nSubstance 1 (methyl) \u2192 only ortho \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl) \u2192 only para \u2192 para fraction 100%.\n\nSubstance 5 (ethyl) \u2192 only ortho \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nSubstance 2,4,6 (meta directors) \u2192 meta \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nWait, but then substances 1 and 5 would have 0% para, same as the meta directors. So the order would have 1 and 5 among the meta group. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, this suggests I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that for ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) direct to both ortho and para, but since the question says only one is formed, maybe the question assumes that the major product is considered, so the one with higher yield is the only one. \n\nFor example, for toluene, the major product is ortho (so the para is only minor, so considered not formed?), leading to para fraction 0. \n\nFor chlorobenzene (Cl), the major product is para (so the ortho is minor, so considered not formed \u2192 para fraction 100%). \n\nThen:\n\nSubstance 1 (toluene): ortho only \u2192 para fraction 0%\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): para only \u2192 100%\n\nSubstance 5 (ethyl): same as toluene \u2192 0%\n\nSubstance 2,4,6: meta \u2192 0%\n\nThus, the substances with para fraction:\n\n2,4,6,1,5 (0%), and 3 (100%). \n\nThen the order of increasing para fraction would be all the 0% first, then 3 (100%). So the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 < 3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 yes, after the meta group (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and 5 (0%). But this would be incorrect because 3 has higher than the others.\n\nWait, but in this case, the correct order would be all the 0% first, then 3. The options have option A as 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 which is correct in that 3 comes after the meta group and before the 0% substances? No, because 1 and 5 are also 0%. So option A would have the 0% group first (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and 5 (0%) which would be wrong because they should be before 3. \n\nHmm, this approach isn't aligning with the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that activating groups direct to ortho only and deactivating to para only is incorrect, and instead, the para isomer is formed preferentially for deactivating groups and ortho for activating. \n\nIf that's the case:\n\n- Activating (methyl, ethyl): ortho only \u2192 0% para.\n\n- Deactivating (Cl): para only \u2192 100% para.\n\nSo then, the order is:\n\nMeta directors (0%), then activating (0%), then Cl (100%).\n\nThus, the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 < 3.\n\nLooking at the options again, the only one that places 3 last is option A and B and C. \n\nOption A: ... then 3 comes before 1 and 5, which is wrong.\n\nOption B: after meta, 5 and 1 (0%) then 3 (100%).\n\nOption C: after meta, 1 and 5 then 3 (100%).\n\nSo options B and C are correct in that 3 is last. \n\nBetween B and C:\n\nOption B: the meta directors are ordered 6<2<4. \n\nOption C: meta ordered 4<6<2.\n\nThe question doesn't give any reason to order the meta directors in a particular sequence among themselves since they all have 0%. \n\nLooking at the options given, perhaps the correct order is the one where the meta directors are in the order of their directing strength or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the actual yield's weight fraction, but I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the question assumes that for ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) give a mixture of ortho and para, so the para fraction is 50% (assuming equal distribution), \n\n- Deactivating (Cl) gives more para, say 70%,\n\nThus, the order would be meta (0%), then activating (50%), then Cl (70%).\n\nIn this case, the ortho/para directors would be ordered 1 and 5 (50%) before 3 (70%). \n\nThen the correct option must have the meta directors first, then 1 and/or5, then 3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: after meta comes 3 (70%) which is wrong.\n\nOption B: after meta, 5 (50%), then 1 (50%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nOption C: after meta, 1 (50%) then 5 (50%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nSo both B and C are correct in terms of the overall order. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe question asks for increasing order of the para fraction. \n\nThe meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%, so they come first. \n\nBetween B and C, the order of the meta directors (the first three) doesn't matter. \n\nThe next part is the ortho/para directors with 50% (substances 1 and 5), then 3 (70%). \n\nIn option B, after the meta directors (6,2,4), comes 5 (50%) then 1 (50%). \n\nIn option C, after meta (4,6,2), comes 1 (50%) then 5 (50%). \n\nBoth are acceptable. \n\nNow, the options given include both B and C. The question must have one correct answer. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that activating groups give 50% para. Let me think again. \n\nIf the activating groups (methyl, ethyl) are ortho/para directors and the substituent is such that the ortho and para positions are equally activated, then the para fraction would be 50%. \n\nBut perhaps the actual ratio is different. \n\nFor example, in toluene (methyl), the product distribution is about 2:1 for ortho:para? Or is it 1:2?\n\nWait, according to some sources, the nitration of toluene gives about 2:1 ratio of ortho:para. So the para isomer would be about 33% of the total (since ortho is 2 parts, para 1 part, total 3 parts \u2192 33% para). \n\nIf that's the case, then for toluene (substance 1) the para fraction is 33%, and for ethylbenzene (5) same. \n\nChlorobenzene (3) would have a higher para fraction, say 70%. \n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) 0%.\n\nThus the order would be:\n\nmeta (0%) \u2192 toluene and ethyl (33%) \u2192 Cl (70%).\n\nThen the correct order would be meta first, then 1 and 5, then 3. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption B: after meta comes 5 (33%), then 1 (33%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nOption C: after meta comes 1 (33%), then 5 (33%), then 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nBoth B and C are correct in this scenario. \n\nBut the options might have one correct answer. \n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC)4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD)3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe difference between B and C is the order of the meta directors first and the order of 1 and 5. \n\nThe question might expect the meta directors to be ordered in a particular way based on their deactivating strength. \n\nNitro (4) is a stronger deactivating group than ester (2) and carboxylic acid (6)? Or perhaps carboxylic acid is stronger than nitro?\n\nWait, the order of deactivating strength:\n\nNitro (-NO2) is the strongest deactivating group, followed by carboxylic acid (-COOH), then ester (-COOR), then halogens (-Cl), etc. \n\nSo nitro (4) is the strongest, then carboxylic acid (6), then ester (2). \n\nThus, their deactivating power is 4>6>2. \n\nThe directing effect is meta, but their deactivating strength doesn't affect the para fraction here (since they all give 0%). But the question's options might have them ordered based on their deactivating strength. \n\nIf the question expects them to be in order of increasing deactivating strength (weakest to strongest), then the order would be 2 (ester) <6 (carboxylic acid)<4 (nitro). \n\nSo the meta directors in increasing order of deactivating strength (i.e., weaker first) would be 2 <6<4. \n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B has them ordered 6<2<4 \u2192 which is 6 (carboxylic) first, then ester, then nitro. That's not increasing strength. \n\nOption C has them as 4<6<2 \u2192 nitro first, then carboxylic, then ester. Which is the opposite of strength. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is not considering that. \n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the para fraction. Since all meta directors have 0, their order doesn't matter. \n\nGiven that both B and C are possible, but the options must have one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. \n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". \n\nFor meta directors, the yield of the para isomer is zero. \n\nFor ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (1 and 5) give a mixture of ortho and para. Assuming equal distribution (50% para), but if the actual yield is lower (like 33%), then their para fraction is 33%, and Cl's is higher (like 66% or 70%). \n\nIf the question's options have B and C as possible, but the given options might have the correct one as option C. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) first, then 1 and5 (33% each), then 3 (66%).\n\nThis fits the order of increasing fraction: 0%, 0%,0%, then 33%, 33%, then 66%.\n\nSo this is correct. \n\nOption B has after meta 5,1 (33%), then 3 (66%). Also correct. \n\nThe difference is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe question's options might have the correct order as option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directors' order is based on their actual directing strength's effect on the para fraction. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the Cl. Let me think again:\n\nChlorobenzene is a deactivating ortho/para director. The directing is to ortho/para. The question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in chlorobenzene's case, the para position is the only one formed (due to the deactivating nature making the para more favored than ortho). So the para fraction is 100%. \n\nIn that case, the order would be meta (0%), then activating (0% for ortho only), then Cl (100%). \n\nWait, but then activating groups would have ortho only (0% para), so their para fraction is 0%, same as meta. \n\nThus, the order would be all meta, activating (1 and 5), then Cl (100%). \n\nSo the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 <3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A has after meta (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and5 (0%). That's wrong because 1 and5 should be before 3. \n\nOption B has after meta (6,2,4), then 5 and1 (0%), then 3 (100%). This is correct. \n\nOption C has after meta (4,6,2), then 1 and5 (0%), then 3. \n\nThus, options B and C are correct in this case. \n\nThe difference is the order of meta directors. \n\nAssuming that the meta directors should be ordered from weakest to strongest deactivating:\n\nEster (2) is weaker than carboxylic (6), which is weaker than nitro (4). So order of meta directors by deactivating strength (from weakest to strongest): 2 <6 <4. \n\nThus, the correct order of meta directors is 2,6,4 \u2192 but none of the options have that. \n\nAlternatively, the order is alphabetical? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on standard directing effects.\n\nWait, let me think of the standard electrophilic substitution directing effects:\n\nMeta directors (0% para):\n\n- NO2 (4), COOH (6), COOR (2) \u2192 all meta.\n\nOrtho/para directors:\n\n- CH3 (1), Cl (3), C2H5 (5).\n\nFor Cl (3), as a deactivating ortho/para director, the para isomer is the major product. So the para fraction is high (like 70%).\n\nFor activating groups (1 and 5), the ortho isomer is major, so para fraction is low (like 30%).\n\nThus the order from lowest to highest is:\n\nMeta (0%), then 1 and5 (30%), then 3 (70%).\n\nSo the correct order must have the meta directors first, then 1 and5, then 3. \n\nThe options:\n\nOption B: 6<2<4 (meta) then 5,1 (30%), then3 (70%). \n\nOption C:4<6<2 (meta), then1 (30%),5 (30%), then3 (70%).\n\nBoth B and C are correct. \n\nThe difference is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe question's options must have one correct answer. Looking at the options given in the problem, perhaps the correct answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para fraction for Cl is higher than both activating and meta, so it's the highest, which fits. \n\nBetween B and C, the order of the meta directors doesn't affect the increasing order of the entire sequence. \n\nThe problem might have the correct answer as option C. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the options, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have the following:\n\nThe substances with meta directors have 0% para. \n\nFor the others:\n\n- The deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) has higher para fraction than the activating ones. \n\nSo the order is meta (0%) < activating (30%) < Cl (70%).\n\nThus, the correct order is:\n\nmeta (2,4,6) <1,5 <3. \n\nThe option that matches this is option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3. \n\nBecause after the meta group (4,6,2), then comes 1 and5 (30%), then3 (70%). \n\nThus the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, option B also fits but the order of the meta directors may not matter. \n\nThe question's options might have option C as correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the para fraction for Cl is higher than activating. \n\nWait, let me think of actual examples:\n\nFor chlorobenzene, when brominated, the major product is the para isomer. The ortho isomer is less favored because of steric hindrance or electronic effects. \n\nThe ratio between ortho and para in chlorobromobenzene is about 1:3, so the para fraction is about 75%. \n\nFor toluene, the ortho:para ratio in nitration is about 2:1, so para is 33%. \n\nThus the para fractions are:\n\n1 (33%),5 (33%),3 (75%).\n\nSo the order is meta (0%) <1 and5 (33%) <3 (75%). \n\nThe correct option must have this order. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 yes. \n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 yes. \n\nBoth are correct, but the question's options must have one. \n\nThe first three (meta directors) in option C are 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt). \n\nThe order of the meta directors here is based on their deactivating strength. NO2 is stronger than COOH? \n\nWait, nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid. \n\nThe deactivating order is:\n\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. \n\nThus, the meta directors in order from strongest to weakest deactivating are: 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt). \n\nThus, if the question orders them by increasing deactivating power (weakest first), it would be 2 <6 <4. \n\nBut in option C, the meta directors are ordered 4<6<2 \u2192 which is strongest first, then next, then weakest. \n\nOption B orders them as6<2<4 \u2192 which is COOH first, then ester, then nitro \u2192 this is also not weakest to strongest. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe question doesn't mention anything about the strength of the substituent's effect, just the para fraction. Since all meta directors have 0% para, their order among themselves doesn't affect the increasing order of the entire list. \n\nThus, both B and C are correct in terms of the overall order. \n\nBut the given options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is \"4<6<2<1<5<3\". \n\nOption B is \"6<2<4<5<1<3\".\n\nThe correct order should be the meta directors first in any order, then 1 and5, then3. \n\nThe problem's options likely consider that the correct answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option A. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the activating groups. \n\nWait, for activating groups (methyl and ethyl), the directing is to ortho and para. The major product is the ortho isomer, so the para fraction would be less than 50%, say 33%. \n\nThe deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) has a higher para fraction (say 66%). \n\nThus the order is meta (0%) < activating (33%) < Cl (66%). \n\nThe correct option must have this. \n\nOption C has 4<6<2 (meta) then 1,5 (33%), then3 (66%). \n\nOption B has 6<2<4 (meta), then5,1 (33%), then3 (66%). \n\nBoth are correct. \n\nThe difference between them is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe problem's options might have the answer as option C. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option C. \n\nBased on the given options and the analysis, I'll go with option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the order of these substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo electrophilic substitution with bromine. Hmm, right, electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. The question mentions that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so maybe the substituent directs the bromine to either ortho/para or meta positions. But since we're talking about the para isomer's yield, I should think about which substituents activate or deactivate the ring and their directing effects.\n\nFirst, let's list out each substance and their substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl group is an activating group and directs the incoming substituent to ortho/para positions. Since there's only one substituent, the bromine will go to either ortho or para. But the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. Wait, but in such cases, the ortho and para positions are equally likely? Or does the methyl group have a preference? Wait, maybe the meta isomer isn't possible here because the methyl is an ortho/para director. Wait, the substituent here is toluene's methyl. So when you add bromine, the major product would be ortho and para. But the question is about the para isomer's yield. The total of ortho and para would be 100%, so the para would be half? Unless there's some steric hindrance or other factors affecting the ratio. Wait, but maybe the question assumes that only one isomer is formed, but that can't be. Wait, the problem states \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe they mean that only one substitution occurs (monobromo), not that there's only one isomer. Hmm, maybe the wording is that each reaction forms only one monobromo isomer, so perhaps the substituents are such that only one position is possible? That might not make sense. Wait, maybe the question is implying that each reaction gives a single product, so perhaps the substituent directs the bromine to only one position (either meta or ortho/para but only one is possible). Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\". Oh, so each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So that must mean that for each of these, the substituent is such that the bromine can only attach in one position. That must be because the substituent is a meta director. Because if it were an ortho/para director, there would be two possible positions (ortho and para). Wait, but maybe in some cases, steric hindrance or other factors prevent one of those? Or perhaps the substituent is in a way that the meta is the only possible position? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that each reaction gives only one monosubstituted product, but not necessarily that all are meta. Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that it strongly directs to one position, so that only the major isomer is considered, and the others are negligible. Then, the \"weight fraction\" would be the proportion of the para isomer compared to the total product. Wait, the question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So if the reaction produces only the para isomer, then the fraction is 100%, but if it produces both ortho and para, then the fraction would be the proportion of para in the total. \n\nAh, right! The problem says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So for each compound, when you brominate it, the para isomer's proportion (as a fraction of all products) is calculated. We need to order them from lowest to highest of that fraction.\n\nSo the key is to figure out for each substituent, what's the ratio of para vs ortho (since meta won't be there unless the substituent is a meta director).\n\nWait, first, let's note the directing effects and activating/deactivating:\n\nSubstances:\n\n1) Toluene (methyl, -CH3): activating, ortho/para director.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester, -COOEt): ester is an electron-withdrawing group, deactivating, and meta director.\n\n3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): Cl is a deactivating group, and it's a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group, but its directing is meta? Let me recall. The halogens are meta directors except for some cases. Wait, actually, the halogens are deactivating, but they are ortho/para directors. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the halogens are deactivating but they are ortho/para directors because the halogen's lone pairs can donate into the ring via resonance. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe directing effect depends on the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate and the type of group. For example:\n\n- Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are ortho/para directors.\n\n- Deactivating groups can be either meta or ortho/para directors. For example, nitro (-NO2) is a strong deactivating group and is a meta director. Halogens (like Cl, Br) are deactivating but are ortho/para directors. Wait, yes. Wait, the halogens have a +M (mesomeric) effect but also -I (inductive). The +M effect (resonance donation) is stronger in activating the ring than the inductive effect. Wait, no, actually, the halogens are deactivating overall but can still direct to ortho/para because of their resonance effect. So Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director. Wait, but I might have to confirm that. Let me see:\n\nNitro is a meta director. Alkoxy (like -OCH3) is ortho/para. \n\nFor halogens like Cl, Br, they are deactivating but are ortho/para directors. So, in chlorobenzene (substance 3), the Cl is a deactivating ortho/para director. So when bromine is added, it can go to ortho or para. So the ratio between ortho and para would depend on other factors like steric hindrance. Wait, but in the case of a single substituent, the ortho and para positions are equally substituted? So in that case, the ortho and para would be equally probable. But maybe in some cases, like when there are other substituents, but here each has only one substituent. So for toluene (substance 1), methyl is ortho/para director, so bromine goes to ortho or para. The ratio between them would be 1:1? So the para fraction would be 50%.\n\nWait, but in some cases, the meta director would direct to only meta, so para would have 0. For meta directing groups, like nitro (substance 4, C6H5-NO2), the nitro group is a meta director, so the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para isomer's weight fraction is 0%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", which suggests that for each substituent, only one product is formed, so perhaps when a meta director is present, the bromine only goes to meta, so the para isomer isn't formed, so its fraction is 0. For ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to ortho or para, but if the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", that must mean that somehow only one position is possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question's wording. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)\". So perhaps each reaction produces only one product. That would mean that in each case, the substituent directs the bromine to a single position. So for meta directors, it would be meta, so the para isomer's fraction is 0. For ortho/para directors, but the substituent is such that only one of those is possible. Wait, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is in such a way that the meta position is blocked, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the substituent is itself in a position that makes only one position possible. Wait, but each substituent is on the benzene ring, but the question doesn't mention their positions. Maybe all substituents are in the same position (like all para to each other?), but the question doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to think that the substituent's directing effect determines the possible positions, but in such a way that only one is possible. For example, if a substituent is a meta director, then the bromine can only go to the meta position, so only one product. For ortho/para directors, the bromine can go to either ortho or para, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. That would imply that in those cases, the ortho and para positions are equivalent? Wait, but in a benzene ring with one substituent, the ortho positions are two different positions (there are two ortho positions relative to the substituent), but the para is one position. Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so maybe when the substituent is an ortho/para director, the ortho and para positions are symmetric in some way, so that the bromine adds to both ortho and para but the products are the same? No, that can't be. Unless the substituent is in a position where ortho and para are equivalent, but that's only possible if the substituent is in a meta position? Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when you have an ortho/para director, the bromine can go to either ortho or para, but in the case of an excess of bromine, maybe it's a competitive process where the major product is considered. Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so perhaps the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only one position is possible. For example, maybe the substituent is a strong ortho director, so bromine only adds to ortho? But I thought ortho/para directors allow both. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that for some substituents, even though they are ortho/para directors, the actual product is only the para isomer. That would be the case if the substituent is a deactivating ortho/para director, but somehow the para position is more activated?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that activating groups (like methyl) would have a higher proportion of ortho and para, but since they are activating, maybe the meta is less likely. Wait, no, activating groups are ortho/para directors, so meta isn't an option. Wait, the meta is only directed by meta directors. \n\nLet me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, for each substituent, determine if it is a meta director or ortho/para director.\n\n1) Methyl (-CH3): ortho/para director (activating)\n\n2) Ester (-COOEt): esters are deactivating and meta directors. Because the carbonyl group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect via resonance (so +M is not present here?), making them meta directors.\n\nWait, actually, esters are -I and -M (since the carbonyl's double bond can't donate electrons into the ring via resonance?), so they are deactivating and meta directors. So yes, substance 2 (ester) is a meta director.\n\n3) Chloro (-Cl): deactivating, but ortho/para director. Because the Cl has lone pairs that can donate into the ring via resonance, making it an ortho/para director.\n\n4) Nitro (-NO2): strong deactivating, meta director. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and directs meta.\n\n5) Ethyl (-C2H5): same as methyl, so ortho/para director (activating).\n\n6) Carboxylic acid (-COOH): carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group and a meta director. Because the carbonyl and the -OH make it a strong -M and -I, so directs meta.\n\nNow, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer in the product. \n\nFor each substituent:\n\n- If it's a meta director (substances 2,4,6), then the bromine can only go to the meta position. So the para isomer's fraction is 0.\n\nWait, but if it's a meta director, the product is only the meta isomer. So the fraction of para would be zero.\n\nFor ortho/para directors (substances 1,3,5):\n\nIn these cases, the bromine can go to ortho or para positions. The ratio between ortho and para depends on the activating/deactivating nature of the substituent. \n\nWait, but for activating groups (like methyl, ethyl), the ortho and para positions are equally substituted? So the ratio between ortho and para would be 1:1, so the para fraction is 50%.\n\nBut for deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl in substance 3), the directing effect is weaker, so maybe the para position is more favored? Or the ortho?\n\nWait, I think that deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl) have a weaker activating effect, so the ortho position might be less favored because of steric hindrance? Wait, but in terms of electronic effects, maybe the para position is more activated? Let me think.\n\nThe substituent (Cl) is a deactivating group. When adding an electrophile, the Cl's resonance donation (via lone pairs) would activate the ring, but since it's deactivating overall, perhaps the ortho and para positions are activated, but not as much as with activating groups. The directing is still to ortho/para, but the ratio between ortho and para?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio depends on whether the substituent is electron-withdrawing (like Cl) or electron-donating (like methyl). \n\nFor activating groups (ortho/para directors like -CH3), the ortho and para positions are equally activated, so the ratio is 1:1, so the para fraction is 50%.\n\nFor deactivating ortho/para directors (like -Cl), the directing is still to ortho/para, but perhaps the para position is more favored. Because the electron-withdrawing group (Cl) might make the para position more activated compared to the ortho. Wait, why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the para position is more substituted in terms of the substituent's influence. Wait, the Cl's resonance effect would donate electrons into the ring, but since it's a deactivating group, perhaps the ortho positions are less activated than the para? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should recall some examples.\n\nTake anisole (methoxybenzene), which is an activating ortho/para director. The product of nitration would have a 1:2 ratio between ortho and para, I think. Wait, actually, methoxy group directs to ortho/para and the major product is ortho and para, with ortho being more than para? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, perhaps the ortho is more substituted because the methoxy group is adjacent. Wait, actually, for activating groups like -OCH3, the ortho position is more activated than the para, leading to a higher yield of ortho isomer. Wait, no, I think I remember that in some cases, the ortho and para are both activated but the ratio depends on the substituent. For example, the methoxy group in anisole gives a higher yield of ortho and para products, with the ortho being more than para? Or maybe they are about equal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the case of activating groups (like -CH3), the ortho and para positions are equally activated, so they are formed in equal amounts. But in deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl), perhaps the para position is more favored.\n\nWait, let me think of the example of chlorobenzene. When bromine is added to chlorobenzene, the product is a mixture of ortho and para isomers. I think that in this case, the para isomer is more predominant. Because the chlorine's electron-withdrawing effect (inductive) might make the ortho positions less activated, so the para is more favored. Wait, but the resonance effect (the +M) from Cl's lone pairs would activate the ortho and para. Hmm, conflicting effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the case of the Cl substituent (a deactivating ortho/para director), the directing is still ortho/para but the ratio is different. For example, in chlorobenzene bromination, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. I think that's correct. Because the chlorine's inductive effect (-I) withdraws electrons, making the ring less electron-rich, so the ortho positions are adjacent to Cl, which is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho positions might be less activated. Meanwhile, the para position is farther from the Cl, so it's more activated. So in that case, the para isomer would be more than ortho. \n\nSo for chlorobenzene (substance 3), the ratio of para to ortho would be higher than 1:1, so the para fraction would be more than 50%. \n\nOn the other hand, for toluene (substance 1), which is an activating group, the ortho and para positions are both highly activated. The ortho position is adjacent to the methyl group, which is electron-donating, so maybe the ortho is even more activated than the para. So the ortho would be more than para, leading to a lower fraction of para (less than 50%). Wait, but I thought for activating groups like methyl, the ratio is 1:2 for ortho:para? Or maybe 1:1?\n\nWait, maybe I should recall specific examples. For anisole (methoxy), the product distribution is about 60% ortho and 40% para. So the ortho is more favored. Similarly, for toluene, the methyl group is a weak activating group, so maybe the ratio is similar. So the para fraction would be lower than 50% for toluene and ethylbenzene (substances 1 and 5). \n\nSo for substance 3 (chlorobenzene), the para fraction is higher than 50%, maybe like 70-80%.\n\nSubstance 5 (ethylbenzene, which is similar to toluene) would have a para fraction similar to toluene, so around 40%?\n\nWait, but I need to get precise here. Let me try to structure this:\n\nSubstances with meta directing groups (2,4,6) will have 0% para fraction.\n\nThe other three (1,3,5) have ortho/para directing groups, so their para fractions are between 0 and 100%. \n\nNow, for those three:\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): deactivating ortho/para director. The para fraction is higher than ortho. Let's say it's ~60% para (assuming para is more than ortho, so higher than 50%).\n\nSubstance 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5): activating ortho/para directors. \n\nFor activating groups, the ortho is more activated than para. For example, in anisole (methoxy), ortho is more. For toluene, the methyl group is weaker than methoxy, so maybe the ortho is still more than para, but the ratio might be less skewed. Let's say toluene has 40% para (so 60% ortho). Similarly for ethyl (substance 5, which is similar to toluene), same as toluene. \n\nSo the para fractions would be:\n\nSubstance 1 (toluene): ~40% para\n\nSubstance 3 (chlorobenzene): ~60% para\n\nSubstance 5 (ethylbenzene): same as toluene, so 40%? Or maybe a bit different? Let's assume 40% for simplicity.\n\nWait, but ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl? No, both are alkyl groups, so ethyl is similar to methyl. So their directing effects are the same. So substance 5 would have the same ratio as 1. \n\nSo now, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest among the ortho/para group (substances 1,3,5):\n\n1 and 5 (40%) < 3 (60%). \n\nSo for the total list, the meta directing substances (2,4,6) have 0% para, so they come first in the order of increasing para fraction. Then the lowest among the ortho/para are 1 and 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). \n\nWait, but the question says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So the lowest fractions first. \n\nThe meta directors (substances 2,4,6) all have 0% para, so they are the first in the order. But which comes first among them? Since they are all 0, but the options have them in different orders. Wait, but the options must have them in some order. Wait, the options list the substances in order like 4<2<6< etc. So perhaps the question expects that the meta directors have 0, so they are the lowest, then the ortho/para ones. But between the meta directors, their actual para fractions are all 0, so they can be ordered arbitrarily? But the options must have them in a specific order. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the meta directors. Let me confirm again:\n\nSubstances with meta directing substituents are 2 (ester), 4 (nitro), and 6 (carboxylic acid). \n\nFor these, the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para isomer's fraction is 0. So all three (2,4,6) have 0% para.\n\nTherefore, their order among themselves doesn't matter for the increasing order, since they are all 0. But in the options, they are ordered in different sequences. For instance, option A starts with 4<2<6<..., option C has 4<6<2..., etc. So perhaps there's an error in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that meta directors give only meta, so the para fraction is zero. But maybe the question is considering that even meta directors might have some ortho/para products? That can't be. The meta directors (like nitro group) direct the substituent to the meta position only, so there's no ortho or para product. So the para fraction is 0. \n\nTherefore, all three (2,4,6) have 0. So in the order, they must come first. But the options list them in different orders. Hmm. Wait, the options must have an order that includes all of them in the lower part. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD) 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nLooking at the options, the first three in each option are the meta directors (since they have 0% para). For example, option A starts with 4,2,6; option B starts with 6,2,4; option C starts with 4,6,2; option D starts with 3 (which is an ortho/para director, so that can't be). So option D is invalid because 3 (Cl) has a higher fraction (60%). So D is out.\n\nNow, among the meta directors (2,4,6), their order among themselves in the options can vary. Since all have 0, but the options must have a specific order, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake with the directing effect of the carboxylic acid (substance 6, COOH). The carboxylic acid is a strong meta director, so it directs to meta, so para fraction is 0. The nitro (4) is also a meta director, so 0. The ester (2) is also meta, so 0. So all three have 0. So their order between themselves doesn't matter for the increasing sequence. But the options have different orders. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong about one of the substituents' directing effects. Let me check each again:\n\nSubstance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester). The ester group (-COOR) is a meta director. Yes, because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance (so no +M), making it a meta director.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro group, definitely meta director.\n\nSubstance 6: carboxylic acid (-COOH) is a meta director. Yes, because the -COOH group is strongly electron-withdrawing and directs meta.\n\nSo all three (2,4,6) are meta directors. So their para fractions are 0. \n\nNow, the next in the order are the ortho/para directors (substances 1,3,5). \n\nFor those, their para fractions are as follows:\n\nSubstance 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5): activating ortho/para directors. The ratio of para to total (ortho + para) is less than 50%, so their para fractions are around 40% each.\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): deactivating ortho/para director. The ratio here is higher, so para fraction is ~60%.\n\nSo the order from lowest to highest among the ortho/para group is 1 and 5 (40%) < 3 (60%). \n\nPutting it all together, the overall order of increasing para fraction is:\n\nMeta directors (0%) first: 2,4,6 (in any order) \u2192 then 1 and 5 (40%) \u2192 then 3 (60%).\n\nNow, looking at the options, the first three must be the meta directors. Let's see the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 the first three are 4,2,6 (all meta, so okay). Then comes 3 (Cl, which is ortho/para, 60%), then 1 and 5 (40%). Wait, but 1 and 5 should come before 3. So in option A, the order after the meta directors is 3 (60%) before 1 and 5 (40%), which would be wrong. Because 40% is less than 60%, so 1 and 5 should come before 3.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 first three are 6,2,4 (meta). Then 5 (40%) then 1 (40%) then 3 (60%). Wait, but 5 and 1 are equal, so they can be in any order. But 5 is written before 1, but since they are equal, that's okay. Then 3 (60%) comes after. So the order after the meta directors is 5,1,3. Which is correct (since 40% < 40% < 60%? Wait no, 5 and 1 have same 40%, so they are equal, so they can be ordered as 5<1 or 1<5. But in option B, it's 5 before 1, then 3. That works. But the first three are 6,2,4. \n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 first three: 4,6,2 (meta). Then 1 (40%), 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). Correct order.\n\nOption D: starts with 3 (Cl), which is 60%, so wrong.\n\nSo between options A, B, C:\n\nOption A has after meta directors: 3 (60%), then 1 and 5 (40%). That's incorrect because 3 is higher than 1/5.\n\nOption B has after meta directors: 5,1 (40%), then 3 (60%). Correct.\n\nOption C has the same as B except the order between 5 and 1 doesn't matter. So the order in C is 4<6<2 (meta), then 1 (40%), 5 (40%), then 3 (60%). Which is correct.\n\nWait, but the question says \"increasing the weight fraction\", so the correct order should be the meta directors (0%) first, then the 40% (1 and 5), then 60% (3). So between B and C.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B's full order is 6 < 2 <4 <5 <1 <3 \u2192 which is meta directors (6,2,4) then 5 (40%), then 1 (40%), then 3 (60%). \n\nOption C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 \u2192 same meta order (4,6,2) then 1 (40), 5 (40), then 3 (60). Both B and C have the correct meta first, then the 40% group, then 60%.\n\nBut the options must have the correct order. Let's check the options again.\n\nWait, the problem is in the options given. Let me recheck the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 after meta (4,2,6), the next is 3 (60%), then 1 (40%), which is wrong.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 after meta (6,2,4), next is 5 (40), then 1 (40), then 3 (60). Correct.\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 same meta, then 1 (40), 5 (40), then 3 (60). Correct.\n\nOption D is invalid.\n\nNow, which of B or C is correct?\n\nThe question requires the order from lowest to highest. The meta directors are all 0. Then comes the ortho/para directors with 40% (1 and 5), then 60% (3).\n\nBetween options B and C, the difference is the order of the meta directors themselves (the first three). Since their fractions are all 0, their order among themselves doesn't affect the increasing sequence. So any order of 2,4,6 is acceptable as long as they are first.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B starts with 6,2,4 (meta) \u2192 then 5,1,3.\n\nOption C starts with 4,6,2 (meta), then 1,5,3.\n\nBoth are valid in terms of the increasing order, but the question expects one of them. \n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that all meta directors have 0. Maybe the question considers that meta directors can have some para? No, that contradicts the directing effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the directing effect of one of the substituents. Let me check substance 2 again: C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester). Is the ester group a meta director? Yes. Because the ester's carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing via resonance, so it can't donate electrons into the ring, making it a meta director. So substance 2 is meta.\n\nSubstance 6 is carboxylic acid (COOH), which is also a strong meta director.\n\nSubstance 4 is nitro, definitely meta.\n\nThus, their order among themselves can be in any order, but the options have them in different sequences. \n\nLooking at the options, let's see which of B or C is present in the choices.\n\nThe correct order after the meta directors is 1 and 5 (40%) before 3 (60%). \n\nIn option B, after meta, the next is 5 (40%) then 1 (40%). Since they are equal, that's okay. \n\nIn option C, after meta, it's 1 then 5 (same as B, just swapped). \n\nThe problem is the first three elements (the meta directors):\n\nOption B lists them as 6 < 2 <4.\n\nOption C lists them as 4 <6 <2.\n\nThe question doesn't give any reason to prefer one order of the meta directors over another, since they all have the same fraction (0). But perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.\n\nWait a second! Wait, maybe I made a mistake with substance 6 (COOH). Let me think again: carboxylic acid is a meta director, so its para fraction is 0. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about the carboxylic acid group again. The -COOH group has a -I effect and also a -M effect (since the oxygen's lone pairs can't donate into the ring due to the adjacent carbonyl group). So it's a strong meta director. So yes, substance 6 is meta.\n\nNow, the problem might be that the question is considering the actual yield's weight fraction, but perhaps in some cases, the para isomer is not formed at all (0), but others have some fraction. \n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, this is critical. The question says that each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So for substances with meta directors (2,4,6), the product is the meta isomer. For the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the product is either ortho or para. But the problem states that \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so in those cases (1,3,5), the substituent must direct to only one position. \n\nWait, this changes everything! Oh no! I completely misread that part. \n\nThe problem says: \"Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\". So each reaction produces only one monobromo product. So the substituent must direct the bromine to only one position. \n\nThis means that for each substituent, the directing effect is such that only one isomer is formed. \n\nTherefore, the meta directors (2,4,6) would form only the meta isomer, so their para fraction is 0. \n\nFor the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the substituent must direct to either ortho or para only. \n\nWait, but how? Because ortho/para directors usually allow both positions. Unless there's another factor. \n\nAh, perhaps the question is implying that the substituent is such that the meta is not possible (like if the substituent is already in a position that blocks meta?), but no, each substituent is on a benzene ring, and the question doesn't specify their positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in cases of ortho/para directors, the substituent's electronic effect makes one position more favorable than the other to such an extent that only that isomer is formed. \n\nFor example, in toluene (substance 1), the methyl group is an ortho/para director. But maybe the methyl group's activating effect makes the ortho position more favorable than para, so only ortho is formed? But then the para would have 0%, conflicting with the previous thought. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, the para is more favored. \n\nWait, this requires knowing for each ortho/para director whether it directs to ortho or para predominantly enough that only one product is formed. \n\nSo let's reevaluate:\n\nSubstances 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl) are ortho/para directors. \n\nFor these, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so the substituent must direct to either ortho or para exclusively. \n\nSo for each of these three, we need to determine whether the substituent directs to ortho or para.\n\nFor activating groups (methyl and ethyl):\n\nActivating groups (like -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors. The directing is to ortho and para, but which is more favored?\n\nIn the case of toluene (methyl), the major product is the ortho and para isomers. However, in some cases, the para isomer might be the only one formed under certain conditions? But in reality, both are formed. \n\nWait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, implying that for each substituent, the directing is so strong that only one position is possible. \n\nPerhaps for activating groups (methyl and ethyl), the ortho position is more activated, so the bromine adds there, leading to only the ortho isomer. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. For example, in anisole (methoxy), which is an activating ortho/para director, the major products are ortho and para. If the question says only one is formed, then maybe in some cases, like with stronger activating groups, only ortho is formed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) directs to para only. \n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\n- Activating ortho/para directors (methyl and ethyl) direct to ortho only. \n\n- Deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl) direct to para only. \n\nThis would mean:\n\nSubstance 1 (methyl) \u2192 only ortho \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl) \u2192 only para \u2192 para fraction 100%.\n\nSubstance 5 (ethyl) \u2192 only ortho \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nSubstance 2,4,6 (meta directors) \u2192 meta \u2192 para fraction 0%.\n\nWait, but then substances 1 and 5 would have 0% para, same as the meta directors. So the order would have 1 and 5 among the meta group. But the options don't have that. \n\nHmm, this suggests I'm still misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that for ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) direct to both ortho and para, but since the question says only one is formed, maybe the question assumes that the major product is considered, so the one with higher yield is the only one. \n\nFor example, for toluene, the major product is ortho (so the para is only minor, so considered not formed?), leading to para fraction 0. \n\nFor chlorobenzene (Cl), the major product is para (so the ortho is minor, so considered not formed \u2192 para fraction 100%). \n\nThen:\n\nSubstance 1 (toluene): ortho only \u2192 para fraction 0%\n\nSubstance 3 (Cl): para only \u2192 100%\n\nSubstance 5 (ethyl): same as toluene \u2192 0%\n\nSubstance 2,4,6: meta \u2192 0%\n\nThus, the substances with para fraction:\n\n2,4,6,1,5 (0%), and 3 (100%). \n\nThen the order of increasing para fraction would be all the 0% first, then 3 (100%). So the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 < 3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 yes, after the meta group (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and 5 (0%). But this would be incorrect because 3 has higher than the others.\n\nWait, but in this case, the correct order would be all the 0% first, then 3. The options have option A as 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 which is correct in that 3 comes after the meta group and before the 0% substances? No, because 1 and 5 are also 0%. So option A would have the 0% group first (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and 5 (0%) which would be wrong because they should be before 3. \n\nHmm, this approach isn't aligning with the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption that activating groups direct to ortho only and deactivating to para only is incorrect, and instead, the para isomer is formed preferentially for deactivating groups and ortho for activating. \n\nIf that's the case:\n\n- Activating (methyl, ethyl): ortho only \u2192 0% para.\n\n- Deactivating (Cl): para only \u2192 100% para.\n\nSo then, the order is:\n\nMeta directors (0%), then activating (0%), then Cl (100%).\n\nThus, the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 < 3.\n\nLooking at the options again, the only one that places 3 last is option A and B and C. \n\nOption A: ... then 3 comes before 1 and 5, which is wrong.\n\nOption B: after meta, 5 and 1 (0%) then 3 (100%).\n\nOption C: after meta, 1 and 5 then 3 (100%).\n\nSo options B and C are correct in that 3 is last. \n\nBetween B and C:\n\nOption B: the meta directors are ordered 6<2<4. \n\nOption C: meta ordered 4<6<2.\n\nThe question doesn't give any reason to order the meta directors in a particular sequence among themselves since they all have 0%. \n\nLooking at the options given, perhaps the correct order is the one where the meta directors are in the order of their directing strength or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the actual yield's weight fraction, but I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the question assumes that for ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (methyl, ethyl) give a mixture of ortho and para, so the para fraction is 50% (assuming equal distribution), \n\n- Deactivating (Cl) gives more para, say 70%,\n\nThus, the order would be meta (0%), then activating (50%), then Cl (70%).\n\nIn this case, the ortho/para directors would be ordered 1 and 5 (50%) before 3 (70%). \n\nThen the correct option must have the meta directors first, then 1 and/or5, then 3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: after meta comes 3 (70%) which is wrong.\n\nOption B: after meta, 5 (50%), then 1 (50%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nOption C: after meta, 1 (50%) then 5 (50%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nSo both B and C are correct in terms of the overall order. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nThe question asks for increasing order of the para fraction. \n\nThe meta directors (2,4,6) have 0%, so they come first. \n\nBetween B and C, the order of the meta directors (the first three) doesn't matter. \n\nThe next part is the ortho/para directors with 50% (substances 1 and 5), then 3 (70%). \n\nIn option B, after the meta directors (6,2,4), comes 5 (50%) then 1 (50%). \n\nIn option C, after meta (4,6,2), comes 1 (50%) then 5 (50%). \n\nBoth are acceptable. \n\nNow, the options given include both B and C. The question must have one correct answer. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that activating groups give 50% para. Let me think again. \n\nIf the activating groups (methyl, ethyl) are ortho/para directors and the substituent is such that the ortho and para positions are equally activated, then the para fraction would be 50%. \n\nBut perhaps the actual ratio is different. \n\nFor example, in toluene (methyl), the product distribution is about 2:1 for ortho:para? Or is it 1:2?\n\nWait, according to some sources, the nitration of toluene gives about 2:1 ratio of ortho:para. So the para isomer would be about 33% of the total (since ortho is 2 parts, para 1 part, total 3 parts \u2192 33% para). \n\nIf that's the case, then for toluene (substance 1) the para fraction is 33%, and for ethylbenzene (5) same. \n\nChlorobenzene (3) would have a higher para fraction, say 70%. \n\nMeta directors (2,4,6) 0%.\n\nThus the order would be:\n\nmeta (0%) \u2192 toluene and ethyl (33%) \u2192 Cl (70%).\n\nThen the correct order would be meta first, then 1 and 5, then 3. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption B: after meta comes 5 (33%), then 1 (33%), then 3 (70%) \u2192 correct.\n\nOption C: after meta comes 1 (33%), then 5 (33%), then 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nBoth B and C are correct in this scenario. \n\nBut the options might have one correct answer. \n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC)4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD)3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nThe difference between B and C is the order of the meta directors first and the order of 1 and 5. \n\nThe question might expect the meta directors to be ordered in a particular way based on their deactivating strength. \n\nNitro (4) is a stronger deactivating group than ester (2) and carboxylic acid (6)? Or perhaps carboxylic acid is stronger than nitro?\n\nWait, the order of deactivating strength:\n\nNitro (-NO2) is the strongest deactivating group, followed by carboxylic acid (-COOH), then ester (-COOR), then halogens (-Cl), etc. \n\nSo nitro (4) is the strongest, then carboxylic acid (6), then ester (2). \n\nThus, their deactivating power is 4>6>2. \n\nThe directing effect is meta, but their deactivating strength doesn't affect the para fraction here (since they all give 0%). But the question's options might have them ordered based on their deactivating strength. \n\nIf the question expects them to be in order of increasing deactivating strength (weakest to strongest), then the order would be 2 (ester) <6 (carboxylic acid)<4 (nitro). \n\nSo the meta directors in increasing order of deactivating strength (i.e., weaker first) would be 2 <6<4. \n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption B has them ordered 6<2<4 \u2192 which is 6 (carboxylic) first, then ester, then nitro. That's not increasing strength. \n\nOption C has them as 4<6<2 \u2192 nitro first, then carboxylic, then ester. Which is the opposite of strength. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is not considering that. \n\nAlternatively, the order is based on the para fraction. Since all meta directors have 0, their order doesn't matter. \n\nGiven that both B and C are possible, but the options must have one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. \n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". \n\nFor meta directors, the yield of the para isomer is zero. \n\nFor ortho/para directors:\n\n- Activating groups (1 and 5) give a mixture of ortho and para. Assuming equal distribution (50% para), but if the actual yield is lower (like 33%), then their para fraction is 33%, and Cl's is higher (like 66% or 70%). \n\nIf the question's options have B and C as possible, but the given options might have the correct one as option C. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nMeta directors (4,6,2) first, then 1 and5 (33% each), then 3 (66%).\n\nThis fits the order of increasing fraction: 0%, 0%,0%, then 33%, 33%, then 66%.\n\nSo this is correct. \n\nOption B has after meta 5,1 (33%), then 3 (66%). Also correct. \n\nThe difference is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe question's options might have the correct order as option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta directors' order is based on their actual directing strength's effect on the para fraction. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the Cl. Let me think again:\n\nChlorobenzene is a deactivating ortho/para director. The directing is to ortho/para. The question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in chlorobenzene's case, the para position is the only one formed (due to the deactivating nature making the para more favored than ortho). So the para fraction is 100%. \n\nIn that case, the order would be meta (0%), then activating (0% for ortho only), then Cl (100%). \n\nWait, but then activating groups would have ortho only (0% para), so their para fraction is 0%, same as meta. \n\nThus, the order would be all meta, activating (1 and 5), then Cl (100%). \n\nSo the order would be 2,4,6,1,5 <3. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A has after meta (4,2,6), then 3 (100%), then 1 and5 (0%). That's wrong because 1 and5 should be before 3. \n\nOption B has after meta (6,2,4), then 5 and1 (0%), then 3 (100%). This is correct. \n\nOption C has after meta (4,6,2), then 1 and5 (0%), then 3. \n\nThus, options B and C are correct in this case. \n\nThe difference is the order of meta directors. \n\nAssuming that the meta directors should be ordered from weakest to strongest deactivating:\n\nEster (2) is weaker than carboxylic (6), which is weaker than nitro (4). So order of meta directors by deactivating strength (from weakest to strongest): 2 <6 <4. \n\nThus, the correct order of meta directors is 2,6,4 \u2192 but none of the options have that. \n\nAlternatively, the order is alphabetical? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on standard directing effects.\n\nWait, let me think of the standard electrophilic substitution directing effects:\n\nMeta directors (0% para):\n\n- NO2 (4), COOH (6), COOR (2) \u2192 all meta.\n\nOrtho/para directors:\n\n- CH3 (1), Cl (3), C2H5 (5).\n\nFor Cl (3), as a deactivating ortho/para director, the para isomer is the major product. So the para fraction is high (like 70%).\n\nFor activating groups (1 and 5), the ortho isomer is major, so para fraction is low (like 30%).\n\nThus the order from lowest to highest is:\n\nMeta (0%), then 1 and5 (30%), then 3 (70%).\n\nSo the correct order must have the meta directors first, then 1 and5, then 3. \n\nThe options:\n\nOption B: 6<2<4 (meta) then 5,1 (30%), then3 (70%). \n\nOption C:4<6<2 (meta), then1 (30%),5 (30%), then3 (70%).\n\nBoth B and C are correct. \n\nThe difference is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe question's options must have one correct answer. Looking at the options given in the problem, perhaps the correct answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para fraction for Cl is higher than both activating and meta, so it's the highest, which fits. \n\nBetween B and C, the order of the meta directors doesn't affect the increasing order of the entire sequence. \n\nThe problem might have the correct answer as option C. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the options, the correct answer is option A. \n\nWait, I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have the following:\n\nThe substances with meta directors have 0% para. \n\nFor the others:\n\n- The deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) has higher para fraction than the activating ones. \n\nSo the order is meta (0%) < activating (30%) < Cl (70%).\n\nThus, the correct order is:\n\nmeta (2,4,6) <1,5 <3. \n\nThe option that matches this is option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3. \n\nBecause after the meta group (4,6,2), then comes 1 and5 (30%), then3 (70%). \n\nThus the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, option B also fits but the order of the meta directors may not matter. \n\nThe question's options might have option C as correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the para fraction for Cl is higher than activating. \n\nWait, let me think of actual examples:\n\nFor chlorobenzene, when brominated, the major product is the para isomer. The ortho isomer is less favored because of steric hindrance or electronic effects. \n\nThe ratio between ortho and para in chlorobromobenzene is about 1:3, so the para fraction is about 75%. \n\nFor toluene, the ortho:para ratio in nitration is about 2:1, so para is 33%. \n\nThus the para fractions are:\n\n1 (33%),5 (33%),3 (75%).\n\nSo the order is meta (0%) <1 and5 (33%) <3 (75%). \n\nThe correct option must have this order. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 yes. \n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 yes. \n\nBoth are correct, but the question's options must have one. \n\nThe first three (meta directors) in option C are 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt). \n\nThe order of the meta directors here is based on their deactivating strength. NO2 is stronger than COOH? \n\nWait, nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid. \n\nThe deactivating order is:\n\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOR. \n\nThus, the meta directors in order from strongest to weakest deactivating are: 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt). \n\nThus, if the question orders them by increasing deactivating power (weakest first), it would be 2 <6 <4. \n\nBut in option C, the meta directors are ordered 4<6<2 \u2192 which is strongest first, then next, then weakest. \n\nOption B orders them as6<2<4 \u2192 which is COOH first, then ester, then nitro \u2192 this is also not weakest to strongest. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe question doesn't mention anything about the strength of the substituent's effect, just the para fraction. Since all meta directors have 0% para, their order among themselves doesn't affect the increasing order of the entire list. \n\nThus, both B and C are correct in terms of the overall order. \n\nBut the given options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is \"4<6<2<1<5<3\". \n\nOption B is \"6<2<4<5<1<3\".\n\nThe correct order should be the meta directors first in any order, then 1 and5, then3. \n\nThe problem's options likely consider that the correct answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option A. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the activating groups. \n\nWait, for activating groups (methyl and ethyl), the directing is to ortho and para. The major product is the ortho isomer, so the para fraction would be less than 50%, say 33%. \n\nThe deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) has a higher para fraction (say 66%). \n\nThus the order is meta (0%) < activating (33%) < Cl (66%). \n\nThe correct option must have this. \n\nOption C has 4<6<2 (meta) then 1,5 (33%), then3 (66%). \n\nOption B has 6<2<4 (meta), then5,1 (33%), then3 (66%). \n\nBoth are correct. \n\nThe difference between them is the order of the meta directors. \n\nThe problem's options might have the answer as option C. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is option C. \n\nBased on the given options and the analysis, I'll go with option C.\n\n\nTo determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer during electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n1. **Meta Directors (0% para fraction):**\n   - **Substances 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), and 6 (C6H5-COOH):** These groups (ester, nitro, and carboxylic acid) are strong deactivating meta directors, directing bromine exclusively to the meta position. Thus, their para fraction is 0%.\n\n2. **Ortho/Para Directors:**\n   - **Substances 1 (C6H5-CH3) and 5 (C6H5-C2H5):** Activating groups (methyl and ethyl) direct bromine to ortho and para positions. However, the ortho position is more activated, leading to a lower para fraction (~33%).\n   - **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl):** A deactivating ortho/para director (chlorine), where the para position is more favored due to the chlorine's inductive effect, resulting in a higher para fraction (~66%).\n\n**Order of Increasing Para Fraction:**\n- Meta directors (0%) first: **2, 4, 6** (order among themselves does not matter).\n- Followed by activating groups (1, 5) with ~33% para fraction.\n- Lastly, the deactivating ortho/para director (3) with ~66% para fraction.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n- **Option C (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3):** Correctly places meta directors first (4, 6, 2), followed by activating groups (1, 5), and finally the deactivating ortho/para director (3). The order of meta directors does not affect the increasing fraction sequence.\n\nAnswer: C",
