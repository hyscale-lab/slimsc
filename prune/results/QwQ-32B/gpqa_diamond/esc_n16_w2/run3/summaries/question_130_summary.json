      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical telescopes. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about redshift and the Lyman alpha line. \n\nThe question mentions that neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. But wait, Lyman alpha is part of the Lyman series, right? Those are the transitions in hydrogen where electrons drop to the n=1 energy level. The Lyman alpha line specifically is the transition from n=2 to n=1, which emits (or absorbs) at 1215.67 Angstroms approximately. \n\nNow, the problem is about detecting these absorption features with ground-based optical telescopes. But optical telescopes typically observe in the visible spectrum. The visible range is from about 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red), right? So the original wavelength of 1216 Angstroms is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But since the clouds are moving away from us, their light is redshifted. \n\nThe key here is that the absorption line must be shifted into the optical window so that we can detect it. So the original wavelength (1216 \u00c5) gets stretched by the redshift to a longer wavelength. The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. \n\nWait, but we need the observed wavelength to be at least in the optical range. The lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just at the edge of the optical window. The optical window starts around 3000-4000 \u00c5? Wait, actually, the Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see below about 300 nm, which is 3000 Angstroms. But visible light is from ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5) to 700 nm. So maybe the lower cutoff for optical is around 3000 \u00c5? Hmm, I should confirm that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard optical window is considered to start at around 3000 \u00c5 (300 nm), so the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5 for the telescope to detect it. So to find the minimum redshift where the absorption line is just entering the optical window. \n\nSo setting up the equation: observed wavelength (\u03bb_obs) = (1 + z) * \u03bb_rest. \n\nWe need \u03bb_obs \u2265 3000 \u00c5 (the minimum wavelength detectable in optical). The rest wavelength \u03bb_rest is 1216 \u00c5. \n\nSo solving for z:\n\n(1 + z) = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest \u2265 3000 / 1216 \n\nCalculating that: 3000 divided by 1216. Let me compute that. 1216 * 2 = 2432, which is less than 3000. 1216 * 2.46? Let's see:\n\n1216 * 2.4 = 1216 * 2 + 1216 * 0.4 = 2432 + 486.4 = 2918.4. Hmm, that's close to 3000. \n\nWait, 1216 * 2.46 = ?\n\nWait, let me do this more accurately. \n\n3000 / 1216 = let's see. \n\n1216 \u00d7 2 = 2432. Subtract that from 3000: 3000 -2432 = 568. \n\nSo 568 /1216 = approx 0.467. So total is 2.467. \n\nSo 1 + z = 2.467 \u2192 z \u2248 1.467. Wait, but that would be the redshift. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. \n\nWait the formula is z = (\u03bb_obs - \u03bb_rest)/\u03bb_rest = (\u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest) - 1. \n\nSo if \u03bb_obs is 3000, then (3000/1216) -1 = (approx 2.467) -1 = 1.467. So z \u2248 1.467. \n\nHmm, but the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. \n\nWait, but maybe the optical window starts higher? Like maybe the lower limit is 3600 \u00c5 (360 nm), since the atmosphere is more transparent above 300 nm but perhaps the standard optical is considered starting at 400 nm? Wait, no. The atmosphere's cutoff for UV is around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so ground-based telescopes can observe from about 3000 \u00c5 upwards. \n\nBut maybe the question assumes that the optical window is up to 4000 \u00c5? No, that would be the lower end of visible. Wait, the question says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". So the telescope can detect in the optical, which is 4000-7000 \u00c5? Then the original absorption line at 1216 \u00c5 must be redshifted into that range. \n\nWait, that would change things. Let me re-read the question. \n\n\"Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?\"\n\nAh, so the absorption line must be in the optical range (4000-7000 \u00c5) to be detected. So the observed wavelength must be at least 4000 \u00c5? \n\nIf that's the case, then the calculation changes. \n\nSo if the observed wavelength has to be at least 4000 \u00c5, then:\n\n(1+z) = 4000 / 1216 \u2248 3.29 \n\nThen z \u2248 2.29. \n\nHmm, the options include C)2.4 and D)1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optical window starts at 3600 \u00c5 (like 360 nm). Let me check that. \n\nThe Earth's atmosphere allows some UV through, but below 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) is mostly blocked. But for ground-based observations, the practical lower limit for optical might be considered around 3000 \u00c5. \n\nWait, this is a key point. If the telescope can detect down to 3000 \u00c5 (ultraviolet), but that's not considered optical? Because optical is visible light. So perhaps the question is considering the visible spectrum (4000-7000 \u00c5). \n\nIn that case, the observed wavelength must be at least 4000 \u00c5, so the required redshift would be (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 (3.29) -1 \u2248 2.29, so around 2.3. The closest option is C) 2.4. \n\nAlternatively, if the lower limit is 3600 \u00c5 (which is 360 nm, near the UV/visible boundary), then 3600/1216 \u2248 2.96, so z\u22481.96, which would be ~1.96, so D)1.9 is close. \n\nHmm, but what is the exact cutoff for optical? The visible spectrum is from ~380 nm (3800 \u00c5) to 750 nm. So perhaps the minimum is 3800 \u00c5. Let me see:\n\n3800 /1216 \u2248 3.125 \u2192 z\u22482.125, so ~2.1. Then the closest would be 2.4 (C) or 1.9 (D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the Lyman-alpha forest concept. Wait, the Lyman-alpha forest is absorption features in the spectra of quasars caused by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. These are observed in the UV and optical, depending on the redshift. \n\nThe Lyman-alpha forest is typically seen at redshifts from z ~ 2 down to z ~ 0. But to observe the absorption line in the optical, the original Lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 \u00c5) must have been redshifted into the optical range (4000-7000 \u00c5). \n\nSo the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 \u00c5. The lower limit for detection would be when the observed wavelength is at the lower end of the optical window (say 4000 \u00c5). \n\nThus, z = (4000/1216) - 1 \u2248 (3.29) -1 = 2.29. \n\nThe options are 2.4 (C) or 1.9 (D). Since 2.29 is closer to 2.4, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 4000 divided by 1216 exactly. \n\n4000 \u00f7 1216. Let me compute 1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. \n\nSo 352/1216 \u2248 0.289. So total is 3.289. So 3.289 -1 = 2.289, so z \u2248 2.29. So the lower limit would be approximately 2.3. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the lower end as 3600 \u00c5, which would give z ~ 1.96. \n\nWait, maybe the question's answer is expecting to use the atmospheric cutoff. Since ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 3000 \u00c5 due to atmospheric absorption. But if the absorption is observed at 3000 \u00c5, then the redshift would be (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.46. Which is close to 1.2 or 1.9. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to check what's the standard approach here. \n\nIn astronomy, when they talk about Lyman-alpha forest observations, the absorption lines are observed in the optical, so the redshift must be such that 1216 \u00c5 * (1+z) is in the optical range. The optical is usually considered from 400 nm (4000 \u00c5) to 700 nm. \n\nSo to get the Lyman-alpha wavelength into optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 \u00c5. The minimum redshift required would be when the observed wavelength is just at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nSo z = (4000 / 1216) -1 = (approx 3.29) -1 = 2.29. \n\nSo the lower limit is about 2.3. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the Lyman-alpha line being in the optical when observed, so that the absorption is in the visible. Hence the calculation as above. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C)2.4. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". So the lower limit would be the minimal z where the absorption is just entering the optical range. \n\nIf the optical starts at 4000 \u00c5, then z ~ 2.3. If the optical starts lower, like 3000 \u00c5 (but that's UV), which can't be observed from the ground. Hence, the correct cutoff is 4000. \n\nTherefore the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses 3650 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me see: 3650/1216 \u2248 3.0, so z\u22482.0. But 2.0 isn't an option. The closest is 1.9 or 2.4. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the redshift must be enough so that the absorption line is in the optical, so the original wavelength (1216 \u00c5) multiplied by (1+z) must be less than, say, 7000 \u00c5 but more than 4000. Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z that allows the absorption to be in the optical. That would be when the observed wavelength is just at the minimum of the optical window, which is 4000. \n\nThus, 2.3 is the required z. Since 2.4 is an option, that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the rest frame wavelength of the cloud's emission? Wait no, the question is about absorption. The clouds absorb the quasar's light, so the quasar's light is at some observed wavelength, but the absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the quasar's emission. The quasar emits at some wavelength, but the absorption occurs at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. The observed wavelength of the absorption is then (1+z_cloud) * 1216 \u00c5. To detect it with optical telescopes, that observed wavelength must be in the optical (4000-7000 \u00c5). \n\nTherefore, to find the lower limit on z_cloud (the redshift of the cloud), the minimal z_cloud would be when (1+z_cloud)*1216 = 4000 \u2192 z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.29, so ~2.3. \n\nSo the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift. Wait, the question says \"the redshift of this objects\" referring to the clouds. So the redshift of the cloud must be such that the absorption is in the optical. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C)2.4. \n\nLooking at the options again, the options are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nYes, 2.4 is option C. So the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption at 1216 \u00c5 can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need the observed wavelength of the absorption feature to fall within the optical range (4000\u20137000 \u00c5).

Since 2.4 is an option, that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the rest frame wavelength of the cloud's emission? Wait no, the question is about absorption. The clouds absorb the quasar's light, so the quasar's light is at some observed wavelength, but the absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the quasar's emission. The quasar emits at some wavelength, but the absorption occurs at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. The observed wavelength of the absorption is then (1+z_cloud) * 1216 \u00c5. To detect it with optical telescopes, that observed wavelength must be in the optical (4000-7000 \u00c5). \n\nTherefore, to find the lower limit on z_cloud (the redshift of the cloud), the minimal z_cloud would be when (1+z_cloud)*1216 = 4000 \u2192 z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.29, so ~2.3. \n\nSo the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift. Wait, the question says \"the redshift of this objects\" referring to the clouds. So the redshift of the cloud must be such that the absorption is in the optical. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C)2.4. \n\nLooking at the options again, the options are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nYes, 2.4 is option C. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption at 1216 \u00c5 can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need the observed wavelength of the absorption feature to fall within the optical range (4000\u20137000 \u00c5). The observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\) is related to the rest wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\) by \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\). \n\nSetting the minimum observed wavelength to 4000 \u00c5 (the lower end of the optical window), we solve for redshift \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}} = \\frac{4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5}}{1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5}} \\approx 3.29\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz \\approx 3.29 - 1 \\approx 2.29\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this calculated value is **2.4** (Option C). Other options like 1.9 (D) would correspond to an observed wavelength of ~3000 \u00c5, which is below the optical window due to atmospheric absorption. Thus, the correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift for these neutral hydrogen clouds so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The question mentions that the clouds absorb light from quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Hmm, right, Lyman alpha is an emission line from hydrogen, but in this case, it's an absorption feature because the clouds are absorbing that wavelength from the quasar's light.\n\nThe key here is probably about the wavelength range that optical telescopes can detect. I remember that optical telescopes on the ground can observe wavelengths from roughly 3000 to 11000 Angstroms, but wait, maybe I should double-check that. Wait, visible light is from about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms, but maybe optical can go a bit lower and higher? Like ultraviolet starts below 4000? But ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it. So the lower end for optical might be around 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms) but maybe even a bit lower? Hmm. Wait, the atmosphere's cutoff for ground-based observations in the UV is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So anything below that can't be observed from the ground. So if the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame, but when redshifted, its observed wavelength would be longer. So the absorption line's wavelength as observed must be above the atmospheric cutoff to be detectable.\n\nSo the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than 3000 Angstroms? Because otherwise, the atmosphere would block it, so the telescope can't detect it. So we need to find the redshift z where the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A) when redshifted becomes 3000 A. Because that's the lower limit. If the redshift is higher than that, the observed wavelength would be longer, so still detectable. So solving for z where (1 + z)*1216 = 3000. Let me write that equation.\n\nThe formula for redshift is: the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So rearranged, z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: lambda_obs = 3000 A (the minimum detectable wavelength), lambda_rest is 1216 A. So z = (3000 / 1216) -1. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, divide 3000 by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 2 is 2432, so subtract that from 3000 gives 568. 568/1216 is about 0.467. So 2 + 0.467 is 2.467. Wait, no, that's wrong. Wait, wait, 3000 divided by 1216: let me do this more carefully. 1216 \u00d7 2.467 \u2248 1216 \u00d72 = 2432, plus 1216 \u00d70.467. Let me see: 0.467\u00d71216 \u2248 1216\u00d70.4 = 486.4, plus 1216\u00d70.067 \u2248 81.6, so total \u2248 568. So 2432+568 = 3000. So yes, 3000/1216 \u2248 2.467. So z \u2248 2.467 -1? Wait no, wait the formula is (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) -1. So 3000/1216 is about 2.467, so subtract 1 gives z \u2248 1.467. Wait, that's approximately 1.47. Wait, but that would be the redshift. Wait, but then the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, so that means that if the redshift is at least that value, then the observed wavelength is above 3000 A, so can be detected. So the lower limit is z \u2248 1.47. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option B (1.2) or D (1.9). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the rest wavelength and observed. Wait, the Lyman alpha is at 1216 A in the rest frame. The absorption occurs at that wavelength in the cloud's rest frame, but because the cloud is moving away (assuming it's part of the Hubble flow), the observed wavelength is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 A. To be detectable, that observed wavelength must be greater than 3000 A (since below that, the atmosphere blocks it). So solving (1+z)*1216 = 3000 gives 1+z = 3000/1216 \u2248 2.467, so z \u2248 1.467. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. The options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm, 1.47 is closest to 1.2 or 1.9? The options don't have 1.5, but perhaps I made an error here. Wait, maybe the cutoff is higher? Maybe the optical window is higher than 3000 A? Let me think again about the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 A), but maybe some telescopes can go a bit lower? Or maybe the question is considering that the telescope can only observe up to say, 4000 A? Wait, no, the problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical spectrum is usually considered from about 400 nm (4000 A) to 700 nm (7000 A). Wait, but then that would mean that wavelengths shorter than 4000 A (like 3000 A) are in the ultraviolet and blocked. Wait, but maybe the question is considering the atmospheric cutoff as 300 nm (3000 A), so anything below that can't be observed. So the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. So my calculation holds. So the redshift would be about 1.47. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I messed up the rest wavelength? Wait, Lyman alpha is indeed 1215.67 A, so 1216 is correct. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's emission, but no, the absorption is at Lyman alpha. Alternatively, maybe the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha is actually in the cloud's frame, so when redshifted, the absorption occurs at (1+z)*1216. So the absorption must be in the optical range. So to be detectable, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. Therefore, (1+z)*1216 >= 3000. Solving for z gives z >= (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.467. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. The options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. So 1.9 is higher than 1.47, so if the lower limit is 1.47, then any redshift above that can be detected. So the lower limit would be 1.47, so the minimal redshift required is ~1.47. Therefore, the answer should be the smallest option that is greater than or equal to that. The options are B)1.2 (too low, since 1.2 is less than 1.47, so if z was 1.2, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(2.2)= 2675 A, which is below 3000, so undetectable. So 1.2 is too low. The next is D)1.9. 1.9 would give 1216*(2.9)= 3526 A, which is above 3000, so detectable. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is that z must be at least ~1.47. So the question asks for the lower limit, so the smallest z where it can be detected. So the answer must be the smallest z in the options that is above 1.47. So between 1.2 and 1.9, the answer would be 1.9? Wait but 1.9 is higher than the required. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z such that it can be detected. So if the lower limit is ~1.47, then any z above that is okay. But the question says \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit would be that z must be at least ~1.47. So the options are B)1.2 (too low), D)1.9 (higher than needed). So perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be within the optical window (which is up to 1 micron, like 10000 A). But maybe the problem is expecting a different cutoff? Wait, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher. Let me think again. Maybe the optical window starts at 300 nm (3000 A) but ends at around 1100 nm (11000 A). So any observed wavelength between 3000 A and 11000 A is okay. So the absorption must have a wavelength in that range. The Lyman alpha is in the rest frame at 1216 A. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216. To be in the optical range (>=3000 A), so (1+z) must be >= 3000/1216 ~2.467, so z ~1.47. So the lower limit is z ~1.47, so the minimal redshift must be at least that. Therefore, the options given: the closest is D)1.9, but that's higher than 1.47. Wait, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed, so the entire spectrum is redshifted? Wait, no, the absorption occurs in the intergalactic medium, so the quasar is behind the clouds. The quasar's light passes through the clouds, which are at some redshift. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the cloud's hydrogen, so the absorption line's wavelength in the observed frame is (1+z_cloud)*1216 A. But the quasar's own redshift could be higher? Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the quasar's emission must also be in the optical. Wait, the question says the clouds are in deep space, so perhaps they are at a redshift less than the quasar? Or maybe not, but the key point is that the absorption line must be in the optical window. Wait, the quasar's own emission would be redshifted as well, but the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength of the absorption is (1+z_cloud)*1216. That must be above 3000 A. Therefore, the calculation as before. So the minimal redshift is ~1.47, so the answer must be the first option that is higher than that. The options are B:1.2 (too low), D:1.9 (sufficient). So the lower limit would be 1.47, so the minimal z must be at least that. So the question asks for the lower limit, so the answer is the minimal z required, which is approximately 1.47. Since the options don't have that, but D is 1.9, which is higher than required. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the atmospheric cutoff is higher. Let me check. The Earth's atmosphere allows light through in the so-called optical window from about 300 nm to around 1100 nm. The exact cutoff is about 300 nm (3000 A) for the lower end. So any wavelength below that is blocked. So the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. So the calculation is correct. So the required z is ~1.47. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Since 1.2 is below the required, so the lower limit is the smallest z where it can be detected, so that would be approximately 1.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is considering a different cutoff? Maybe they are using 4000 A as the cutoff? Let's see. If the cutoff is 4000 A, then (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 (3.288) -1= 2.288, so z\u22482.29. The closest option is C)2.4. But then the answer would be C. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed Lyman alpha emission from the cloud itself is needed, but that's not the case here. The question is about the absorption in the quasar's spectrum. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check another approach. Suppose that the absorption occurs at a wavelength that's in the optical range. The rest wavelength is 1216 A. So observed wavelength must be between 3000 A and, say, 11000 A. So solving for the minimal z where observed is 3000 A gives z ~1.47. So that's the lower limit. The minimal required z is ~1.47. So any cloud with z less than that would have absorption at shorter wavelengths, undetectable. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. Among the options, the first one higher than that is D)1.9, but B) is 1.2, which is lower. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) so that they can be detected. The lower limit is the smallest redshift that allows detection. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer should be the smallest option that is at least that. But since the options don't have that, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha emission from the quasar must also be in the optical? Wait, the quasar emits over a broad spectrum, but the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. The key is the observed wavelength of the absorption feature. So the calculation holds. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's light at the rest frame Lyman alpha (1216 A) must be redshifted into the optical. So the quasar's emission at 1216 A (in its rest frame) would be observed at (1+z_quasar)*1216 A. But the absorption is at the cloud's redshift, so the observed absorption wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216. To detect the absorption, the observed wavelength must be in the optical. So if the cloud's redshift is such that (1+z_cloud)*1216 >= 3000, then it can be detected. So the minimal z_cloud is ~1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is ~1.47. Since the options are given, perhaps the question expects an approximate value. The closest option is D)1.9, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate 3000 divided by 1216. Let me compute 1216 \u00d7 2 = 2432. 3000-2432 = 568. 568 divided by 1216 is 0.467. So total is 2.467, so z = 1.467. So ~1.47. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9. Hmm. The options might have a different cutoff. Wait, perhaps the cutoff is 4000 A? Let's see. 4000 /1216 = 3.288, so z = 2.288. The closest is C)2.4. But the question says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". Maybe the optical window is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 A)? Let me check. The visible spectrum is from ~400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if they consider the optical to start at 4000 A, then the cutoff would be higher. But ground-based telescopes can observe near-UV (like 320 nm) with special instruments, but generally, the standard optical is 400-700 nm. So maybe the question is using 4000 A as the cutoff. Let's try that. So 4000 A. Then z = (4000/1216) -1 = (3.288) -1= 2.288. So ~2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So that would be the answer. But why would they use 4000 A instead of 3000? The problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\". If optical is considered to start at 4000 A (400 nm), then the answer would be C. But the initial assumption was 3000 A. Maybe I should check some references. The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations in the ultraviolet is around 300 nm (3000 A) because the atmosphere absorbs shorter wavelengths. So any wavelength longer than that (up to 1100 nm) can be observed. So the cutoff is 3000 A. Hence, the calculation should give z ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light must also be in the optical? Wait, but the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. The quasar itself could be at a higher redshift. The absorption feature is at the cloud's redshift. For example, if the cloud is at z=1.5, then the absorption is at (1+1.5)*1216 ~ 3040 A, which is just above 3000. That's barely detectable. But maybe the question wants the minimal z where the absorption line is within the optical range. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The absorption line in the observed frame is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1+z). Wait, no, actually, the formula is that the observed wavelength is the rest wavelength multiplied by (1+z). So yes. So (1+z)= lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So if lambda_obs must be \u22653000 A, then (1+z) must be \u22653000/1216. So z \u2265 (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.467. The options given are B)1.2, D)1.9. Since 1.2 is below, and 1.9 is above, the minimal required is ~1.47. The lower limit is that you need at least that redshift. So the smallest possible z where it can be detected is ~1.47. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the lower limit is the minimal z required, so the answer is the smallest option that is equal or higher than that. Since the options don't have 1.47, but D is 1.9 which is higher than required, but B is 1.2 which is too low. Wait, but maybe the question is phrased as the lower limit meaning the minimum z where detection is possible. So the lower limit is the smallest z possible where detection is possible. Therefore, the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer is the first option that is higher than or equal to that. Since 1.9 is higher than 1.47, but there's no option between 1.2 and 1.9, maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest given option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 3000 divided by 1216: let's compute 1216 \u00d72 = 2432. 2432 + 568 = 3000. 568/1216 = 0.467. So total multiplier is 2.467. Subtract 1 gives 1.467. So yes. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman alpha emission line from the quasar itself? Wait, no, the question is about absorption by the clouds. Maybe the question is considering that the quasar's emission must be in the optical as well. Let me think. The quasar emits a broad spectrum, but the absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. To observe the absorption, the observed wavelength must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be such that (1+z)*1216 is in the optical. So the minimal z is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is using a different value for the rest wavelength? Maybe they are using 1215.67 instead of 1216? Let me see. Let's do exact calculation. 3000 /1215.67 \u2248 3000 /1215.67. Let's compute 1215.67 \u00d7 2.468. Let me see 1215.67 \u00d72 =2431.34, plus 1215.67 \u00d70.468 \u2248 1215.67\u00d70.4=486.27, 1215.67\u00d70.068\u224882.7. So total 486.27+82.7=568.97. Total 2431.34+568.97\u22483000.3. So yes, so exactly 2.468 gives 3000.3, so z\u22481.468. So same as before. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. The closest is D)1.9, which is higher than needed. But why would the options include 2.4? That would be 3000/1216\u22482.467, so if the question is asking for the redshift where the observed wavelength is exactly 3000, then that's z=1.47, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe they are considering that the absorption must be in the visible (400-700 nm), so between 4000 and 7000 A. Let me try that. The lower end is 4000 A. Then (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.288, so z\u22482.29. The closest option is C)2.4. That would be the case if the cutoff is 4000. But then why would the question say \"optical\" which typically includes up to near-IR but starts at 300 nm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit of the quasar's redshift such that the absorption can be observed. Wait, the quasar's redshift must be higher than the cloud's redshift. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the quasar's redshift zq must be greater than the cloud's redshift zc. To observe the absorption, the observed wavelength of the cloud's absorption must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be at least ~1.47. But the question is about the cloud's redshift. So the lower limit for the cloud's redshift is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, maybe the question expects using the Lyman alpha wavelength in the rest frame of the quasar? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between emission and absorption. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength must be \u22653000 A. Therefore, the minimal z is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the quasar? Wait, no. The absorption is caused by the intervening cloud, so it's at the cloud's redshift. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the Lyman alpha wavelength. Let me confirm: Lyman alpha is 1215.67 \u00c5, so 1216 is correct. Hmm. Maybe the question expects us to use the approximate value of 1220? Let's try: 3000/1220 \u2248 2.459, so z\u22481.459, still ~1.46. Still not matching the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, the question says: \"the lower limit on the redshift of this objects\" (the clouds). So it's the cloud's redshift. So the answer must be approximately 1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe the question is considering that the absorption line must be in the optical window, so the observed wavelength must be between say 4000 and 7000 A. So the minimal observed wavelength is 4000 A. Then z would be (4000/1216) -1\u22482.29. So 2.3. Then the closest option is C)2.4. That's possible. Maybe the question assumes the optical starts at 4000 A. So perhaps that's the case. The problem might be using 4000 A as the lower limit of the optical. Let me see. If that's the case, then the answer would be C)2.4. Alternatively, the question might have a typo. But given the options, the closest is D)1.9 or C)2.4. If the cutoff is 3000 A, then D is higher than needed. If cutoff is 4000, then C is correct. The options include C and D. Let me see the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. If the answer is C)2.4, that would correspond to a cutoff of 4000 A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atmospheric cutoff for the Lyman alpha itself. Wait, no. The absorption is at a redshifted wavelength. The key point is that the observed wavelength must be above the atmospheric cutoff. So if the cutoff is 3000, the answer is ~1.47, but that's not an option. The closest options are D (1.9) and C (2.4). Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. The observed wavelength must be in the optical (above 3000 A). The rest wavelength of the cloud's absorption is 1216 A. The observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 A. To be detectable, this must be \u22653000 A. So solving for z gives z \u2265 (3000/1216) -1 \u22481.47. The question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z required. The options given are B (1.2) and D (1.9). Since 1.2 is below 1.47, it's insufficient. 1.9 is sufficient. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is that z must be at least ~1.47. The question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the smallest z where detection is possible is ~1.47. So the lower limit is that value. Since the options don't have it, but D is the first option above that value. So the answer must be D)1.9? But why isn't there an option between 1.2 and 1.9? Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe considering that the quasar's light must have the Lyman alpha emission in the optical as well. Let's see: the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1+z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. To be observed, that must be in the optical. But the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The absorption feature is at (1+z_c)*1216 A. To detect the absorption, that wavelength must be in the optical. The quasar's redshift must be greater than the cloud's, but the question is only about the cloud's redshift. So the calculation remains. I think the correct calculation gives z\u22481.47, and since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects the answer as D)1.9, assuming that the cutoff is higher. Alternatively, maybe the question's options are wrong. But given the options provided, I think the best possible answer is D)1.9. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest*(1+z). Wait, is that correct for absorption? Yes. Because the redshift is the same whether emission or absorption. So for an absorption line, the observed wavelength is indeed (1+z)*lambda_rest. So the calculation is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. If that's the case, then the quasar's redshift must be such that its light, when redshifted, includes the cloud's absorption at Lyman alpha. Wait, but that would complicate things. Let me think. Suppose the quasar is at redshift zq, and the cloud is at redshift zc < zq. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength of the absorption is (1+zc)*1216. To be detectable, this must be \u22653000 A. So the cloud's zc must be \u22651.47. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds), so that would still be zc \u22651.47. Therefore, the answer should be the minimal zc required, which is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, but D is 1.9, which is higher than that, perhaps the question intended the quasar's redshift. Let's try that. Suppose we want the quasar's redshift such that the cloud's absorption is at least 3000 A. Then the cloud's zc must be at least 1.47. But the quasar's redshift zq must be higher than zc. So the minimal zq would be just above 1.47. So again, the same problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the redshift where the observed Lyman alpha is in the visible (400-700 nm). So between 4000 and 7000 A. The minimal z would be (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.29. So 2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So maybe that's the intended answer. The question might consider the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) as the optical, so the lower limit is ~2.3, so option C. That makes sense. Maybe I was too strict with the atmospheric cutoff. If the optical is considered to start at 4000 A (400 nm), then the answer is C. So perhaps that's what the question expects. The problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\" and the visible spectrum is from ~400 nm upwards, so maybe they are using that. Let me recalculate with 4000 A: (4000/1216) -1 = (3.288) -1= 2.288, so ~2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So that's probably the intended answer. The confusion is whether the lower limit of the optical is 3000 or 4000 A. If it's 4000, then the answer is C. Given the options, I think that's what they expect. So I'll go with C)2.4.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (at 1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need the observed wavelength of the absorption to be within the optical window. The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations is typically considered to start around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) for the ultraviolet, but the visible optical window (400\u2013700 nm) starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nThe observed wavelength is given by:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\nTo ensure detectability in the optical (assuming the lower limit is 4000 \u00c5 for the visible spectrum):\n\\[\n4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.288 \\implies z \\approx 2.288\n\\]\nThe closest option to this value is **C) 2.4**.

Considering the visible spectrum's typical definition and the provided choices, **C) 2.4** is the most appropriate answer.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift for these neutral hydrogen clouds so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The question mentions that the clouds absorb light from quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Hmm, right, Lyman alpha is an emission line from hydrogen, but in this case, it's an absorption feature because the clouds are absorbing that wavelength from the quasar's light.\n\nThe key here is probably about the wavelength range that optical telescopes can detect. I remember that optical telescopes on the ground can observe wavelengths from roughly 3000 to 11000 Angstroms, but wait, maybe I should double-check that. Wait, visible light is from about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms, but maybe optical can go a bit lower and higher? Like ultraviolet starts below 4000? But ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it. So the lower end for optical might be around 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms) but maybe even a bit lower? Hmm. Wait, the atmosphere's cutoff for ground-based observations in the UV is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So anything below that can't be observed from the ground. So if the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame, but when redshifted, its observed wavelength would be longer. So the absorption line's wavelength as observed must be above the atmospheric cutoff to be detectable.\n\nSo the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than 3000 Angstroms? Because otherwise, the atmosphere would block it, so the telescope can't detect it. So we need to find the redshift z where the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A) when redshifted becomes 3000 A. Because that's the lower limit. If the redshift is higher than that, the observed wavelength would be longer, so still detectable. So solving for z where (1 + z)*1216 = 3000. Let me write that equation.\n\nThe formula for redshift is: the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So rearranged, z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: lambda_obs = 3000 A (the minimum detectable wavelength), lambda_rest is 1216 A. So z = (3000 / 1216) -1. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, divide 3000 by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 2 is 2432, so subtract that from 3000 gives 568. 568/1216 is about 0.467. So 2 + 0.467 is 2.467. Wait, no, that's wrong. Wait, wait, 3000 divided by 1216: let me do this more carefully. 1216 \u00d7 2.467 \u2248 1216 \u00d72 = 2432, plus 1216 \u00d70.467. Let me see: 0.467\u00d71216 \u2248 1216\u00d70.4 = 486.4, plus 1216\u00d70.067 \u2248 81.6, so total \u2248 568. So 2432+568 = 3000. So yes, 3000/1216 \u2248 2.467. So z \u2248 2.467 -1? Wait no, wait the formula is (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) -1. So 3000/1216 is about 2.467, so subtract 1 gives z \u2248 1.467. Wait, that's approximately 1.47. Wait, but that would be the redshift. Wait, but then the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, so that means that if the redshift is at least that value, then the observed wavelength is above 3000 A, so can be detected. So the lower limit is z \u2248 1.47. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option B (1.2) or D (1.9). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the rest wavelength and observed. Wait, the Lyman alpha is at 1216 A in the rest frame. The absorption occurs at that wavelength in the cloud's rest frame, but because the cloud is moving away (assuming it's part of the Hubble flow), the observed wavelength is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 A. To be detectable, that observed wavelength must be greater than 3000 A (since below that, the atmosphere blocks it). So solving (1+z)*1216 = 3000 gives 1+z = 3000/1216 \u2248 2.467, so z \u2248 1.467. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. The options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm, 1.47 is closest to 1.2 or 1.9? The options don't have 1.5, but perhaps I made an error here. Wait, maybe the cutoff is higher? Maybe the optical window is higher than 3000 A? Let me think again about the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 A), but maybe some telescopes can go a bit lower? Or maybe the question is considering that the telescope can only observe up to say, 4000 A? Wait, no, the problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical spectrum is usually considered from about 400 nm (4000 A) to 700 nm (7000 A). Wait, but then that would mean that wavelengths shorter than 4000 A (like 3000 A) are in the ultraviolet and blocked. Wait, but maybe the question is considering the atmospheric cutoff as 300 nm (3000 A), so anything below that can't be observed. So the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. So my calculation holds. So the redshift would be about 1.47. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I messed up the rest wavelength? Wait, Lyman alpha is indeed 1215.67 A, so 1216 is correct. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's emission, but no, the absorption is at Lyman alpha. Alternatively, maybe the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha is actually in the cloud's frame, so when redshifted, the absorption occurs at (1+z)*1216. So the absorption must be in the optical range. So to be detectable, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. Therefore, (1+z)*1216 >= 3000. Solving for z gives z >= (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.467. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. The options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. So 1.9 is higher than 1.47, so if the lower limit is 1.47, then any redshift above that can be detected. So the lower limit would be 1.47, so the minimal redshift required is ~1.47. Therefore, the answer should be the smallest option that is greater than or equal to that. The options are B)1.2 (too low, since 1.2 is less than 1.47, so if z was 1.2, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(2.2)= 2675 A, which is below 3000, so undetectable. So 1.2 is too low. The next is D)1.9. 1.9 would give 1216*(2.9)= 3526 A, which is above 3000, so detectable. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is that z must be at least ~1.47. So the question asks for the lower limit, so the smallest z where it can be detected. So the answer must be the smallest z in the options that is above 1.47. So between 1.2 and 1.9, the answer would be 1.9? Wait but 1.9 is higher than the required. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z such that it can be detected. So if the lower limit is ~1.47, then any z above that is okay. But the question says \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit would be that z must be at least ~1.47. So the options are B)1.2 (too low), D)1.9 (higher than needed). So perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be within the optical window (which is up to 1 micron, like 10000 A). But maybe the problem is expecting a different cutoff? Wait, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher. Let me think again. Maybe the optical window starts at 300 nm (3000 A) but ends at around 1100 nm (11000 A). So any observed wavelength between 3000 A and 11000 A is okay. So the absorption must have a wavelength in that range. The Lyman alpha is in the rest frame at 1216 A. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216. To be in the optical range (>=3000 A), so (1+z) must be >= 3000/1216 ~2.467, so z ~1.47. So the lower limit is z ~1.47, so the minimal redshift must be at least that. Therefore, the options given: the closest is D)1.9, but that's higher than 1.47. Wait, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed, so the entire spectrum is redshifted? Wait, no, the absorption occurs in the intergalactic medium, so the quasar is behind the clouds. The quasar's light passes through the clouds, which are at some redshift. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the cloud's hydrogen, so the absorption line's wavelength in the observed frame is (1+z_cloud)*1216 A. But the quasar's own redshift could be higher? Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the quasar's emission must also be in the optical. Wait, the question says the clouds are in deep space, so perhaps they are at a redshift less than the quasar? Or maybe not, but the key point is that the absorption line must be in the optical window. Wait, the quasar's own emission would be redshifted as well, but the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength of the absorption is (1+z_cloud)*1216. That must be above 3000 A. Therefore, the calculation as before. So the minimal redshift is ~1.47, so the answer must be the first option that is higher than that. The options are B:1.2 (too low), D:1.9 (sufficient). So the lower limit would be 1.47, so the minimal z must be at least that. So the question asks for the lower limit, so the answer is the minimal z required, which is approximately 1.47. Since the options don't have that, but D is 1.9, which is higher than required. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the atmospheric cutoff is higher. Let me check. The Earth's atmosphere allows light through in the so-called optical window from about 300 nm to around 1100 nm. The exact cutoff is about 300 nm (3000 A) for the lower end. So any wavelength below that is blocked. So the observed wavelength must be above 3000 A. So the calculation is correct. So the required z is ~1.47. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Since 1.2 is below the required, so the lower limit is the smallest z where it can be detected, so that would be approximately 1.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is considering a different cutoff? Maybe they are using 4000 A as the cutoff? Let's see. If the cutoff is 4000 A, then (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 (3.288) -1= 2.288, so z\u22482.29. The closest option is C)2.4. But then the answer would be C. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed Lyman alpha emission from the cloud itself is needed, but that's not the case here. The question is about the absorption in the quasar's spectrum. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check another approach. Suppose that the absorption occurs at a wavelength that's in the optical range. The rest wavelength is 1216 A. So observed wavelength must be between 3000 A and, say, 11000 A. So solving for the minimal z where observed is 3000 A gives z ~1.47. So that's the lower limit. The minimal required z is ~1.47. So any cloud with z less than that would have absorption at shorter wavelengths, undetectable. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. Among the options, the first one higher than that is D)1.9, but B) is 1.2, which is lower. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) so that they can be detected. The lower limit is the smallest redshift that allows detection. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer should be the smallest option that is at least that. But since the options don't have that, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha emission from the quasar must also be in the optical? Wait, the quasar emits over a broad spectrum, but the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. The key is the observed wavelength of the absorption feature. So the calculation holds. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's light at the rest frame Lyman alpha (1216 A) must be redshifted into the optical. So the quasar's emission at 1216 A (in its rest frame) would be observed at (1+z_quasar)*1216 A. But the absorption is at the cloud's redshift, so the observed absorption wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216. To detect the absorption, the observed wavelength must be in the optical. So if the cloud's redshift is such that (1+z_cloud)*1216 >= 3000, then it can be detected. So the minimal z_cloud is ~1.47. Therefore, the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is ~1.47. Since the options are given, perhaps the question expects an approximate value. The closest option is D)1.9, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate 3000 divided by 1216. Let me compute 1216 \u00d7 2 = 2432. 3000-2432 = 568. 568 divided by 1216 is 0.467. So total is 2.467, so z = 1.467. So ~1.47. The options are B)1.2, D)1.9. Hmm. The options might have a different cutoff. Wait, perhaps the cutoff is 4000 A? Let's see. 4000 /1216 = 3.288, so z = 2.288. The closest is C)2.4. But the question says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". Maybe the optical window is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 A)? Let me check. The visible spectrum is from ~400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So if they consider the optical to start at 4000 A, then the cutoff would be higher. But ground-based telescopes can observe near-UV (like 320 nm) with special instruments, but generally, the standard optical is 400-700 nm. So maybe the question is using 4000 A as the cutoff. Let's try that. So 4000 A. Then z = (4000/1216) -1 = (3.288) -1= 2.288. So ~2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So that would be the answer. But why would they use 4000 A instead of 3000? The problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\". If optical is considered to start at 4000 A (400 nm), then the answer would be C. But the initial assumption was 3000 A. Maybe I should check some references. The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations in the ultraviolet is around 300 nm (3000 A) because the atmosphere absorbs shorter wavelengths. So any wavelength longer than that (up to 1100 nm) can be observed. So the cutoff is 3000 A. Hence, the calculation should give z ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light must also be in the optical? Wait, but the quasar's light is being absorbed by the cloud. The quasar itself could be at a higher redshift. The absorption feature is at the cloud's redshift. For example, if the cloud is at z=1.5, then the absorption is at (1+1.5)*1216 ~ 3040 A, which is just above 3000. That's barely detectable. But maybe the question wants the minimal z where the absorption line is within the optical range. So the lower limit is z \u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The absorption line in the observed frame is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1+z). Wait, no, actually, the formula is that the observed wavelength is the rest wavelength multiplied by (1+z). So yes. So (1+z)= lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So if lambda_obs must be \u22653000 A, then (1+z) must be \u22653000/1216. So z \u2265 (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.467. The options given are B)1.2, D)1.9. Since 1.2 is below, and 1.9 is above, the minimal required is ~1.47. The lower limit is that you need at least that redshift. So the smallest possible z where it can be detected is ~1.47. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So the lower limit is the minimal z required, so the answer is the smallest option that is equal or higher than that. Since the options don't have 1.47, but D is 1.9 which is higher than required, but B is 1.2 which is too low. Wait, but maybe the question is phrased as the lower limit meaning the minimum z where detection is possible. So the lower limit is the smallest z possible where detection is possible. Therefore, the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer is the first option that is higher than or equal to that. Since 1.9 is higher than 1.47, but there's no option between 1.2 and 1.9, maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest given option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 3000 divided by 1216: let's compute 1216 \u00d72 = 2432. 2432 + 568 = 3000. 568/1216 = 0.467. So total multiplier is 2.467. Subtract 1 gives 1.467. So yes. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Lyman alpha emission line from the quasar itself? Wait, no, the question is about absorption by the clouds. Maybe the question is considering that the quasar's emission must be in the optical as well. Let me think. The quasar emits a broad spectrum, but the absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. To observe the absorption, the observed wavelength must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be such that (1+z)*1216 is in the optical. So the minimal z is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is using a different value for the rest wavelength? Maybe they are using 1215.67 instead of 1216? Let me see. Let's do exact calculation. 3000 /1215.67 \u2248 3000 /1215.67. Let's compute 1215.67 \u00d7 2.468. Let me see 1215.67 \u00d72 =2431.34, plus 1215.67 \u00d70.468 \u2248 1215.67\u00d70.4=486.27, 1215.67\u00d70.068\u224882.7. So total 486.27+82.7=568.97. Total 2431.34+568.97\u22483000.3. So yes, so exactly 2.468 gives 3000.3, so z\u22481.468. So same as before. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. The closest is D)1.9, which is higher than needed. But why would the options include 2.4? That would be 3000/1216\u22482.467, so if the question is asking for the redshift where the observed wavelength is exactly 3000, then that's z=1.47, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe they are considering that the absorption must be in the visible (400-700 nm), so between 4000 and 7000 A. Let me try that. The lower end is 4000 A. Then (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.288, so z\u22482.29. The closest option is C)2.4. That would be the case if the cutoff is 4000. But then why would the question say \"optical\" which typically includes up to near-IR but starts at 300 nm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the lower limit of the quasar's redshift such that the absorption can be observed. Wait, the quasar's redshift must be higher than the cloud's redshift. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the quasar's redshift zq must be greater than the cloud's redshift zc. To observe the absorption, the observed wavelength of the cloud's absorption must be in the optical. So the cloud's redshift must be at least ~1.47. But the question is about the cloud's redshift. So the lower limit for the cloud's redshift is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, maybe the question expects using the Lyman alpha wavelength in the rest frame of the quasar? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between emission and absorption. The Lyman alpha absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength must be \u22653000 A. Therefore, the minimal z is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the quasar? Wait, no. The absorption is caused by the intervening cloud, so it's at the cloud's redshift. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the Lyman alpha wavelength. Let me confirm: Lyman alpha is 1215.67 \u00c5, so 1216 is correct. Hmm. Maybe the question expects us to use the approximate value of 1220? Let's try: 3000/1220 \u2248 2.459, so z\u22481.459, still ~1.46. Still not matching the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, the question says: \"the lower limit on the redshift of this objects\" (the clouds). So it's the cloud's redshift. So the answer must be approximately 1.47. Since that's not an option, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe the question is considering that the absorption line must be in the optical window, so the observed wavelength must be between say 4000 and 7000 A. So the minimal observed wavelength is 4000 A. Then z would be (4000/1216) -1\u22482.29. So 2.3. Then the closest option is C)2.4. That's possible. Maybe the question assumes the optical starts at 4000 A. So perhaps that's the case. The problem might be using 4000 A as the lower limit of the optical. Let me see. If that's the case, then the answer would be C)2.4. Alternatively, the question might have a typo. But given the options, the closest is D)1.9 or C)2.4. If the cutoff is 3000 A, then D is higher than needed. If cutoff is 4000, then C is correct. The options include C and D. Let me see the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. If the answer is C)2.4, that would correspond to a cutoff of 4000 A. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atmospheric cutoff for the Lyman alpha itself. Wait, no. The absorption is at a redshifted wavelength. The key point is that the observed wavelength must be above the atmospheric cutoff. So if the cutoff is 3000, the answer is ~1.47, but that's not an option. The closest options are D (1.9) and C (2.4). Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think differently. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud. The observed wavelength must be in the optical (above 3000 A). The rest wavelength of the cloud's absorption is 1216 A. The observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 A. To be detectable, this must be \u22653000 A. So solving for z gives z \u2265 (3000/1216) -1 \u22481.47. The question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z required. The options given are B (1.2) and D (1.9). Since 1.2 is below 1.47, it's insufficient. 1.9 is sufficient. So the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is that z must be at least ~1.47. The question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the smallest z where detection is possible is ~1.47. So the lower limit is that value. Since the options don't have it, but D is the first option above that value. So the answer must be D)1.9? But why isn't there an option between 1.2 and 1.9? Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe considering that the quasar's light must have the Lyman alpha emission in the optical as well. Let's see: the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1+z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. To be observed, that must be in the optical. But the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The absorption feature is at (1+z_c)*1216 A. To detect the absorption, that wavelength must be in the optical. The quasar's redshift must be greater than the cloud's, but the question is only about the cloud's redshift. So the calculation remains. I think the correct calculation gives z\u22481.47, and since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects the answer as D)1.9, assuming that the cutoff is higher. Alternatively, maybe the question's options are wrong. But given the options provided, I think the best possible answer is D)1.9. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest*(1+z). Wait, is that correct for absorption? Yes. Because the redshift is the same whether emission or absorption. So for an absorption line, the observed wavelength is indeed (1+z)*lambda_rest. So the calculation is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. If that's the case, then the quasar's redshift must be such that its light, when redshifted, includes the cloud's absorption at Lyman alpha. Wait, but that would complicate things. Let me think. Suppose the quasar is at redshift zq, and the cloud is at redshift zc < zq. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength of the absorption is (1+zc)*1216. To be detectable, this must be \u22653000 A. So the cloud's zc must be \u22651.47. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds), so that would still be zc \u22651.47. Therefore, the answer should be the minimal zc required, which is ~1.47. Since that's not an option, but D is 1.9, which is higher than that, perhaps the question intended the quasar's redshift. Let's try that. Suppose we want the quasar's redshift such that the cloud's absorption is at least 3000 A. Then the cloud's zc must be at least 1.47. But the quasar's redshift zq must be higher than zc. So the minimal zq would be just above 1.47. So again, the same problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the redshift where the observed Lyman alpha is in the visible (400-700 nm). So between 4000 and 7000 A. The minimal z would be (4000/1216) -1 \u22482.29. So 2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So maybe that's the intended answer. The question might consider the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) as the optical, so the lower limit is ~2.3, so option C. That makes sense. Maybe I was too strict with the atmospheric cutoff. If the optical is considered to start at 4000 A (400 nm), then the answer is C. So perhaps that's what the question expects. The problem states \"optical ground-based telescopes\" and the visible spectrum is from ~400 nm upwards, so maybe they are using that. Let me recalculate with 4000 A: (4000/1216) -1 = (3.288) -1= 2.288, so ~2.29. The closest option is C)2.4. So that's probably the intended answer. The confusion is whether the lower limit of the optical is 3000 or 4000 A. If it's 4000, then the answer is C. Given the options, I think that's what they expect. So I'll go with C)2.4.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption (at 1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need the observed wavelength of the absorption to be within the optical window. The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observations is typically considered to start around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) for the ultraviolet, but the visible optical window (400\u2013700 nm) starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nThe observed wavelength is given by:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\nTo ensure detectability in the optical (assuming the lower limit is 4000 \u00c5 for the visible spectrum):\n\\[\n4000 \\, \\text{\u00c5} = 1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.288 \\implies z \\approx 2.288\n\\]\nThe closest option to this value is **C) 2.4**. This assumes the optical window starts at 4000 \u00c5. While the atmospheric cutoff at 3000 \u00c5 would yield \\( z \\approx 1.47 \\), the given options do not include this value. Considering the visible spectrum's typical definition and the provided choices, **C) 2.4** is the most appropriate answer.\n\nAnswer: C",
