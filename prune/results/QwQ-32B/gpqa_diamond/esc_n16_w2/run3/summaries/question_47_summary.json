      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about identifying the compound C9H11NO2 based on IR and NMR data. Alright, first I need to go through each piece of data and see what functional groups or structures they suggest.\n\nStarting with the IR spectrum. The first thing I remember is that IR bands can help identify functional groups. The problem states there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the region for N-H stretching. Wait, amide N-H typically has a broad band around 3300 cm-1. But there are two peaks here. Maybe one is an amide and another an alcohol or something else? Wait, but the compound's formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The nitrogens here might be part of an amide group or an amine. \n\nThen there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. A carboxylic acid would have a lower wavenumber, around 1700-1710, but maybe an ester or amide? Wait, esters have C=O around 1740 cm-1, but maybe the exact value can vary. Wait, maybe I should recall exact ranges better. Wait, amides have their C=O around 1640-1680 cm-1, while esters are around 1730-1750. So 1720 is closer to an ester's carbonyl. Hmm. So that suggests there's an ester group here. But wait, the molecular formula includes an N, so maybe it's an amide? Wait, but the carbonyl is at 1720, which is more ester-like. Wait, but maybe the molecule has both an ester and an amide? Or perhaps the amide's carbonyl is shifted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester, and the N is part of an amine. Let me think. Let's look at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR data shows several peaks. The first peak is at 1.20 ppm as a triplet (t, 3H). That's probably the methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group (since triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2). Then there's a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet could be an exchangeable proton, like an alcohol or amine. Wait, but amines can have NH protons as broad singlets. Then 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H), which would be the CH2 next to the ethyl group's CH3 (so that's the CH2O part of an ethoxy group? Because ethoxy is O-CH2-CH3, so the CH2 would be next to the oxygen and have a quartet from the adjacent CH3). \n\nPutting that together, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would correspond to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), but in an ethoxy group (O-CH2-CH3). So that part is likely an ethoxy group, so part of an ester or ether. Since the carbonyl is at 1720 (which is ester-like), maybe the ester group is ethyl something. The ester would be R-O-CH2-CH3, so the ethyl group is part of the ester's R-O-CO-R' group? Wait, the ester structure is O-C(=O)-O-R. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so the ethoxy would be part of the R' group. Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is part of the ester. For example, if it's an ethyl ester, then the ester oxygen is connected to the ethyl group. \n\nNow, the other peaks in the NMR: the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest aromatic protons. The doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 might be on a benzene ring. Let's think about the positions. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, maybe ortho or meta? But the 8.0 is also a doublet. The positions would depend on the substituents. For example, if there's an amide group attached to the benzene, that would de-shield the aromatic protons. Alternatively, if there's an ethoxy group and an amine group, their positions would affect the chemical shifts. \n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. The benzene ring (C6H5) plus other groups. Let's see: if it's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see, the ethoxy group (C2H5O-) would account for C2, H5 (but actually, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, so that's C2H5O). So the ethoxy group contributes 2 carbons. Then the carbonyl group (from the ester) would be another carbon. Wait, the ester is part of the structure. Let me think of possible options. \n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is in the 3-position. So structure would be OCH2CH3 attached at position 3, and CONH2 at another position? Wait, but the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C7+2=9, H7 - (since ethoxy has 5 H's? Wait, benzene with ethoxy and amide: the ethoxy adds 2 carbons, and the amide adds 1 (the carbonyl). Let me count: C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide carbonyl) = 9 carbons. The hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (if two substituents), then ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), amide's NH2 has 2 H. Wait, but the actual molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute each option's formula.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is OCH2CH2- in position 3, and CONH2. Wait, benzamide's formula is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (which is OCH2CH3, so adds 2 carbons and 5 H?) Let's see: the benzene ring has 6 C, the ethoxy adds 2 C (so total 8?), but the benzamide's CONH2 adds another carbon? Wait, benzamide is Ph-C(=O)-NH2. So the benzamide has 7 carbons (Ph is 6, plus the carbonyl carbon?), so adding ethoxy (2 carbons) would make 8 carbons? Wait, maybe my math is off. Let's do it properly.\n\nBenzene (C6H6) + ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O-) would be part of the benzene substituents. Then the amide group (CONH2) is another substituent. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide's carbonyl carbon) = 9. So that's C9. Hydrogens: benzene with three substituents (ethoxy and amide) would have 6 - 3 = 3 H on the ring. The ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3), the amide's NH2 has 2 H. The amide's carbonyl is O=C-NH2. Wait, but the amide's structure: the benzene ring attached to C(=O)NH2. So the total H would be:\n\nBenzene ring: 6 - 3 (substituents) = 3 H (on the ring not substituted). The ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), the amide's NH2 has 2 H, the carbonyl group doesn't add H. So total H: 3 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) + 2 (NH2) = 10 H. Wait but the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy here. Let me count again. \n\nWait, benzene (6 C) plus ethoxy (2 C) plus the amide's carbonyl (1 C) gives 9 C. For H:\n\nThe benzene ring has 5 H (since three substituents take three Hs away from the benzene's 6). Wait, actually, each substituent replaces a H. So 6 -3 =3 H left on the ring. The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which has 5 H (the two CH2 and CH3). The amide group is CONH2: the carbonyl is attached to the benzene, and the NH2 has two H. So the NH2 contributes 2 H. So total H is 3 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (NH2) = 10. The formula would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H short. So maybe that's not the right option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amide is not a primary amide. Wait, benzamide is primary amide (RCONH2). Let's check option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be an ester where the benzene has a carboxylate ester group (so O-CO-OEt) and an amino group. Let's see the formula for D. \n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is Ph-COOCH2CH3, with an NH2 on the 4-position. The benzene ring has 6 C, the COOCH2CH3 adds 2 C (the ethyl group) and the COO is part of the ester (so the COO is two oxygens and the carbonyl). The amino group is NH2. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: the COO is part of the ester, but the ethyl adds 2 carbons, so total 2 more) plus the carbonyl carbon is part of the ester. Wait, the structure is Ph-COO-CH2CH3. So the benzene is attached to the COO group. The COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (the COO is between the benzene and the ethyl). Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is part of the ester, so the ester's carbonyl is part of the benzene ring's substituent. So total carbons: benzene (6) + 3 (from COOCH2CH3: the COO is O2C- part, then CH2CH3 is 2 carbons, so total 3?) Wait, the COOCH2CH3 group has 3 carbons (the COO is O=C-O-, so the ethyl group is CH2CH3 attached to the O). So the carbonyl is part of the ester. So total carbons: 6 + 3 (from the ester part) = 9. The amino group is on the benzene ring. \n\nHydrogens: Let's count. The benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents: the ester and the NH2). Wait, substituents on the benzene: the ester group (at position 4?), and the amino group (position 4? Wait, the name is 4-aminobenzoate. So the amino is on the 4-position, and the ester is on the carboxylic acid part. Wait, the benzoate part is the carboxylate. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the carboxylic acid is esterified. So the benzene ring has a -COOEt group (the ester) at the carboxylic acid position, and the amino group is at the 4-position relative to that? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the amino is in the 4-position relative to the ester group. \n\nAlternatively, the formula: The ester part (Ph-COOCH2CH3) would have:\n\nBenzene (6 C), the ester's carbonyl is part of the group, then the ethyl adds 2 C (so total 6+3=9 C). The amino group is on the benzene, so it's NH2 attached to a carbon on the ring. \n\nHydrogen count: Benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents: the ester and the NH2). The ester group's ethyl has 5 H (CH2CH3), the NH2 has 2 H. The benzene ring's remaining H is 5 (since two substituents take away two H). Wait, wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces a H. So if there are two substituents (the ester and the amino group), then 6-2=4 H on the ring. Wait, that would be 4 H on the ring. Then the ester's ethyl has 5 H, the amino has 2 H. Total H: 4 +5 +2 =11. Plus, the carbonyl group doesn't add H. So total H would be 11, which matches the formula C9H11NO2. So that's a possibility. \n\nLooking at the options, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would fit the formula. Let's check the NMR data for that. \n\nThe NMR data given is: \n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's the CH3 of the ethyl group (since the CH3 is a triplet from the adjacent CH2). \n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 broad singlet, which could be the NH2 group (amine). Amines can show as broad singlets because the protons exchange rapidly. \n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 the CH2 in the ethoxy group (since it's adjacent to the CH3, so quartet from the 3H on the CH3). \n\nThen the aromatic peaks at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). Let's think about the aromatic regions. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure would have an amino group at the 4-position (relative to the ester group). Wait, the ester group is on the carboxylic acid position, so the numbering would start there. Let me imagine the structure as: \n\nThe benzene ring has the -COOEt group at position 1 (the carboxylic acid part), so the amino group is at position 4 (so meta to the ester group). The substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining hydrogens would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The amino group (NH2) is on the 4th carbon. The ester group is on the 1st. \n\nThe aromatic protons would be split into different chemical shifts based on their positions relative to the substituents. The NH2 is a strong deactivating group, but the ester is also deactivating. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded. Let's see, in such a structure, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (meta to the amino) might be a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the ester and meta to the amino?) Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 are due to ortho and para protons. \n\nAlternatively, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 could be the two sets of aromatic protons. For example, in a meta disubstituted benzene (since the substituents are in 1 and 4?), the protons might split into two doublets. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the amino and ester groups are para? Wait, the name is 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate part is the carboxylate ester, so the ester is on the carboxylic acid (position 1), then the amino is at position 4. So the substituents are para? Wait, positions 1 and 4 would be para on a benzene ring. So the amino and ester are para. That would make the aromatic protons ortho and meta. Wait, maybe the two doublets correspond to the two different sets of protons. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the chemical shifts. The NH2 is in the para position. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be more deshielded. Let's think: the amino group is electron-donating (since it's NH2), but the ester group is electron-withdrawing. The combination might affect the chemical shifts. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons. In a benzene ring with substituents, the positions of the protons can be determined by their shifts. For example, in o-xylene, the meta protons are around 7.0-7.2, and the ortho are around 6.8-7.0. But with different groups, it can vary. \n\nThe peaks given are 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). The higher shift (8.0 ppm) suggests more deshielding. So maybe those protons are near the electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The lower shift (7.0) is near the amino group. \n\nAlternatively, in a structure where the amino is at position 4 and the ester at 1 (para), then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (meta to the amino, and ortho to the ester?) Wait, maybe positions 2 and 6 would be meta to the amino and ortho to the ester? Hmm, perhaps the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the ester group) would be more deshielded because of the ester's electron-withdrawing effect, leading to a higher chemical shift (like 8.0 ppm). The protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta to the ester and ortho to the amino?) would be less deshielded, maybe around 7.0 ppm. \n\nSo that would give two doublets: the 8.0 (ortho to ester) and 7.0 (meta to ester, ortho to amino). The multiplicity as doublets makes sense if they are each next to a single substituent. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits the molecular formula and the NMR data. Let me check the other options to be sure. \n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (CHO). Wait, formamide is HCONH2. Wait, the structure here would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: so the formamide is attached to a phenyl group with an ethoxy substituent. The structure would be: \n\nPhenyl group (with ethoxy at 4) attached to the formyl group (CHO) via the N? Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. Wait, the name would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formyl group is attached to the phenyl via the nitrogen. Wait, perhaps the structure is: the phenyl group has an ethoxy at position 4, and the formyl group is attached via an amide linkage. Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH(NH2)-CO? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula. The molecular formula for option B would be:\n\nPhenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (OCH2CH3) gives 6+2=8 carbons. Then formamide (HCONH2) has 1 carbon. So total carbons: 9. So that matches C9. The formula would be C9H? Let's count H:\n\nPhenyl group with ethoxy and formamide substituents. The benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents). The ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3). The formamide: the formyl group (HCONH2) has the H on the carbonyl? Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. So the formamide group has two H on the NH2 and one on the formyl. Wait, but the formamide is attached to the phenyl group. Let me structure it as N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: so the formamide is H2N-C(=O)- attached to the phenyl. The phenyl has ethoxy at 4. \n\nThe benzene ring has 6 C, ethoxy adds 2, formamide adds 1 (the formyl carbon). Total 9. The H count: benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents). Ethoxy:5 H. The formamide's NH2 has 2 H, and the formyl has one H (the H on the carbonyl group? Wait, formamide's structure is H2N-C(=O)-H. So the carbonyl has an H attached. So that H is part of the formamide. So total H from formamide: 2 (NH2) +1 (formyl H) = 3. The ethoxy has 5. The benzene ring's remaining H: 5. So total H: 5+5+3 =13? But the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe I miscalculated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formamide is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure is (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-C(=O)-H. The formamide group has the structure H2N-C(=O)-R. Wait, no, the name would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formyl group (H-C(=O)-) is attached via the N. So the structure is:\n\nH2N-C(=O)-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, but the benzene ring's ethoxy is at position 4. The formamide's H is on the formyl carbon. Let me count H again. Benzene ring with two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) leaves 4 H. Ethoxy:5 H. The formamide's NH2 has 2 H, the formyl H is one. The formamide's carbonyl doesn't add H. So total H: 4 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide's H) = 12. Still not matching. The formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Maybe this option is incorrect. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at 4. The structure would be Ph-COOCH2CH2CH3, with NH2 on the 4-position. Let's see the formula. \n\nPhenyl (6C), the propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) adds 4 carbons (COO is two O's, but the ethyl group here is propyl? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2CH2COOH? Wait, propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is the ester from propionic acid. The propionate group would be -COOCH2CH2CH3 (since propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so the ester is CH3CH2COO-). Wait, so the propionate group has 3 carbons (the COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 3 carbons in the CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's 3 carbons: the COO is part of the ester, then CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) +1 (COO's carbonyl?) Wait, the benzene attached to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons would be 6 + 4 (the COO is O2C- attached to the benzene and the propyl group). Wait, the propionate group is COOCH2CH2CH3, so that's 4 carbons (the COO is between the benzene and the propyl group). So total carbons: 6 +4 =10? Which would exceed the given formula C9. Hmm, so that's not correct. Therefore option C is out. \n\nSo back to option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me confirm the NMR data again. The 1H NMR peaks are:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H) \u2013 CH3 of the ethyl group (the ethyl is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, so the CH2CH3 part). The CH3 is a triplet from the adjacent CH2 (so J coupling to the CH2). \n\n4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2013 the NH2 group (amine), which is broad. \n\n4.5 (q, 2H) \u2013 the CH2 in the ethyl group (adjacent to the CH3, so quartet from the 3H on the CH3). \n\nThe aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0. The chemical shifts for the aromatic protons make sense given the substituents. The IR data: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl (so that matches the ester group in option D). The bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 could be the NH2 group's protons (since amines have broad peaks around 3300-3500, and there might be two peaks due to hydrogen bonding or different environments). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound in question has a molecular formula of C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, indicative of an ester carbonyl group (C=O). The medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 correspond to the N-H stretching vibrations of an amine group (NH2), which is broad due to hydrogen bonding. \n\nThe 1H NMR data reveals:\n- A triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponding to the methyl group (CH3) of an ethyl group (CH2CH3).\n- A quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) from the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the ethyl's CH3, confirming the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) group.\n- A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) attributed to the NH2 group, consistent with an amine.\n- Doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) suggest aromatic protons influenced by substituents. The higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) indicates proximity to an electron-withdrawing group (ester), while the lower shift (7.0 ppm) reflects proximity to an electron-donating group (amine).\n\nOption D, **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, fits this analysis. The structure includes an ethyl ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a 4-aminophenyl group, providing the required molecular formula and NMR/IR features. The other options either mismatch the molecular formula (e.g., C) or fail to account for the amine and ester groups properly (e.g., A, B).\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about identifying the compound C9H11NO2 based on IR and NMR data. Alright, first I need to go through each piece of data and see what functional groups or structures they suggest.\n\nStarting with the IR spectrum. The first thing I remember is that IR bands can help identify functional groups. The problem states there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the region for N-H stretching. Wait, amide N-H typically has a broad band around 3300 cm-1. But there are two peaks here. Maybe one is an amide and another an alcohol or something else? Wait, but the compound's formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The nitrogens here might be part of an amide group or an amine. \n\nThen there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. A carboxylic acid would have a lower wavenumber, around 1700-1710, but maybe an ester or amide? Wait, esters have C=O around 1740 cm-1, but maybe the exact value can vary. Wait, maybe I should recall exact ranges better. Wait, amides have their C=O around 1640-1680 cm-1, while esters are around 1730-1750. So 1720 is closer to an ester's carbonyl. Hmm. So that suggests there's an ester group here. But wait, the molecular formula includes an N, so maybe it's an amide? Wait, but the carbonyl is at 1720, which is more ester-like. Wait, but maybe the molecule has both an ester and an amide? Or perhaps the amide's carbonyl is shifted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester, and the N is part of an amine. Let me think. Let's look at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR data shows several peaks. The first peak is at 1.20 ppm as a triplet (t, 3H). That's probably the methyl group (CH3) in an ethyl group (since triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2). Then there's a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet could be an exchangeable proton, like an alcohol or amine. Wait, but amines can have NH protons as broad singlets. Then 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q, 2H), which would be the CH2 next to the ethyl group's CH3 (so that's the CH2O part of an ethoxy group? Because ethoxy is O-CH2-CH3, so the CH2 would be next to the oxygen and have a quartet from the adjacent CH3). \n\nPutting that together, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would correspond to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), but in an ethoxy group (O-CH2-CH3). So that part is likely an ethoxy group, so part of an ester or ether. Since the carbonyl is at 1720 (which is ester-like), maybe the ester group is ethyl something. The ester would be R-O-CH2-CH3, so the ethyl group is part of the ester's R-O-CO-R' group? Wait, the ester structure is O-C(=O)-O-R. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so the ethoxy would be part of the R' group. Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is part of the ester. For example, if it's an ethyl ester, then the ester oxygen is connected to the ethyl group. \n\nNow, the other peaks in the NMR: the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest aromatic protons. The doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 might be on a benzene ring. Let's think about the positions. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, maybe ortho or meta? But the 8.0 is also a doublet. The positions would depend on the substituents. For example, if there's an amide group attached to the benzene, that would de-shield the aromatic protons. Alternatively, if there's an ethoxy group and an amine group, their positions would affect the chemical shifts. \n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. The benzene ring (C6H5) plus other groups. Let's see: if it's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see, the ethoxy group (C2H5O-) would account for C2, H5 (but actually, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, so that's C2H5O). So the ethoxy group contributes 2 carbons. Then the carbonyl group (from the ester) would be another carbon. Wait, the ester is part of the structure. Let me think of possible options. \n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is in the 3-position. So structure would be OCH2CH3 attached at position 3, and CONH2 at another position? Wait, but the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C7+2=9, H7 - (since ethoxy has 5 H's? Wait, benzene with ethoxy and amide: the ethoxy adds 2 carbons, and the amide adds 1 (the carbonyl). Let me count: C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide carbonyl) = 9 carbons. The hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (if two substituents), then ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), amide's NH2 has 2 H. Wait, but the actual molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute each option's formula.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is OCH2CH2- in position 3, and CONH2. Wait, benzamide's formula is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (which is OCH2CH3, so adds 2 carbons and 5 H?) Let's see: the benzene ring has 6 C, the ethoxy adds 2 C (so total 8?), but the benzamide's CONH2 adds another carbon? Wait, benzamide is Ph-C(=O)-NH2. So the benzamide has 7 carbons (Ph is 6, plus the carbonyl carbon?), so adding ethoxy (2 carbons) would make 8 carbons? Wait, maybe my math is off. Let's do it properly.\n\nBenzene (C6H6) + ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O-) would be part of the benzene substituents. Then the amide group (CONH2) is another substituent. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (amide's carbonyl carbon) = 9. So that's C9. Hydrogens: benzene with three substituents (ethoxy and amide) would have 6 - 3 = 3 H on the ring. The ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3), the amide's NH2 has 2 H. The amide's carbonyl is O=C-NH2. Wait, but the amide's structure: the benzene ring attached to C(=O)NH2. So the total H would be:\n\nBenzene ring: 6 - 3 (substituents) = 3 H (on the ring not substituted). The ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3), the amide's NH2 has 2 H, the carbonyl group doesn't add H. So total H: 3 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) + 2 (NH2) = 10 H. Wait but the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy here. Let me count again. \n\nWait, benzene (6 C) plus ethoxy (2 C) plus the amide's carbonyl (1 C) gives 9 C. For H:\n\nThe benzene ring has 5 H (since three substituents take three Hs away from the benzene's 6). Wait, actually, each substituent replaces a H. So 6 -3 =3 H left on the ring. The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which has 5 H (the two CH2 and CH3). The amide group is CONH2: the carbonyl is attached to the benzene, and the NH2 has two H. So the NH2 contributes 2 H. So total H is 3 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (NH2) = 10. The formula would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H short. So maybe that's not the right option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amide is not a primary amide. Wait, benzamide is primary amide (RCONH2). Let's check option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be an ester where the benzene has a carboxylate ester group (so O-CO-OEt) and an amino group. Let's see the formula for D. \n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is Ph-COOCH2CH3, with an NH2 on the 4-position. The benzene ring has 6 C, the COOCH2CH3 adds 2 C (the ethyl group) and the COO is part of the ester (so the COO is two oxygens and the carbonyl). The amino group is NH2. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: the COO is part of the ester, but the ethyl adds 2 carbons, so total 2 more) plus the carbonyl carbon is part of the ester. Wait, the structure is Ph-COO-CH2CH3. So the benzene is attached to the COO group. The COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (the COO is between the benzene and the ethyl). Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is part of the ester, so the ester's carbonyl is part of the benzene ring's substituent. So total carbons: benzene (6) + 3 (from COOCH2CH3: the COO is O2C- part, then CH2CH3 is 2 carbons, so total 3?) Wait, the COOCH2CH3 group has 3 carbons (the COO is O=C-O-, so the ethyl group is CH2CH3 attached to the O). So the carbonyl is part of the ester. So total carbons: 6 + 3 (from the ester part) = 9. The amino group is on the benzene ring. \n\nHydrogens: Let's count. The benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents: the ester and the NH2). Wait, substituents on the benzene: the ester group (at position 4?), and the amino group (position 4? Wait, the name is 4-aminobenzoate. So the amino is on the 4-position, and the ester is on the carboxylic acid part. Wait, the benzoate part is the carboxylate. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the carboxylic acid is esterified. So the benzene ring has a -COOEt group (the ester) at the carboxylic acid position, and the amino group is at the 4-position relative to that? Wait, maybe the numbering is such that the amino is in the 4-position relative to the ester group. \n\nAlternatively, the formula: The ester part (Ph-COOCH2CH3) would have:\n\nBenzene (6 C), the ester's carbonyl is part of the group, then the ethyl adds 2 C (so total 6+3=9 C). The amino group is on the benzene, so it's NH2 attached to a carbon on the ring. \n\nHydrogen count: Benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents: the ester and the NH2). The ester group's ethyl has 5 H (CH2CH3), the NH2 has 2 H. The benzene ring's remaining H is 5 (since two substituents take away two H). Wait, wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces a H. So if there are two substituents (the ester and the amino group), then 6-2=4 H on the ring. Wait, that would be 4 H on the ring. Then the ester's ethyl has 5 H, the amino has 2 H. Total H: 4 +5 +2 =11. Plus, the carbonyl group doesn't add H. So total H would be 11, which matches the formula C9H11NO2. So that's a possibility. \n\nLooking at the options, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would fit the formula. Let's check the NMR data for that. \n\nThe NMR data given is: \n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's the CH3 of the ethyl group (since the CH3 is a triplet from the adjacent CH2). \n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 broad singlet, which could be the NH2 group (amine). Amines can show as broad singlets because the protons exchange rapidly. \n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 the CH2 in the ethoxy group (since it's adjacent to the CH3, so quartet from the 3H on the CH3). \n\nThen the aromatic peaks at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). Let's think about the aromatic regions. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure would have an amino group at the 4-position (relative to the ester group). Wait, the ester group is on the carboxylic acid position, so the numbering would start there. Let me imagine the structure as: \n\nThe benzene ring has the -COOEt group at position 1 (the carboxylic acid part), so the amino group is at position 4 (so meta to the ester group). The substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining hydrogens would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The amino group (NH2) is on the 4th carbon. The ester group is on the 1st. \n\nThe aromatic protons would be split into different chemical shifts based on their positions relative to the substituents. The NH2 is a strong deactivating group, but the ester is also deactivating. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded. Let's see, in such a structure, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (meta to the amino) might be a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the ester and meta to the amino?) Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 are due to ortho and para protons. \n\nAlternatively, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 could be the two sets of aromatic protons. For example, in a meta disubstituted benzene (since the substituents are in 1 and 4?), the protons might split into two doublets. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the amino and ester groups are para? Wait, the name is 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate part is the carboxylate ester, so the ester is on the carboxylic acid (position 1), then the amino is at position 4. So the substituents are para? Wait, positions 1 and 4 would be para on a benzene ring. So the amino and ester are para. That would make the aromatic protons ortho and meta. Wait, maybe the two doublets correspond to the two different sets of protons. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the chemical shifts. The NH2 is in the para position. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be more deshielded. Let's think: the amino group is electron-donating (since it's NH2), but the ester group is electron-withdrawing. The combination might affect the chemical shifts. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons. In a benzene ring with substituents, the positions of the protons can be determined by their shifts. For example, in o-xylene, the meta protons are around 7.0-7.2, and the ortho are around 6.8-7.0. But with different groups, it can vary. \n\nThe peaks given are 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). The higher shift (8.0 ppm) suggests more deshielding. So maybe those protons are near the electron-withdrawing group (the ester). The lower shift (7.0) is near the amino group. \n\nAlternatively, in a structure where the amino is at position 4 and the ester at 1 (para), then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (meta to the amino, and ortho to the ester?) Wait, maybe positions 2 and 6 would be meta to the amino and ortho to the ester? Hmm, perhaps the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the ester group) would be more deshielded because of the ester's electron-withdrawing effect, leading to a higher chemical shift (like 8.0 ppm). The protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta to the ester and ortho to the amino?) would be less deshielded, maybe around 7.0 ppm. \n\nSo that would give two doublets: the 8.0 (ortho to ester) and 7.0 (meta to ester, ortho to amino). The multiplicity as doublets makes sense if they are each next to a single substituent. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which fits the molecular formula and the NMR data. Let me check the other options to be sure. \n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (CHO). Wait, formamide is HCONH2. Wait, the structure here would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: so the formamide is attached to a phenyl group with an ethoxy substituent. The structure would be: \n\nPhenyl group (with ethoxy at 4) attached to the formyl group (CHO) via the N? Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. Wait, the name would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formyl group is attached to the phenyl via the nitrogen. Wait, perhaps the structure is: the phenyl group has an ethoxy at position 4, and the formyl group is attached via an amide linkage. Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH(NH2)-CO? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula. The molecular formula for option B would be:\n\nPhenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (OCH2CH3) gives 6+2=8 carbons. Then formamide (HCONH2) has 1 carbon. So total carbons: 9. So that matches C9. The formula would be C9H? Let's count H:\n\nPhenyl group with ethoxy and formamide substituents. The benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents). The ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3). The formamide: the formyl group (HCONH2) has the H on the carbonyl? Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. So the formamide group has two H on the NH2 and one on the formyl. Wait, but the formamide is attached to the phenyl group. Let me structure it as N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: so the formamide is H2N-C(=O)- attached to the phenyl. The phenyl has ethoxy at 4. \n\nThe benzene ring has 6 C, ethoxy adds 2, formamide adds 1 (the formyl carbon). Total 9. The H count: benzene ring has 5 H (since two substituents). Ethoxy:5 H. The formamide's NH2 has 2 H, and the formyl has one H (the H on the carbonyl group? Wait, formamide's structure is H2N-C(=O)-H. So the carbonyl has an H attached. So that H is part of the formamide. So total H from formamide: 2 (NH2) +1 (formyl H) = 3. The ethoxy has 5. The benzene ring's remaining H: 5. So total H: 5+5+3 =13? But the formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe I miscalculated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formamide is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure is (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-C(=O)-H. The formamide group has the structure H2N-C(=O)-R. Wait, no, the name would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formyl group (H-C(=O)-) is attached via the N. So the structure is:\n\nH2N-C(=O)-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, but the benzene ring's ethoxy is at position 4. The formamide's H is on the formyl carbon. Let me count H again. Benzene ring with two substituents (ethoxy and formamide) leaves 4 H. Ethoxy:5 H. The formamide's NH2 has 2 H, the formyl H is one. The formamide's carbonyl doesn't add H. So total H: 4 (ring) +5 (ethoxy) +3 (formamide's H) = 12. Still not matching. The formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Maybe this option is incorrect. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester attached to a benzene ring with an amino group at 4. The structure would be Ph-COOCH2CH2CH3, with NH2 on the 4-position. Let's see the formula. \n\nPhenyl (6C), the propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) adds 4 carbons (COO is two O's, but the ethyl group here is propyl? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2CH2COOH? Wait, propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate is the ester from propionic acid. The propionate group would be -COOCH2CH2CH3 (since propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so the ester is CH3CH2COO-). Wait, so the propionate group has 3 carbons (the COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 3 carbons in the CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's 3 carbons: the COO is part of the ester, then CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) +1 (COO's carbonyl?) Wait, the benzene attached to COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons would be 6 + 4 (the COO is O2C- attached to the benzene and the propyl group). Wait, the propionate group is COOCH2CH2CH3, so that's 4 carbons (the COO is between the benzene and the propyl group). So total carbons: 6 +4 =10? Which would exceed the given formula C9. Hmm, so that's not correct. Therefore option C is out. \n\nSo back to option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me confirm the NMR data again. The 1H NMR peaks are:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H) \u2013 CH3 of the ethyl group (the ethyl is O-CO-O-CH2CH3, so the CH2CH3 part). The CH3 is a triplet from the adjacent CH2 (so J coupling to the CH2). \n\n4.0 (bs, 2H) \u2013 the NH2 group (amine), which is broad. \n\n4.5 (q, 2H) \u2013 the CH2 in the ethyl group (adjacent to the CH3, so quartet from the 3H on the CH3). \n\nThe aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0. The chemical shifts for the aromatic protons make sense given the substituents. The IR data: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl (so that matches the ester group in option D). The bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 could be the NH2 group's protons (since amines have broad peaks around 3300-3500, and there might be two peaks due to hydrogen bonding or different environments). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nThe compound in question has a molecular formula of C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, indicative of an ester carbonyl group (C=O). The medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 correspond to the N-H stretching vibrations of an amine group (NH2), which is broad due to hydrogen bonding. \n\nThe 1H NMR data reveals:\n- A triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponding to the methyl group (CH3) of an ethyl group (CH2CH3).\n- A quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) from the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the ethyl's CH3, confirming the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) group.\n- A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) attributed to the NH2 group, consistent with an amine.\n- Doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) suggest aromatic protons influenced by substituents. The higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) indicates proximity to an electron-withdrawing group (ester), while the lower shift (7.0 ppm) reflects proximity to an electron-donating group (amine).\n\nOption D, **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, fits this analysis. The structure includes an ethyl ester (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a 4-aminophenyl group, providing the required molecular formula and NMR/IR features. The other options either mismatch the molecular formula (e.g., C) or fail to account for the amine and ester groups properly (e.g., A, B).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how to interpret IR and NMR spectra. Let's start with the IR data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These peaks are usually associated with N-H stretching vibrations. Since there are two peaks here, maybe it's an amide (which has two N-H peaks) or something like an aniline (but maybe different). Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a typical carbonyl stretch. A carbonyl group (C=O) is present. \n\nLooking at the molecular formula, C9H11NO2. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so substituting:\n\n(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (18 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5 DoU. \n\nEach degree of unsaturation can be a double bond or a ring. So 5 DoU could mean, for example, a benzene ring (which is 4 DoU) plus a carbonyl (1 DoU) or other combinations. Since there's a carbonyl at 1720, maybe an ester or amide? Let's see.\n\nThe NMR data: \n\n1H NMR peaks:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a methyl group with a triplet, which is typical for a CH3 group attached to an oxygen (like ethyl group's CH3, since ethyl has CH2CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet from coupling with the CH2). The triplet suggests J coupling from the adjacent CH2.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. That might be an amino group (NH2) since amines often show up as broad signals due to hydrogen bonding. The 2H suggests maybe a primary amine (-NH2).\n\nWait, but the options have different structures. Let's look at the other peaks.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet, which would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH3 in an ethyl group. Because the ethyl group's CH2 would have a quartet (from the three neighboring protons on the CH3). Wait, but the first peak was 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H). Wait, that can't be right for an ethyl group. Wait, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3, so the CH2 would be a quartet (from the three H on the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet (from the single H on the CH2). Wait, no, actually, the CH2 next to the CH3 would have a triplet from the two H on the adjacent CH2? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. In an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 is connected to the CH3. The CH2's protons would have a triplet from the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (if it's part of a longer chain?), but in an ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3. Wait, the CH2CH3 group: the CH2 protons are next to the CH3, so each CH2 proton is coupled with the three H on the CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (split into 4 peaks because of three neighboring H), and the CH3 would be a triplet (split into three peaks from the two H on the CH2). Wait, that's right. So the CH2 would be a quartet (J = ~7 Hz), and the CH3 would be a triplet (J same as the CH2). So in the NMR data here, the 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 (triplet?), but the 4.5 is a quartet (the CH2). But wait, the CH2 in an ethyl group would be a quartet, but here the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is higher than usual. Hmm, maybe that's not an ethyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). Let's see. \n\nWait, an ethoxy group (O-CH2-CH3) would have the CH2 adjacent to oxygen. The CH2 would be a triplet (from the three H on the CH3), so the CH2 would be a triplet? Wait, the ethoxy group's CH2 would have the protons adjacent to the oxygen. The CH2 is connected to the oxygen, so each proton on the CH2 would couple with the three H on the CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (like in ethyl group). The CH3 would be a triplet. But in the NMR data here, the CH3 is a triplet (t, 3H) at 1.2, and the CH2 is a quartet at 4.5. That fits with an ethyl group. But then the CH2 is at 4.5 ppm? That's a bit high for a CH2 in an ethyl group, which is usually around 1-2 ppm. Wait, that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe it's part of an ester? Because in an ester, like ethyl acetate, the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is connected to an aromatic ring. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is from an OCH2CH3 where the CH2 is adjacent to an aromatic ring. For example, in a 4-ethoxybenzoate, the ethoxy group's CH2 might have a higher chemical shift than in an ethyl group. Or perhaps the ethyl group is part of an ester. Let me check the other peaks.\n\nThe other peaks are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, both as doublets. Those are aromatic protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each as a doublet. That might be due to coupling with a neighboring proton. Wait, in a meta or para substitution? Let's think: if the aromatic protons are in a meta position, their coupling might be different. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a di-substituted benzene where the protons are adjacent to substituents causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each have two protons, so that would be two sets of two protons each, making four aromatic protons in total. Since benzene has six, that suggests two substituents (each taking two positions?) or maybe ortho, meta, para arrangements.\n\nWait, let's look at the options. The options are:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nSo let's analyze each option's structure and see which fits the data.\n\nFirst, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check each option's formula.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would make the formula:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + CONH2 (CO is 2C, NH2 adds N and H2), plus ethoxy (C2H5O). Wait, let's count:\n\nBenzamide is C7H7NO (C6H5CONH2). Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would replace a hydrogen on the benzene with OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7 + 2 (from ethoxy) = C9, H: original benzamide has 7*2 (wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2: C6H5 is 5 H, plus CO (no H there), NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 5 + 2 (from NH2) + 2 (from CONH2's N? Wait, maybe I should just count properly. Let's see: \n\nBenzamide is C6H5-CO-NH2. So the formula is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as a substituent on the benzene would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since ethoxy is -OCH2CH3, which is -O-C2H5, so each ethoxy adds 2 C and 5 H, but replacing a H on the benzene. So original benzamide has 7 H on the benzene (since benzene is 6, but one is replaced by the CONH2 group?), wait maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me calculate the formula for option A:\n\n3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzene with ethoxy at 3-position and CONH2 at another position (since benzamide's amide is on the benzene). Wait, actually, benzamide is the amide where the amide group is directly attached to the benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would be:\n\nPhenyl group with ethoxy at 3 and the amide (CONH2) at, say, the 4 position? Or maybe the amide is on the benzene ring. Wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, which implies that the benzamide (the amide group) is on the benzene ring, and the ethoxy is at the 3-position. So the structure is:\n\nC6H4(OC2H5)(CONH2), with the groups in positions 3 and another (maybe 4 or 1?). The molecular formula would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (from CONH2: the CO is two carbons, but the CONH2 adds a carbonyl and an NH2. Wait, the amide is RCONH2. So the benzamide has the amide group as part of the benzene. So the formula would be C7H7NO (benzamide) plus the ethoxy adds 2 C and 5 H (since ethoxy is OCH2CH3). Wait, but substituting a hydrogen on the benzene with ethoxy adds 2 C (from the ethoxy's CH2CH3) plus the oxygen. So the total would be:\n\nOriginal benzamide: C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (which is -OCH2CH3) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since the ethoxy is replacing one H on the benzene). So the new formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's see: \n\nOriginal H in benzamide: 7H (from benzene minus one H for the amide group? Wait, benzamide structure: the amide is -CONH2 attached to the benzene. So the benzene has 5 H (since one position is taken by the -CONH2 group). The amide group's -CONH2 adds its own H's: the NH2 has 2 H. So total H in benzamide: 5 (from benzene) + 2 (from NH2) + any others? The CO group doesn't add H. So total H is 5 +2 =7? So yes, benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (which has 5 H in the ethoxy group (since ethoxy is OCH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. So total 2+3=5 H in the ethoxy group, but replacing one H on the benzene. So the total H would be (7-1) +5 (from ethoxy) = 7 +5 =12? Wait, original benzamide has 7 H, but when adding ethoxy, you subtract one H (the one replaced) and add 5 from the ethoxy's H. So 7-1=6 +5=11 H. So total H would be 11, so the formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. So option A is possible.\n\nNow option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) would mean the phenyl group is attached to the nitrogen of the formamide. The structure would be HCONH-4-ethoxyphenyl. The formula would be: \n\nFormamide is HCONH2 (CHNO). The phenyl group is C6H5, but with an ethoxy group at 4. So substituting a H on the phenyl with ethoxy. So the total formula would be:\n\nFormamide (CHNO) + phenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (C2H5O). Wait, let's count carbons:\n\nFormamide has 1 (from HCO) + the phenyl group (C6) plus ethoxy (C2). So total carbons: 1+6+2=9. Hydrogens: formamide has HCO has 1 H (the H in HCO), plus NH2 has 2 H. The phenyl group has 5 H (since one H is replaced by the ethoxy group). The ethoxy has 5 H (as before). So total H: 1 (from HCO) +2 (NH2) +5 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) = 1+2=3 +5=8 +5=13? Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3 where Ph is phenyl. The phenyl has 5 H (since one is replaced by the ethoxy). The ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 5 H). The formamide part: HCONH2 has the HCO (with one H), the NH2 (two H), and the H from the formamide's carbonyl? Wait, the formamide is HCONH2, so the formula is C H O N plus the phenyl and ethoxy. Let me compute each part:\n\nFormamide: HCONH2 \u2192 C (1), H (1+2=3), O (1), N (1). \n\nThen the phenyl group (C6H5), but with ethoxy attached at 4. The phenyl group contributes 6 C and 5 H (since one H is replaced by ethoxy). The ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (2 C, 5 H). \n\nSo total carbons: 1 (formamide) +6 (phenyl) +2 (ethoxy) = 9 C. \n\nHydrogens: formamide has 3 H from HCONH2 (H from HCO and NH2). Then phenyl gives 5 H, ethoxy gives 5 H. Total H: 3+5+5=13? But the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Wait, so that would be H13? But the compound given has H11. So that's a problem. Maybe my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide is attached to the phenyl through the nitrogen. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The phenyl group here is part of the amine's substituent. The phenyl has the ethoxy group, so the phenyl's H count would be 5 (since one H is replaced by the ethoxy). The formamide part (HCONH-) has the H on the HCO, but when connected to the phenyl, maybe the phenyl takes one H from the NH. Wait, perhaps the formula is C (formamide: 1) + phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) \u2192 9 C. Nitrogen is present once. Oxygen: formamide has one O, plus the ethoxy's O \u2192 total 2 O. So O2. The H count: formamide has HCONH2. The HCO has one H, the NH2 has two. But when attached to the phenyl, the NH is connected to the phenyl, so the NH's H might decrease. Wait, in N-alkyl formamides, the NH would still have two H? Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-R (where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl). So the NH is connected to R, so the NH would only have one H left. Because the original formamide is HCONH2. Replacing one H with R would leave one H on the NH. So the NH has one H. \n\nSo H from formamide: HCO has one H, NH has one H \u2192 total 2 from formamide. Then the phenyl (5 H), ethoxy (5 H). So total H: 2+5+5=12? Still, the given formula has 11 H. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's carbonyl is part of the benzene? Wait no, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide is separate. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula of option B would be C9H12NO2. Since the given compound is C9H11NO2, that's one H less, so B might not be correct. So perhaps B is out.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure here would be a phenyl group with an amino group at 4 and a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- (wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO? Wait, no. The propionate group is CH2CH2COO? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but that's actually CH3CH2COOH). So the propionate group would be CH2CH2COO- (but correct structure is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3? No, propionate is the ester of propionic acid. Wait, the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be the ester of phenylamine with propionic acid? Or perhaps the structure is benzene with an amino group and a propionate ester. Let me clarify the name. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester group (like -OOCCH2CH2CH3). Wait, but propionate as an ester would be OOCR where R is propyl. Alternatively, maybe it's the amide? Wait, the name says \"propionate\", which is an ester. So the structure is phenyl group with -NH2 at 4, and an ester group (like -COOCH2CH2CH3). So the formula would be:\n\nPhenyl (C6) + amino (NH2) + propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3). Let's count carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (from propyl: the propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3, which adds 3 carbons (the propyl group) plus the COO. Wait, the COO is two carbons. Wait, no. The propionate ester is R-OOCR where R is propyl (C3H7). So the ester group is -OOC-(propyl). Wait, actually, the propionate group would be -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO adds two carbons (the carbonyl and the oxygen? Wait, the structure is -CO-O-R where R is propyl. So the carbonyl is part of the ester. So the total carbons in the ester part: COOCH2CH2CH3 has 3 (from propyl) +2 (from the COO?) Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons in the ester group would be 3 (from the propyl) plus the two from the COO? Wait no, the COO is two oxygen atoms. The carbonyl is one C=O. The ester group is -OOCR, so the R is propyl (C3H7). So the ester contributes 3 carbons from propyl plus the COO (which is part of the ester's structure but doesn't add more carbons beyond the CO). Wait, perhaps better to count:\n\nThe propionate ester is -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO is part of the ester, so the carbons in the ester group: the COO has one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) plus the propyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), wait, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propyl is -CH2CH2CH3, so the ester would be COO-CH2CH2CH3. So the COO adds one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) plus the propyl's 3 carbons. So total 4 carbons from the ester group. \n\nThe benzene ring (6 C) plus the amino group (no carbons) plus the ester group (4 carbons) \u2192 total 10 C? Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9. Hmm, so that would not match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-calculate:\n\nThe propionate ester group is -COOCH2CH2CH3. The COO is part of the ester. The carbonyl is one C. The propyl (CH2CH2CH3) is three C's. So total 4 carbons from the ester. Benzene (6) + 4 (ester) + the amine (no C) \u2192 total 10 C. The given compound has 9 C. So that's a problem. Therefore, option C might not be correct. So perhaps C is out.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This is an ester. Benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So ethyl benzoate would be Ph-COOCH2CH3. But here it's 4-aminobenzoate, so the benzene ring has an amino group at 4 and the ester group (COOEt). So the structure is:\n\nPhenyl group with -NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt group (the benzoate part). \n\nCalculating the formula: \n\nPhenyl (C6) has two substituents: -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3. \n\nThe COOCH2CH3 adds 2 (from COO's carbonyl and the O) but in terms of carbons: the ester group is -COOCH2CH3. So the COO adds one C (the carbonyl) plus the ethyl group (CH2CH3). Wait, the ethyl group here is CH2CH3 (two carbons), so the ester group contributes 1 (from COO's C) + 2 (from ethyl) = 3 carbons. \n\nTotal carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (ester) + the amine (no carbons) \u2192 9 C. That matches the given C9. \n\nHydrogen count: Let's see. \n\nPhenyl ring with substituents: the benzene has 6 C. Each substituent takes a position. The -NH2 and -COOEt. The benzene has 6 - 2 substituents \u2192 4 H remaining on the ring (but need to account for the positions). \n\nThe ester group: COOCH2CH3. The COOCH2CH3 has the ethyl group: CH2CH3 (so 3 H on the CH2 (but wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. The COO has no H except on the ethyl. \n\nThe amino group (NH2) has two H. \n\nTotal H:\n\nBenzene ring: Let's see, the benzene ring has 6 C. The substituents are at two positions (4-aminobenzoate). Let's say the amino is at 4 and the ester at, say, 1? Or they could be in different positions. Regardless, each substituent takes a position, so the remaining 4 positions have H. So 4 H on the benzene ring. \n\nThen the ester's ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 5 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 \u2192 total 5). The COO group has no H except the ethyl's. \n\nThe amino group has 2 H. \n\nThe ester's carbonyl group (COO) doesn't add H. \n\nThe benzene ring's 4 H plus the ester's 5 H plus the NH2's 2 H \u2192 total H so far: 4+5+2 = 11. \n\nBut wait, the benzene ring's substituents may take some H. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the benzene ring with two substituents (at 4 and another position for the ester). Let's say the ester is at position 1 (for example). Then the remaining four positions (2,3,5,6) would have H. So 4 H on the ring. \n\nThe amino group at 4 takes that position's H. The ester group at 1 takes that H. So yes, 4 H on the ring. \n\nThen, the ester's ethyl group: the ethyl has 5 H (as above). The NH2 has 2 H. The rest?\n\nWait, the COO group's carbonyl is O=C-OEt, so no H there. \n\nSo total H: 4 (ring) + 5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11. \n\nSo the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So D is a candidate.\n\nNow let's go back to the NMR data. Let's analyze each option's NMR.\n\nStarting with option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate):\n\nStructure: benzene with -NH2 at 4 and -COOCH2CH3 (the ester group at another position, say 1). \n\nThe NMR peaks:\n\nLooking at the given NMR data:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H): This is the CH3 of the ethyl group (since t is triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2). The CH2CH3 in the ethyl group would have the CH3 as a triplet (J from the CH2). \n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): This could be the NH2 group. Since it's a broad singlet, that's typical for an amine (which can be broad due to hydrogen bonding). \n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): The CH2 in the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 would be next to the carbonyl (since it's part of the ester). In an ester like COOCH2CH3, the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The CH2's protons would be deshielded, so their chemical shift is higher than in a regular ethyl group (which is around 1-2 ppm). The CH2 here is at 4.5 ppm, which makes sense because being next to the carbonyl (which is electron-withdrawing) would increase the chemical shift. The quartet comes from coupling with the three H on the CH3 (so the CH2 has a quartet). \n\nThe aromatic peaks:\n\nThe benzene ring has substituents at 4 (NH2) and, say, 1 (the ester). So the ring would have two substituents. The positions of the aromatic protons depend on their positions relative to the substituents. Let's consider the ester group (COOEt) at position 1 and the NH2 at 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the NH2 (position 4) and the ester (position 1). Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure mentally. \n\nAlternatively, the ester is at position 1, and the NH2 at 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are meta to the NH2 and para to the ester. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to the NH2 (position 4). \n\nThe splitting of the aromatic protons can be a bit complex, but in the NMR given, there are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each with 2H. Let's see:\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the aromatic protons adjacent to the NH2 (position 4) would be at positions 3 and 5. These might be deshielded due to the NH2 group and could be around 7 ppm. The other protons (positions 2 and 6) are farther from the NH2 and closer to the ester group (position 1), so maybe they are at higher ppm (like 8 ppm). Each set might be a doublet due to coupling with neighboring protons. For example, the protons at positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to NH2) might be in a doublet due to coupling with each other, but since they are on the same ring, maybe they couple with the adjacent protons. Alternatively, the splitting could be due to the J coupling between neighboring protons on the ring. \n\nAlternatively, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 could represent two sets of two equivalent protons each. For instance, positions 2 and 6 (which are para to each other and meta to the NH2) might be one set, and positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to the NH2) another. \n\nThe chemical shifts would depend on the electron density. The NH2 is electron-donating, so adjacent protons (3 and 5) might be downfield shifted a bit, but the ester (which is electron-withdrawing via the carbonyl) at position 1 would cause the protons at 2 and 6 to be more deshielded, hence higher ppm (like 8 ppm). \n\nSo the doublets at 7.0 (maybe positions 3 and 5) and 8.0 (positions 2 and 6) each with 2H. That fits the given NMR. \n\nNow checking the other options. Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Its structure would have an ethoxy group at 3 and the amide (CONH2) at another position, maybe 4. Let's see the NMR.\n\nIn 3-ethoxybenzamide, the amide would be part of the benzene ring. The amide group (CONH2) would be attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is at 3. \n\nThe NMR of such a compound would have:\n\nThe amide's NH2: the amide's NH2 would be part of the CONH2 group. Wait, the amide is RCONH2, so the NH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The NH2 in an amide is usually less basic and can sometimes be a singlet, but in this case, maybe it's a singlet but not as broad as a primary amine. Wait, but in the given NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If this is an amide's NH2, would it be broad? Amide NH's are typically around 8 ppm and sharp, but the NH2 in an amide (like in benzamide) might have different behavior. Wait, benzamide has the amide's NH2. Let me recall: benzamide's amide proton (the NH2?) No, wait, benzamide is PhCONH2, so the NH2 is the amine part of the amide. The NH2 in an amide is actually a primary amine but attached to a carbonyl. The NH2 in amides typically have a chemical shift around 8 ppm or so and are sharp. However, if the NH2 is in an amide, maybe it's a singlet but not broad. Alternatively, maybe in the case of benzamide, the NH2 could be broad if it's involved in hydrogen bonding, but I think in NMR spectra, amide NH's are usually sharp. \n\nSo in option A's case, the NH2 would be the amide's, which might not show as a broad singlet. The given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) which would be more consistent with a primary amine (like an amino group, NH2) rather than an amide's NH2. So that would suggest that the compound has an NH2 group not part of an amide, but a separate amine group. \n\nLooking at the options, option D has an NH2 group (4-aminobenzoate) which is a primary amine, giving the broad singlet. Option B (formamide) has an NH attached to the formamide, but maybe not as broad. Option C's structure may not fit the formula. \n\nSo the NMR data for option D seems to fit better. Let's check the IR data again. The IR has strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In option D (ethyl benzoate), the ester has a carbonyl (from the ester group), which matches. The amide in option A also has a carbonyl (amide's C=O), so that's also possible. \n\nThe IR also has medium to strong N-H bands at 3420 and 3325. Amides typically have a single N-H peak around 3300 cm-1, but sometimes two peaks if the amide is in a different form. However, primary amines (like in option D) have two N-H bands due to the two NH protons. The presence of two peaks here (3420 and 3325) is typical for primary amines, which have two distinct N-H stretches. So that supports option D. \n\nAmides usually have a single band around 3300 cm-1 (since the NH2 is in the amide, which has different hydrogen bonding), but maybe in some cases there's splitting. However, the given data has two distinct peaks, which is more consistent with an amine (primary amine's two N-H groups) rather than an amide's single NH2 group in an amide (which might have a single peak). \n\nSo putting it all together: the molecular formula matches D. The NMR's ethyl group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet) fits the ester's ethyl. The aromatic peaks as doublets at 7 and 8 ppm fit the substituents. The NH2's broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is consistent with a primary amine. The IR's carbonyl at 1720 (ester) and two N-H peaks (amine) all align with option D. \n\nOption A would have an amide's carbonyl (also at ~1700 cm-1, maybe a bit different?), but the N-H would be a single band. Since the given IR has two N-H peaks, that's better for a primary amine (D). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound in question has a molecular formula of C9H11NO2, which corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 and two N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicative of a primary amine. The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of an ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 adjacent to the carbonyl in an ester), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH\u2082 group), and two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (aromatic protons). \n\n**Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)** fits all criteria:\n- The ethyl group's CH\u2083 (1.20 ppm) and CH\u2082 (4.5 ppm) match the NMR peaks.\n- The NH\u2082 group's broad singlet (4.0 ppm) aligns with the primary amine's IR peaks.\n- The aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) correspond to substituents on the benzene ring (4-aminobenzoate).\n- The carbonyl in the ester group (COOEt) accounts for the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 IR band.\n\nOther options either fail the molecular formula (B), exhibit incorrect proton counts (C), or lack the primary amine's IR features (A). \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how to interpret IR and NMR spectra. Let's start with the IR data. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These peaks are usually associated with N-H stretching vibrations. Since there are two peaks here, maybe it's an amide (which has two N-H peaks) or something like an aniline (but maybe different). Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a typical carbonyl stretch. A carbonyl group (C=O) is present. \n\nLooking at the molecular formula, C9H11NO2. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so substituting:\n\n(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (18 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5 DoU. \n\nEach degree of unsaturation can be a double bond or a ring. So 5 DoU could mean, for example, a benzene ring (which is 4 DoU) plus a carbonyl (1 DoU) or other combinations. Since there's a carbonyl at 1720, maybe an ester or amide? Let's see.\n\nThe NMR data: \n\n1H NMR peaks:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a methyl group with a triplet, which is typical for a CH3 group attached to an oxygen (like ethyl group's CH3, since ethyl has CH2CH3, the CH3 would be a triplet from coupling with the CH2). The triplet suggests J coupling from the adjacent CH2.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. That might be an amino group (NH2) since amines often show up as broad signals due to hydrogen bonding. The 2H suggests maybe a primary amine (-NH2).\n\nWait, but the options have different structures. Let's look at the other peaks.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet, which would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH3 in an ethyl group. Because the ethyl group's CH2 would have a quartet (from the three neighboring protons on the CH3). Wait, but the first peak was 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H). Wait, that can't be right for an ethyl group. Wait, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3, so the CH2 would be a quartet (from the three H on the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet (from the single H on the CH2). Wait, no, actually, the CH2 next to the CH3 would have a triplet from the two H on the adjacent CH2? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. In an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 is connected to the CH3. The CH2's protons would have a triplet from the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (if it's part of a longer chain?), but in an ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3. Wait, the CH2CH3 group: the CH2 protons are next to the CH3, so each CH2 proton is coupled with the three H on the CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (split into 4 peaks because of three neighboring H), and the CH3 would be a triplet (split into three peaks from the two H on the CH2). Wait, that's right. So the CH2 would be a quartet (J = ~7 Hz), and the CH3 would be a triplet (J same as the CH2). So in the NMR data here, the 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 (triplet?), but the 4.5 is a quartet (the CH2). But wait, the CH2 in an ethyl group would be a quartet, but here the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is higher than usual. Hmm, maybe that's not an ethyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). Let's see. \n\nWait, an ethoxy group (O-CH2-CH3) would have the CH2 adjacent to oxygen. The CH2 would be a triplet (from the three H on the CH3), so the CH2 would be a triplet? Wait, the ethoxy group's CH2 would have the protons adjacent to the oxygen. The CH2 is connected to the oxygen, so each proton on the CH2 would couple with the three H on the CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (like in ethyl group). The CH3 would be a triplet. But in the NMR data here, the CH3 is a triplet (t, 3H) at 1.2, and the CH2 is a quartet at 4.5. That fits with an ethyl group. But then the CH2 is at 4.5 ppm? That's a bit high for a CH2 in an ethyl group, which is usually around 1-2 ppm. Wait, that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe it's part of an ester? Because in an ester, like ethyl acetate, the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is connected to an aromatic ring. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is from an OCH2CH3 where the CH2 is adjacent to an aromatic ring. For example, in a 4-ethoxybenzoate, the ethoxy group's CH2 might have a higher chemical shift than in an ethyl group. Or perhaps the ethyl group is part of an ester. Let me check the other peaks.\n\nThe other peaks are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, both as doublets. Those are aromatic protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets suggest that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each as a doublet. That might be due to coupling with a neighboring proton. Wait, in a meta or para substitution? Let's think: if the aromatic protons are in a meta position, their coupling might be different. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a di-substituted benzene where the protons are adjacent to substituents causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each have two protons, so that would be two sets of two protons each, making four aromatic protons in total. Since benzene has six, that suggests two substituents (each taking two positions?) or maybe ortho, meta, para arrangements.\n\nWait, let's look at the options. The options are:\n\nA) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n\nB) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nSo let's analyze each option's structure and see which fits the data.\n\nFirst, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check each option's formula.\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would make the formula:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + CONH2 (CO is 2C, NH2 adds N and H2), plus ethoxy (C2H5O). Wait, let's count:\n\nBenzamide is C7H7NO (C6H5CONH2). Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would replace a hydrogen on the benzene with OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7 + 2 (from ethoxy) = C9, H: original benzamide has 7*2 (wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2: C6H5 is 5 H, plus CO (no H there), NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 5 + 2 (from NH2) + 2 (from CONH2's N? Wait, maybe I should just count properly. Let's see: \n\nBenzamide is C6H5-CO-NH2. So the formula is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as a substituent on the benzene would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since ethoxy is -OCH2CH3, which is -O-C2H5, so each ethoxy adds 2 C and 5 H, but replacing a H on the benzene. So original benzamide has 7 H on the benzene (since benzene is 6, but one is replaced by the CONH2 group?), wait maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me calculate the formula for option A:\n\n3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzene with ethoxy at 3-position and CONH2 at another position (since benzamide's amide is on the benzene). Wait, actually, benzamide is the amide where the amide group is directly attached to the benzene. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would be:\n\nPhenyl group with ethoxy at 3 and the amide (CONH2) at, say, the 4 position? Or maybe the amide is on the benzene ring. Wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, which implies that the benzamide (the amide group) is on the benzene ring, and the ethoxy is at the 3-position. So the structure is:\n\nC6H4(OC2H5)(CONH2), with the groups in positions 3 and another (maybe 4 or 1?). The molecular formula would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (from CONH2: the CO is two carbons, but the CONH2 adds a carbonyl and an NH2. Wait, the amide is RCONH2. So the benzamide has the amide group as part of the benzene. So the formula would be C7H7NO (benzamide) plus the ethoxy adds 2 C and 5 H (since ethoxy is OCH2CH3). Wait, but substituting a hydrogen on the benzene with ethoxy adds 2 C (from the ethoxy's CH2CH3) plus the oxygen. So the total would be:\n\nOriginal benzamide: C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (which is -OCH2CH3) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since the ethoxy is replacing one H on the benzene). So the new formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's see: \n\nOriginal H in benzamide: 7H (from benzene minus one H for the amide group? Wait, benzamide structure: the amide is -CONH2 attached to the benzene. So the benzene has 5 H (since one position is taken by the -CONH2 group). The amide group's -CONH2 adds its own H's: the NH2 has 2 H. So total H in benzamide: 5 (from benzene) + 2 (from NH2) + any others? The CO group doesn't add H. So total H is 5 +2 =7? So yes, benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (which has 5 H in the ethoxy group (since ethoxy is OCH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. So total 2+3=5 H in the ethoxy group, but replacing one H on the benzene. So the total H would be (7-1) +5 (from ethoxy) = 7 +5 =12? Wait, original benzamide has 7 H, but when adding ethoxy, you subtract one H (the one replaced) and add 5 from the ethoxy's H. So 7-1=6 +5=11 H. So total H would be 11, so the formula would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. So option A is possible.\n\nNow option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) would mean the phenyl group is attached to the nitrogen of the formamide. The structure would be HCONH-4-ethoxyphenyl. The formula would be: \n\nFormamide is HCONH2 (CHNO). The phenyl group is C6H5, but with an ethoxy group at 4. So substituting a H on the phenyl with ethoxy. So the total formula would be:\n\nFormamide (CHNO) + phenyl (C6H5) plus ethoxy (C2H5O). Wait, let's count carbons:\n\nFormamide has 1 (from HCO) + the phenyl group (C6) plus ethoxy (C2). So total carbons: 1+6+2=9. Hydrogens: formamide has HCO has 1 H (the H in HCO), plus NH2 has 2 H. The phenyl group has 5 H (since one H is replaced by the ethoxy group). The ethoxy has 5 H (as before). So total H: 1 (from HCO) +2 (NH2) +5 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) = 1+2=3 +5=8 +5=13? Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3 where Ph is phenyl. The phenyl has 5 H (since one is replaced by the ethoxy). The ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 5 H). The formamide part: HCONH2 has the HCO (with one H), the NH2 (two H), and the H from the formamide's carbonyl? Wait, the formamide is HCONH2, so the formula is C H O N plus the phenyl and ethoxy. Let me compute each part:\n\nFormamide: HCONH2 \u2192 C (1), H (1+2=3), O (1), N (1). \n\nThen the phenyl group (C6H5), but with ethoxy attached at 4. The phenyl group contributes 6 C and 5 H (since one H is replaced by ethoxy). The ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (2 C, 5 H). \n\nSo total carbons: 1 (formamide) +6 (phenyl) +2 (ethoxy) = 9 C. \n\nHydrogens: formamide has 3 H from HCONH2 (H from HCO and NH2). Then phenyl gives 5 H, ethoxy gives 5 H. Total H: 3+5+5=13? But the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Wait, so that would be H13? But the compound given has H11. So that's a problem. Maybe my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide is attached to the phenyl through the nitrogen. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The phenyl group here is part of the amine's substituent. The phenyl has the ethoxy group, so the phenyl's H count would be 5 (since one H is replaced by the ethoxy). The formamide part (HCONH-) has the H on the HCO, but when connected to the phenyl, maybe the phenyl takes one H from the NH. Wait, perhaps the formula is C (formamide: 1) + phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) \u2192 9 C. Nitrogen is present once. Oxygen: formamide has one O, plus the ethoxy's O \u2192 total 2 O. So O2. The H count: formamide has HCONH2. The HCO has one H, the NH2 has two. But when attached to the phenyl, the NH is connected to the phenyl, so the NH's H might decrease. Wait, in N-alkyl formamides, the NH would still have two H? Wait, no. The formamide is HCONH-R (where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl). So the NH is connected to R, so the NH would only have one H left. Because the original formamide is HCONH2. Replacing one H with R would leave one H on the NH. So the NH has one H. \n\nSo H from formamide: HCO has one H, NH has one H \u2192 total 2 from formamide. Then the phenyl (5 H), ethoxy (5 H). So total H: 2+5+5=12? Still, the given formula has 11 H. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's carbonyl is part of the benzene? Wait no, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide is separate. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula of option B would be C9H12NO2. Since the given compound is C9H11NO2, that's one H less, so B might not be correct. So perhaps B is out.\n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure here would be a phenyl group with an amino group at 4 and a propionate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- (wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO? No, propionate is CH2CH2COO? Wait, no. The propionate group is CH2CH2COO? Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH (but that's actually CH3CH2COOH). So the propionate group would be CH2CH2COO- (but correct structure is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3? No, propionate is the ester of propionic acid. Wait, the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be the ester of phenylamine with propionic acid? Or perhaps the structure is benzene with an amino group and a propionate ester. Let me clarify the name. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester group (like -OOCCH2CH2CH3). Wait, but propionate as an ester would be OOCR where R is propyl. Alternatively, maybe it's the amide? Wait, the name says \"propionate\", which is an ester. So the structure is phenyl group with -NH2 at 4, and an ester group (like -COOCH2CH2CH3). So the formula would be:\n\nPhenyl (C6) + amino (NH2) + propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3). Let's count carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (from propyl: the propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3, which adds 3 carbons (the propyl group) plus the COO. Wait, the COO is two carbons. Wait, no. The propionate ester is R-OOCR where R is propyl (C3H7). So the ester group is -OOC-(propyl). Wait, actually, the propionate group would be -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO adds two carbons (the carbonyl and the oxygen? Wait, the structure is -CO-O-R where R is propyl. So the carbonyl is part of the ester. So the total carbons in the ester part: COOCH2CH2CH3 has 3 (from propyl) +2 (from the COO?) Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons in the ester group would be 3 (from the propyl) plus the two from the COO? Wait no, the COO is two oxygen atoms. The carbonyl is one C=O. The ester group is -OOCR, so the R is propyl (C3H7). So the ester contributes 3 carbons from propyl plus the COO (which is part of the ester's structure but doesn't add more carbons beyond the CO). Wait, perhaps better to count:\n\nThe propionate ester is -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the COO is part of the ester, so the carbons in the ester group: the COO has one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) plus the propyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), wait, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, propyl is -CH2CH2CH3, so the ester would be COO-CH2CH2CH3. So the COO adds one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) plus the propyl's 3 carbons. So total 4 carbons from the ester group. \n\nThe benzene ring (6 C) plus the amino group (no carbons) plus the ester group (4 carbons) \u2192 total 10 C? Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9. Hmm, so that would not match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-calculate:\n\nThe propionate ester group is -COOCH2CH2CH3. The COO is part of the ester. The carbonyl is one C. The propyl (CH2CH2CH3) is three C's. So total 4 carbons from the ester. Benzene (6) + 4 (ester) + the amine (no C) \u2192 total 10 C. The given compound has 9 C. So that's a problem. Therefore, option C might not be correct. So perhaps C is out.\n\nOption D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. This is an ester. Benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So ethyl benzoate would be Ph-COOCH2CH3. But here it's 4-aminobenzoate, so the benzene ring has an amino group at 4 and the ester group (COOEt). So the structure is:\n\nPhenyl group with -NH2 at position 4 and a COOEt group (the benzoate part). \n\nCalculating the formula: \n\nPhenyl (C6) has two substituents: -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3. \n\nThe COOCH2CH3 adds 2 (from COO's carbonyl and the O) but in terms of carbons: the ester group is -COOCH2CH3. So the COO adds one C (the carbonyl) plus the ethyl group (CH2CH3). Wait, the ethyl group here is CH2CH3 (two carbons), so the ester group contributes 1 (from COO's C) + 2 (from ethyl) = 3 carbons. \n\nTotal carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (ester) + the amine (no carbons) \u2192 9 C. That matches the given C9. \n\nHydrogen count: Let's see. \n\nPhenyl ring with substituents: the benzene has 6 C. Each substituent takes a position. The -NH2 and -COOEt. The benzene has 6 - 2 substituents \u2192 4 H remaining on the ring (but need to account for the positions). \n\nThe ester group: COOCH2CH3. The COOCH2CH3 has the ethyl group: CH2CH3 (so 3 H on the CH2 (but wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. The COO has no H except on the ethyl. \n\nThe amino group (NH2) has two H. \n\nTotal H:\n\nBenzene ring: Let's see, the benzene ring has 6 C. The substituents are at two positions (4-aminobenzoate). Let's say the amino is at 4 and the ester at, say, 1? Or they could be in different positions. Regardless, each substituent takes a position, so the remaining 4 positions have H. So 4 H on the benzene ring. \n\nThen the ester's ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 5 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 \u2192 total 5). The COO group has no H except the ethyl's. \n\nThe amino group has 2 H. \n\nThe ester's carbonyl group (COO) doesn't add H. \n\nThe benzene ring's 4 H plus the ester's 5 H plus the NH2's 2 H \u2192 total H so far: 4+5+2 = 11. \n\nBut wait, the benzene ring's substituents may take some H. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the benzene ring with two substituents (at 4 and another position for the ester). Let's say the ester is at position 1 (for example). Then the remaining four positions (2,3,5,6) would have H. So 4 H on the ring. \n\nThe amino group at 4 takes that position's H. The ester group at 1 takes that H. So yes, 4 H on the ring. \n\nThen, the ester's ethyl group: the ethyl has 5 H (as above). The NH2 has 2 H. The rest?\n\nWait, the COO group's carbonyl is O=C-OEt, so no H there. \n\nSo total H: 4 (ring) + 5 (ethyl) + 2 (NH2) = 11. \n\nSo the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So D is a candidate.\n\nNow let's go back to the NMR data. Let's analyze each option's NMR.\n\nStarting with option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate):\n\nStructure: benzene with -NH2 at 4 and -COOCH2CH3 (the ester group at another position, say 1). \n\nThe NMR peaks:\n\nLooking at the given NMR data:\n\n1.20 (t, 3H): This is the CH3 of the ethyl group (since t is triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2). The CH2CH3 in the ethyl group would have the CH3 as a triplet (J from the CH2). \n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): This could be the NH2 group. Since it's a broad singlet, that's typical for an amine (which can be broad due to hydrogen bonding). \n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): The CH2 in the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group's CH2 would be next to the carbonyl (since it's part of the ester). In an ester like COOCH2CH3, the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The CH2's protons would be deshielded, so their chemical shift is higher than in a regular ethyl group (which is around 1-2 ppm). The CH2 here is at 4.5 ppm, which makes sense because being next to the carbonyl (which is electron-withdrawing) would increase the chemical shift. The quartet comes from coupling with the three H on the CH3 (so the CH2 has a quartet). \n\nThe aromatic peaks:\n\nThe benzene ring has substituents at 4 (NH2) and, say, 1 (the ester). So the ring would have two substituents. The positions of the aromatic protons depend on their positions relative to the substituents. Let's consider the ester group (COOEt) at position 1 and the NH2 at 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the NH2 (position 4) and the ester (position 1). Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure mentally. \n\nAlternatively, the ester is at position 1, and the NH2 at 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are meta to the NH2 and para to the ester. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to the NH2 (position 4). \n\nThe splitting of the aromatic protons can be a bit complex, but in the NMR given, there are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each with 2H. Let's see:\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the aromatic protons adjacent to the NH2 (position 4) would be at positions 3 and 5. These might be deshielded due to the NH2 group and could be around 7 ppm. The other protons (positions 2 and 6) are farther from the NH2 and closer to the ester group (position 1), so maybe they are at higher ppm (like 8 ppm). Each set might be a doublet due to coupling with neighboring protons. For example, the protons at positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to NH2) might be in a doublet due to coupling with each other, but since they are on the same ring, maybe they couple with the adjacent protons. Alternatively, the splitting could be due to the J coupling between neighboring protons on the ring. \n\nAlternatively, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 could represent two sets of two equivalent protons each. For instance, positions 2 and 6 (which are para to each other and meta to the NH2) might be one set, and positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to the NH2) another. \n\nThe chemical shifts would depend on the electron density. The NH2 is electron-donating, so adjacent protons (3 and 5) might be downfield shifted a bit, but the ester (which is electron-withdrawing via the carbonyl) at position 1 would cause the protons at 2 and 6 to be more deshielded, hence higher ppm (like 8 ppm). \n\nSo the doublets at 7.0 (maybe positions 3 and 5) and 8.0 (positions 2 and 6) each with 2H. That fits the given NMR. \n\nNow checking the other options. Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Its structure would have an ethoxy group at 3 and the amide (CONH2) at another position, maybe 4. Let's see the NMR.\n\nIn 3-ethoxybenzamide, the amide would be part of the benzene ring. The amide group (CONH2) would be attached to the benzene. The ethoxy is at 3. \n\nThe NMR of such a compound would have:\n\nThe amide's NH2: the amide's NH2 would be part of the CONH2 group. Wait, the amide is RCONH2, so the NH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The NH2 in an amide is usually less basic and can sometimes be a singlet, but in this case, maybe it's a singlet but not as broad as a primary amine. Wait, but in the given NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If this is an amide's NH2, would it be broad? Amide NH's are typically around 8 ppm and sharp, but the NH2 in an amide (like in benzamide) might have different behavior. Wait, benzamide has the amide's NH2. Let me recall: benzamide's amide proton (the NH2?) No, wait, benzamide is PhCONH2, so the NH2 is the amine part of the amide. The NH2 in an amide is actually a primary amine but attached to a carbonyl. The NH2 in amides typically have a chemical shift around 8 ppm or so and are sharp. However, if the NH2 is in an amide, maybe it's a singlet but not broad. Alternatively, maybe in the case of benzamide, the NH2 could be broad if it's involved in hydrogen bonding, but I think in NMR spectra, amide NH's are usually sharp. \n\nSo in option A's case, the NH2 would be the amide's, which might not show as a broad singlet. The given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) which would be more consistent with a primary amine (like an amino group, NH2) rather than an amide's NH2. So that would suggest that the compound has an NH2 group not part of an amide, but a separate amine group. \n\nLooking at the options, option D has an NH2 group (4-aminobenzoate) which is a primary amine, giving the broad singlet. Option B (formamide) has an NH attached to the formamide, but maybe not as broad. Option C's structure may not fit the formula. \n\nSo the NMR data for option D seems to fit better. Let's check the IR data again. The IR has strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In option D (ethyl benzoate), the ester has a carbonyl (from the ester group), which matches. The amide in option A also has a carbonyl (amide's C=O), so that's also possible. \n\nThe IR also has medium to strong N-H bands at 3420 and 3325. Amides typically have a single N-H peak around 3300 cm-1, but sometimes two peaks if the amide is in a different form. However, primary amines (like in option D) have two N-H bands due to the two NH protons. The presence of two peaks here (3420 and 3325) is typical for primary amines, which have two distinct N-H stretches. So that supports option D. \n\nAmides usually have a single band around 3300 cm-1 (since the NH2 is in the amide, which has different hydrogen bonding), but maybe in some cases there's splitting. However, the given data has two distinct peaks, which is more consistent with an amine (primary amine's two N-H groups) rather than an amide's single NH2 group in an amide (which might have a single peak). \n\nSo putting it all together: the molecular formula matches D. The NMR's ethyl group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet) fits the ester's ethyl. The aromatic peaks as doublets at 7 and 8 ppm fit the substituents. The NH2's broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is consistent with a primary amine. The IR's carbonyl at 1720 (ester) and two N-H peaks (amine) all align with option D. \n\nOption A would have an amide's carbonyl (also at ~1700 cm-1, maybe a bit different?), but the N-H would be a single band. Since the given IR has two N-H peaks, that's better for a primary amine (D). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nThe compound in question has a molecular formula of C9H11NO2, which corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 and two N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicative of a primary amine. The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of an ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 adjacent to the carbonyl in an ester), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH\u2082 group), and two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (aromatic protons). \n\n**Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)** fits all criteria:\n- The ethyl group's CH\u2083 (1.20 ppm) and CH\u2082 (4.5 ppm) match the NMR peaks.\n- The NH\u2082 group's broad singlet (4.0 ppm) aligns with the primary amine's IR peaks.\n- The aromatic doublets (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) correspond to substituents on the benzene ring (4-aminobenzoate).\n- The carbonyl in the ester group (COOEt) accounts for the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 IR band.\n\nOther options either fail the molecular formula (B), exhibit incorrect proton counts (C), or lack the primary amine's IR features (A). \n\nAnswer: D",
