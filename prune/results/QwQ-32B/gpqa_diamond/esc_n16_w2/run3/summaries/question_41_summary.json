      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, let's see. The question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the lab. And they want the speed of light relative to the lab observer. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is usually c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But here, the glass is moving. Wait, how does that affect the speed? Because normally, the medium is stationary. But if the medium is moving, does that add to the speed of the light?\n\nWait, in classical physics, velocities just add up. Like, if you're on a train moving forward at v, and you throw a ball forward at u, someone on the ground sees the ball moving at v + u. But light is different because of relativity. Oh right, but the question says to take c=1, maybe assuming that the speed of light in vacuum is 1. Wait, but the problem is about the speed in glass. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is in a frame where the glass is moving. The observer is in the lab, so the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light is propagating. Wait, but the glass's movement would affect the light's speed relative to the lab frame?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the speed of light in the moving medium. There's a concept here. I recall that in the rest frame of the medium, the light's speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is the velocity of the medium plus the speed in the medium's rest frame. But since the medium is moving at velocity v, then the total speed would be v + (c/n). But wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Oh, but the problem might be assuming a classical approach here? Because the options are fractions that could come from classical addition.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.\" Maybe they want a classical answer here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is v_light = c/n. Now, the medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be the velocity of the medium plus the light's velocity relative to the medium. But since they are in the same direction, it would be v + (c/n). But since c is given as 1, that would be v + (1/n). But none of the options have that. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the question is considering that the light's speed in the moving medium is adjusted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the moving medium is (c + v)/n? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Another approach: The refractive index is n = c/v_medium, where v_medium is the speed of light in the medium when it's stationary. So normally, v_medium = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that change?\n\nWait, perhaps in the lab frame, the speed of light is the velocity of the medium plus the speed in the medium's frame. So that would be v + (c/n). But since c is 1, that would be v + 1/n. But let's see the options. The options have terms like (1 + n*v) over something. Let's see option A is (1 +n*v)/(n +v). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is (c + v)/(n) or (n c + v)/n. Wait, if the medium is moving at v, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (c/n) + v? Because the medium's movement adds to the light's speed? That would give (1/n + v). But how does that relate to the options?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a classical approach where velocities add, but in that case, the options might have to be rearranged. Let me check the options again. Let me see the options again:\n\nA) (1 +n*v)/(n +v)\n\nB) 1\n\nC) (1 +n*v)/(n -v)\n\nD) (1 -n*v)/(n +v)\n\nHmm. Let me see, if I suppose that the speed of light in the moving medium is (v + (c/n)), then substituting c=1, that would be v + 1/n. But to get to the options, perhaps there's a different approach. Alternatively, maybe it's a question of relativistic velocity addition?\n\nWait, in relativity, when you have a medium moving, the speed of light in the medium isn't simply additive. The relativistic formula for the speed of light in a moving medium might be more complex. Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic? The options don't look like relativistic velocity additions, since those usually have denominators with sqrt terms or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the concept of the aether, but that's probably not. Alternatively, think of the glass as a medium moving with velocity v, so the speed of light in the lab frame would be the velocity of the medium plus the speed relative to the medium. But in that case, the speed would be v + (c/n). But with c=1, that would be v + 1/n. Let me see if that can be rewritten into any of the options. Let's see:\n\nSuppose v + 1/n = (n v +1)/n. Which is (1 +n v)/n. But none of the options have that. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Hmm. Not the same. So that approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is given by (c + v)/(n). Wait, that would be (1 +v)/n. Which would be (1 +v)/n. But that also doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative motion of the medium and the light. Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light in the glass's rest frame. But again, that would be v + (1/n). But perhaps the problem is considering that the light is moving through the glass, so the glass's velocity affects the effective speed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is (c + v)/n, but that would be (1 +v)/n, which is different from the options. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is calculated using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Let me recall the relativistic velocity addition formula. Suppose in the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at v_medium = c/n. Then, the medium is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The lab observer would see the light's speed as (v + v_medium)/(1 + (v v_medium)/c\u00b2). Let's plug in the numbers. Let me set c=1 here.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nv_medium = 1/n (since c is 1). So the numerator is v + (1/n). The denominator is 1 + (v*(1/n))/1\u00b2 = 1 + v/n.\n\nThus, the total speed would be [v + 1/n] / [1 + v/n].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate fractions:\n\nNumerator: n*v + 1\n\nDenominator: n + v\n\nSo the total is (1 + n*v)/(n + v). Which is option A. Wait, so that would be the relativistic approach. But the question says \"Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.\" Maybe they expect the relativistic velocity addition formula here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not be relativistic. Wait, but in that case, the answer would be v + (1/n), but that's not an option. Hmm. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So, the glass's velocity is in the same direction as the light's direction in the medium's frame. So using the relativistic formula gives option A. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a classical approach where velocities add, but then the answer would be v + (1/n). But that's not among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is using the relativistic velocity addition, leading to option A. Let me see the options again. Option A is (1 +n*v)/(n +v). Yes, exactly what I got.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me check the velocity addition formula again. Suppose the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the medium's frame, the light is moving at v_medium = c/n. Then, the lab frame would compute the speed as (v + v_medium)/(1 + v v_medium/c\u00b2). Since the medium is moving in the same direction as the light's direction in its own frame, that's correct. So the calculation is right.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A. Let me check the options again. Yes, A is (1 +n*v)/(n +v). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: in some contexts, the speed of light in a moving medium might be considered differently. For example, some sources say that the speed is c/n plus the medium velocity, but in a non-relativistic way, but that would give v + 1/n. However, the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is expecting the relativistic approach here. Since that gives option A, that's the way to go.\n\nAnother angle: If the glass is moving, the observer in the lab sees the light moving at speed (v + (c/n)) / (1 + (v/(c n)) ), since relativistic addition. Since c is 1 here, that's exactly the same as before. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is tricking me because the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the question says \"the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory.\" So the glass's movement is in the same direction as the beam's direction. So the beam is moving in the direction of the glass's velocity, so when adding velocities, it's correct. So the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the lab when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The speed of light in a medium like glass is usually given by v_medium = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary, right? Now, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. \n\nHmm, how does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I remember that when the medium is moving, the speed of light relative to an observer outside the medium (like the laboratory frame) might be different. But I'm a bit confused here because I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, maybe that's not entirely accurate. Let me think again.\n\nOh right! The speed of light in the medium's rest frame is c/n. But if the medium is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be different. The question is, how do we combine the motion of the medium with the light's speed in the medium?\n\nI think this is similar to how velocities add in different frames. But since we're dealing with light, which always travels at c in a vacuum, but in a medium it's slower. However, when the medium is moving, maybe we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity? Wait, but the medium's motion complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me recall. In the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed of the medium plus the speed of light in the medium's frame. But that would be v + (c/n). But wait, that might not account for relativistic effects properly. Since velocities can't just add linearly in relativity. Hmm, but since the velocity v is probably non-relativistic here (since it's a lab setup, maybe v is much less than c?), but the problem states to take c=1, so maybe we can ignore relativistic effects? Or perhaps the question is assuming classical velocity addition?\n\nWait, the problem says \"constant velocity v\" but doesn't specify if it's relativistic. Since the options are given in terms of n and v, maybe we can treat it classically. Let's see.\n\nIf the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer, then the light in the medium's frame is moving at c/n. So from the lab frame, the speed of the light should be the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of the light in the medium's frame? But direction is important here. Since both the medium and the light are moving in the same direction as the observer. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again: \"glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory.\" So the glass and the beam are moving in the same direction, which is towards the observer. Wait, the observer is in the lab. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is also moving in that same direction. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction (so away from the observer? Wait, maybe I need to visualize this better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So imagine the light is going to the right, and the glass is also moving to the right. The observer is in the lab, which is the stationary frame. The glass is moving to the right, so in the lab frame, the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. \n\nHmm, so in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n to the right. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v to the right, so the light's velocity relative to the lab would be v + (c/n). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. But then why are the options different?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another consideration here. The refractive index might depend on the motion of the medium? Or perhaps the formula is different. Wait, I recall that in some contexts, when the medium is moving, the effective speed of light in the lab frame can be given by (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n^2 c))? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is given by (c/n + v) divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a non-relativistic approximation. Let me think again. Let's denote the speed of light in the glass's rest frame as v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light + v? That would be (c/n) + v. But let's check the options. Let's plug in c=1 (since the problem says to take c=1), so that would be (1/n) + v. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's see the options:\n\nA) (1 +n*v)/(n +v )\n\nB) 1\n\nC) (1 +n*v)/(n -v )\n\nD) (1 -n*v)/(n +v )\n\nHmm. So (1/n + v) would be (1 + n v)/n. But that's not matching any of the options except perhaps A or C. Wait, (1 +n v)/n would be 1/n + v. But the options have denominators like n + v, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about how the speed of light in moving medium is calculated. \n\nIn the rest frame of the medium, the speed is c/n. To find the speed in the lab frame (where the medium is moving at velocity v), we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but the medium is moving at v, so perhaps the velocity of the light in the lab frame is (v_medium + v)/(1 + (v v_medium)/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, let's see. The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity in the moving frame (medium's frame here), and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab. \n\nWait, but in this case, the light's speed in the medium's frame is u = c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v (in the same direction as the light) relative to the lab. So applying the formula, the lab's observed speed would be ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 + (v / n c) * v / c\u00b2? Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator again.\n\nWait, the denominator is 1 + (u v)/c\u00b2. Since u is c/n, so ( (c/n)*v ) / c\u00b2 = v/(n c). So the denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c). \n\nTherefore, the total is [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:\n\nNumerator: (c/n + v)*n c = (c^2 + v n c)\n\nDenominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v\n\nSo the speed is (c\u00b2 + v n c) / (n c + v )\n\nBut since c is given as 1, substitute c=1:\n\n(1 + v n ) / (n + v )\n\nSo that would be option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again. \n\nThe velocity addition formula gives:\n\nu' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, u is the speed in the moving frame (the glass's rest frame, which is moving at v relative to lab). So u = c/n. Then plug into the formula:\n\nu' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify denominator's term: (c/n * v)/c\u00b2 = v/(n c)\n\nSo denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c). \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n c to make it easier:\n\nNumerator: (c/n + v) * n c = (c^2 + v n c )\n\nDenominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v \n\nSo the result is (c\u00b2 + v n c) / (n c + v )\n\nSet c=1 (as per problem's instruction, since c=1 here), so numerator is 1 + v n, denominator n + v. So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is moving through the glass at (c/n) relative to the glass. Since both are moving in the same direction, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v + (c/n). But that's a classical addition, which would be different. But according to the velocity addition formula, it's different. \n\nWait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the result is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me see what that would be in the limit where v is small. Let's suppose v << c (so v is much smaller than 1). Then (1 + n v)/(n +v ) \u2248 (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n )) \u2248 (1/(n) ) * (1 + n v) / (1 + v/n ) \u2248 (1/n)(1 + n v) (1 - v/n ) \u2248 (1/n)(1 + n v - v/n - v\u00b2) \u2248 1/n + v - v/(n\u00b2) - ... So to first order, that's approximately (1/n + v). Which matches the classical addition. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if the options have another possible answer. Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v). But in that case, if the glass was moving opposite to the light, maybe. Wait, but in the problem statement, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me confirm the velocity addition formula's direction. Suppose the medium is moving in the positive direction (same as the light). So in the lab frame, the light's speed is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2 ), where u is the speed in the medium's frame. Since both are in the same direction, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the medium were moving opposite to the light's direction in the medium's frame, then u would be negative. But in this case, the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes in such problems, the refractive index is considered to be in the rest frame of the medium, so when the medium moves, the effective speed is different. But according to the velocity addition formula, the result is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), so A. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the lab when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The speed of light in a medium like glass is usually given by v_medium = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary, right? Now, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. \n\nHmm, how does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I remember that when the medium is moving, the speed of light relative to an observer outside the medium (like the laboratory frame) might be different. But I'm a bit confused here because I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, maybe that's not entirely accurate. Let me think again.\n\nOh right! The speed of light in the medium's rest frame is c/n. But if the medium is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be different. The question is, how do we combine the motion of the medium with the light's speed in the medium?\n\nI think this is similar to how velocities add in different frames. But since we're dealing with light, which always travels at c in a vacuum, but in a medium it's slower. However, when the medium is moving, maybe we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity? Wait, but the medium's motion complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me recall. In the lab frame, the light's speed would be the speed of the medium plus the speed of light in the medium's frame. But that would be v + (c/n). But wait, that might not account for relativistic effects properly. Since velocities can't just add linearly in relativity. Hmm, but since the velocity v is probably non-relativistic here (since it's a lab setup, maybe v is much less than c?), but the problem states to take c=1, so maybe we can ignore relativistic effects? Or perhaps the question is assuming classical velocity addition?\n\nWait, the problem says \"constant velocity v\" but doesn't specify if it's relativistic. Since the options are given in terms of n and v, maybe we can treat it classically. Let's see.\n\nIf the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer, then the light in the medium's frame is moving at c/n. So from the lab frame, the speed of the light should be the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of the light in the medium's frame? But direction is important here. Since both the medium and the light are moving in the same direction as the observer. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again: \"glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory.\" So the glass and the beam are moving in the same direction, which is towards the observer. Wait, the observer is in the lab. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is also moving in that same direction. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards them, and the light is moving in the same direction (so away from the observer? Wait, maybe I need to visualize this better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So imagine the light is going to the right, and the glass is also moving to the right. The observer is in the lab, which is the stationary frame. The glass is moving to the right, so in the lab frame, the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. \n\nHmm, so in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n to the right. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v to the right, so the light's velocity relative to the lab would be v + (c/n). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. But then why are the options different?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another consideration here. The refractive index might depend on the motion of the medium? Or perhaps the formula is different. Wait, I recall that in some contexts, when the medium is moving, the effective speed of light in the lab frame can be given by (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/(n^2 c))? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is given by (c/n + v) divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a non-relativistic approximation. Let me think again. Let's denote the speed of light in the glass's rest frame as v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light + v? That would be (c/n) + v. But let's check the options. Let's plug in c=1 (since the problem says to take c=1), so that would be (1/n) + v. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's see the options:\n\nA) (1 +n*v)/(n +v )\n\nB) 1\n\nC) (1 +n*v)/(n -v )\n\nD) (1 -n*v)/(n +v )\n\nHmm. So (1/n + v) would be (1 + n v)/n. But that's not matching any of the options except perhaps A or C. Wait, (1 +n v)/n would be 1/n + v. But the options have denominators like n + v, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about how the speed of light in moving medium is calculated. \n\nIn the rest frame of the medium, the speed is c/n. To find the speed in the lab frame (where the medium is moving at velocity v), we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but the medium is moving at v, so perhaps the velocity of the light in the lab frame is (v_medium + v)/(1 + (v v_medium)/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, let's see. The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity in the moving frame (medium's frame here), and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab. \n\nWait, but in this case, the light's speed in the medium's frame is u = c/n. The medium is moving at velocity v (in the same direction as the light) relative to the lab. So applying the formula, the lab's observed speed would be ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 + (v / n c) * v / c\u00b2? Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator again.\n\nWait, the denominator is 1 + (u v)/c\u00b2. Since u is c/n, so ( (c/n)*v ) / c\u00b2 = v/(n c). So the denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c). \n\nTherefore, the total is [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:\n\nNumerator: (c/n + v)*n c = (c^2 + v n c)\n\nDenominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v\n\nSo the speed is (c\u00b2 + v n c) / (n c + v )\n\nBut since c is given as 1, substitute c=1:\n\n(1 + v n ) / (n + v )\n\nSo that would be option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again. \n\nThe velocity addition formula gives:\n\nu' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, u is the speed in the moving frame (the glass's rest frame, which is moving at v relative to lab). So u = c/n. Then plug into the formula:\n\nu' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify denominator's term: (c/n * v)/c\u00b2 = v/(n c)\n\nSo denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c). \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n c to make it easier:\n\nNumerator: (c/n + v) * n c = (c^2 + v n c )\n\nDenominator: (1 + v/(n c)) * n c = n c + v \n\nSo the result is (c\u00b2 + v n c) / (n c + v )\n\nSet c=1 (as per problem's instruction, since c=1 here), so numerator is 1 + v n, denominator n + v. So the speed is (1 + n v)/(n +v ), which is option A. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is moving through the glass at (c/n) relative to the glass. Since both are moving in the same direction, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v + (c/n).

Then (1 + n v)/(n +v ) \u2248 (1 + n v)/(n (1 + v/n )) \u2248 (1/(n) ) * (1 + n v) / (1 + v/n ) \u2248 (1/n)(1 + n v) (1 - v/n ) \u2248 (1/n)(1 + n v - v/n - v\u00b2) \u2248 1/n + v - v/(n\u00b2) - ... So to first order, that's approximately (1/n + v). Which matches the classical addition. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if the options have another possible answer. Option C is (1 +n v)/(n - v).
