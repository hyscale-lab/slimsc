      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me think through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem gives me a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I believe is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, right, the orthophosphate ion is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. So, the question is about a buffer solution made with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Wait, but the Na2HPO4 is the dihydrate, but I think the water of crystallization doesn't affect the ions in solution once it's dissolved. So, the key here is to figure out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution and then use the appropriate equilibrium to find PO4^3-.\n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each compound. \n\nFirst, KH2PO4 has a molar mass of 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 136.09. Let me see, 1/136 is approximately 0.00735, so maybe around 0.00735 moles? Let me do it more accurately. 136.09 * 0.0073 is 136.09 *0.007 = ~0.9526, plus 0.0003*136.09=0.0408, so total ~0.9934, so 0.0073 would give about 0.993, so maybe the exact value is 1/136.09 \u22480.007346 mol. \n\nThen, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles would be 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 178 is roughly 0.005618. So approximately 0.005618 mol. \n\nNow, since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentrations would be:\n\nConcentration of KH2PO4: 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M. \n\nConcentration of Na2HPO4: 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M. \n\nWait, but I should note that KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-). So the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the relevant species here. \n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Since PO4^3- is the next deprotonation from HPO4^2-, we can use the third dissociation constant, Ka3. \n\nThe third dissociation is: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is given as 1.8x10^-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using this equilibrium. \n\nBut to do that, I might need to find the pH of the solution first, because the position of the equilibrium depends on the H+ concentration. Alternatively, maybe since we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, we can find the pH from that buffer, and then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation. \n\nWait, let's think step by step. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so it's a buffer system between the second and third dissociation steps of phosphoric acid. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). Here, the second dissociation's Ka is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8))? Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u22480.792 -8 = -7.208, so pKa2 is 7.208. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). \n\nWe can plug in the concentrations we calculated earlier. \n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M (from Na2HPO4), and [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4). \n\nSo the ratio is 0.02809 / 0.03673 \u22480.764. The log of that is log(0.764) \u2248-0.117. \n\nTherefore pH = 7.208 -0.117 \u22487.091. \n\nSo the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we look at the third dissociation: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] \n\nWe have Ka3, [HPO4^2-] is known (0.02809 M), and [H+] can be found from the pH. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.1x10^-8 M. \n\nLet me compute 10^-7.09: \n\nSince 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 0.09 in the exponent: 10^-0.09 \u2248 ~0.812. So 1e-7 *0.812 \u22488.12e-8. \n\nSo [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M. \n\nNow plug into the equation: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.12e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809 = ~0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14 \n\nThen divide by 8.12e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0562 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\nCalculating 5.0562 /8.12 \u22480.6226 \n\nSo 0.6226e-6 = 6.226e-7 M \n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.23e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or D (3.97e-7). Wait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, let's check the calculation again step by step. \n\nFirst, the moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09g/mol = 1/136.09 \u22480.007346 mol. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol \u22480.005618 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\nKH2PO4: 0.007346 /0.2 =0.03673 M. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.005618 /0.2 =0.02809 M. Correct.\n\npKa2 is correct. 6.2e-8 gives pKa 7.208. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH = 7.208 + log(0.02809/0.03673). \n\nThe ratio is 0.02809/0.03673 = let's compute exactly. 0.02809 divided by 0.03673. \n\n0.02809 \u00f7 0.03673 \u22480.764. log(0.764)=? Let me use a calculator approach. \n\nLog(0.76) is about -0.119, log(0.77)= -0.1139. Since 0.764 is between them. Let me compute log(0.764). \n\nAlternatively, using natural logs and converting: \n\nln(0.764) \u2248-0.268, so log(x)= ln(x)/ln(10) \u2248-0.268/2.3026 \u2248-0.116. So that gives pH=7.208 -0.116\u22487.092. \n\nSo pH\u22487.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n10^-7.09 = 10^( -7 -0.09 ) = 10^-7 *10^-0.09. \n\n10^-0.09: 10^0.1 is about 1.2589, so 10^-0.09 = 1/(10^0.09). Let me compute 10^0.09:\n\nTake natural logs: ln(10^0.09)=0.09*ln10\u22480.09*2.3026\u22480.2072. So exp(0.2072)= e^0.2072\u22481.2296. So 10^0.09\u22481.2296, so 10^-0.09\u22480.813. \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.813 =8.13e-8 M. \n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12)*(0.02809)/(8.13e-8). \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.13e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.0562/8.13)*1e-6. \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.13. Let's calculate that:\n\n5.0562 \u00f78.13: \n\n8.13 \u00d70.622 = 5.056 (since 8*0.622=4.976, 0.13\u00d70.622\u22480.08086 \u2192 total ~5.0568). \n\nSo 5.0562/8.13 \u22480.622. \n\nThus, 0.622 \u00d71e-6 = 6.22e-7 M. \n\nHmm, so that's 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding in the steps. Let me check if I did all the steps precisely. \n\nWait, perhaps when calculating the ratio of concentrations. Let me recheck the initial concentrations. \n\nWait, the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: when it dissolves, each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion. So the moles of HPO4^2- is exactly the same as the moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.005618 mol. Correct. Similarly, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- in 1:1 ratio, so 0.007346 mol. \n\nSo the concentrations are correct. \n\npH calculation steps are okay. \n\nThe Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, so that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, the equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In the second dissociation, H2PO4^- is the acid (donates a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the base is HPO4^2-. So the equation is correct as used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, since the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the equilibrium. \n\nSo using the formula [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]. \n\nAll the values plug in correctly. \n\nHmm, so 6.22e-7 is very close to option A (6.24e-7). The difference could be from using more precise numbers. Let me try using more precise calculations. \n\nLet me recalculate the moles with more precision. \n\nFirst, KH2PO4: 1.00 /136.09. Let me compute that exactly. 136.09 \u00d7 0.007346 = 1.00 (approx). Let me compute 1/136.09. \n\n136.09 \u00d7 0.007346 = 136.09 *0.007 =0.95263, plus 136.09*0.000346 = 136.09 *0.0003=0.040827, plus 136.09 *0.000046 \u22486.26. So total 0.95263+0.040827=0.993457 +0.00626\u22480.9997, so 0.007346 gives ~1.00g. So that's accurate enough. \n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 /177.99. Let me compute that precisely. 177.99 \u00d70.005618= 177.99\u00d70.005=0.88995, plus 177.99\u00d70.000618\u22480.1099. So total ~0.9998. So that's correct. \n\nThen the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 /0.03673. Let me compute this exactly: \n\n0.02809 divided by 0.03673. Let me write both as 2809/100000 divided by 3673/100000 =2809/3673. \n\nDividing 2809 by 3673. Let's see:\n\n3673 \u00d70.764 = 3673*0.7=2571.1; 3673*0.06=220.38; 3673*0.004=14.692. Total:2571.1+220.38=2791.48 +14.692=2806.172. So 0.764 gives 2806.172, which is very close to 2809. So 0.764 + (2809-2806.172)/3673 \u22480.764 + 2.828/3673\u22480.764+0.00077\u22480.76477. So the ratio is ~0.7648. \n\nTaking log(0.7648). Let me use a calculator-like approach. \n\nLog(0.7648)= log(7.648\u00d710^-1) = log(7.648) -1. \n\nLog(7.648): since log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.64)=0.8833, so 7.648 is a bit more. Let's see, log(7.64)=0.8833, log(7.65)=0.8838. So 7.648 is between 7.64 and 7.65. \n\nDifference between 7.64 and 7.65 is 0.01. The value 7.648 is 0.008 above 7.64. So per 0.01 difference, the log increases by 0.0005 (from 0.8833 to 0.8838). So 0.008 is 0.8 of the interval. So 0.8833 +0.8*0.0005=0.8833 +0.0004=0.8837. \n\nThus, log(7.648)=0.8837, so log(0.7648)=0.8837-1= -0.1163. \n\nThus pH =7.208 -0.1163=7.0917. \n\nSo pH is approximately 7.0917. \n\n[H+] =10^-7.0917. Let's compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me use the formula 10^(-7.0917)=10^(-7 -0.0917)=10^-7 *10^-0.0917. \n\nCompute 10^-0.0917. Let me compute ln(10^-0.0917)= -0.0917 *ln10\u2248-0.0917*2.3026\u2248-0.2111. \n\nSo exp(-0.2111)= e^-0.2111. Let me compute e^-0.2=0.8187; e^-0.2111 is a bit less. \n\n0.2111-0.2=0.0111. So using Taylor series: e^-0.2111 \u2248 e^-0.2 * e^-0.0111 \u22480.8187*(1 -0.0111 + ...) \u22480.8187*(0.9889)=approx 0.8187*0.9889. \n\n0.8187*0.98=0.8023, 0.8187*0.0089\u22480.0073, so total ~0.8023+0.0073=0.8096. So about 0.8096. \n\nThus 10^-0.0917\u22480.8096, so [H+]=1e-7 *0.8096\u22488.096e-8. \n\nNow, plugging back into [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.096e-8 \n\nFirst multiply numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809=0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.096e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.096e-8 = (5.0562 /8.096)*1e-6 \n\nCalculate 5.0562 \u00f78.096: \n\nLet me compute 8.096 \u00d70.625 =5.06. Exactly? 8*0.625=5, 0.096*0.625=0.06, so total 5.06. \n\nSo 5.0562 is just slightly less than 5.06, so 0.625 - (0.0038/8.096). \n\nWait, 5.0562 is 5.06 -0.0038. \n\nSo 5.0562 /8.096 =0.625 - (0.0038/8.096) \u22480.625 -0.00047\u22480.6245. \n\nSo approximately 0.6245. \n\nThus, 0.6245e-6 =6.245e-7 M. \n\nAh! That's exactly option A: 6.24x10^-7 M. \n\nSo my initial calculation had rounding errors but when done more precisely, it comes out to 6.24e-7, which matches option A. \n\nWait, but let me check once again. \n\nWait, the exact calculation for the ratio gives 0.6245, so 6.245e-7, which is 6.24e-7 when rounded to three significant figures. The given options have three significant figures, so that's spot on for option A. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait a second. Let me check the question again. It says \"orthophosphate ions\". Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Yes. So that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: Did I mix up any steps? Let me see. \n\nThe key steps are correct. The buffer pH is correctly calculated. Then using that pH to find [H+], plug into the Ka3 equation. All steps seem okay. \n\nHmm, so why is option D (3.97e-7) an option? Maybe someone might use the second dissociation's Ka instead of the third? But no, because the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the third dissociation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone miscalculates the ratio? Let me see. \n\nWait, another possible mistake: perhaps I should have used the third pKa directly in the buffer equation? No, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- to PO4^3-, so the buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- would use pKa3. But in our case, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant pKa is pKa2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot that the third dissociation is much weaker, but no, the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me think through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem gives me a solution with 200.00 cm\u00b3 (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I believe is PO4^3-.\n\nHmm, right, the orthophosphate ion is the fully deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. So, the question is about a buffer solution made with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Wait, but the Na2HPO4 is the dihydrate, but I think the water of crystallization doesn't affect the ions in solution once it's dissolved. So, the key here is to figure out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution and then use the appropriate equilibrium to find PO4^3-.\n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each compound. \n\nFirst, KH2PO4 has a molar mass of 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 136.09. Let me see, 1/136 is approximately 0.00735, so maybe around 0.00735 moles? Let me do it more accurately. 136.09 * 0.0073 is 136.09 *0.007 = ~0.9526, plus 0.0003*136.09=0.0408, so total ~0.9934, so 0.0073 would give about 0.993, so maybe the exact value is 1/136.09 \u22480.007346 mol. \n\nThen, for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles would be 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 178 is roughly 0.005618. So approximately 0.005618 mol. \n\nNow, since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentrations would be:\n\nConcentration of KH2PO4: 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M. \n\nConcentration of Na2HPO4: 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M. \n\nWait, but I should note that KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's the sodium salt of HPO4^2-). So the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the relevant species here. \n\nThe problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Since PO4^3- is the next deprotonation from HPO4^2-, we can use the third dissociation constant, Ka3. \n\nThe third dissociation is: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is given as 1.8x10^-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using this equilibrium. \n\nBut to do that, I might need to find the pH of the solution first, because the position of the equilibrium depends on the H+ concentration. Alternatively, maybe since we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, we can find the pH from that buffer, and then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation. \n\nWait, let's think step by step. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so it's a buffer system between the second and third dissociation steps of phosphoric acid. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). Here, the second dissociation's Ka is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8))? Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) \u22480.792 -8 = -7.208, so pKa2 is 7.208. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). \n\nWe can plug in the concentrations we calculated earlier. \n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M (from Na2HPO4), and [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4). \n\nSo the ratio is 0.02809 / 0.03673 \u22480.764. The log of that is log(0.764) \u2248-0.117. \n\nTherefore pH = 7.208 -0.117 \u22487.091. \n\nSo the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we look at the third dissociation: HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] \n\nWe have Ka3, [HPO4^2-] is known (0.02809 M), and [H+] can be found from the pH. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.1x10^-8 M. \n\nLet me compute 10^-7.09: \n\nSince 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 0.09 in the exponent: 10^-0.09 \u2248 ~0.812. So 1e-7 *0.812 \u22488.12e-8. \n\nSo [H+] \u22488.12e-8 M. \n\nNow plug into the equation: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.12e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809 = ~0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14 \n\nThen divide by 8.12e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0562 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\nCalculating 5.0562 /8.12 \u22480.6226 \n\nSo 0.6226e-6 = 6.226e-7 M \n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.23e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or D (3.97e-7). Wait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, let's check the calculation again step by step. \n\nFirst, the moles:\n\nKH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09g/mol = 1/136.09 \u22480.007346 mol. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99g/mol \u22480.005618 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\nKH2PO4: 0.007346 /0.2 =0.03673 M. Correct.\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.005618 /0.2 =0.02809 M. Correct.\n\npKa2 is correct. 6.2e-8 gives pKa 7.208. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH = 7.208 + log(0.02809/0.03673). \n\nThe ratio is 0.02809/0.03673 = let's compute exactly. 0.02809 divided by 0.03673. \n\n0.02809 \u00f7 0.03673 \u22480.764. log(0.764)=? Let me use a calculator approach. \n\nLog(0.76) is about -0.119, log(0.77)= -0.1139. Since 0.764 is between them. Let me compute log(0.764). \n\nAlternatively, using natural logs and converting: \n\nln(0.764) \u2248-0.268, so log(x)= ln(x)/ln(10) \u2248-0.268/2.3026 \u2248-0.116. So that gives pH=7.208 -0.116\u22487.092. \n\nSo pH\u22487.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n10^-7.09 = 10^( -7 -0.09 ) = 10^-7 *10^-0.09. \n\n10^-0.09: 10^0.1 is about 1.2589, so 10^-0.09 = 1/(10^0.09). Let me compute 10^0.09:\n\nTake natural logs: ln(10^0.09)=0.09*ln10\u22480.09*2.3026\u22480.2072. So exp(0.2072)= e^0.2072\u22481.2296. So 10^0.09\u22481.2296, so 10^-0.09\u22480.813. \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.813 =8.13e-8 M. \n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12)*(0.02809)/(8.13e-8). \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.13e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.0562/8.13)*1e-6. \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.13. Let's calculate that:\n\n5.0562 \u00f78.13: \n\n8.13 \u00d70.622 = 5.056 (since 8*0.622=4.976, 0.13\u00d70.622\u22480.08086 \u2192 total ~5.0568). \n\nSo 5.0562/8.13 \u22480.622. \n\nThus, 0.622 \u00d71e-6 = 6.22e-7 M. \n\nHmm, so that's 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding in the steps. Let me check if I did all the steps precisely. \n\nWait, perhaps when calculating the ratio of concentrations. Let me recheck the initial concentrations. \n\nWait, the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: when it dissolves, each formula unit gives one HPO4^2- ion. So the moles of HPO4^2- is exactly the same as the moles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which is 0.005618 mol. Correct. Similarly, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^- in 1:1 ratio, so 0.007346 mol. \n\nSo the concentrations are correct. \n\npH calculation steps are okay. \n\nThe Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, so that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, the equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In the second dissociation, H2PO4^- is the acid (donates a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the base is HPO4^2-. So the equation is correct as used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, since the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u21cc H+ + PO4^3-, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the equilibrium. \n\nSo using the formula [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]. \n\nAll the values plug in correctly. \n\nHmm, so 6.22e-7 is very close to option A (6.24e-7). The difference could be from using more precise numbers. Let me try using more precise calculations. \n\nLet me recalculate the moles with more precision. \n\nFirst, KH2PO4: 1.00 /136.09. Let me compute that exactly. 136.09 \u00d7 0.007346 = 1.00 (approx). Let me compute 1/136.09. \n\n136.09 \u00d7 0.007346 = 136.09 *0.007 =0.95263, plus 136.09*0.000346 = 136.09 *0.0003=0.040827, plus 136.09 *0.000046 \u22486.26. So total 0.95263+0.040827=0.993457 +0.00626\u22480.9997, so 0.007346 gives ~1.00g. So that's accurate enough. \n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 /177.99. Let me compute that precisely. 177.99 \u00d70.005618= 177.99\u00d70.005=0.88995, plus 177.99\u00d70.000618\u22480.1099. So total ~0.9998. So that's correct. \n\nThen the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 /0.03673. Let me compute this exactly: \n\n0.02809 divided by 0.03673. Let me write both as 2809/100000 divided by 3673/100000 =2809/3673. \n\nDividing 2809 by 3673. Let's see:\n\n3673 \u00d70.764 = 3673*0.7=2571.1; 3673*0.06=220.38; 3673*0.004=14.692. Total:2571.1+220.38=2791.48 +14.692=2806.172. So 0.764 gives 2806.172, which is very close to 2809. So 0.764 + (2809-2806.172)/3673 \u22480.764 + 2.828/3673\u22480.764+0.00077\u22480.76477. So the ratio is ~0.7648. \n\nTaking log(0.7648). Let me use a calculator-like approach. \n\nLog(0.7648)= log(7.648\u00d710^-1) = log(7.648) -1. \n\nLog(7.648): since log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.64)=0.8833, so 7.648 is a bit more. Let's see, log(7.64)=0.8833, log(7.65)=0.8838. So 7.648 is between 7.64 and 7.65. \n\nDifference between 7.64 and 7.65 is 0.01. The value 7.648 is 0.008 above 7.64. So per 0.01 difference, the log increases by 0.0005 (from 0.8833 to 0.8838). So 0.008 is 0.8 of the interval. So 0.8833 +0.8*0.0005=0.8833 +0.0004=0.8837. \n\nThus, log(7.648)=0.8837, so log(0.7648)=0.8837-1= -0.1163. \n\nThus pH =7.208 -0.1163=7.0917. \n\nSo pH is approximately 7.0917. \n\n[H+] =10^-7.0917. Let's compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me use the formula 10^(-7.0917)=10^(-7 -0.0917)=10^-7 *10^-0.0917. \n\nCompute 10^-0.0917. Let me compute ln(10^-0.0917)= -0.0917 *ln10\u2248-0.0917*2.3026\u2248-0.2111. \n\nSo exp(-0.2111)= e^-0.2111. Let me compute e^-0.2=0.8187; e^-0.2111 is a bit less. \n\n0.2111-0.2=0.0111. So using Taylor series: e^-0.2111 \u2248 e^-0.2 * e^-0.0111 \u22480.8187*(1 -0.0111 + ...) \u22480.8187*(0.9889)=approx 0.8187*0.9889. \n\n0.8187*0.98=0.8023, 0.8187*0.0089\u22480.0073, so total ~0.8023+0.0073=0.8096. So about 0.8096. \n\nThus 10^-0.0917\u22480.8096, so [H+]=1e-7 *0.8096\u22488.096e-8. \n\nNow, plugging back into [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.096e-8 \n\nFirst multiply numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809=0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.096e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.096e-8 = (5.0562 /8.096)*1e-6 \n\nCalculate 5.0562 \u00f78.096: \n\nLet me compute 8.096 \u00d70.625 =5.06. Exactly? 8*0.625=5, 0.096*0.625=0.06, so total 5.06. \n\nSo 5.0562 is just slightly less than 5.06, so 0.625 - (0.0038/8.096). \n\nWait, 5.0562 is 5.06 -0.0038. \n\nSo 5.0562 /8.096 =0.625 - (0.0038/8.096) \u22480.625 -0.00047\u22480.6245. \n\nSo approximately 0.6245. \n\nThus, 0.6245e-6 =6.245e-7 M. \n\nAh! That's exactly option A: 6.24x10^-7 M. \n\nSo my initial calculation had rounding errors but when done more precisely, it comes out to 6.24e-7, which matches option A. \n\nWait, but let me check once again. \n\nWait, the exact calculation for the ratio gives 0.6245, so 6.245e-7, which is 6.24e-7 when rounded to three significant figures. The given options have three significant figures, so that's spot on for option A. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait a second. Let me check the question again. It says \"orthophosphate ions\". Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Yes. So that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to check: Did I mix up any steps? Let me see. \n\nThe key steps are correct. The buffer pH is correctly calculated. Then using that pH to find [H+], plug into the Ka3 equation. All steps seem okay. \n\nHmm, so why is option D (3.97e-7) an option? Maybe someone might use the second dissociation's Ka instead of the third? But no, because the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from the third dissociation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone miscalculates the ratio? Let me see. \n\nWait, another possible mistake: perhaps I should have used the third pKa directly in the buffer equation? No, because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- to PO4^3-, so the buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- would use pKa3. But in our case, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant pKa is pKa2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot that the third dissociation is much weaker, but no, the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we start by calculating the moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O:\n\n- Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol\n- Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005618 mol\n\nThe concentrations in 0.2 L are:\n- [H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.03673 M\n- [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.02809 M\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (pKa\u2082 = -log(6.2\u00d710\u207b\u2078) \u2248 7.208):\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa}_2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{PO}_4^-]}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.208 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.02809}{0.03673}\\right) \u2248 7.208 - 0.116 \u2248 7.092\n\\]\n\nThe [H\u207a] from pH 7.092 is:\n\\[\n[\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-7.092} \u2248 8.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nUsing the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka\u2083 = 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2):\n\\[\n\\text{Ka}_3 = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}\n\\]\n\\[\n[\\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \\frac{\\text{Ka}_3 \\times [\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\\text{H}^+]} = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12})(0.02809)}{8.1 \\times 10^{-8}} \u2248 6.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me see what I need to do. The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. The Ka values given are for H\u2083PO\u2084, with Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 being 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each of these salts contribute to the solution. Let me start by calculating the molar concentrations of each compound. \n\nStarting with KH\u2082PO\u2084. The molecular weight (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g. Moles would be mass divided by molar mass, so 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let's see, 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007346 mol, so roughly 0.00735 moles. Since the volume is 0.2 L (200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L), the concentration is moles over volume. So 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M. That's for KH\u2082PO\u2084. \n\nNow the other compound is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. Its Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Again, 1.00 g divided by that. 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. Divided by 0.2 L gives 0.02809 M. \n\nSo now, the two salts contribute different phosphate species. Let me think about their dissociation. \n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissociates, it should give K\u207a and H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b ions. Similarly, Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O would dissociate into 2 Na\u207a and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions (since the 2H2O is just water of crystallization and would dissolve). \n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. So how does that come into play? \n\nThe H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is the hydrogen phosphate ion. The orthophosphate is the third deprotonation. So, I think the presence of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can deprotonate further to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. But given the Ka values, especially Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b would be very low, but maybe we can calculate it using the equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a buffer solution between HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, maybe I need to consider the equilibrium between them. Wait, but the orthophosphate would come from the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b losing a proton. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe problem is asking for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. To find that, I need to look at the third dissociation step of H\u2083PO\u2084. The third dissociation is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a. The equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nSo, the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b would depend on the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and the H+ concentration. Alternatively, maybe the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can deprotonate to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, so using the Ka3 expression. \n\nBut first, let me confirm the initial concentrations. Let me note down the concentrations again:\n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084: 0.03673 M (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b)\nNa\u2082HPO\u2084: 0.02809 M (HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b)\n\nWait, but the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is coming from Na\u2082HPO\u2084, so the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is 0.02809 M. \n\nThe H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is 0.03673 M. \n\nNow, the solution is a buffer between H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, right? Because they are adjacent species in the phosphate system. The pKa2 for H3PO4 is the log(Ka2) which is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 -7.21, so pKa2 \u2248 7.21. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2, because it's a buffer between H2PO4\u207b and HPO4\u00b2\u207b. \n\nWait, so the pH here would be determined by the ratio of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b to H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. Let me check that. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base would be HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and the acid would be H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. \n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]). \n\nLet me compute the ratio. The concentrations are 0.02809 and 0.03673. \n\nSo log(0.02809 / 0.03673) = log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117. \n\nTherefore, pH \u2248 7.21 - 0.117 \u2248 7.09. \n\nSo the pH of the solution is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, which is the next deprotonation step. The third dissociation is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 would be [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b][H\u207a]/[HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = Ka3. \n\nWe need to solve for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. \n\nRearranged: [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (Ka3 * [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]) / [H\u207a] \n\nWe know [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] is 0.02809 M (but wait, actually, in the solution, the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b might have some deprotonation, but given that Ka3 is so small, maybe the change is negligible? Let me think. Since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the amount of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b that deprotonates to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is going to be tiny, so we can approximate [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] as approximately 0.02809 M. \n\nThe H+ concentration can be found from the pH. Since pH is 7.09, [H+] = 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.13e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the equation: \n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.13e-8) \n\nLet me calculate that. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.13e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.13e-8 \u2248 6.22e-7 M. \n\nHmm, that would be approximately 6.22e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or B (5.48e-7). \n\nWait, but maybe I made an approximation error. Let me check the calculations again. \n\nWait, the pH was calculated as 7.09. Let me compute [H+] again. \n\npH = 7.09 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.09). Let me compute that more precisely. \n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812, so 1e-7 * 0.812 = 8.12e-8. So that part is okay. \n\nThen, 1.8e-12 * 0.02809: \n\n1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14. \n\nDivided by 8.12e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0562 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\nCalculating 5.0562 /8.12: Let's see, 5/8 is 0.625, so approximately 5.0562 /8.12 \u2248 0.6225. \n\nSo 0.6225 * 1e-6 = 6.225e-7 M. \n\nSo that's about 6.23e-7, which would be option A (6.24e-7). But wait, the options have A as 6.24e-7 and B as 5.48e-7. So close to A. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of the pH. Let me recalculate the pH again. \n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])\n\npKa2 is log(Ka2) inverse. Since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) but wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that again. \n\nlog(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = ~0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076. \n\nThe ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.02809)/(0.03673) \u2248 0.764. \n\nlog(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) \u2248 -0.117 (since log(0.7) is about -0.155, but 0.764 is closer to 0.8, whose log is -0.0969). Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nlog(0.764): Let's see. log(7.64) is 0.883, so log(0.764) = 0.883 - 1 = -0.117. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, pH = 7.2076 -0.117 \u2248 7.0906. So pH \u22487.09. \n\nSo the [H+] is indeed ~8.13e-8. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). But the options are given as:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 \n\nHmm. Maybe my approximation is missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b concentration isn't exactly 0.02809 because some of it is converted to PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b? Let me think. Since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the change would be negligible, so the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the contribution from the second dissociation? Wait, the H2PO4^- can also lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, but that's part of the buffer system. But since we're looking at the third ionization, maybe that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall phosphate species. Let me see another approach. \n\nThe total phosphate species would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, as the first deprotonation (Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pH around 1.5 would be where H3PO4 and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium, but our solution is at pH ~7, so those are negligible. The third deprotonation (Ka3) is so small that PO4^3- is minimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the HPO4^2- can also accept a proton from H2PO4^-? Wait, no, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are as given. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the autoionization of water? Probably negligible here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? But no, orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the concentrations. Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, KH\u2082PO\u2084: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that exactly. \n\n136.09 g/mol. 1.00 /136.09 = 0.007346 mol. Yes. \n\nVolume is 0.2 L. So 0.007346 /0.2 = 0.03673 M. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = 1 /177.99 = 0.005618 mol. Divided by 0.2 gives 0.02809 M. \n\nThat's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation leads me to 6.23e-7, which is option A. But let's check the options again. \n\nWait, the options are A:6.24e-7, B:5.48e-7, C:2.8e-7, D:3.97e-7. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's an error in assuming the H+ concentration? Let me see. \n\nWait, another thought: The HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can also lose a proton to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, but maybe there's also a contribution from H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b losing two protons? But no, that would require going through HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is not exactly 7.09, but I need to compute it more precisely? Let me check the exact values. \n\nLet me recalculate the pH step again. \n\nThe ratio [HPO\u2084^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 /0.03673 = let's compute that exactly. \n\n0.02809 divided by 0.03673. Let's compute that:\n\n0.02809 /0.03673 \u2248 (2809/36730) *10^4? Wait, perhaps better as decimal division:\n\n0.02809 \u00f7 0.03673. Let me compute this division:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 0.0001: 280.9 / 367.3 \u2248 0.764. So log(0.764) is indeed approx -0.117. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator for log(0.764):\n\nlog(0.764) = ln(0.764)/ln(10) \u2248 (-0.269)/2.3026 \u2248 -0.1168. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1168 = 7.0908. \n\nSo pH is 7.0908. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0908). Let me compute that precisely. \n\n10^(-7.0908) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0908). \n\n10^(-0.0908) is e.g., 10^0.0908 = approx 1.227 (since 10^0.1 is ~1.258, so 0.09 is a bit less). Let me compute it:\n\nlog(1.227) is 0.089, so 10^0.0908 \u22481.227. So 1/1.227 \u22480.815. \n\nThus, 10^(-0.0908)= ~0.815. \n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 *0.815 \u22488.15e-8. \n\nSo that's about 8.15e-8. \n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809)/ (8.15e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivided by 8.15e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.15e-8 = (5.0562 /8.15) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.15: Let's calculate that. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.15. \n\n8.15 \u00d70.6 =4.89, so 5.0562 -4.89 =0.1662. \n\n0.1662 /8.15 \u22480.0204. \n\nSo total is 0.6 +0.0204=0.6204. \n\nSo 0.6204 \u00d71e-6 =6.204e-7 M. \n\nThat's approximately 6.20e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. The slight difference could be due to rounding during calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b concentration? Wait, the initial concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is 0.02809 M. But when HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b deprotonates to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b would decrease slightly. Let's see if that's significant. \n\nLet me denote x = [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. Then, according to the equilibrium: \n\nHPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a \n\nThe change would be -x for HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, +x for PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, and +x for H+ (but the H+ comes from the solution, which is already buffered by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- equilibrium, so maybe the H+ is fixed, so the approximation holds). \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the exact expression, but since x is very small, the approximation [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] \u2248 0.02809 is valid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the contribution from the second dissociation? \n\nWait another thought: The question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. The only source here is the deprotonation of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can also protonate to form H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, but that's part of the buffer system. \n\nWait, but the calculation seems to give an answer very close to option A. However, the options have B as 5.48e-7. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula of the sodium salt. Let me check the formula again. The sodium salt is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The formula for disodium hydrogen phosphate is Na\u2082HPO\u2084. The 2H\u2082O is water of crystallization, which doesn't affect the dissociation. So when it dissolves, it gives 2Na+ and HPO\u2084^2- ions. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the molarity calculation for the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O? Let me recheck:\n\nMw of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. \n\n1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol. Yes. \n\nSo 0.005618 /0.2 L =0.02809 M. That's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? But no, that's hydrogen phosphate. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the third dissociation's Ka, but in a different way. Let me think again. \n\nThe expression for the third dissociation is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \n\nRearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nWe have all those values. \n\nWait, so if I compute it precisely, using the exact [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.0908 = antilog(-7.0908) \n\nLet me compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. \n\nLet me write 7.0908 as 7 + 0.0908. \n\n10^-7.0908 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0908). \n\nCompute 10^(-0.0908):\n\nTake natural logs: ln(10^(-0.0908)) = -0.0908 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0908 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2092 \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.2092 \u2248 0.811 \n\nThus, 10^-0.0908 \u22480.811 \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.811 =8.11e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.11e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0562 /8.11) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0562 /8.11 \u22480.623 \n\nSo 0.623 *1e-6 =6.23e-7 \u21926.23 x10^-7 M. \n\nSo that's exactly option A. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but why is option B present? Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of HPO\u2084^2-? \n\nWait, the sodium salt is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. When this dissolves, each mole gives 1 mole of HPO\u2084^2-. So the molarity is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong pKa? Let me check the given Ka values. \n\nThe question says: Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, 1.8e-12. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the first deprotonation? No, that would be H3PO4 to H2PO4^- which is Ka1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? If so, then the concentration would be 0.02809 M, but that's not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the contribution from H2PO4^- losing two protons? \n\nWait, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is part of the buffer. But to get PO4^3-, it would need to lose another proton. So the path is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-. \n\nThe first step is governed by Ka2, the second by Ka3. \n\nBut since the solution is a buffer at pH ~7.09, which is near pKa2 (~7.21), the concentration of HPO4^2- is about half of H2PO4^-? Wait, no, the ratio was about 0.76, which is close to 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the overall equilibrium for the third dissociation, but considering the H+ from the buffer? Which I did. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once again:\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12. \n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M. \n\n[H+] is 8.1e-8. \n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.1e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDenominator:8.1e-8 \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0562 /8.1) *1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.1 is approximately 0.6242. \n\nSo 0.6242e-6 \u21926.242e-7. \n\nAh! Wait a second! If I use 8.1 instead of 8.11, then 5.0562 /8.1 = exactly 0.6242. \n\nSo that gives exactly 6.242e-7, which is option A. \n\nSo the precise calculation gives exactly the value in option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. \n\nBut why is option B there? Maybe a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? \n\nWait, let me check again the Henderson-Hasselbalch step. \n\nThe buffer is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). \n\nThe equation is pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nYes. \n\nSo with the given concentrations, the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the concentration of H+ as 1e-7, but that would give a different answer. \n\nIf someone mistakenly assumes pH=7, then [H+]=1e-7, then:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/1e-7 = (5.056e-14)/1e-7 =5.056e-7. That would be ~5.06e-7, which is close to option B (5.48e-7), but not exactly. \n\nPerhaps the error comes from using the wrong pKa? For example, if someone used pKa3 instead of considering the pH from pKa2. \n\nWait, another possible mistake: Maybe the user confused Ka2 and Ka3? Let's see. \n\nWait, the problem is asking about PO4^3-, which is the third dissociation (HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-), so the correct Ka is Ka3. \n\nAlternatively, if someone used Ka2 instead of Ka3, then:\n\nUsing Ka2=6.2e-8, then [PO4^3-] would be (6.2e-8 * 0.02809)/8.1e-8 \u2248 (6.2*0.02809)/8.1 *1e0. \n\nWait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the expression for Ka2 is [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-] = Ka2. But for the third step, it's [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = Ka3. \n\nSo if someone mistakenly used Ka2 instead of Ka3, they might have done:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka2 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(6.2e-8 * 0.02809)/8.1e-8 = (6.2 *0.02809)/8.1 * (1e-8 /1e-8) \u2192 (0.174)/8.1 \u22480.0215 \u2192 2.15e-2? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps another error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total phosphate concentration? \n\nTotal phosphate would be the sum of all species, but the question specifically asks for PO4^3-, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in calculating the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? \n\nWait, for instance, if the ratio was taken as [acid]/[base] instead of [base]/[acid], then pH would be pKa2 + log(0.03673/0.02809)= pKa2 + log(1.308) \u22487.21 +0.117=7.327. \n\nThen pH=7.327 \u2192 [H+]=4.7e-8. \n\nThen, [PO4^3-]=(1.8e-12 *0.02809)/(4.7e-8) \n\nNumerator: 5.056e-14 \n\nDivided by 4.7e-8 \u21925.056e-14 /4.7e-8 \u22481.076e-6 \u21921.08e-6 M, which is higher than any options. \n\nHmm. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the molar masses? Let me check the molar masses again. \n\nKH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is 2*(1.008)=2.016, P is 30.97, O4 is 4*16=64. \n\nTotal: 39.1 + 2.016 +30.97 +64 = 39.1+2.016=41.116; 41.116+30.97=72.086; +64=136.086 \u2248136.09 g/mol. Correct. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4: H is 1.008, P 30.97, O4 64. So HPO4 is 1.008+30.97+64=95.98. The 2H2O is 2*(2*1.008 +16)=2*(18.016)=36.032. \n\nSo total molar mass is 45.98 +95.98 +36.032 =45.98+95.98=141.96 +36.032=178.0 (rounded to 177.99 as given). So that's correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct, so the answer must be A. \n\nWait the options are A)6.24e-7, which matches the precise calculation. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me see what I need to do. The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. The Ka values given are for H\u2083PO\u2084, with Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 being 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each of these salts contribute to the solution. Let me start by calculating the molar concentrations of each compound. \n\nStarting with KH\u2082PO\u2084. The molecular weight (Mw) is given as 136.09 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g. Moles would be mass divided by molar mass, so 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let's see, 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007346 mol, so roughly 0.00735 moles. Since the volume is 0.2 L (200 cm\u00b3 = 0.2 L), the concentration is moles over volume. So 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M. That's for KH\u2082PO\u2084. \n\nNow the other compound is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. Its Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Again, 1.00 g divided by that. 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. Divided by 0.2 L gives 0.02809 M. \n\nSo now, the two salts contribute different phosphate species. Let me think about their dissociation. \n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissociates, it should give K\u207a and H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b ions. Similarly, Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O would dissociate into 2 Na\u207a and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b ions (since the 2H2O is just water of crystallization and would dissolve). \n\nWait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. So how does that come into play? \n\nThe H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is the hydrogen phosphate ion. The orthophosphate is the third deprotonation. So, I think the presence of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can deprotonate further to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. But given the Ka values, especially Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b would be very low, but maybe we can calculate it using the equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a buffer solution between HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, maybe I need to consider the equilibrium between them. Wait, but the orthophosphate would come from the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b losing a proton. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe problem is asking for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. To find that, I need to look at the third dissociation step of H\u2083PO\u2084. The third dissociation is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a. The equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nSo, the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b would depend on the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and the H+ concentration. Alternatively, maybe the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can deprotonate to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, so using the Ka3 expression. \n\nBut first, let me confirm the initial concentrations. Let me note down the concentrations again:\n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084: 0.03673 M (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b)\nNa\u2082HPO\u2084: 0.02809 M (HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b)\n\nWait, but the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is coming from Na\u2082HPO\u2084, so the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is 0.02809 M. \n\nThe H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is 0.03673 M. \n\nNow, the solution is a buffer between H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, right? Because they are adjacent species in the phosphate system. The pKa2 for H3PO4 is the log(Ka2) which is log(6.2e-8) \u2248 -7.21, so pKa2 \u2248 7.21. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2, because it's a buffer between H2PO4\u207b and HPO4\u00b2\u207b. \n\nWait, so the pH here would be determined by the ratio of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b to H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. Let me check that. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base would be HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b and the acid would be H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. \n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]). \n\nLet me compute the ratio. The concentrations are 0.02809 and 0.03673. \n\nSo log(0.02809 / 0.03673) = log(0.764) \u2248 -0.117. \n\nTherefore, pH \u2248 7.21 - 0.117 \u2248 7.09. \n\nSo the pH of the solution is around 7.09. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, which is the next deprotonation step. The third dissociation is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 would be [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b][H\u207a]/[HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = Ka3. \n\nWe need to solve for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. \n\nRearranged: [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (Ka3 * [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]) / [H\u207a] \n\nWe know [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] is 0.02809 M (but wait, actually, in the solution, the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b might have some deprotonation, but given that Ka3 is so small, maybe the change is negligible? Let me think. Since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the amount of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b that deprotonates to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is going to be tiny, so we can approximate [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] as approximately 0.02809 M. \n\nThe H+ concentration can be found from the pH. Since pH is 7.09, [H+] = 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.13e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the equation: \n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.13e-8) \n\nLet me calculate that. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.13e-8: 5.0562e-14 / 8.13e-8 \u2248 6.22e-7 M. \n\nHmm, that would be approximately 6.22e-7, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or B (5.48e-7). \n\nWait, but maybe I made an approximation error. Let me check the calculations again. \n\nWait, the pH was calculated as 7.09. Let me compute [H+] again. \n\npH = 7.09 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-7.09). Let me compute that more precisely. \n\n10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812, so 1e-7 * 0.812 = 8.12e-8. So that part is okay. \n\nThen, 1.8e-12 * 0.02809: \n\n1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 = 5.0562e-14. \n\nDivided by 8.12e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0562 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\nCalculating 5.0562 /8.12: Let's see, 5/8 is 0.625, so approximately 5.0562 /8.12 \u2248 0.6225. \n\nSo 0.6225 * 1e-6 = 6.225e-7 M. \n\nSo that's about 6.23e-7, which would be option A (6.24e-7). But wait, the options have A as 6.24e-7 and B as 5.48e-7. So close to A. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of the pH. Let me recalculate the pH again. \n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])\n\npKa2 is log(Ka2) inverse. Since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) but wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that again. \n\nlog(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = ~0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076. \n\nThe ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.02809)/(0.03673) \u2248 0.764. \n\nlog(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) \u2248 -0.117 (since log(0.7) is about -0.155, but 0.764 is closer to 0.8, whose log is -0.0969). Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nlog(0.764): Let's see. log(7.64) is 0.883, so log(0.764) = 0.883 - 1 = -0.117. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, pH = 7.2076 -0.117 \u2248 7.0906. So pH \u22487.09. \n\nSo the [H+] is indeed ~8.13e-8. \n\nHmm. So the calculation gives 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). But the options are given as:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB) 5.48x10^-7 \n\nHmm. Maybe my approximation is missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b concentration isn't exactly 0.02809 because some of it is converted to PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b? Let me think. Since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, the change would be negligible, so the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the contribution from the second dissociation? Wait, the H2PO4^- can also lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, but that's part of the buffer system. But since we're looking at the third ionization, maybe that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall phosphate species. Let me see another approach. \n\nThe total phosphate species would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, as the first deprotonation (Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pH around 1.5 would be where H3PO4 and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium, but our solution is at pH ~7, so those are negligible. The third deprotonation (Ka3) is so small that PO4^3- is minimal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the HPO4^2- can also accept a proton from H2PO4^-? Wait, no, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so their concentrations are as given. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the autoionization of water? Probably negligible here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? But no, orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the concentrations. Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, KH\u2082PO\u2084: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that exactly. \n\n136.09 g/mol. 1.00 /136.09 = 0.007346 mol. Yes. \n\nVolume is 0.2 L. So 0.007346 /0.2 = 0.03673 M. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = 1 /177.99 = 0.005618 mol. Divided by 0.2 gives 0.02809 M. \n\nThat's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation leads me to 6.23e-7, which is option A. But let's check the options again. \n\nWait, the options are A:6.24e-7, B:5.48e-7, C:2.8e-7, D:3.97e-7. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's an error in assuming the H+ concentration? Let me see. \n\nWait, another thought: The HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can also lose a proton to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, but maybe there's also a contribution from H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b losing two protons? But no, that would require going through HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is not exactly 7.09, but I need to compute it more precisely? Let me check the exact values. \n\nLet me recalculate the pH step again. \n\nThe ratio [HPO\u2084^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 /0.03673 = let's compute that exactly. \n\n0.02809 divided by 0.03673. Let's compute that:\n\n0.02809 /0.03673 \u2248 (2809/36730) *10^4? Wait, perhaps better as decimal division:\n\n0.02809 \u00f7 0.03673. Let me compute this division:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 0.0001: 280.9 / 367.3 \u2248 0.764. So log(0.764) is indeed approx -0.117. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a calculator for log(0.764):\n\nlog(0.764) = ln(0.764)/ln(10) \u2248 (-0.269)/2.3026 \u2248 -0.1168. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1168 = 7.0908. \n\nSo pH is 7.0908. \n\n[H+] = 10^(-7.0908). Let me compute that precisely. \n\n10^(-7.0908) = 10^(-7) *10^(-0.0908). \n\n10^(-0.0908) is e.g., 10^0.0908 = approx 1.227 (since 10^0.1 is ~1.258, so 0.09 is a bit less). Let me compute it:\n\nlog(1.227) is 0.089, so 10^0.0908 \u22481.227. So 1/1.227 \u22480.815. \n\nThus, 10^(-0.0908)= ~0.815. \n\nSo [H+] = 1e-7 *0.815 \u22488.15e-8. \n\nSo that's about 8.15e-8. \n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809)/ (8.15e-8) \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 = 0.050562, so 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivided by 8.15e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.15e-8 = (5.0562 /8.15) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.15: Let's calculate that. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.15. \n\n8.15 \u00d70.6 =4.89, so 5.0562 -4.89 =0.1662. \n\n0.1662 /8.15 \u22480.0204. \n\nSo total is 0.6 +0.0204=0.6204. \n\nSo 0.6204 \u00d71e-6 =6.204e-7 M. \n\nThat's approximately 6.20e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. The slight difference could be due to rounding during calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b concentration? Wait, the initial concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is 0.02809 M. But when HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b deprotonates to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, the concentration of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b would decrease slightly. Let's see if that's significant. \n\nLet me denote x = [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]. Then, according to the equilibrium: \n\nHPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a \n\nThe change would be -x for HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, +x for PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, and +x for H+ (but the H+ comes from the solution, which is already buffered by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- equilibrium, so maybe the H+ is fixed, so the approximation holds). \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the exact expression, but since x is very small, the approximation [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] \u2248 0.02809 is valid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the contribution from the second dissociation? \n\nWait another thought: The question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. The only source here is the deprotonation of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can also protonate to form H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, but that's part of the buffer system. \n\nWait, but the calculation seems to give an answer very close to option A. However, the options have B as 5.48e-7. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula of the sodium salt. Let me check the formula again. The sodium salt is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The formula for disodium hydrogen phosphate is Na\u2082HPO\u2084. The 2H\u2082O is water of crystallization, which doesn't affect the dissociation. So when it dissolves, it gives 2Na+ and HPO\u2084^2- ions. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the molarity calculation for the Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O? Let me recheck:\n\nMw of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is 177.99 g/mol. \n\n1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol. Yes. \n\nSo 0.005618 /0.2 L =0.02809 M. That's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? But no, that's hydrogen phosphate. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the third dissociation's Ka, but in a different way. Let me think again. \n\nThe expression for the third dissociation is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \n\nRearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/[H+]\n\nWe have all those values. \n\nWait, so if I compute it precisely, using the exact [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.0908 = antilog(-7.0908) \n\nLet me compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. \n\nLet me write 7.0908 as 7 + 0.0908. \n\n10^-7.0908 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0908). \n\nCompute 10^(-0.0908):\n\nTake natural logs: ln(10^(-0.0908)) = -0.0908 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.0908 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2092 \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.2092 \u2248 0.811 \n\nThus, 10^-0.0908 \u22480.811 \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.811 =8.11e-8 M. \n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.11e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.11e-8: \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0562 /8.11) * 1e-6 \n\n5.0562 /8.11 \u22480.623 \n\nSo 0.623 *1e-6 =6.23e-7 \u21926.23 x10^-7 M. \n\nSo that's exactly option A. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but why is option B present? Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration of HPO\u2084^2-? \n\nWait, the sodium salt is Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. When this dissolves, each mole gives 1 mole of HPO\u2084^2-. So the molarity is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong pKa? Let me check the given Ka values. \n\nThe question says: Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, 1.8e-12. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the first deprotonation? No, that would be H3PO4 to H2PO4^- which is Ka1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? If so, then the concentration would be 0.02809 M, but that's not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the contribution from H2PO4^- losing two protons? \n\nWait, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, which is part of the buffer. But to get PO4^3-, it would need to lose another proton. So the path is H2PO4^- \u2192 HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-. \n\nThe first step is governed by Ka2, the second by Ka3. \n\nBut since the solution is a buffer at pH ~7.09, which is near pKa2 (~7.21), the concentration of HPO4^2- is about half of H2PO4^-? Wait, no, the ratio was about 0.76, which is close to 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the overall equilibrium for the third dissociation, but considering the H+ from the buffer? Which I did. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once again:\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12. \n\n[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M. \n\n[H+] is 8.1e-8. \n\nSo [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.1e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14 \n\nDenominator:8.1e-8 \n\n5.0562e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0562 /8.1) *1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.1 is approximately 0.6242. \n\nSo 0.6242e-6 \u21926.242e-7. \n\nAh! Wait a second! If I use 8.1 instead of 8.11, then 5.0562 /8.1 = exactly 0.6242. \n\nSo that gives exactly 6.242e-7, which is option A. \n\nSo the precise calculation gives exactly the value in option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. \n\nBut why is option B there? Maybe a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? \n\nWait, let me check again the Henderson-Hasselbalch step. \n\nThe buffer is between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). \n\nThe equation is pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nYes. \n\nSo with the given concentrations, the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the concentration of H+ as 1e-7, but that would give a different answer. \n\nIf someone mistakenly assumes pH=7, then [H+]=1e-7, then:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/1e-7 = (5.056e-14)/1e-7 =5.056e-7. That would be ~5.06e-7, which is close to option B (5.48e-7), but not exactly. \n\nPerhaps the error comes from using the wrong pKa? For example, if someone used pKa3 instead of considering the pH from pKa2. \n\nWait, another possible mistake: Maybe the user confused Ka2 and Ka3? Let's see. \n\nWait, the problem is asking about PO4^3-, which is the third dissociation (HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3-), so the correct Ka is Ka3. \n\nAlternatively, if someone used Ka2 instead of Ka3, then:\n\nUsing Ka2=6.2e-8, then [PO4^3-] would be (6.2e-8 * 0.02809)/8.1e-8 \u2248 (6.2*0.02809)/8.1 *1e0. \n\nWait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the expression for Ka2 is [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-] = Ka2. But for the third step, it's [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = Ka3. \n\nSo if someone mistakenly used Ka2 instead of Ka3, they might have done:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka2 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(6.2e-8 * 0.02809)/8.1e-8 = (6.2 *0.02809)/8.1 * (1e-8 /1e-8) \u2192 (0.174)/8.1 \u22480.0215 \u2192 2.15e-2? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps another error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total phosphate concentration? \n\nTotal phosphate would be the sum of all species, but the question specifically asks for PO4^3-, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in calculating the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? \n\nWait, for instance, if the ratio was taken as [acid]/[base] instead of [base]/[acid], then pH would be pKa2 + log(0.03673/0.02809)= pKa2 + log(1.308) \u22487.21 +0.117=7.327. \n\nThen pH=7.327 \u2192 [H+]=4.7e-8. \n\nThen, [PO4^3-]=(1.8e-12 *0.02809)/(4.7e-8) \n\nNumerator: 5.056e-14 \n\nDivided by 4.7e-8 \u21925.056e-14 /4.7e-8 \u22481.076e-6 \u21921.08e-6 M, which is higher than any options. \n\nHmm. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the molar masses? Let me check the molar masses again. \n\nKH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is 2*(1.008)=2.016, P is 30.97, O4 is 4*16=64. \n\nTotal: 39.1 + 2.016 +30.97 +64 = 39.1+2.016=41.116; 41.116+30.97=72.086; +64=136.086 \u2248136.09 g/mol. Correct. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na2 is 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4: H is 1.008, P 30.97, O4 64. So HPO4 is 1.008+30.97+64=95.98. The 2H2O is 2*(2*1.008 +16)=2*(18.016)=36.032. \n\nSo total molar mass is 45.98 +95.98 +36.032 =45.98+95.98=141.96 +36.032=178.0 (rounded to 177.99 as given). So that's correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct, so the answer must be A. \n\nWait the options are A)6.24e-7, which matches the precise calculation. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we first calculate the molar concentrations of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. \n\n**KH\u2082PO\u2084:**\n- Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol\n- Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007346 mol\n- Concentration = 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.03673 M (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b)\n\n**Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O:**\n- Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol\n- Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.005618 mol\n- Concentration = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.02809 M (HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b)\n\nNext, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution, which acts as a buffer between H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b (acid) and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b (base). The pKa\u2082 (for the second dissociation of H\u2083PO\u2084) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{pKa}_2 = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.21\n\\]\nUsing the concentrations:\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa}_2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{PO}_4^-]}\\right) = 7.21 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.02809}{0.03673}\\right) \\approx 7.09\n\\]\nThe hydrogen ion concentration \\([H^+]\\) is:\n\\[\n[H^+] = 10^{-7.09} \\approx 8.13 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\([PO\u2084^{3-}]\\), we use the third dissociation constant (Ka\u2083 = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2):\n\\[\nK_{a3} = \\frac{[\\text{PO}_4^{3-}][H^+]}{[\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}\n\\]\nRearranging for \\([PO\u2084^{3-}]\\):\n\\[\n[\\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \\frac{K_{a3} \\times [\\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]} = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 0.02809}{8.13 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
