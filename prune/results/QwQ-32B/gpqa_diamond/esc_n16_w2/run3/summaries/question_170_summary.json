      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron given its spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4), right? Hmm, first I should recall how to calculate the expectation value of an operator in quantum mechanics. The formula is the bra vector multiplied by the operator multiplied by the ket vector. Since spin is a two-level system, the state is a two-component vector.\n\nThe spin state here is written as (3i, 4). Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually written as a column vector. So maybe that's (3i in the first component and 4 in the second). Let me note that the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [3i; 4]. But I should make sure to normalize this vector because expectation values depend on normalized states. The question didn't mention normalization, so maybe I need to check if it's already normalized. Let me compute the norm squared first. The norm squared would be (3i)*(3i)* + 4*4. Wait, but the components are complex numbers. The first component is 3i, so its complex conjugate would be -3i. So the norm squared is (3i)* (3i) + (4)*(4). \n\nCalculating each term: (3i)* is -3i, multiplied by 3i gives (-3i)(3i) = -9i\u00b2 = -9(-1) =9. The second term is 4*4=16. So total norm squared is 9 +16=25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, to normalize the state, we divide by 5. So the normalized state vector is (3i/5, 4/5). \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, maybe they just gave the state as a non-normalized vector? Hmm, the question says \"the spin state (3i, 4)\". I think in such cases, unless stated otherwise, we can assume it's a normalized vector. Wait, but when I calculated the norm, it was 25, so the norm squared is 25, which is (5)^2. So the actual normalized vector would be each component divided by 5. But maybe the question expects us to use the given vector as is, even if not normalized? Hmm, but expectation values depend on the state's normalization. Because expectation value \u27e8S_y\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8|S_y|\u03c8\u27e9. So perhaps we need to use the given vector, but maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized? Wait, but the norm squared is 25, so unless they are using a different notation, like the components are already normalized, but that's not the case here. So I think I should proceed with the normalized vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem just wants the expectation value without considering normalization. Wait, but in physics, expectation values are calculated with normalized states. So I think we have to normalize it. Let me go with that approach.\n\nSo first, normalize the state. The normalized vector is (3i/5, 4/5). \n\nNow, the spin operator along y is given as \u03c3_y matrix. The matrix for S_y is (\u03c3_y) multiplied by \u0127/2, right? Because the Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z are the spin operators divided by \u0127/2. Wait, the standard formula is that the spin operator S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3_y. So the expectation value would be (\u0127/2) multiplied by the expectation value of \u03c3_y in the given state.\n\nSo first, compute \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9, then multiply by \u0127/2 to get S_y.\n\nThe \u03c3_y matrix is given as:\n\n\u03c3_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c3_y | \u03c8\u27e9, where |\u03c8\u27e9 is the normalized vector (3i/5, 4/5). The bra vector \u27e8\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9, so that's ( -3i/5 , 4/5 ). Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. \n\nSo let's write this out step by step. \n\nFirst, let me denote the components:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [\u03c8\u2081; \u03c8\u2082] = [ (3i)/5 ; 4/5 ]\n\n\u27e8\u03c8| = [ \u03c8\u2081*, \u03c8\u2082* ] = [ (-3i)/5, 4/5 ]\n\nNow, the matrix multiplication is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9. Let's compute \u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9 first.\n\nMultiplying \u03c3_y with |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8\u27e9 = [0*(-3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ] ?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication. Let me write it properly. \n\nThe first component of \u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9 is (0 * \u03c8\u2081) + (-i)*\u03c8\u2082. The second component is (i * \u03c8\u2081) + (0 * \u03c8\u2082).\n\nSo:\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i)/5 = (3i\u00b2)/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.\n\nTherefore, \u03c3_y |\u03c8\u27e9 is the vector [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ].\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8| multiplied by this vector. \n\n\u27e8\u03c8| is [ -3i/5 , 4/5 ].\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n(-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2 ) /25. Since i\u00b2 is -1, so this becomes 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = (-12)/25.\n\nAdding both terms: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25.\n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 is -24/25.\n\nThen, the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2)*\u27e8\u03c3_y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-24 \u0127)/(50) = simplifies to (-12 \u0127)/25.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is -12 hbar over 25, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my steps to be sure.\n\nWait, let me go through the calculation again because sometimes signs can be tricky with complex numbers.\n\nFirst, the components:\n\nThe state vector after normalization is (3i/5, 4/5).\n\nThe conjugate transpose (bra vector) is (-3i/5, 4/5).\n\nMultiplying \u03c3_y with the ket:\n\nFirst component of \u03c3_y |\u03c8> is 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5). So that's -i*(4/5) = -4i/5. Correct.\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5). The term is i*(3i/5) = 3i\u00b2/5 = -3/5. Correct.\n\nThen, the bra vector times this result:\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2)/25 \u2192 -12/25.\n\nSecond term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25. \n\nTotal is indeed -24/25. So yes. Then multiplied by \u0127/2 gives -12\u0127/25. Which matches option A.\n\nWait, but hold on. The question might have a different convention for the spin operator. Let me confirm the definition of S_y. The standard is S_y = (\u0127/2)\u03c3_y. So the calculation is correct. So the answer is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the expectation value of the electron's spin along the y-direction, S_y. The electron is given in the spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, right, spin states are usually represented as vectors, and the expectation value involves using the Pauli matrices. The question mentions the \u03c3_y matrix, which is given as a 2x2 matrix with entries 0, -i, i, 0. \n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator in quantum mechanics is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying it by the operator matrix, and then multiplying by the original state vector. So for S_y, since the spin operator S_y is (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y, the expectation value should be (\u0127/2) multiplied by the expectation of \u03c3_y in this state.\n\nWait, the problem might just want the answer in terms of \u0127, so I should keep track of that factor. Let me make sure I get the steps right. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. So the state vector |\u03c8> is [3i; 4], right? But to compute the expectation value, I need to use the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i (since the complex conjugate of i is -i), and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So the bra vector <\u03c8| would be [-3i, 4].\n\nNow, the matrix \u03c3_y is:\n[ 0   -i ]\n[ i    0 ]\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3_y is <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8>. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply \u03c3_y with the state vector |\u03c8>:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4 ; i*(3i) + 0*4 ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, let me correct that. Wait, when multiplying matrices, the order matters. The calculation is \u03c3_y times the column vector. Let's see:\n\nThe first entry of \u03c3_y times |\u03c8> is (0)*(first component of |\u03c8>) + (-i)*(second component of |\u03c8>). The first component of |\u03c8> is 3i, the second is 4. So first entry is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.\n\nThe second entry is (i)*(first component) + 0*(second component) = i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, so that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo \u03c3_y|\u03c8> is the column vector [-4i; -3].\n\nThen, the bra vector <\u03c8| is [-3i, 4], so when we take the inner product with this resulting vector, we have:\n\n[-3i, 4] \u2022 [-4i; -3] = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).\n\nLet me compute each term. \n\nFirst term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) = -12.\n\nAdding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24. \n\nWait, so the expectation value of \u03c3_y is -24? But that can't be right because the options are in terms of hbar over 25 or something. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me check again step by step. \n\nFirst, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). So the column vector is:\n\n|\u03c8> = [3i]\n       [4 ]\n\nSo when we multiply \u03c3_y (which is the matrix) with this vector:\n\nFirst component of \u03c3_y * |\u03c8> is 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i. Correct.\n\nSecond component is i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i\u00b2 = -3. Correct.\n\nSo the resulting vector after \u03c3_y |\u03c8> is indeed [-4i; -3].\n\nThen the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8>. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, conjugate of 4 is 4. So the row vector is [-3i, 4].\n\nNow, the inner product:\n\nFirst element: (-3i)*(-4i) = (12 i\u00b2) = 12*(-1) = -12.\n\nSecond element: 4*(-3) = -12. So total is -12 + (-12) = -24. Hmm, so that's the expectation value of \u03c3_y, which is <\u03c3_y>.\n\nBut the question is asking for S_y, which is (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y. So the expectation value of S_y would be (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127. But wait, the options have hbar over 25. Wait, maybe I missed a normalization factor?\n\nOh right! The state vector must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must add up to 1. So the state (3i,4) might not be normalized. Let me check that.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25) =5. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/5)*(3i,4). So I need to normalize the vector before computing the expectation value.\n\nAh, that's probably where I messed up. The given state isn't normalized. So I need to use the normalized state. Let me recalculate everything with the normalized vector.\n\nThe normalized state is (1/5)*(3i,4). So the column vector is (3i/5, 4/5). Let me redo the calculation with that.\n\nSo |\u03c8> = [ (3i)/5 ]\n         [  4/5 ]\n\nThen, the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose, so:\n\n[ -3i/5 , 4/5 ]\n\nNow, compute \u03c3_y * |\u03c8>:\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (i * 3i)/5 = (3i\u00b2)/5 = -3/5.\n\nSo \u03c3_y |\u03c8> is the vector [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nNow, the inner product <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> is:\n\n[ -3i/5 , 4/5 ] \u2022 [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2)/25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = (-12)/25.\n\nAdding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3_y is -24/25. \n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option A: -12 hbar over 25. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option A is -12 hbar /25, which matches. But hold on, the problem statement says \"Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\" So S_y is indeed (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y, so multiplying by 1/2. Let me confirm the calculation again:\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_y was -24/25. Then S_y = (\u0127/2)(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. So yes, that's option A. \n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I forgot to normalize the vector. So that's critical. So the correct answer should be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the expectation value of the electron's spin along the y-direction, S_y. The electron is given in the spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, right, spin states are usually represented as vectors, and the expectation value involves using the Pauli matrices. The question mentions the \u03c3_y matrix, which is given as a 2x2 matrix with entries 0, -i, i, 0. \n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator in quantum mechanics is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying it by the operator matrix, and then multiplying by the original state vector. So for S_y, since the spin operator S_y is (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y, the expectation value should be (\u0127/2) multiplied by the expectation of \u03c3_y in this state.\n\nWait, the problem might just want the answer in terms of \u0127, so I should keep track of that factor. Let me make sure I get the steps right. The spin state is given as (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. So the state vector |\u03c8> is [3i; 4], right? But to compute the expectation value, I need to use the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i (since the complex conjugate of i is -i), and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So the bra vector <\u03c8| would be [-3i, 4].\n\nNow, the matrix \u03c3_y is:\n[ 0   -i ]\n[ i    0 ]\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3_y is <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8>. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply \u03c3_y with the state vector |\u03c8>:\n\n\u03c3_y * |\u03c8> = [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4 ; i*(3i) + 0*4 ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, let me correct that. Wait, when multiplying matrices, the order matters. The calculation is \u03c3_y times the column vector. Let's see:\n\nThe first entry of \u03c3_y times |\u03c8> is (0)*(first component of |\u03c8>) + (-i)*(second component of |\u03c8>). The first component of |\u03c8> is 3i, the second is 4. So first entry is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.\n\nThe second entry is (i)*(first component) + 0*(second component) = i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, so that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.\n\nSo \u03c3_y|\u03c8> is the column vector [-4i; -3].\n\nThen, the bra vector <\u03c8| is [-3i, 4], so when we take the inner product with this resulting vector, we have:\n\n[-3i, 4] \u2022 [-4i; -3] = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).\n\nLet me compute each term. \n\nFirst term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i\u00b2. Since i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.\n\nSecond term: 4*(-3) = -12.\n\nAdding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24. \n\nWait, so the expectation value of \u03c3_y is -24? But that can't be right because the options are in terms of hbar over 25 or something. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me check again step by step. \n\nFirst, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). So the column vector is:\n\n|\u03c8> = [3i]\n       [4 ]\n\nSo when we multiply \u03c3_y (which is the matrix) with this vector:\n\nFirst component of \u03c3_y * |\u03c8> is 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i. Correct.\n\nSecond component is i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i\u00b2 = -3. Correct.\n\nSo the resulting vector after \u03c3_y |\u03c8> is indeed [-4i; -3].\n\nThen the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8>. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, conjugate of 4 is 4. So the row vector is [-3i, 4].\n\nNow, the inner product:\n\nFirst element: (-3i)*(-4i) = (12 i\u00b2) = 12*(-1) = -12.\n\nSecond element: 4*(-3) = -12. So total is -12 + (-12) = -24. Hmm, so that's the expectation value of \u03c3_y, which is <\u03c3_y>.\n\nBut the question is asking for S_y, which is (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y. So the expectation value of S_y would be (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127. But wait, the options have hbar over 25. Wait, maybe I missed a normalization factor?\n\nOh right! The state vector must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must add up to 1. So the state (3i,4) might not be normalized. Let me check that.\n\nThe norm squared is |3i|\u00b2 + |4|\u00b2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25) =5. Therefore, the actual state vector is (1/5)*(3i,4). So I need to normalize the vector before computing the expectation value.\n\nAh, that's probably where I messed up. The given state isn't normalized. So I need to use the normalized state. Let me recalculate everything with the normalized vector.\n\nThe normalized state is (1/5)*(3i,4). So the column vector is (3i/5, 4/5). Let me redo the calculation with that.\n\nSo |\u03c8> = [ (3i)/5 ]\n         [  4/5 ]\n\nThen, the bra vector <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose, so:\n\n[ -3i/5 , 4/5 ]\n\nNow, compute \u03c3_y * |\u03c8>:\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.\n\nSecond component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (i * 3i)/5 = (3i\u00b2)/5 = -3/5.\n\nSo \u03c3_y |\u03c8> is the vector [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nNow, the inner product <\u03c8|\u03c3_y|\u03c8> is:\n\n[ -3i/5 , 4/5 ] \u2022 [ -4i/5 ; -3/5 ]\n\nFirst term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i\u00b2)/25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.\n\nSecond term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = (-12)/25.\n\nAdding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.\n\nSo the expectation value of \u03c3_y is -24/25. \n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_y is (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option A: -12 hbar over 25. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option A is -12 hbar /25, which matches. But hold on, the problem statement says \"Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\" So S_y is indeed (\u0127/2) times \u03c3_y, so multiplying by 1/2. Let me confirm the calculation again:\n\nThe expectation value of \u03c3_y was -24/25. Then S_y = (\u0127/2)(-24/25) = (-12 \u0127)/25. So yes, that's option A. \n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I forgot to normalize the vector. So that's critical.
