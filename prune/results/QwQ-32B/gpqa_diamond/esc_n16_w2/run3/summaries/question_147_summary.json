      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A given the reaction p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b, and that the mass of A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Hmm, I need to recall how to approach annihilation reactions and conservation laws here.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles or energy. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is probably very small, so maybe we can approximate its total energy as just its rest mass energy. The same goes for the proton, right? Because protons and antiprotons have the same mass. So the total initial energy should be the sum of their rest masses. \n\nThe proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So adding those together, the total initial energy would be 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so we can consider the total energy as just the rest mass energy of both particles. \n\nNow, the products are two A\u207a and two A\u207b particles. Each of these has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Since there are four particles (2+ and 2-), each with mass m_A, their total rest mass energy would be 4 * m_A c\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. \n\nWait a second, the initial energy is 1876 MeV, but the rest mass energy of the products is only 1200 MeV. That means there's some extra energy that must be in the form of kinetic energy of the particles. Because energy is conserved, so the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) of the products must equal the initial energy. \n\nSo the total energy of the products is 1876 MeV. The rest mass energy is 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy must be 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. But how does this relate to the velocity of each particle?\n\nHmm, each particle's total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since there are four particles, their total energy would be 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. Setting that equal to the initial energy gives:\n\n4 * gamma * (300 MeV) = 1876 MeV\n\nWait, solving for gamma here. Let's see:\n\ngamma = (1876) / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.5633. Now, the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So we can solve for v.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me write gamma as:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma\n\nThen, 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/(gamma)^2\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma)^2\n\nPlugging in gamma \u22481.5633, let me compute 1/(1.5633)^2 first. Let's calculate 1.5633 squared. \n\n1.5633 squared is approximately (1.5)^2 = 2.25, but more accurately:\n\n1.5633 * 1.5633. Let's compute:\n\n1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25\n\n1.5 * 0.0633 = ~0.09495\n\n0.0633 *1.5 = same, so total for cross terms is 2*0.09495 \u2248 0.1899\n\nThen 0.0633 squared is ~0.004, so total is 2.25 + 0.1899 +0.004 \u2248 2.4439. Wait, actually that's perhaps not the right way. Maybe better to do 1.5633^2:\n\nLet me compute 1.5633 squared:\n\n(1.5633)^2 = (1 + 0.5633)^2 = 1 + 2*0.5633 + (0.5633)^2\n\n= 1 + 1.1266 + 0.3173 \u2248 1 + 1.1266 is 2.1266 +0.3173 \u2248 2.4439.\n\nSo 1/(gamma squared) is 1/2.4439 \u2248 0.409.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.409 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.591).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.591). Let's see, sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746. Since 0.591 is a bit less than 0.6, maybe around 0.769? Let me compute 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, wait, 0.77^2 = 0.5929, which is very close to 0.591. So the square root is approximately 0.77. Therefore, v \u2248 0.77c. Wait, but that's option A. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but the question is about the velocity of particle A. However, I might have made an error in assuming that all four particles have the same gamma. Since they are produced in pairs, maybe their momenta are balanced? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since the proton and antiproton are annihilating, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so we can assume the initial momentum is approximately zero? Because the proton's momentum and antiproton's are opposite. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its momentum is small, so the total initial momentum is negligible. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must be zero. \n\nTherefore, the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions. But each pair (A+ and A-) must have equal and opposite momenta? Not sure. But in any case, the total momentum is zero, so the particles must be moving symmetrically.\n\nBut for the energy, the total energy is conserved. The initial rest energy is 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The products have four particles each of mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so their total rest mass energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV, so the remaining energy must be kinetic. \n\nBut when calculating gamma, since each particle's energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, and there are four of them, so total energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV. So yes, that's how I got gamma \u22481.5633. Then, v \u22480.77c, which would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.91c (C) and others. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the gamma:\n\nTotal energy of products: 4 * gamma * m_A c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV\n\nm_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV. So 4 * gamma * 300 = 4*300 gamma = 1200 gamma = 1876\n\nSo gamma = 1876 /1200 \u22481.5633. Correct. \n\nThen gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSo sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/1.5633 \u22480.64. \n\nWait, wait, 1 divided by 1.5633 is approximately 0.64. Wait, sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)=0.64 \u2192 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 0.4096 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2=1-0.4096=0.5904 \u2192 v/c= sqrt(0.5904)= approx 0.768. So 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c. So that's option A. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made an error in the assumption that all four particles have the same gamma? Because if the particles are moving in pairs with opposite momenta, their energies would have to add up. But since the total momentum is zero, perhaps each pair has the same velocity but opposite direction? \n\nWait, but the gamma is the same for each particle because they all have the same mass and presumably the same speed (since they are produced symmetrically). So their energies are the same, so gamma would be same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the initial energy. Wait, the proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So their rest energy is 938 each. The total rest energy is indeed 1876. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the antiproton's kinetic energy isn't negligible? The question says the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". So maybe the proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is considered at rest? Because in annihilation reactions, sometimes one particle is at rest. \n\nWait, the problem states \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. But if it's moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible. So the total initial energy would be the proton's rest mass (938) plus the antiproton's rest mass (938) plus the antiproton's kinetic energy (which is small). So the initial energy is approximately 1876, so that part is okay. \n\nTherefore, the calculation should be correct. Then the answer would be A) 0.77c. But the options given include that as option A. Hmm, but I recall sometimes in these problems, when the total energy is calculated, you have to consider the momentum terms. Wait, but in this case, since the total momentum is zero, all the energy is rest plus kinetic, so maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the number of particles? The reaction produces 2A+ and 2A-. So four particles total. Each with mass 300. So yes, 4 * 300 is 1200. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using relativistic energy-momentum relation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy per particle is (gamma -1)*m c\u00b2. So total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma -1)*m c\u00b2. \n\nBut the total energy is 4 gamma m c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the options given include 0.91c (C) and 0.96c (B). Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again the gamma value. \n\nWait, 1876 divided by 1200 is exactly 1.563333...\n\nSo gamma is 1.563333...\n\nThen, 1/gamma squared is (1/1.563333)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 1.563333 squared:\n\nLet me compute 1.563333^2:\n\nFirst, 1.56 squared is 2.4336. \n\nThen 0.003333 added to 1.56 gives 1.563333. The exact calculation:\n\n(1.56 + 0.003333)^2 = (1.56)^2 + 2*1.56*(0.003333) + (0.003333)^2 \u2248 2.4336 + 0.0104 + 0.000011 \u2248 2.444. \n\nSo 1/(1.56333)^2 = 1/2.444 \u22480.409. \n\nThen 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.409 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.591 \u2192 v = sqrt(0.591)c. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is sqrt(0.59) is approx 0.768, yes. 0.768c is 0.77c when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nHmm, so why is option C 0.91c? That's a higher velocity. Maybe I messed up the rest mass? Wait, the problem says m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So m_A is 300/(c\u00b2). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy. Wait, proton and antiproton masses are 938 each. So total rest energy is 1876. But if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, does that contribute? The problem says it's slowly moving, so its kinetic energy is negligible. So initial energy is approx 1876. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so their total momentum is the momentum of the antiproton. But then the products must have the same momentum? Wait, but the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, so its momentum is small. Maybe the total momentum is negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, the antiproton's velocity is small. So the total momentum is approximately equal to the antiproton's momentum. But since it's slow, maybe the momentum is negligible, so the center of mass is approximately at rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the calculation of gamma. Let me think differently. \n\nThe total energy is 4 gamma m c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nSo gamma = (1876)/(4*300) = 1876/1200 = 1.563333...\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.5633. \n\nThen, to find v, let's compute beta = v/c. \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)\n\nSo, solving for beta:\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nSo, 1/gamma squared is 1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 0.409. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is approximately 0.768. So beta \u22480.768, so v \u22480.77c. \n\nHmm, so that's option A. But why is there an option C at 0.91? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy? Let me check the mass of the proton and antiproton again. \n\nWait, the proton mass is indeed about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Let me confirm that. Yes, the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. So 2 of them would be 1876. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the antiproton's kinetic energy is zero, so the initial energy is just twice the proton mass. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the invariant quantity. The total energy squared minus the momentum squared times c\u00b2 should be equal on both sides. \n\nIn the initial frame, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total momentum is negligible. So initial momentum is approximately zero. So the invariant quantity (E_initial)^2 = (p_initial c)^2 + (total rest mass energy)^2. But since p_initial is negligible, then (E_initial)^2 \u2248 (total rest mass energy)^2. \n\nOn the product side, the total energy is E_products = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. The total momentum of the products is zero (since they have to cancel out), so the invariant quantity is (E_products)^2 = (total rest mass energy)^2 + (momentum)^2 c\u00b2. But since momentum is zero, then (E_products)^2 must equal (total rest mass energy of products)^2. Wait, but that can't be because the products have kinetic energy. \n\nHmm, maybe that approach is conflicting. Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe invariant quantity for the system is the same on both sides. \n\nSo, (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 = (E_products)^2 - (p_products c)^2 \n\nSince the initial momentum is negligible, p_initial \u22480, so E_initial \u2248 sqrt( (total rest mass energy)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) \u2248 total rest mass energy. \n\nOn the product side, E_products must equal E_initial, so E_products = E_initial. \n\nAlso, the product's total momentum squared times c squared is (E_products)^2 - (total rest mass energy of products)^2. \n\nBut since the total momentum of the products must be zero (since the initial momentum was zero), then that implies that (E_products)^2 = (total rest mass energy of products)^2. But that would require that E_products equals the rest mass energy of the products, which would mean no kinetic energy. But that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, so this must mean that my assumption that the initial momentum is zero is wrong? Because otherwise, this would require that the products have zero kinetic energy, but that's not possible because the initial energy is higher than the products' rest mass. \n\nHmm, so maybe the initial momentum isn't zero. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Let's assume the proton is at rest. Then the antiproton has some small momentum p, so the total initial momentum is p. The products must then have a total momentum p in the same direction. \n\nBut how does that affect the energy? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the antiproton is moving slowly enough that its kinetic energy is negligible, but its momentum is not negligible. Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, momentum p \u2248 mv, and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. If the speed is small, then the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. So maybe the momentum is small compared to the rest mass energy divided by c? Because p = gamma m v. But if v is small, then gamma \u22481, so p \u2248 m v. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the initial momentum is zero. So that the total energy is the sum of the rest masses. Therefore, the calculation leading to option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider that the total energy is (proton rest + antiproton rest) plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Wait, but if it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is still 1876. \n\nHmm, maybe I should check if the answer is A, but the options have another answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of particles. Let me check again. \n\nThe reaction produces 2A+ and 2A\u2212. So four particles. Each of mass 300. So total rest mass energy 1200. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the kinetic energy per particle. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nSo per particle, that's 676 /4 = 169 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c\u00b2 = 169 MeV. \n\nSo (gamma -1)*300 = 169 \u2192 gamma = 1 + 169/300 \u22481 + 0.5633 = 1.5633. \n\nSame gamma as before. \n\nSo, same result. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma formula. \n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, solving for v:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). \n\nSo, plugging in gamma =1.5633:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 \u22480.409. \n\nSo 1-0.409=0.591. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is approx 0.769. \n\nSo 0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm, but the options include 0.91c. Maybe I need to recheck the problem statement again. \n\nWait, the question says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". Maybe I should consider that the proton is moving? Or perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small momentum. \n\nWait, in that case, the total momentum of the system is the momentum of the antiproton. The products must have the same momentum. \n\nHmm, but then the energy would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a frame where the proton is moving and the antiproton is stationary? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the particles are emitted with equal and opposite momenta. For example, each pair (A+ and A-) moves in opposite directions. \n\nWait, but with four particles, maybe they form two pairs each moving in opposite directions. \n\nThe total momentum must be zero, so the momentum vectors must cancel. \n\nBut each particle has momentum p = gamma m v. \n\nAssuming they are moving in pairs with opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. \n\nBut the energy is additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all four particles are moving in the same direction? No, that would give net momentum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the velocity calculation is correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like energy conservation considering relativistic expressions. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. \n\nThe total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, since they are at rest? Wait, no, the antiproton is slowly moving. \n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so total energy is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe total energy must be equal to the sum of the energies of the four particles. \n\nEach particle has energy gamma * m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSo 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nWhich gives the same gamma as before. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is A) 0.77c. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me compute sqrt(0.591) more precisely. \n\n0.768 squared is 0.59, so 0.768c. \n\nWait, let me compute 0.768 squared: \n\n0.768^2 = (0.7 + 0.068)^2 = 0.7^2 + 2*0.7*0.068 +0.068\u00b2 = 0.49 + 0.0952 +0.004624 = 0.49 +0.0952 is 0.5852 +0.004624 is 0.5898. So that's very close to 0.591. \n\nSo sqrt(0.591) is about 0.769. \n\nThus, the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. Since the options are given, and A is 0.77c, that's the correct choice. \n\nSo I think the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A given the reaction p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b, and that the mass of A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Hmm, I need to recall how to approach annihilation reactions and conservation laws here.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles or energy. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is probably very small, so maybe we can approximate its total energy as just its rest mass energy. The same goes for the proton, right? Because protons and antiprotons have the same mass. So the total initial energy should be the sum of their rest masses. \n\nThe proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So adding those together, the total initial energy would be 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so we can consider the total energy as just the rest mass energy of both particles. \n\nNow, the products are two A\u207a and two A\u207b particles. Each of these has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. Since there are four particles (2+ and 2-), each with mass m_A, their total rest mass energy would be 4 * m_A c\u00b2. Let me calculate that: 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. \n\nWait a second, the initial energy is 1876 MeV, but the rest mass energy of the products is only 1200 MeV. That means there's some extra energy that must be in the form of kinetic energy of the particles. Because energy is conserved, so the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) of the products must equal the initial energy. \n\nSo the total energy of the products is 1876 MeV. The rest mass energy is 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy must be 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. But how does this relate to the velocity of each particle?\n\nHmm, each particle's total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since there are four particles, their total energy would be 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. Setting that equal to the initial energy gives:\n\n4 * gamma * (300 MeV) = 1876 MeV\n\nWait, solving for gamma here. Let's see:\n\ngamma = (1876) / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633...\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.5633. Now, the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So we can solve for v.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me write gamma as:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma\n\nThen, 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/(gamma)^2\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma)^2\n\nPlugging in gamma \u22481.5633, let me compute 1/(1.5633)^2 first. Let's calculate 1.5633 squared. \n\n1.5633 squared is approximately (1.5)^2 = 2.25, but more accurately:\n\n1.5633 * 1.5633. Let's compute:\n\n1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25\n\n1.5 * 0.0633 = ~0.09495\n\n0.0633 *1.5 = same, so total for cross terms is 2*0.09495 \u2248 0.1899\n\nThen 0.0633 squared is ~0.004, so total is 2.25 + 0.1899 +0.004 \u2248 2.4439. Wait, actually that's perhaps not the right way. Maybe better to do 1.5633^2:\n\nLet me compute 1.5633 squared:\n\n(1.5633)^2 = (1 + 0.5633)^2 = 1 + 2*0.5633 + (0.5633)^2\n\n= 1 + 1.1266 + 0.3173 \u2248 1 + 1.1266 is 2.1266 +0.3173 \u2248 2.4439.\n\nSo 1/(gamma squared) is 1/2.4439 \u2248 0.409.\n\nSo 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.409 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.591).\n\nCalculating sqrt(0.591). Let's see, sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746. Since 0.591 is a bit less than 0.6, maybe around 0.769? Let me compute 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, wait, 0.77^2 = 0.5929, which is very close to 0.591. So the square root is approximately 0.77. Therefore, v \u2248 0.77c. Wait, but that's option A. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but the question is about the velocity of particle A. However, I might have made an error in assuming that all four particles have the same gamma. Since they are produced in pairs, maybe their momenta are balanced? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. Since the proton and antiproton are annihilating, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so we can assume the initial momentum is approximately zero? Because the proton's momentum and antiproton's are opposite. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its momentum is small, so the total initial momentum is negligible. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must be zero. \n\nTherefore, the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions. But each pair (A+ and A-) must have equal and opposite momenta? Not sure. But in any case, the total momentum is zero, so the particles must be moving symmetrically.\n\nBut for the energy, the total energy is conserved. The initial rest energy is 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The products have four particles each of mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so their total rest mass energy is 4*300 = 1200 MeV, so the remaining energy must be kinetic. \n\nBut when calculating gamma, since each particle's energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2, and there are four of them, so total energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV. So yes, that's how I got gamma \u22481.5633. Then, v \u22480.77c, which would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.91c (C) and others. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the gamma:\n\nTotal energy of products: 4 * gamma * m_A c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV\n\nm_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV. So 4 * gamma * 300 = 4*300 gamma = 1200 gamma = 1876\n\nSo gamma = 1876 /1200 \u22481.5633. Correct. \n\nThen gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSo sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/1.5633 \u22480.64. \n\nWait, wait, 1 divided by 1.5633 is approximately 0.64. Wait, sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)=0.64 \u2192 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 0.4096 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2=1-0.4096=0.5904 \u2192 v/c= sqrt(0.5904)= approx 0.768. So 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c. So that's option A. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made an error in the assumption that all four particles have the same gamma? Because if the particles are moving in pairs with opposite momenta, their energies would have to add up. But since the total momentum is zero, perhaps each pair has the same velocity but opposite direction? \n\nWait, but the gamma is the same for each particle because they all have the same mass and presumably the same speed (since they are produced symmetrically). So their energies are the same, so gamma would be same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the initial energy. Wait, the proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So their rest energy is 938 each. The total rest energy is indeed 1876. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the antiproton's kinetic energy isn't negligible? The question says the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". So maybe the proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is considered at rest? Because in annihilation reactions, sometimes one particle is at rest. \n\nWait, the problem states \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. But if it's moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible. So the total initial energy would be the proton's rest mass (938) plus the antiproton's rest mass (938) plus the antiproton's kinetic energy (which is small). So the initial energy is approximately 1876, so that part is okay. \n\nTherefore, the calculation should be correct. Then the answer would be A) 0.77c. But the options given include that as option A. Hmm, but I recall sometimes in these problems, when the total energy is calculated, you have to consider the momentum terms. Wait, but in this case, since the total momentum is zero, all the energy is rest plus kinetic, so maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the number of particles? The reaction produces 2A+ and 2A-. So four particles total. Each with mass 300. So yes, 4 * 300 is 1200. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using relativistic energy-momentum relation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy per particle is (gamma -1)*m c\u00b2. So total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma -1)*m c\u00b2. \n\nBut the total energy is 4 gamma m c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the options given include 0.91c (C) and 0.96c (B). Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again the gamma value. \n\nWait, 1876 divided by 1200 is exactly 1.563333...\n\nSo gamma is 1.563333...\n\nThen, 1/gamma squared is (1/1.563333)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 1.563333 squared:\n\nLet me compute 1.563333^2:\n\nFirst, 1.56 squared is 2.4336. \n\nThen 0.003333 added to 1.56 gives 1.563333. The exact calculation:\n\n(1.56 + 0.003333)^2 = (1.56)^2 + 2*1.56*(0.003333) + (0.003333)^2 \u2248 2.4336 + 0.0104 + 0.000011 \u2248 2.444. \n\nSo 1/(1.56333)^2 = 1/2.444 \u22480.409. \n\nThen 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.409 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.591 \u2192 v = sqrt(0.591)c. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is sqrt(0.59) is approx 0.768, yes. 0.768c is 0.77c when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nHmm, so why is option C 0.91c? That's a higher velocity. Maybe I messed up the rest mass? Wait, the problem says m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So m_A is 300/(c\u00b2). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy. Wait, proton and antiproton masses are 938 each. So total rest energy is 1876. But if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, does that contribute? The problem says it's slowly moving, so its kinetic energy is negligible. So initial energy is approx 1876. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so their total momentum is the momentum of the antiproton. But then the products must have the same momentum? Wait, but the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, so its momentum is small. Maybe the total momentum is negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, the antiproton's velocity is small. So the total momentum is approximately equal to the antiproton's momentum. But since it's slow, maybe the momentum is negligible, so the center of mass is approximately at rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the calculation of gamma. Let me think differently. \n\nThe total energy is 4 gamma m c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nSo gamma = (1876)/(4*300) = 1876/1200 = 1.563333...\n\nSo, gamma is about 1.5633. \n\nThen, to find v, let's compute beta = v/c. \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta\u00b2)\n\nSo, solving for beta:\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nSo, 1/gamma squared is 1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 0.409. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is approximately 0.768. So beta \u22480.768, so v \u22480.77c. \n\nHmm, so that's option A. But why is there an option C at 0.91? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial energy? Let me check the mass of the proton and antiproton again. \n\nWait, the proton mass is indeed about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Let me confirm that. Yes, the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. So 2 of them would be 1876. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the antiproton's kinetic energy is zero, so the initial energy is just twice the proton mass. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the invariant quantity. The total energy squared minus the momentum squared times c\u00b2 should be equal on both sides. \n\nIn the initial frame, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total momentum is negligible. So initial momentum is approximately zero. So the invariant quantity (E_initial)^2 = (p_initial c)^2 + (total rest mass energy)^2. But since p_initial is negligible, then (E_initial)^2 \u2248 (total rest mass energy)^2. \n\nOn the product side, the total energy is E_products = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. The total momentum of the products is zero (since they have to cancel out), so the invariant quantity is (E_products)^2 = (total rest mass energy)^2 + (momentum)^2 c\u00b2. But since momentum is zero, then (E_products)^2 must equal (total rest mass energy of products)^2. Wait, but that can't be because the products have kinetic energy. \n\nHmm, maybe that approach is conflicting. Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe invariant quantity for the system is the same on both sides. \n\nSo, (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 = (E_products)^2 - (p_products c)^2 \n\nSince the initial momentum is negligible, p_initial \u22480, so E_initial \u2248 sqrt( (total rest mass energy)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) \u2248 total rest mass energy. \n\nOn the product side, E_products must equal E_initial, so E_products = E_initial. \n\nAlso, the product's total momentum squared times c squared is (E_products)^2 - (total rest mass energy of products)^2. \n\nBut since the total momentum of the products must be zero (since the initial momentum was zero), then that implies that (E_products)^2 = (total rest mass energy of products)^2. But that would require that E_products equals the rest mass energy of the products, which would mean no kinetic energy. But that's a contradiction. \n\nWait, so this must mean that my assumption that the initial momentum is zero is wrong? Because otherwise, this would require that the products have zero kinetic energy, but that's not possible because the initial energy is higher than the products' rest mass. \n\nHmm, so maybe the initial momentum isn't zero. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Let's assume the proton is at rest. Then the antiproton has some small momentum p, so the total initial momentum is p. The products must then have a total momentum p in the same direction. \n\nBut how does that affect the energy? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the antiproton is moving slowly enough that its kinetic energy is negligible, but its momentum is not negligible. Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, momentum p \u2248 mv, and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2. If the speed is small, then the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. So maybe the momentum is small compared to the rest mass energy divided by c? Because p = gamma m v. But if v is small, then gamma \u22481, so p \u2248 m v. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the initial momentum is zero. So that the total energy is the sum of the rest masses. Therefore, the calculation leading to option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider that the total energy is (proton rest + antiproton rest) plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Wait, but if it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is still 1876. \n\nHmm, maybe I should check if the answer is A, but the options have another answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of particles. Let me check again. \n\nThe reaction produces 2A+ and 2A\u2212. So four particles. Each of mass 300. So total rest mass energy 1200. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the kinetic energy per particle. \n\nThe total kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nSo per particle, that's 676 /4 = 169 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c\u00b2 = 169 MeV. \n\nSo (gamma -1)*300 = 169 \u2192 gamma = 1 + 169/300 \u22481 + 0.5633 = 1.5633. \n\nSame gamma as before. \n\nSo, same result. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma formula. \n\nGamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, solving for v:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). \n\nSo, plugging in gamma =1.5633:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 \u22480.409. \n\nSo 1-0.409=0.591. \n\nsqrt(0.591) is approx 0.769. \n\nSo 0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm, but the options include 0.91c. Maybe I need to recheck the problem statement again. \n\nWait, the question says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". Maybe I should consider that the proton is moving? Or perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small momentum. \n\nWait, in that case, the total momentum of the system is the momentum of the antiproton. The products must have the same momentum. \n\nHmm, but then the energy would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a frame where the proton is moving and the antiproton is stationary? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the particles are emitted with equal and opposite momenta. For example, each pair (A+ and A-) moves in opposite directions. \n\nWait, but with four particles, maybe they form two pairs each moving in opposite directions. \n\nThe total momentum must be zero, so the momentum vectors must cancel. \n\nBut each particle has momentum p = gamma m v. \n\nAssuming they are moving in pairs with opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. \n\nBut the energy is additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all four particles are moving in the same direction? No, that would give net momentum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the velocity calculation is correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like energy conservation considering relativistic expressions. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. \n\nThe total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, since they are at rest? Wait, no, the antiproton is slowly moving. \n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so total energy is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe total energy must be equal to the sum of the energies of the four particles. \n\nEach particle has energy gamma * m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSo 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 1876. \n\nWhich gives the same gamma as before. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is A) 0.77c. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me compute sqrt(0.591) more precisely. \n\n0.768 squared is 0.59, so 0.768c. \n\nWait, let me compute 0.768 squared: \n\n0.768^2 = (0.7 + 0.068)^2 = 0.7^2 + 2*0.7*0.068 +0.068\u00b2 = 0.49 + 0.0952 +0.004624 = 0.49 +0.0952 is 0.5852 +0.004624 is 0.5898. So that's very close to 0.591. \n\nSo sqrt(0.591) is about 0.769. \n\nThus, the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. Since the options are given, and A is 0.77c, that's the correct choice. \n\nSo I think the answer is A.\n\n\nThe annihilation process \\( p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-} \\) involves a slowly moving antiproton, so its kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial rest mass energy is \\( 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. The reaction given is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. The antiproton is slowly moving, so I can probably assume that its kinetic energy is negligible, right? That means the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton will be converted into the energy of the particles A. \n\nFirst, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other forms. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy, so maybe I can ignore it. The total energy available should then be the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. \n\nThe rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, the total rest energy is 2 * 938 MeV. Wait, but the problem says m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV. Hmm, so each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. \n\nThe reaction produces two A+ and two A- particles. Each has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 MeV, because there are four particles (two positive and two negative). So that's 1200 MeV. \n\nWait a second, but the initial energy from the proton and antiproton is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So 1876 MeV on the left, and 1200 MeV on the right. The difference must be the kinetic energy of the A particles. But the question is about their velocity, so maybe we can assume they are moving at relativistic speeds, so their total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are moving at a speed where their kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the energy they get from the annihilation. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think. The total energy from the proton and antiproton must equal the total energy of the four A particles. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, the initial energy is approximately 2*(m_p c\u00b2) = 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe four A particles each have a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV) must be the kinetic energy of the particles. \n\nBut since the particles are moving relativistically, their total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2. Each A particle has that. Since there are four particles, total energy is 4*gamma*(300 MeV) = 1200 gamma MeV. This must equal the initial energy of 1876 MeV. \n\nSo, 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, solving for v:\n\ngamma = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nLet me rearrange that. Let's compute sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64.\n\nSquaring both sides: 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.64\u00b2 = 0.4096\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768. Wait, that's about 0.77c. Hmm, but that's option A. But wait, I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200. Let's see, 1200 * 1.5 is 1800. 1876 is 76 more than 1800. 76/1200 = 0.0633. So total gamma is 1.5633, yes.\n\nThen 1/gamma is approximately 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64. Squaring that gives 0.4096. So 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904. Square root of that is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute that more accurately. 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, that's very close. 0.77^2 is 0.5929, which is a bit higher than 0.5904, so the actual value would be a bit less than 0.77. Let's see sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.7683. So approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, which would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options are A)0.77c, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. Hmm, so why is this conflicting with some intuition?\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption here. Let me check the steps again.\n\nThe initial energy is 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The final total energy must equal this. The four particles have each a total energy of gamma*m_A c\u00b2. So total energy is 4*gamma*(300) = 4*300*gamma = 1200 gamma. So 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma=1.5633. \n\nThen, gamma = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096. Then v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.5904, so v/c is sqrt(0.5904)= approx 0.768. So that's 0.77c, so option A. \n\nHmm, but I recall that sometimes in these annihilation problems, especially with equal numbers of particles, their momenta must cancel. Since the initial momentum is zero (antiproton is slow, so proton and antiproton at rest?), Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then their total momentum is not exactly zero. Wait, but maybe the problem assumes they are at rest? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its momentum is small, but maybe we can approximate the total initial momentum as zero? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the proton and antiproton are at rest? Because if the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" maybe the entire system is considered to have negligible momentum. So that the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the four particles must fly off in such a way that their momenta cancel. \n\nAssuming that, then the particles must come out in pairs with opposite momenta. So maybe two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions. \n\nBut for the velocity, since all particles have the same mass and presumably the same speed (since they are created symmetrically), their gamma factors would be the same. \n\nSo the previous calculation holds. So according to that, the answer should be A) 0.77c. \n\nBut why are there other options? Let me see if I made a mistake in the mass. Wait, the problem says m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV, so each A has that mass. So the total rest mass of the four particles is indeed 4*300 = 1200 MeV. \n\nWait, but perhaps the initial energy is not 2*938? Let me confirm the proton mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, yes. So 2 times that is 1876. \n\nHmm, so then the calculation seems right. Then why is the option B 0.96c? Maybe I need to consider that the particles are moving at a higher speed. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200 again. 1876 / 1200. Let's see: 1200 * 1.5 = 1800, 1876-1800 =76, so 76/1200 = 0.063333... So gamma is 1.563333... So that's correct. \n\nThen, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64. Squaring gives 0.4096. 1 - 0.4096 is 0.5904. Square root is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904):\n\nLet me see, 0.77^2 = 0.5929. The difference between 0.5929 and 0.5904 is about 0.0025. So sqrt(0.5904) is about 0.77 minus a little. Let me try 0.768:\n\n0.768 squared: 0.768 *0.768 = 0.589824. That's very close to 0.5904. So sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.7683. So v/c \u22480.7683, which is 0.77c when rounded to two decimal places. So that's answer A. \n\nHmm. So why are there other options? Maybe I missed something here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, could it be that the initial energy isn't 2 times the proton mass? The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But if it's \"slowly moving\", then its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2 = 2*938. So that part should be okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proton and antiproton to be at rest, so their total energy is exactly 2*938. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. Then the answer should be A. But the options have B as 0.96. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. So total charge is zero, which is okay. But maybe the particles are created with some kinetic energy, but their velocities are all the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the total energy goes into the kinetic energy, and the rest mass is negligible? But that can't be because their rest mass is 300 MeV each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the speed using relativistic energy-momentum relation. Let me think. \n\nEach A particle has energy E = gamma m_A c\u00b2. The total energy of all four is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2. Wait, no, the total energy must equal the initial energy. So 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nWait, if I set that equal, then gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) )? Wait, no. Let me write the equation again. \n\nTotal initial energy (proton + antiproton) = 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nTotal final energy is 4 * gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) )= (m_p)/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, but then that would be gamma = (938)/(2*300) = 938/(600) \u2248 1.5633. Which is exactly what I had before. \n\nSo that's the same result. So the gamma is indeed ~1.5633, leading to velocity ~0.77c. \n\nHmm. So that must be the right answer, option A. \n\nWait but the options given include 0.96, which is a higher speed. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial energy? Let me see if the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. Wait, but even if the antiproton is moving, but slowly, so kinetic energy is negligible. The rest mass of the antiproton is 938 MeV, so the total rest energy is still 2*938. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in different units? Wait no, the mass given is m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the annihilation produces two A+ and two A- particles, but perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) must have equal and opposite momenta, so their speeds are the same? So each pair would have the same gamma. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the particles are at rest? But that can't be because the total rest mass energy is 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial 1876, so they must have kinetic energy. \n\nHmm, I think I'm confident that the calculation is correct. The answer should be A)0.77c. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me compute gamma as 1.5633. \n\nGamma = 1.5633. \n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c. \n\nSo, sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64. \n\nSquaring gives 0.4096 = 1 - beta\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 -0.4096=0.5904 \u2192 beta = sqrt(0.5904)=0.768. \n\nYes, so 0.768c is approximately 0.77c. So that's option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. I think the options are given, so the answer is A. Maybe the other options are there to trick people who miscalculate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the particles are produced in pairs with opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. But that doesn't affect the speed calculation since each particle's speed is determined by their energy. \n\nSo I think the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. The reaction given is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. The antiproton is slowly moving, so I can probably assume that its kinetic energy is negligible, right? That means the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton will be converted into the energy of the particles A. \n\nFirst, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other forms. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy, so maybe I can ignore it. The total energy available should then be the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. \n\nThe rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, the total rest energy is 2 * 938 MeV. Wait, but the problem says m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV. Hmm, so each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. \n\nThe reaction produces two A+ and two A- particles. Each has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 MeV, because there are four particles (two positive and two negative). So that's 1200 MeV. \n\nWait a second, but the initial energy from the proton and antiproton is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So 1876 MeV on the left, and 1200 MeV on the right. The difference must be the kinetic energy of the A particles. But the question is about their velocity, so maybe we can assume they are moving at relativistic speeds, so their total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are moving at a speed where their kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the energy they get from the annihilation. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think. The total energy from the proton and antiproton must equal the total energy of the four A particles. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, the initial energy is approximately 2*(m_p c\u00b2) = 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe four A particles each have a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. The remaining energy (1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV) must be the kinetic energy of the particles. \n\nBut since the particles are moving relativistically, their total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2. Each A particle has that. Since there are four particles, total energy is 4*gamma*(300 MeV) = 1200 gamma MeV. This must equal the initial energy of 1876 MeV. \n\nSo, 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, solving for v:\n\ngamma = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nLet me rearrange that. Let's compute sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64.\n\nSquaring both sides: 1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.64\u00b2 = 0.4096\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768. Wait, that's about 0.77c. Hmm, but that's option A. But wait, I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200. Let's see, 1200 * 1.5 is 1800. 1876 is 76 more than 1800. 76/1200 = 0.0633. So total gamma is 1.5633, yes.\n\nThen 1/gamma is approximately 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64. Squaring that gives 0.4096. So 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904. Square root of that is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute that more accurately. 0.77 squared is 0.5929. Oh, that's very close. 0.77^2 is 0.5929, which is a bit higher than 0.5904, so the actual value would be a bit less than 0.77. Let's see sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.7683. So approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, which would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options are A)0.77c, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. Hmm, so why is this conflicting with some intuition?\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption here. Let me check the steps again.\n\nThe initial energy is 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. The final total energy must equal this. The four particles have each a total energy of gamma*m_A c\u00b2. So total energy is 4*gamma*(300) = 4*300*gamma = 1200 gamma. So 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma=1.5633. \n\nThen, gamma = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096. Then v\u00b2/c\u00b2 is 0.5904, so v/c is sqrt(0.5904)= approx 0.768. So that's 0.77c, so option A. \n\nHmm, but I recall that sometimes in these annihilation problems, especially with equal numbers of particles, their momenta must cancel. Since the initial momentum is zero (antiproton is slow, so proton and antiproton at rest?), Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving.

Let me confirm the proton mass. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, yes. So 2 times that is 1876. \n\nHmm, so then the calculation seems right. Then why is the option B 0.96c? Maybe I need to consider that the particles are moving at a higher speed. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate gamma. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200 again. 1876 / 1200. Let's see: 1200 * 1.5 = 1800, 1876-1800 =76, so 76/1200 = 0.063333... So gamma is 1.563333... So that's correct. \n\nThen, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64. Squaring gives 0.4096. 1 - 0.4096 is 0.5904. Square root is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904):\n\nLet me see, 0.77^2 = 0.5929. The difference between 0.5929 and 0.5904 is about 0.0025. So sqrt(0.5904) is about 0.77 minus a little. Let me try 0.768:\n\n0.768 squared: 0.768 *0.768 = 0.589824. That's very close to 0.5904. So sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.7683. So v/c \u22480.7683, which is 0.77c when rounded to two decimal places. So that's answer A. \n\nHmm. So why are there other options? Maybe I missed something here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, could it be that the initial energy isn't 2 times the proton mass? The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But if it's \"slowly moving\", then its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2 = 2*938. So that part should be okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proton and antiproton to be at rest, so their total energy is exactly 2*938. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. Then the answer should be A. But the options have B as 0.96. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the reaction is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. So total charge is zero, which is okay. But maybe the particles are created with some kinetic energy, but their velocities are all the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the total energy goes into the kinetic energy, and the rest mass is negligible? But that can't be because their rest mass is 300 MeV each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the speed using relativistic energy-momentum relation. Let me think. \n\nEach A particle has energy E = gamma m_A c\u00b2. The total energy of all four is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2. Wait, no, the total energy must equal the initial energy. So 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nWait, if I set that equal, then gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) )? Wait, no. Let me write the equation again. \n\nTotal initial energy (proton + antiproton) = 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nTotal final energy is 4 * gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) )= (m_p)/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, but then that would be gamma = (938)/(2*300) = 938/(600) \u2248 1.5633. Which is exactly what I had before. \n\nSo that's the same result. So the gamma is indeed ~1.5633, leading to velocity ~0.77c. \n\nHmm. So that must be the right answer, option A. \n\nWait but the options given include 0.96, which is a higher speed. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial energy? Let me see if the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small velocity. Wait, but even if the antiproton is moving, but slowly, so kinetic energy is negligible. The rest mass of the antiproton is 938 MeV, so the total rest energy is still 2*938. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in different units? Wait no, the mass given is m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the annihilation produces two A+ and two A- particles, but perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) must have equal and opposite momenta, so their speeds are the same? So each pair would have the same gamma. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the particles are at rest? But that can't be because the total rest mass energy is 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial 1876, so they must have kinetic energy. \n\nHmm, I think I'm confident that the calculation is correct. The answer should be A)0.77c. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me compute gamma as 1.5633. \n\nGamma = 1.5633. \n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c. \n\nSo, sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64. \n\nSquaring gives 0.4096 = 1 - beta\u00b2 \u2192 beta\u00b2 = 1 -0.4096=0.5904 \u2192 beta = sqrt(0.5904)=0.768. \n\nYes, so 0.768c is approximately 0.77c. So that's option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. I think the options are given, so the answer is A. Maybe the other options are there to trick people who miscalculate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the particles are produced in pairs with opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. But that doesn't affect the speed calculation since each particle's speed is determined by their energy. \n\nSo I think the answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the velocity of particle A, we start by noting the annihilation process \\( p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \\).
