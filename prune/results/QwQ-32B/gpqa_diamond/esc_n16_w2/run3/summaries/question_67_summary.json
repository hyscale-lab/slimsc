      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the joint probability that both electrons have their L_z values as -\u0127 when measured. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, right, this is a coupled angular momentum state. Let me recall how angular momentum coupling works here.\n\nFirst, each electron has an orbital angular momentum of l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number is L = 2, and the z-component is M = -1. The question is about the probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127 simultaneously. \n\nThe state |1,1,2,-1> is part of the coupled basis. To find the probability, I need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states, which are products of the individual angular momentum eigenstates of each electron. The coefficients in that expansion will give the probabilities.\n\nThe coupled state |l1,l2,L,M> can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states |l1,m1,l2,m2>. So, I need to find the coefficient of the term |1, -1, 1, -1> in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>.\n\nWait, but let me think: the total M is the sum of m1 and m2. Since M is -1, then m1 + m2 = -1. The possible combinations for m1 and m2 when each electron has l=1 are m1 can be -1, 0, +1, similarly for m2. So possible pairs (m1, m2) that add to -1 would be (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, ... wait, no, since each m can't be less than -l. So possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Wait, but each m can be -1, 0, +1. So adding to -1: m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs:\n\nm1=-1 and m2=0 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm1=0 and m2=-1 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm1=-2? No, since l=1, so m can't be -2. So only those two combinations. Wait, but then how does the state |1,1,2,-1> combine those?\n\nBut the question is about the term where both are -1. Wait, that would be m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which would sum to -2. But our M here is -1. So that combination (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not part of the M=-1 state. Therefore, the coefficient for |1,-1,1,-1> in this state would be zero. Hence the probability is zero. Wait, but that would be answer D.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the total angular momentum L is 2, and M is -1. The possible m1 and m2 must add to M = -1. So the only possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, the state |2, -1> can't have contributions from the pair (-1, -1) because that would give a total M of -2. Therefore, the component with both m1 and m2 being -1 is not present in this state. Hence the probability is zero. So the answer should be D) 0?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to actually compute the coefficients. Let me recall the formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here.\n\nThe state |l1,l2,L,M> is constructed from the uncoupled states. Let me see, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is built from the possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible terms are:\n\nFor L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are indeed (-1,0) and (0,-1). Let me think of the CG coefficients. The standard way to write the |L,M> state is a combination of the |m1,m2> states. For L=2, M=-1, the possible m1 and m2 values must add to -1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1 to L=2, M=-1 can be found in tables or calculated. Let me try to remember how they work.\n\nThe general approach is that the highest weight state (maximum M) is constructed first, then others are found by lowering operators. Let's see. For example, the state with M=2 would be |1,1> (since m1=1, m2=1 gives M=2). Then, to get M=1, you might have combinations of (1,0) and (0,1), etc. But perhaps for M=-1, the coefficients would be symmetric or antisymmetric?\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that when coupling l1 and l2, the CG coefficients for |L,M> are given by certain formulas. Let me think of the specific case here.\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 for M=-1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients for those terms in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> would be the same because of symmetry? Let me see.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1 m1 1 m2 | 2 -1> is non-zero only when m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible terms are m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. The coefficients for these two terms would be the same in magnitude, but possibly with a sign difference.\n\nThe exact value can be calculated using the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for two electrons in p orbitals (l=1 each), the triplet and singlet states. Wait, but here we are dealing with orbital angular momentum, not spin. But the coupling is similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the |1,-1,1,0> and |1,0,1,-1> terms. Let me write:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = C1 |1,-1,1,0> + C2 |1,0,1,-1>.\n\nWhat's the normalization condition? The sum of squares of coefficients should be 1. Let's see.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, M=-1 when coupling l1=1 and l2=1. \n\nLooking up a standard Clebsch-Gordan table:\n\nThe CG coefficient for (l1=1, m1=-1; l2=1, m2=0) coupling to L=2, M=-1.\n\nThe formula for CG coefficients can be complex, but here's a way to compute it. The standard formula involves some recursion relations, but perhaps I can recall that for symmetric combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the state as being symmetric or antisymmetric. Wait, the total angular momentum state here is symmetric under exchange? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the coefficients for the two terms are equal. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the coefficients C1 and C2 are equal. Let's say C1 = C2 = 1/\u221a2. Then the state would be ( | -1,0> + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2). Then the probability of finding each term would be 1/2 each. But the question is about the joint probability of getting both electrons at -\u0127, which would be the term |-1, -1>, but that's not part of this combination, so zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficients are different. Wait, let me think of the ladder operators.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for CG coefficients. Let me try to compute it.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for l1=1, m1; l2=1, m2; L=2, M=-1 is given by:\n\nThe standard notation is < l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M >.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps using the formula for the coefficients when M is fixed. Let's see, for the case where M = m1 + m2 = -1, so m2 = -1 - m1.\n\nThe general formula for the coefficients can be found using the following approach. Let me consider the case when L = l1 + l2 = 2 (since 1+1=2, so that's the maximum L here). \n\nThe highest M for L=2 is 2, which is |1,1;1,1> combined as |2,2>. Then, to get lower M states, we can apply the lowering operator. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for the case of coupling two angular momenta l1 and l2 to L = l1 + l2 (the maximum possible), the coefficients are all 1/sqrt(N) where N is the number of terms, but only when the m's add up. Wait, but for L=2, the state with M=2 is only |1,1;1,1>, so that's just a single term. The next state M=1 would be combinations of (1,0) and (0,1). For L=2, M=1, the state would be ( |1,0;1,1> + |1,1;1,0> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, but that's for M=1+1=2? No, M for that would be 1+1=2? Wait no. Wait, the first term would have m1=1, m2=0 \u2192 total M=1, and m1=0, m2=1 \u2192 M=1. So yes, those add to M=1. So the state for L=2, M=1 is ( |1,0,1,1> + |1,1,1,0> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nSimilarly, for M=0, the terms would be (1,-1;1,1) + (1,0;1,0) + (1,1;1,-1), but perhaps with coefficients?\n\nWait, but in our case, we need M=-1. So the terms would be m1 + m2 = -1. The possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1,0) and (0, -1). \n\nThe state |L=2, M=-1> should be constructed from these two terms. Since L is the maximum possible (2), the coefficients here would be symmetric. So perhaps it's ( | -1,0 > + | 0,-1 > ) / sqrt(2). \n\nIf that's the case, then the expansion of |2, -1> would have coefficients 1/\u221a2 for each of those terms. Therefore, the probability of measuring the first electron with m1 = -1 and the second with m2 =0 is 1/2, and similarly for the other term. But the question is about the joint probability of both being -1, which would be the term | -1, -1 >, but that's not present here. Hence, the probability is 0, which would be option D.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm this. Let me check if there's another possible contribution. For instance, could there be a component where m1 is -1 and m2 is -1? But their sum would be -2, which would require M = -2, but our state has M = -1. Therefore, that term can't be part of this state. So indeed, the answer must be D) 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me see another approach. Let me recall that for two angular momenta with l1 = l2 =1, the combined states for L=2 are:\n\nThe M=2 state: |1,1>1,1.\n\nM=1: (|1,0,1,1> + |1,1,1,0>)/sqrt(2).\n\nM=0: (|1,1,1,-1> + |1,-1,1,1>)/sqrt(2) + |1,0,1,0> * sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the M=0 state for L=2 is a combination of three terms? Wait, no. Wait, for M=0, m1 + m2 = 0. The possible pairs are (1, -1), (0,0), (-1,1). So three terms. Therefore, the M=0 state would have three terms. So for L=2, M=0, the state would be a combination of those three terms. But for M=-1, only two terms as before.\n\nTherefore, the M=-1 state for L=2 is indeed only the combination of (|-1,0> and |0,-1>) each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2). Hence, the term with both m1 and m2 being -1 is not present. Therefore, the probability is zero. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should check a specific example of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me think of the case of two p electrons (l=1 each). The total angular momentum can be L=0,1,2. For L=2, the M values go from -2 to +2. \n\nLooking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1:\n\nThe standard tables (like in the back of a textbook) would list the coefficients. For example, according to standard tables, the CG coefficient for (l1=1, m1=-1; l2=1, m2=0) coupling to L=2, M=-1 is sqrt(1/2). Similarly for (m1=0, m2=-1). So the state is indeed ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient for the term where both are -1 is zero. Hence, the joint probability of both electrons having L_z = -\u0127 (i.e., m=-1) is zero. So the answer must be D) 0.\n",

The question is asking for the joint probability that when we measure the L\u2081z and L\u2082z components (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum), both give -\u0127.\n\nHmm. Let me recall how angular momentum coupling works. When you have two particles with angular momenta l\u2081 and l\u2082, their total angular momentum L is the vector sum, which can take values from |l\u2081 - l\u2082| up to l\u2081 + l\u2082 in integer steps. Here, both l\u2081 and l\u2082 are 1 (since they're in p orbitals, so l=1). So the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers l would be 0, 1, or 2. But the state given has l=2, so that's the maximum possible. The m value here is -1, which is the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe problem is about measuring L\u2081z and L\u2082z. Each of these can have eigenvalues of m\u2081\u0127 and m\u2082\u0127, where m\u2081 and m\u2082 are integers from -1 to +1. The question is specifically asking for the probability that both L\u2081z and L\u2082z are measured as -\u0127. So each would have m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = -1. The joint probability would be the probability that both electrons have their individual z-components at -\u0127.\n\nBut how does this relate to the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>? I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states, which are products of the individual angular momentum states. The coupled state |l1,l2,l,m> is a linear combination of the uncoupled states |l1,m1> \u2297 |l2,m2> where m1 + m2 = m. In this case, m is -1, so m1 + m2 must equal -1. \n\nWait, but the question is about the probability of getting both m1 and m2 equal to -1. However, if m1 + m2 must equal the total m (which is -1 here), then if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2, which doesn't equal the total m of -1. Therefore, that combination (m1=-1, m2=-1) can't contribute to the given coupled state. Hence, the probability should be zero?\n\nWait, let me confirm. The total m is the sum of the individual m's. Since the total m here is -1, any combination where m1 + m2 = -1 is allowed, but the combination where both are -1 would sum to -2, which is not equal to the total m of -1. Therefore, that particular term isn't present in the expansion of the coupled state. Therefore, the probability of both being -\u0127 is zero. So the answer would be D) 0?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write out the explicit expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled states. Let's think about the possible m1 and m2 values. The total m is -1, so possible pairs (m1, m2) that add to -1 are:\n\n- ( -1, 0 ), because -1 + 0 = -1\n\n- ( 0, -1 ), same as above?\n\nWait, no, the pairs would be all combinations where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 can be -1, 0, or +1, and similarly for m2. So the possible pairs:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 ranges from -1 to +1. So those are the only two possible pairs.\n\nWait, so the only possible pairs contributing to the state |1,1,2,-1> are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). Therefore, the combination (m1=-1 and m2=-1) is not part of this state. Therefore, the amplitude for that term is zero, so the probability is zero. So the answer is D) 0?\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me check if there's another possibility. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the coefficients in the expansion?\n\nThe general formula for the coupled states uses Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1,l2,l,m> is a linear combination of |l1,m1>|l2,m2> with coefficients given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For the specific case here, l1=l2=1, l=2, and m=-1.\n\nLet me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2. For l1=1, l2=1, and total l=2, m=-1.\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m=-1 are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of these terms. The coefficients can be found using tables or formulas.\n\nI think the coefficients for the combination where l=2, m=-1 would be something like:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = ( |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ) / sqrt(2) ?\n\nWait, let me see. The standard CG coefficients for two spin 1 particles (since l=1 is like a spin-1 system) adding to total l=2 and m=-1.\n\nThe CG coefficient for m1 = -1, m2 =0 would be sqrt( ( (2 - m +1)(2 + m +1) ) / ( (2 +1)(2 +1) )) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should look up the exact coefficients here, but since I can't, I have to recall.\n\nAlternatively, for l1 = l2 =1 and total l=2, m=-1.\n\nThe state |2,-1> is constructed from the possible m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nSo the basis vectors contributing are |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.\n\nThe coefficients should be such that the state is symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, for orbital angular momentum, the total state must be symmetric under exchange because electrons are identical particles, but wait, actually, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so if the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, but here spin is ignored. Wait, the question says to ignore spin, so perhaps we can treat the orbital angular momentum part without considering the overall symmetry? Hmm, but the question is about the angular momentum state, so maybe the coupling is just the angular part, and the problem is purely about the angular momentum addition, regardless of particle statistics. So perhaps the coefficients are just as per CG coefficients regardless.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1 would be:\n\nThe formula for the CG coefficient <l1,m1; l2,m2 | l, m> is given by some expression. Alternatively, let me think of the state |2,-1>. The highest m for l=2 is 2. To get that, you need m1=1 and m2=1. Then each step down in m would involve combinations with lower m1 and m2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients for the |2,-1> state would be:\n\nLet me see, for the case when l = l1 + l2 = 2 (the maximum possible), the state |2,2> is just |1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1> no? Wait, no, to get m=2, you need both m1 and m2 at +1. Wait, m1 + m2 = 2, so m1=1 and m2=1. So |2,2> is just |1,1>|1,1>.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of the standard addition. For two angular momenta l1 and l2, the maximum l is l1 + l2. The state |l1 + l2, l1 + l2> is just the product state with each at their maximum m. So for l1=l2=1, |2,2> would be |1,1>\u2297|1,1>.\n\nThen to get |2,1>, you need combinations where m1 + m2 =1. The possible terms are |1,1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,1>. The coefficients would be such that they form an eigenstate of L\u00b2 and Lz. Similarly, the state |2,0> would have m terms adding to 0, and so on.\n\nFor the state |2, -1>, the m is -1, so m1 + m2 =-1. The possible combinations are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). So the state would be a combination of those two terms. The coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nI think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1, -1>|1, 0> in the state |2, -1> would be sqrt(2)/2, and similarly for the other term. Because when you have two terms, they are combined with coefficients that are 1/sqrt(2) each. Let me see, because in the case of spin-1/2, when you have two states adding to a triplet, the m=0 state has (|\u2191\u2193> + |\u2193\u2191>)/sqrt(2). Similarly here, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, in this state, the only terms present are those where one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0. The combination where both have m=-1 is not present. Therefore, when we measure L\u2081z and L\u2082z, the possible outcomes are either (-\u0127, 0) or (0, -\u0127), each with probability (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2. So the total probability for either of those is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but since the question is asking specifically for both being -\u0127, which isn't present, so the probability is zero. \n\nTherefore the answer is D) 0. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The question says \"the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127\". Since neither of the terms in the state has both m1 and m2 as -1, the amplitude for that term is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero. That makes sense. So the answer is D.\n",

Because when you have two terms, they are combined with coefficients that are 1/sqrt(2) each. Let me see, because in the case of spin-1/2, when you have two states adding to a triplet, the m=0 state has (|\u2191\u2193> + |\u2193\u2191>)/sqrt(2). Similarly here, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, in this state, the only terms present are those where one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0. The combination where both have m=-1 is not present.

So the total probability for either of those is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but since the question is asking specifically for both being -\u0127, which isn't present, so the probability is zero. \n\nTherefore the answer is D) 0. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The question says \"the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127\". Since neither of the terms in the state has both m1 and m2 as -1, the amplitude for that term is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero. That makes sense. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\(-\\hbar\\) for the coupled angular momentum state \\(|1,1,2,-1\\rangle\\), we analyze the possible contributions to this state.
