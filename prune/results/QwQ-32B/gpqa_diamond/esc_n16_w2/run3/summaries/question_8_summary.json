      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about white lupine and anthracnose resistance. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nThe question is about three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made mutants for each and some double mutants. The results of their resistance levels are given, and we have to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the options provided. \n\nFirst, let me recall some genetics terms. Epistasis means that one gene masks the effect of another. For example, if two genes are involved in a pathway, a mutation in one might prevent the other's product from being made, so the double mutant would show the same phenotype as the more upstream mutation. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here the question is about interactions between genes, so maybe epistasis is more relevant here. Redundancy would mean that two genes have overlapping functions, so if one is knocked out, the other can compensate, but if both are knocked out, you get a stronger effect.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nWild-type is 100% resistance. The single mutants:\n\n- g1 (no G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not completely.\n- g2 (no G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big loss. So G2 seems important.\n- g3 (no G3) has 50% resistance. So losing G3 reduces it by half.\n\nNow the double mutants:\n\n- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n- g1g3: 10% (lower than g1 or g3 alone)\n- g2g3: 0% (same as g2 or g2g3)\n\nHmm. Let's think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, then maybe G1 and G3 are downstream. Let's see.\n\nFirst, since g2 alone is 0% resistance, which is worse than the others. So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist at all. So maybe G2 is essential. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are not contributing when G2 is already missing. So maybe G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it might control the expression of G1 and/or G3. If G2 is off, then even if G1 is present, it might not be expressed. Wait, but the g1 mutant still has some resistance (75%), so maybe G2's product is needed for G1's expression? Or perhaps G2 is necessary for both G1 and G3 to function.\n\nAlternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But in that case, the g1 mutant would still have G3, but if G2 is missing, G3 might not be expressed either. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 would be expressed. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's product is required for G1 and G3 to function. Like, maybe G1 and G3 are enzymes that need a protein made by G2 to work. So without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, they can't function. So in the g2 mutant, all three are knocked out (since their products can't function without G2's product), leading to 0% resistance.\n\nLooking at the g1g3 double mutant: their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in some overlapping way. If they are redundant, then losing both would have a more severe effect than either alone. But since their combined effect is 10% (much lower than 75% or 50%), that supports redundancy. Because redundancy means each can compensate for the other. So when both are missing, their combined loss leads to a much bigger problem. That would make sense here. \n\nSo if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their double knockout would be worse than either alone. So that points towards option D or maybe C or D? Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options:\n\nA) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n\nB) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so maybe regulated similarly?), G3 epistatic to G1.\n\nC) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.\n\nD) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.\n\nWait, epistasis here. Let me think. If G2 is a TF, then it's upstream. So the other genes are downstream. \n\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1's effect is masked by G3's mutation? Or vice versa. Wait, epistasis is when the genotype at one locus masks the effect of another. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the effect would be the same as g1 alone. But in reality, the g1g3 has 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that can't be. Therefore, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1? Then the double mutant would have the same as G3's effect. But 10% is worse than G3's 50%, so that's not either. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and the others. Since in the g1g2 mutant, the resistance is 0% same as g2. So the presence of the g1 mutation doesn't change the outcome when G2 is already knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's mutation masks the effect of G1's mutation. So G2 is upstream of G1. That would make sense if G2 is a TF that's required for G1's function. So in the absence of G2, whether G1 is present or not doesn't matter. So the g1g2 double has same as g2 alone.\n\nSimilarly, the g2g3 also has 0% same as g2. So G2's mutation masks the effect of G3's mutation. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.\n\nNow the question is about which option fits. The options mention which gene is the TF. The question says at least one is a TF acting upstream. So G2 being a TF fits because its knockout leads to complete loss, and the double mutants with G2 show same as G2 alone, so G2 is upstream.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, redundancy would explain the g1g3 having lower resistance than either single. \n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can compensate for the other. So when both are missing, resistance drops more. So that's the case here. \n\nNow the epistasis part in D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would have additive effect. So the epistasis part in the options might not be directly about them. \n\nWait, the options mention epistasis between G1 and G3. Let me think again. \n\nThe question states that one of the genes is a TF acting upstream. So if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. So their interactions would be in the pathway after G2. \n\nIn the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than both single mutants (75% and 50%). So that suggests that they are in parallel pathways (redundant). Because when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. So redundancy is a key here. \n\nSo looking at the options, D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Hmm, but how does the epistasis part work here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think of another approach. \n\nEpistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3's mutation is masked by G1's mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than the g1 alone (75%). So that can't be. So maybe G3 is epistatic to G1? Then the double would have the same as G3's effect (50%), but it's 10%, so that also doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the epistasis here isn't between G1 and G3 but between G2 and them. Since in the double mutants with G2, the results are same as G2 alone. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. \n\nThe options don't mention that. The options talk about between G1 and G3. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says G1 is epistatic to G3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis in the options is about the direction of the pathway. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1 is downstream of G3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when G1 is knocked out, it affects G3's function. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is the worst. So G2 is essential. \n\n- The double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have the same as G2 alone. So G2's mutation masks the effect of the other mutations. That means G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2 is upstream of both. \n\n- The G1 and G3 single mutants have 75% and 50% resistance respectively, so they are contributing but not as much as G2. \n\n- The double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is much worse than either single. So their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. That suggests redundancy between them. So their functions overlap, so when both are missing, the plant can't compensate, leading to a worse outcome. \n\nSo the conclusion would be that G2 is a TF upstream (since it's epistatic to the others), and G1 and G3 are redundant. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but where does the epistasis between G1 and G3 come in?\n\nHmm, maybe the epistasis part in the options is a distractor. Because the question states that at least one is upstream, which is G2 here. The redundancy is between G1 and G3, so their double knockout has a worse effect. So the correct option should mention redundancy between G1 and G3 and G2 as the TF. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D has that. But the last part says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nWait, maybe the epistasis here is not between G1 and G3, but between G2 and them. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis between G1 and G3 is not required here. Let me check other options.\n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (maybe co-regulated?), and G3 is epistatic to G1. Not sure. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. \n\nOption D's redundancy is correct. The epistasis part in D might be a red herring. Wait, maybe the question requires that one of the options must have all correct parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis here is between G1 and G3. Let me think: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3's mutation is masked by G1's mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than G1's alone. So that can't be. \n\nIf G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double would have the same as G3's single (50%), but it's 10%, so that's not. \n\nHmm, so maybe the epistasis part in the options is not between G1 and G3 but perhaps between G2 and G1, but that's not listed in the options. \n\nWait, looking back at the options again:\n\nOption D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. If that's the case, then the presence of a g1 mutation would mask the effect of a g3 mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the result is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. That contradicts epistasis. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, so maybe the epistasis part in the options is incorrect, but the redundancy part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is in a different way. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term. Let me recall: Epistasis is when one gene is epistatic (dominant in effect) over another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the genotype at A can mask the effect of B. \n\nSo if in the double mutant g1g3, the result is worse than either single, that suggests that their effects are additive, so not epistatic. Therefore, the epistasis between G1 and G3 isn't happening here. \n\nTherefore, the correct option must be the one that states redundancy between G1 and G3, and G2 being the TF. Looking at the options, that's D. Even if the epistasis part is confusing, perhaps the question expects that the redundancy is the main point, and the epistasis part in D is a distractor but maybe correct in some way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis part in D is a mistake, but perhaps the answer is D because of the redundancy and G2 being TF. Let me check other options again. \n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nWait, perhaps the epistasis here is that when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's mutation becomes more pronounced? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D because the first two parts are correct. Since the question says \"at least one\" is a TF, which G2 is. The redundancy between G1 and G3 is correct. The epistasis part may not be required, but perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, but here the question is about interactions between genes. So redundancy is more relevant. \n\nOption B mentions same promoter. Not sure. \n\nTherefore, the best option is D. \n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes G1, G2, and G3, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants. \n\n- **G2** is critical, as its knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, and double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0%, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor upstream of the others. \n- **G1 and G3** exhibit redundancy. Their single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) show partial resistance, but their double mutant (g1g3) has drastically reduced resistance (10%), indicating their functions overlap. When both are absent, their combined loss exacerbates the phenotype. \n- **Epistasis between G1 and G3 is not supported**, as the g1g3 resistance (10%) is worse than either single mutant, contradicting masking effects. \n\nOption **D** correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, redundancy between G1 and G3, and the epistasis claim (G1 epistatic to G3) is irrelevant here but does not conflict with the data.

The epistasis part may not be required, but perhaps the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, but here the question is about interactions between genes. So redundancy is more relevant. \n\nOption B mentions same promoter. Not sure. \n\nTherefore, the best option is D. \n\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes G1, G2, and G3, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants. \n\n- **G2** is critical, as its knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, and double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0%, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor upstream of the others. \n- **G1 and G3** exhibit redundancy. Their single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) show partial resistance, but their double mutant (g1g3) has drastically reduced resistance (10%), indicating their functions overlap. When both are absent, their combined loss exacerbates the phenotype. \n- **Epistasis between G1 and G3 is not supported**, as the g1g3 resistance (10%) is worse than either single mutant, contradicting masking effects. \n\nOption **D** correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, redundancy between G1 and G3, and the epistasis claim (G1 epistatic to G3) is irrelevant here but does not conflict with the data. Other options either misattribute epistasis or fail to address redundancy. \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about figuring out the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experiment involved knockout mutants and double mutants, and we have their resistance levels compared to the wild-type. The question is asking which conclusion about their interactions is correct based on the results.\n\nFirst, let's recap the data given. The wild-type is 100%. The single mutants: g1 has 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%. The double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, g1g3 is 10%, and g2g3 is 0%. \n\nThe key here is understanding epistasis and redundancy. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks the effect of another. If a double mutant shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. For example, if the double mutant g1g2 has the same as g2, then G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when you remove G2, the effect of G1 is hidden.\n\nLooking at the data, the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance. The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both also have 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' absence doesn't change the outcome (since they're already at 0%). So G2 might be a transcription factor that's upstream of the others. \n\nNow, let's look at the other mutants. The g1 single mutant has 75%, which is a partial loss. The g3 has 50%. The double g1g3 has 10%. That's way lower than either single. This might suggest that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways. If they are redundant, meaning they can each contribute to resistance but together their loss leads to a worse outcome. Wait, but redundancy usually means that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So in a double knockout, you lose both and the effect is additive. But here, the single mutants have 75 and 50, which when combined, the resistance is 10. That's a big drop. So maybe they are part of the same pathway but not redundant? Or perhaps their functions are additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both require G2. Since G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's necessary for activating both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the g1 mutant, since G2 is still present, maybe G3 is still active, so you get partial resistance. Similarly, in g3, G1 is still active, giving some resistance. \n\nLet me think about the options now. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. Wait, but if G1 is the TF, then the g1 mutant should have a big effect. But in the data, the g1 mutant only has 75% resistance, not 0. So that doesn't fit. Because if G1 is a TF upstream, knocking it out would lead to loss of downstream genes, which might result in low resistance. But since g1 is still at 75, maybe that's not the case. So A might not be right.\n\nOption B: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure about the same promoter. Also, G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm. If G2 is the TF, then when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed? But in the g2 single mutant, resistance is 0. The double mutants with G2 (like g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0. So the presence or absence of G1 or G3 doesn't matter when G2 is gone. So G2 being a TF makes sense here. Then, looking at the other parts. The question is about the interaction between G1 and G3. The g1g3 double has 10%, which is worse than either single. If they are in the same pathway but redundant, then their combined loss would be worse than either alone. But redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. For example, if each contributes 50% (so together 100%), but when both are gone, 0. But here the single mutants have 75 and 50. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways. Let's see: G1's loss leads to 75% (so maybe it's contributing 25% of the resistance?), and G3's loss is 50% (so contributing 50%). So together, 25 +50? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe their effects are multiplicative. 75% (g1) could mean that when G1 is missing, resistance is 3/4 of wild. G3 missing gives 1/2. So together, if they are independent, the combined effect would be 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5%, but the actual is 10%. That's way lower. So maybe they are in the same pathway, so their combined loss is worse. \n\nOption B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure. The key part here is epistasis between G3 and G1. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 would affect G1's expression. But not sure how that plays here. Let's skip for now.\n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, pleiotropy means one gene has multiple effects. But how does that help here? The epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G1 would mask G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g1. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75. So that contradicts. Therefore C can't be right.\n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, redundancy would mean that they can substitute each other. So if you have a single mutant, each loses part of the function, but together they are worse. But the question is about the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then when you remove G1, the effect of G3 is masked. But in the g1g3 double, which has both gone, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 alone (75%). That suggests that G1's presence might have been masking some effect of G3? Not sure. Alternatively, redundancy would mean that together they contribute to the same function. So their combined loss leads to a bigger hit. Let's see:\n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants each lose part of the function. The double would lose both. So, for instance, if each contributes 50% of the function, then the single mutants would have 50% each, and the double would have 0. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so their contributions aren't equal. Hmm, but maybe the redundancy isn't complete. Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways, so their combined loss reduces resistance more than either alone. The 10% is much lower than the product (75% *50% is 37.5%), so perhaps they are in series. \n\nWait, the question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Since G2 is a TF in options B, C, D. The data suggests that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0, and any double mutant with G2 is also 0. So G2 is essential. So G2 is likely the TF that's upstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 may be downstream of G2, and their products are necessary for resistance. \n\nNow, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: since G2 is still present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out, leading to 10% resistance. That suggests that both G1 and G3 are contributing to the resistance pathway, and their combined loss is worse than either alone. So they are not redundant because redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So if they are in parallel pathways, their combined loss would be additive. The 10% is much lower than the product of their individual losses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but not redundant. For example, G1's product is required for G3's function. So if G1 is missing, G3 can't do its job. But then the g1 mutant would have G3 still present but not functional, so maybe lower than 75. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 75% for g1 suggests that G1's loss reduces resistance by 25%. G3's loss reduces by half. So maybe G1 contributes more. The double loss would then be even less. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. The options that have G2 as the TF are B, C, D. Let's eliminate A first since G1 as a TF would probably lead to a more severe phenotype in the single mutant, but g1 is only 75. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would lead to a more severe phenotype, which matches the data (g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either single). But redundancy usually implies that each can compensate for the other, so the single mutants would have similar levels. Here, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so they aren't the same. So maybe not redundancy. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel but not redundant. Let's think about epistasis. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. Wait, epistasis is when one gene's allele masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g3 (since G1's absence can't mask G3's absence). But in reality, the double is 10% which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B?), then the double would have the same as G3's single. But 10% is worse than G3's 50, so that also doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Let's think again. Since G2 is the TF, and the double mutants with G2 (like g1g2) are 0, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. The question is about the relationship between G1 and G3. \n\nThe single mutants: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. The double g1g3 is 10%. So when both are missing, the resistance is much lower. This suggests that they are in separate pathways that are both necessary, so their combined loss reduces resistance more. Like, each contributes to a part of the defense. So their functions are additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So if you knock out G1, you lose G3's function too, but G3's knockout only affects G3. Wait, but the data for g1 is 75, which is better than g3's 50. That might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is downstream of G1, then the g1 mutant would also lose G3's function. But then the g1 single would have a phenotype as bad as g3 or worse. But in reality, g1 is better than g3. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways. So each contributes some resistance. So losing both reduces resistance more. \n\nNow, looking at the options again, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy usually means that each can compensate, so the single mutants would have similar resistance levels. Since their single mutant levels are different (75 vs 50), redundancy might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not redundant, but the question says \"gene redundancy\" is an option. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (so redundant?), and the epistasis is that G1 is epistatic to G3. Wait, but I'm confused. \n\nWait, the question says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in D. Epistasis would mean that the effect of G1 masks G3. So, in the double mutant, since both are knocked out, their combined effect would be the same as the more severe of the two? Or the effect of G3 is masked by G1's presence. Wait, epistasis is tricky here. Let me recall the definition. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the genotype of A determines the phenotype regardless of B's genotype. So if you have a double mutant, the effect would be the same as the more epistatic gene. \n\nSuppose G1 is epistatic to G3. Then the presence of G1 determines the outcome. So in the g1g3 double, since both are missing, maybe it's the same as g1? But the double has 10%, which is worse than g1's 75. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is B? Let me check option B again. \n\nOption B says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. \n\nSame promoter might mean they are co-regulated. But how does that help? The epistatic part: G3 is epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is present, it masks G1's effect. So, in a double mutant where G3 is missing, the effect of G1 would be seen. Wait, but in the g1g3 double, which lacks both, the resistance is 10%. The g1 single has 75, which is better. So if G3 is epistatic over G1, then in the presence of G3, G1's contribution is masked. So when you remove G3, the G1's effect is unmasked, but since G1 is also removed in the double, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is such that G3's function is required for G1's function. So if G3 is knocked out, then G1 can't function. But then the g1 single would still have G3, so G1's absence would lead to lower resistance, but the g3 single would have G1, but G1 can't function because G3 is missing. Wait, but that would mean that the g3 single's resistance would be worse than g1's. Indeed, the g3 single is 50% vs g1's 75. That fits. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is required for G1's function, then in the g3 mutant, G1 can't do its job, so the resistance is lower. \n\nIn that case, the g1 mutant has G3 still present, so G1's loss only reduces resistance by 25% (since it's 75%). But G3's loss (g3) removes its own function plus G1's function (since G1 needs G3), so the total loss is 50% of control. Wait, but then the g1g3 double would have neither G1 nor G3, so their combined effect would be even worse. Which matches the 10% result. \n\nSo in this scenario, G3 is epistatic to G1. So that would make option B possible. But let's see the options again. Option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. And G1 and G3 have the same promoter. The same promoter might mean that they are transcribed together, but that's maybe not directly relevant. The key point here is the epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, in this model, G3 is epistatic over G1. So the epistasis is G3 over G1, which would fit option B. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the other option D. D says G1 and G3 are redundant. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse, which matches the 10%, but their single mutants have different levels, which might not fit redundancy. But maybe they contribute different amounts. Like, G1 contributes more. \n\nWait, but redundancy usually means they can substitute each other, so their single mutants have similar resistance levels. Since they are different here, maybe not. So perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, let's recap the possible scenarios. \n\nIf G2 is the TF, then both G1 and G3 are downstream of it. \n\nThe g1g3 double has 10%, which is worse than either single. This could mean that G1 and G3 are in separate parallel pathways. So each contributes some resistance. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1 has 75%: so losing G1 reduces resistance by 25%. \n\ng3 has 50%: so losing G3 reduces by half. \n\nCombined, they lose 25+50? But that's additive. But 75-50 would be 25, but the double is 10% (which is 90% loss). So maybe their contributions are multiplicative? \n\nAlternatively, their functions are in series. Like, each step is necessary. So if you lose one, you have partial loss, but losing both is worse. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of G2 allows both G1 and G3 to function. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, even with G2 present, the plant can't resist. \n\nNow, considering the options, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse, but their single mutants would have similar levels. Since their single mutants have different levels (75 vs 50), that might not be redundancy. \n\nOption B's point about G3 being epistatic to G1 would explain why g3's single mutant is worse than g1's. Because G3 is needed for G1 to function. So in g3's absence, G1 can't function, so losing G3 removes both G3 and the effect of G1. Thus, the g3 mutant's resistance is lower than g1's. \n\nIn the double mutant g1g3, both are gone, so you get even less resistance (10%). \n\nThis model would fit the data. So the epistasis is G3 over G1, which matches option B's \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". \n\nAdditionally, option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure how important that is, but the question doesn't give info about promoters, so maybe that part isn't critical. The main points are G2 as the TF, and the epistasis between G1 and G3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B?\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nIf they are redundant, then the single mutants should have similar resistance levels. Since they don't, that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe redundancy isn't about the same function but different pathways. But redundancy usually implies they can substitute each other. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redundancy is that they both contribute to the same process, so their combined loss is worse. The different single mutant levels could mean that each contributes a different amount. For example, G1 contributes 25% (so losing it leaves 75%), G3 contributes 50% (so losing it leaves 50%). Together, they contribute 75%, so losing both would leave 0, but the double is 10%. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the total resistance is the sum of their contributions. If wild-type is 100, then G1 contributes 25 (since losing it reduces to 75), and G3 contributes 50 (since losing it reduces to 50). So together, they contribute 75, so losing both would leave 25? But the double is at 10. Not matching. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let's see the options again. \n\nThe question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". Since G2 is the TF, the other genes are downstream. \n\nNow, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% even though G2 is present. So the plant still has G2, but without G1 and G3, it's very susceptible. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are necessary for resistance when activated by G2. Their combined loss removes all resistance (or almost all). \n\nSo their individual losses reduce resistance, but not completely. So they are both required, but not fully redundant. \n\nThe key is the epistasis between G1 and G3. The question is which option explains the 10% in the double. \n\nIf G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B), then the presence of G3 is needed for G1 to function. So in the g3 mutant, G1's function is lost even though G1 is present, hence the lower resistance. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G3 is still present, so G3 can function on its own (since G1 is not needed for G3's function). Hence, the g1 mutant's resistance is better (75%) than g3's (50%). \n\nThe double mutant lacks both, so no function, leading to 10% (maybe some residual?). \n\nThis model fits. \n\nSo the correct answer would be B? \n\nWait, but the options: \n\nOption B says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". The part about the same promoter might not be necessary, but the question doesn't contradict it. The key is the epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, option D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as G1's single mutant (since G1's absence would mask G3's). But in reality, the double is 10% which is worse than G1's 75. So that can't be. \n\nSo option B is better. \n\nWait, but the answer options: the correct answer is B or D? \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me try another angle. \n\nThe question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. Since G2 is the TF, the other genes are downstream. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1 is 75%: so when G1 is missing, the plant still has some resistance. Since G2 is present, maybe G2 can still activate G3. \n\ng3 is 50%: so when G3 is missing, the plant still has some resistance from G1. \n\nThe double g1g3 has 10%: so when both are missing, the plant can't get resistance from either, so very low. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are both necessary for full resistance. Each contributes partially. So their functions are additive. \n\nIn this case, their genes are in parallel pathways, so they are not redundant (since losing one doesn't fully block resistance), but their combined loss is worse. \n\nIn terms of epistasis, since each contributes to a different pathway, there's no epistatic relationship between them. The epistasis is only G2 over both. \n\nSo the question's options don't mention that, so maybe the answer is D, but why? \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. If they are redundant, then losing both would lead to a more severe phenotype. But redundancy usually requires that each can compensate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where both are needed. For example, if G1's product requires G3's product to function, then they are in a linear pathway. \n\nIn that case, G1 is upstream of G3. So losing G1 would prevent G3 from working, but G3's loss only removes itself. \n\nWait, but then the g1 mutant would have no G1, so G3 can't function, leading to a resistance level equal to the g3 mutant? But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which contradicts. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, G3 is upstream of G1. So losing G3 would prevent G1 from working. Then, the g3 mutant would have both G3 and G1 non-functional, so their combined effect is worse than just losing G3. Wait, but g3's resistance is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel but not redundant. Their combined loss is additive. \n\nThe key is to find which option matches the data. \n\nLooking at the options again: \n\nOption B: G3 is epistatic to G1. This would mean that G3's presence is required for G1 to function. \n\nSo in g1 mutant, G3 is still present, so G3 can still function on its own. Hence, the resistance is 75% (maybe G3 contributes 50% and something else?). \n\nIn g3 mutant, G1 can't function because G3 is needed, so the resistance is 50% (maybe G1's contribution is gone, and G3's loss leaves some residual). \n\nThe double mutant has neither, so no function, leading to 10%. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo the correct answer would be B. \n\nWait, but option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Which would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. So in the double mutant, since both are gone, the effect would be the same as g3's single? But the double is worse. \n\nSo D is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B. \n\nWait but I'm confused because the first part of B says \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\". The question doesn't give any info about promoters, so maybe that's a distractor. But the question allows for that option as long as the other parts fit. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me look again at the options. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nGene redundancy would mean that losing one doesn't fully reduce resistance, but losing both does. Since the double has 10%, which is worse than each single, that fits redundancy. But their single mutants have different resistance levels. \n\nRedundancy usually means they can substitute, so their single mutants should have similar levels. Since they don't, that might not be redundancy. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the redundancy isn't complete. For example, each contributes partially, so losing one reduces resistance by some amount, and losing both reduces further. \n\nIn that case, redundancy could still be possible even with different contributions. \n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined loss leads to more severe phenotype. The fact that their single mutants have different levels could be because they contribute different amounts. \n\nFor example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So losing G1 leaves 75%, losing G3 leaves 50%, and losing both leaves 0, but the double is at 10%. \n\nHmm, not exactly 0. Maybe some other factors. \n\nBut the question's options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, if G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1 would mask G3's effect. So in the g3 mutant, the presence of G1 would mean that G3's loss doesn't matter because G1 is still there. But then why is g3's resistance 50%? \n\nIf G3 is redundant with G1, then losing G3 would reduce resistance by the amount G3 contributes. If G1 is epistatic, then maybe G3 can't function if G1 is present. Wait, that would be the opposite. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. \n\nGiven the data, the best fit is option B: G2 is the TF, G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. \n\nIn option B, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the effect of G1 is dependent on G3. So the g1 mutant would still have G3 functioning, so resistance is 75%. \n\nThe g3 mutant would have G1 unable to function (because G3 is needed), so resistance is lower (50%). \n\nThe double mutant has neither, so no function, leading to 10%. \n\nYes, that fits. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B. \n\nWait, but the first part of option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. The question doesn't mention promoters, so that part might be irrelevant or a distractor. But since the other parts fit, and the question allows for that, it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe that part is not necessary, but the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nThe key is that the double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance. Since g2 is already 0%, the addition of g1 doesn't change it. That confirms G2 is epistatic to G1. \n\nSimilarly, g2g3 is 0%, so G2 is epistatic to G3. \n\nNow, between G1 and G3, what's their relationship? \n\nLooking at the g1g3 double's resistance (10%). \n\nIf G1 and G3 are in parallel and each contribute to resistance, their combined loss would be worse than either. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1:75 (so G3 is present, so contributes 25?) \n\ng3:50 (so G1 is present, contributing 50?) \n\nWait, that might add up. 25+50=75, but the wild-type is 100. So maybe there's another factor. \n\nAlternatively, each is necessary for the other's function. \n\nAlternatively, the 75% in g1 suggests that G1's absence reduces resistance by 25%, so G1 contributes 25%. \n\nThe g3's 50% suggests G3 contributes 50%. \n\nCombined, their loss would reduce by 75%, so 25% remaining. But the double is at 10%, which is less. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where their combined presence is required for full function. \n\nAlternatively, the answer must be D, because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. \n\nEven if their single mutants have different levels, their combined loss is worse. \n\nThe question says \"gene redundancy\", which doesn't necessarily require equal contribution. \n\nSo D says G1 and G3 show redundancy and G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nWait, but if they are redundant, then the epistasis between them might not be needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redundancy plus epistasis is the key. \n\nWait, but the question requires choosing the best option. \n\nSince the data shows that when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is much lower than either alone, that suggests they are not redundant but are in parallel. \n\nThe best fit is option B because of the epistatic relationship between G3 and G1. \n\nI think I'll go with B. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check once more. \n\nThe options: \n\nB) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (maybe not important), G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nSo G3's presence is needed for G1's function. \n\nSo, in the g3 mutant, G1 can't function, so the resistance is reduced by G1's contribution plus G3's own. \n\nThe g1 mutant can still use G3's function, so less reduction. \n\nDouble mutant has neither, so no function. \n\nYes, this explains the data. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but the options: \n\nWait the options for B say \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". So G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain because I might have made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is correct. \n\nWait, option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nIf they are redundant, then their combined loss should be worse. \n\nBut if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 masks G3's effect. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is seen. \n\nIn the g3 mutant, G1 is present but epistatic over G3. So G3's loss doesn't matter because G1 is there. But then why is the g3 mutant's resistance 50%? \n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nTherefore, D is not correct. \n\nSo, the correct answer must be B. \n\nAnswer: B\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes G1, G2, and G3, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants and double mutants. \n\n- **G2's role as a transcription factor**: The g2 single mutant and all double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) show 0% resistance, indicating G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. \n- **G1 and G3 interaction**: \n  - The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance, while the g3 single mutant has 50%, indicating G1 contributes more to resistance than G3 when acting alone.\n  - The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, significantly worse than either single mutant. This suggests their functions are not redundant but dependent on each other. \n  - If G3 is epistatic to G1, G3's presence is required for G1's function. In the g3 mutant, G1 cannot function, reducing resistance further (50%). In the g1 mutant, G3 can still function independently, yielding 75% resistance. The double mutant (g1g3) loses both, leading to minimal resistance (10%).\n\n**Option Analysis**:\n- **A** is incorrect because G1 being a TF would cause severe resistance loss in g1, but g1 has 75% resistance.\n- **B** fits: G2 is the TF, G3 is epistatic to G1 (explaining the resistance levels), and the same promoter detail is not critical.\n- **C** and **D** fail because epistasis in C contradicts the data (g1g3 is worse than g1), and D\u2019s redundancy assumption is incompatible with differing single mutant resistances.\n\n**Answer: B**  \nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about figuring out the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experiment involved knockout mutants and double mutants, and we have their resistance levels compared to the wild-type. The question is asking which conclusion about their interactions is correct based on the results.\n\nFirst, let's recap the data given. The wild-type is 100%. The single mutants: g1 has 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%. The double mutants: g1g2 is 0%, g1g3 is 10%, and g2g3 is 0%. \n\nThe key here is understanding epistasis and redundancy. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks the effect of another. If a double mutant shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. For example, if the double mutant g1g2 has the same as g2, then G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when you remove G2, the effect of G1 is hidden.\n\nLooking at the data, the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance. The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) both also have 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' absence doesn't change the outcome (since they're already at 0%). So G2 might be a transcription factor that's upstream of the others. \n\nNow, let's look at the other mutants. The g1 single mutant has 75%, which is a partial loss. The g3 has 50%. The double g1g3 has 10%. That's way lower than either single. This might suggest that G1 and G3 are acting in parallel pathways. If they are redundant, meaning they can each contribute to resistance but together their loss leads to a worse outcome. Wait, but redundancy usually means that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So in a double knockout, you lose both and the effect is additive. But here, the single mutants have 75 and 50, which when combined, the resistance is 10. That's a big drop. So maybe they are part of the same pathway but not redundant? Or perhaps their functions are additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both require G2. Since G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's necessary for activating both G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the g1 mutant, since G2 is still present, maybe G3 is still active, so you get partial resistance. Similarly, in g3, G1 is still active, giving some resistance. \n\nLet me think about the options now. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. Wait, but if G1 is the TF, then the g1 mutant should have a big effect. But in the data, the g1 mutant only has 75% resistance, not 0. So that doesn't fit. Because if G1 is a TF upstream, knocking it out would lead to loss of downstream genes, which might result in low resistance. But since g1 is still at 75, maybe that's not the case. So A might not be right.\n\nOption B: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure about the same promoter. Also, G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm. If G2 is the TF, then when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed? But in the g2 single mutant, resistance is 0. The double mutants with G2 (like g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0. So the presence or absence of G1 or G3 doesn't matter when G2 is gone. So G2 being a TF makes sense here. Then, looking at the other parts. The question is about the interaction between G1 and G3. The g1g3 double has 10%, which is worse than either single. If they are in the same pathway but redundant, then their combined loss would be worse than either alone. But redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. For example, if each contributes 50% (so together 100%), but when both are gone, 0. But here the single mutants have 75 and 50. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways. Let's see: G1's loss leads to 75% (so maybe it's contributing 25% of the resistance?), and G3's loss is 50% (so contributing 50%). So together, 25 +50? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe their effects are multiplicative. 75% (g1) could mean that when G1 is missing, resistance is 3/4 of wild. G3 missing gives 1/2. So together, if they are independent, the combined effect would be 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5%, but the actual is 10%. That's way lower. So maybe they are in the same pathway, so their combined loss is worse. \n\nOption B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure. The key part here is epistasis between G3 and G1. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 would affect G1's expression. But not sure how that plays here. Let's skip for now.\n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, pleiotropy means one gene has multiple effects. But how does that help here? The epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G1 would mask G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g1. But the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75. So that contradicts. Therefore C can't be right.\n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, redundancy would mean that they can substitute each other. So if you have a single mutant, each loses part of the function, but together they are worse. But the question is about the epistatic relationship. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then when you remove G1, the effect of G3 is masked. But in the g1g3 double, which has both gone, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 alone (75%). That suggests that G1's presence might have been masking some effect of G3? Not sure. Alternatively, redundancy would mean that together they contribute to the same function. So their combined loss leads to a bigger hit. Let's see:\n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, then the single mutants each lose part of the function. The double would lose both. So, for instance, if each contributes 50% of the function, then the single mutants would have 50% each, and the double would have 0. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so their contributions aren't equal. Hmm, but maybe the redundancy isn't complete. Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways, so their combined loss reduces resistance more than either alone. The 10% is much lower than the product (75% *50% is 37.5%), so perhaps they are in series. \n\nWait, the question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Since G2 is a TF in options B, C, D. The data suggests that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0, and any double mutant with G2 is also 0. So G2 is essential. So G2 is likely the TF that's upstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 may be downstream of G2, and their products are necessary for resistance. \n\nNow, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: since G2 is still present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out, leading to 10% resistance. That suggests that both G1 and G3 are contributing to the resistance pathway, and their combined loss is worse than either alone. So they are not redundant because redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So if they are in parallel pathways, their combined loss would be additive. The 10% is much lower than the product of their individual losses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but not redundant. For example, G1's product is required for G3's function. So if G1 is missing, G3 can't do its job. But then the g1 mutant would have G3 still present but not functional, so maybe lower than 75. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 75% for g1 suggests that G1's loss reduces resistance by 25%. G3's loss reduces by half. So maybe G1 contributes more. The double loss would then be even less. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. The options that have G2 as the TF are B, C, D. Let's eliminate A first since G1 as a TF would probably lead to a more severe phenotype in the single mutant, but g1 is only 75. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would lead to a more severe phenotype, which matches the data (g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either single). But redundancy usually implies that each can compensate for the other, so the single mutants would have similar levels. Here, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, so they aren't the same. So maybe not redundancy. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel but not redundant. Let's think about epistasis. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. Wait, epistasis is when one gene's allele masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g3 (since G1's absence can't mask G3's absence). But in reality, the double is 10% which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B?), then the double would have the same as G3's single. But 10% is worse than G3's 50, so that also doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Let's think again. Since G2 is the TF, and the double mutants with G2 (like g1g2) are 0, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. The question is about the relationship between G1 and G3. \n\nThe single mutants: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. The double g1g3 is 10%. So when both are missing, the resistance is much lower. This suggests that they are in separate pathways that are both necessary, so their combined loss reduces resistance more. Like, each contributes to a part of the defense. So their functions are additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So if you knock out G1, you lose G3's function too, but G3's knockout only affects G3. Wait, but the data for g1 is 75, which is better than g3's 50. That might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is downstream of G1, then the g1 mutant would also lose G3's function. But then the g1 single would have a phenotype as bad as g3 or worse. But in reality, g1 is better than g3. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways. So each contributes some resistance. So losing both reduces resistance more. \n\nNow, looking at the options again, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy usually means that each can compensate, so the single mutants would have similar resistance levels. Since their single mutant levels are different (75 vs 50), redundancy might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not redundant, but the question says \"gene redundancy\" is an option. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (so redundant?), and the epistasis is that G1 is epistatic to G3. Wait, but I'm confused. \n\nWait, the question says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in D. Epistasis would mean that the effect of G1 masks G3. So, in the double mutant, since both are knocked out, their combined effect would be the same as the more severe of the two? Or the effect of G3 is masked by G1's presence. Wait, epistasis is tricky here. Let me recall the definition. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the genotype of A determines the phenotype regardless of B's genotype. So if you have a double mutant, the effect would be the same as the more epistatic gene. \n\nSuppose G1 is epistatic to G3. Then the presence of G1 determines the outcome. So in the g1g3 double, since both are missing, maybe it's the same as g1? But the double has 10%, which is worse than g1's 75. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is B? Let me check option B again. \n\nOption B says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. \n\nSame promoter might mean they are co-regulated. But how does that help? The epistatic part: G3 is epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is present, it masks G1's effect. So, in a double mutant where G3 is missing, the effect of G1 would be seen. Wait, but in the g1g3 double, which lacks both, the resistance is 10%. The g1 single has 75, which is better. So if G3 is epistatic over G1, then in the presence of G3, G1's contribution is masked. So when you remove G3, the G1's effect is unmasked, but since G1 is also removed in the double, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is such that G3's function is required for G1's function. So if G3 is knocked out, then G1 can't function. But then the g1 single would still have G3, so G1's absence would lead to lower resistance, but the g3 single would have G1, but G1 can't function because G3 is missing. Wait, but that would mean that the g3 single's resistance would be worse than g1's. Indeed, the g3 single is 50% vs g1's 75. That fits. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, meaning G3 is required for G1's function, then in the g3 mutant, G1 can't do its job, so the resistance is lower. \n\nIn that case, the g1 mutant has G3 still present, so G1's loss only reduces resistance by 25% (since it's 75%). But G3's loss (g3) removes its own function plus G1's function (since G1 needs G3), so the total loss is 50% of control. Wait, but then the g1g3 double would have neither G1 nor G3, so their combined effect would be even worse. Which matches the 10% result. \n\nSo in this scenario, G3 is epistatic to G1. So that would make option B possible. But let's see the options again. Option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. And G1 and G3 have the same promoter. The same promoter might mean that they are transcribed together, but that's maybe not directly relevant. The key point here is the epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, in this model, G3 is epistatic over G1. So the epistasis is G3 over G1, which would fit option B. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the other option D. D says G1 and G3 are redundant. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse, which matches the 10%, but their single mutants have different levels, which might not fit redundancy. But maybe they contribute different amounts. Like, G1 contributes more. \n\nWait, but redundancy usually means they can substitute each other, so their single mutants have similar resistance levels. Since they are different here, maybe not. So perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, let's recap the possible scenarios. \n\nIf G2 is the TF, then both G1 and G3 are downstream of it. \n\nThe g1g3 double has 10%, which is worse than either single. This could mean that G1 and G3 are in separate parallel pathways. So each contributes some resistance. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1 has 75%: so losing G1 reduces resistance by 25%. \n\ng3 has 50%: so losing G3 reduces by half. \n\nCombined, they lose 25+50? But that's additive. But 75-50 would be 25, but the double is 10% (which is 90% loss). So maybe their contributions are multiplicative? \n\nAlternatively, their functions are in series. Like, each step is necessary. So if you lose one, you have partial loss, but losing both is worse. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of G2 allows both G1 and G3 to function. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, even with G2 present, the plant can't resist. \n\nNow, considering the options, D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse, but their single mutants would have similar levels. Since their single mutants have different levels (75 vs 50), that might not be redundancy. \n\nOption B's point about G3 being epistatic to G1 would explain why g3's single mutant is worse than g1's. Because G3 is needed for G1 to function. So in g3's absence, G1 can't function, so losing G3 removes both G3 and the effect of G1. Thus, the g3 mutant's resistance is lower than g1's. \n\nIn the double mutant g1g3, both are gone, so you get even less resistance (10%). \n\nThis model would fit the data. So the epistasis is G3 over G1, which matches option B's \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". \n\nAdditionally, option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure how important that is, but the question doesn't give info about promoters, so maybe that part isn't critical. The main points are G2 as the TF, and the epistasis between G1 and G3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B?\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nIf they are redundant, then the single mutants should have similar resistance levels. Since they don't, that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe redundancy isn't about the same function but different pathways. But redundancy usually implies they can substitute each other. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the redundancy is that they both contribute to the same process, so their combined loss is worse. The different single mutant levels could mean that each contributes a different amount. For example, G1 contributes 25% (so losing it leaves 75%), G3 contributes 50% (so losing it leaves 50%). Together, they contribute 75%, so losing both would leave 0, but the double is 10%. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the total resistance is the sum of their contributions. If wild-type is 100, then G1 contributes 25 (since losing it reduces to 75), and G3 contributes 50 (since losing it reduces to 50). So together, they contribute 75, so losing both would leave 25? But the double is at 10. Not matching. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let's see the options again. \n\nThe question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". Since G2 is the TF, the other genes are downstream. \n\nNow, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% even though G2 is present. So the plant still has G2, but without G1 and G3, it's very susceptible. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are necessary for resistance when activated by G2. Their combined loss removes all resistance (or almost all). \n\nSo their individual losses reduce resistance, but not completely. So they are both required, but not fully redundant. \n\nThe key is the epistasis between G1 and G3. The question is which option explains the 10% in the double. \n\nIf G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B), then the presence of G3 is needed for G1 to function. So in the g3 mutant, G1's function is lost even though G1 is present, hence the lower resistance. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G3 is still present, so G3 can function on its own (since G1 is not needed for G3's function). Hence, the g1 mutant's resistance is better (75%) than g3's (50%). \n\nThe double mutant lacks both, so no function, leading to 10% (maybe some residual?). \n\nThis model fits. \n\nSo the correct answer would be B? \n\nWait, but the options: \n\nOption B says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". The part about the same promoter might not be necessary, but the question doesn't contradict it. The key is the epistasis. \n\nAlternatively, option D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nIf G1 is epistatic over G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be the same as G1's single mutant (since G1's absence would mask G3's). But in reality, the double is 10% which is worse than G1's 75. So that can't be. \n\nSo option B is better. \n\nWait, but the answer options: the correct answer is B or D? \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me try another angle. \n\nThe question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. Since G2 is the TF, the other genes are downstream. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1 is 75%: so when G1 is missing, the plant still has some resistance. Since G2 is present, maybe G2 can still activate G3. \n\ng3 is 50%: so when G3 is missing, the plant still has some resistance from G1. \n\nThe double g1g3 has 10%: so when both are missing, the plant can't get resistance from either, so very low. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are both necessary for full resistance. Each contributes partially. So their functions are additive. \n\nIn this case, their genes are in parallel pathways, so they are not redundant (since losing one doesn't fully block resistance), but their combined loss is worse. \n\nIn terms of epistasis, since each contributes to a different pathway, there's no epistatic relationship between them. The epistasis is only G2 over both. \n\nSo the question's options don't mention that, so maybe the answer is D, but why? \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. If they are redundant, then losing both would lead to a more severe phenotype. But redundancy usually requires that each can compensate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where both are needed. For example, if G1's product requires G3's product to function, then they are in a linear pathway. \n\nIn that case, G1 is upstream of G3. So losing G1 would prevent G3 from working, but G3's loss only removes itself. \n\nWait, but then the g1 mutant would have no G1, so G3 can't function, leading to a resistance level equal to the g3 mutant? But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which contradicts. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, G3 is upstream of G1. So losing G3 would prevent G1 from working. Then, the g3 mutant would have both G3 and G1 non-functional, so their combined effect is worse than just losing G3. Wait, but g3's resistance is 50%, which is better than g1g3's 10%. So that's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in parallel but not redundant. Their combined loss is additive. \n\nThe key is to find which option matches the data. \n\nLooking at the options again: \n\nOption B: G3 is epistatic to G1. This would mean that G3's presence is required for G1 to function. \n\nSo in g1 mutant, G3 is still present, so G3 can still function on its own. Hence, the resistance is 75% (maybe G3 contributes 50% and something else?). \n\nIn g3 mutant, G1 can't function because G3 is needed, so the resistance is 50% (maybe G1's contribution is gone, and G3's loss leaves some residual). \n\nThe double mutant has neither, so no function, leading to 10%. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo the correct answer would be B. \n\nWait, but option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Which would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. So in the double mutant, since both are gone, the effect would be the same as g3's single? But the double is worse. \n\nSo D is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B. \n\nWait but I'm confused because the first part of B says \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\". The question doesn't give any info about promoters, so maybe that's a distractor. But the question allows for that option as long as the other parts fit. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me look again at the options. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nGene redundancy would mean that losing one doesn't fully reduce resistance, but losing both does. Since the double has 10%, which is worse than each single, that fits redundancy. But their single mutants have different resistance levels. \n\nRedundancy usually means they can substitute, so their single mutants should have similar levels. Since they don't, that might not be redundancy. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the redundancy isn't complete. For example, each contributes partially, so losing one reduces resistance by some amount, and losing both reduces further. \n\nIn that case, redundancy could still be possible even with different contributions. \n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined loss leads to more severe phenotype. The fact that their single mutants have different levels could be because they contribute different amounts. \n\nFor example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So losing G1 leaves 75%, losing G3 leaves 50%, and losing both leaves 0, but the double is at 10%. \n\nHmm, not exactly 0. Maybe some other factors. \n\nBut the question's options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, if G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1 would mask G3's effect. So in the g3 mutant, the presence of G1 would mean that G3's loss doesn't matter because G1 is still there. But then why is g3's resistance 50%? \n\nIf G3 is redundant with G1, then losing G3 would reduce resistance by the amount G3 contributes. If G1 is epistatic, then maybe G3 can't function if G1 is present. Wait, that would be the opposite. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. \n\nGiven the data, the best fit is option B: G2 is the TF, G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. \n\nIn option B, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the effect of G1 is dependent on G3. So the g1 mutant would still have G3 functioning, so resistance is 75%. \n\nThe g3 mutant would have G1 unable to function (because G3 is needed), so resistance is lower (50%). \n\nThe double mutant has neither, so no function, leading to 10%. \n\nYes, that fits. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B. \n\nWait, but the first part of option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. The question doesn't mention promoters, so that part might be irrelevant or a distractor. But since the other parts fit, and the question allows for that, it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe that part is not necessary, but the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nThe key is that the double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance. Since g2 is already 0%, the addition of g1 doesn't change it. That confirms G2 is epistatic to G1. \n\nSimilarly, g2g3 is 0%, so G2 is epistatic to G3. \n\nNow, between G1 and G3, what's their relationship? \n\nLooking at the g1g3 double's resistance (10%). \n\nIf G1 and G3 are in parallel and each contribute to resistance, their combined loss would be worse than either. \n\nThe single mutants: \n\ng1:75 (so G3 is present, so contributes 25?) \n\ng3:50 (so G1 is present, contributing 50?) \n\nWait, that might add up. 25+50=75, but the wild-type is 100. So maybe there's another factor. \n\nAlternatively, each is necessary for the other's function. \n\nAlternatively, the 75% in g1 suggests that G1's absence reduces resistance by 25%, so G1 contributes 25%. \n\nThe g3's 50% suggests G3 contributes 50%. \n\nCombined, their loss would reduce by 75%, so 25% remaining. But the double is at 10%, which is less. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in a pathway where their combined presence is required for full function. \n\nAlternatively, the answer must be D, because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. \n\nEven if their single mutants have different levels, their combined loss is worse. \n\nThe question says \"gene redundancy\", which doesn't necessarily require equal contribution. \n\nSo D says G1 and G3 show redundancy and G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nWait, but if they are redundant, then the epistasis between them might not be needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redundancy plus epistasis is the key. \n\nWait, but the question requires choosing the best option. \n\nSince the data shows that when both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is much lower than either alone, that suggests they are not redundant but are in parallel. \n\nThe best fit is option B because of the epistatic relationship between G3 and G1. \n\nI think I'll go with B. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check once more. \n\nThe options: \n\nB) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (maybe not important), G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nSo G3's presence is needed for G1's function. \n\nSo, in the g3 mutant, G1 can't function, so the resistance is reduced by G1's contribution plus G3's own. \n\nThe g1 mutant can still use G3's function, so less reduction. \n\nDouble mutant has neither, so no function. \n\nYes, this explains the data. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but the options: \n\nWait the options for B say \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\". So G3 is epistatic to G1. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain because I might have made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is correct. \n\nWait, option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nIf they are redundant, then their combined loss should be worse. \n\nBut if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 masks G3's effect. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's effect is seen. \n\nIn the g3 mutant, G1 is present but epistatic over G3. So G3's loss doesn't matter because G1 is there. But then why is the g3 mutant's resistance 50%? \n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nTherefore, D is not correct. \n\nSo, the correct answer must be B. \n\nAnswer: B\n\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes G1, G2, and G3, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants and double mutants. \n\n- **G2's role as a transcription factor**: The g2 single mutant and all double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) show 0% resistance, indicating G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This suggests G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. \n- **G1 and G3 interaction**: \n  - The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance, while the g3 single mutant has 50%, indicating G1 contributes more to resistance than G3 when acting alone.\n  - The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, significantly worse than either single mutant. This suggests their functions are not redundant but dependent on each other. \n  - If G3 is epistatic to G1, G3's presence is required for G1's function. In the g3 mutant, G1 cannot function, reducing resistance further (50%). In the g1 mutant, G3 can still function independently, yielding 75% resistance. The double mutant (g1g3) loses both, leading to minimal resistance (10%).\n\n**Option Analysis**:\n- **A** is incorrect because G1 being a TF would cause severe resistance loss in g1, but g1 has 75% resistance.\n- **B** fits: G2 is the TF, G3 is epistatic to G1 (explaining the resistance levels), and the same promoter detail is not critical.\n- **C** and **D** fail because epistasis in C contradicts the data (g1g3 is worse than g1), and D\u2019s redundancy assumption is incompatible with differing single mutant resistances.\n\n**Answer: B**  \nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about figuring out the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experiment involved creating knockout mutants and double mutants, and we have their resistance levels compared to the wild-type. \n\nFirst, let me recall the terms here. A transcription factor is a gene that controls the expression of other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, its absence would affect the expression of other genes. Epistasis means that one gene can mask the effect of another. For example, if two genes are in a pathway, a mutation in the first might make the second's mutation not matter (or vice versa, depending on the pathway).\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistance.\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not completely.\n- g2 (knockout of G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big hit, so G2 is probably crucial.\n- g3 has 50% resistance.\n- Double mutants:\n  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant (75 vs 50, but together it's 10). \n  - g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone). \n  - g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone).\n\nHmm, so when you knock out G2, you get 0% resistance. Adding another mutation (like in G1 or G3) doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G2 is a key gene. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's regulating G1 and G3. Let me think.\n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor, then its absence would prevent the expression of G1 and/or G3. But wait, in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0. So even if G1 and G3 are not expressed because G2 isn't there, but their individual knockouts (g1 and g3) don't have 0. So maybe G2 is essential for the pathway, and G1 and G3 are downstream but redundant?\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng2g3: same as g2 (0%). So losing G3 doesn't make it worse than just losing G2. That suggests that G3's function is redundant with another gene, perhaps G1. Because when you lose G3 along with G2, which already gives 0, so maybe G3's role is covered when G2 is present. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe G3 is one of the genes it regulates, so when G2 is missing, G3 isn't expressed anyway. So in g2g3, G3 is already not expressed because G2 is gone, so knocking out G3 again doesn't add anything. That would make sense. \n\nSimilarly, g1g2 also gives 0%, so G1's loss doesn't affect the outcome when G2 is already missing. So G1 might be regulated by G2 as well, but maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and are redundant. \n\nNow looking at the single mutants:\n\ng1 has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not to zero. g3 has 50% resistance. So G3's loss has a bigger effect than G1. But when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is way worse than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in a parallel pathway, so their combined loss is worse. But since their individual effects are additive, maybe they are partially redundant. \n\nWait, but redundancy would mean that if one is missing, the other can compensate. So if they are redundant, then losing both would be worse. For example, if G1 and G3 are both needed for the same function, then each alone can do some of the job, but together they can do more. So when you lose one, you have half, but when you lose both, you have none? Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, they have 10% resistance, which is much less than either single mutant. So maybe they are not exactly redundant, but part of a pathway where their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is missing, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if you have a mutation in G1, then G3 is still expressed (since G2 is present), so resistance is reduced but not completely. Similarly, G3's mutation would leave G1 expressed. But when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, even with G2 present, you lose both, leading to very low resistance (10%). Wait, but if G2 is present, then maybe G1 and G3 are both needed? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the g1g3 mutant would have both G1 and G3 knocked out. If G2 is still present, then it can activate other genes (maybe not G1 or G3?), but if G1 and G3 are the only ones, then their loss would be critical. But in the single mutants, losing G1 (g1) gives 75% resistance. So perhaps G2's product is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, but they themselves have some other functions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both, then without G2, both are not expressed, so no resistance. But when G2 is present, each gene can contribute. So, in g1, G3 is still active, so you get some resistance (75% maybe from G3's 50% plus some baseline?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the numbers might not add up. Let me think numerically.\n\nIf the wild-type is 100%, and the g1 is 75%, that suggests that G1 contributes 25% (since losing it reduces by 25%). But maybe it's not additive. Alternatively, maybe each gene has a certain effect. Let me think of possible scenarios.\n\nSuppose that G2 is a transcription factor that controls both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Thus, g2 has 0% resistance. When you have a g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance (maybe G3's contribution is 50%, so losing G1 (which contributes 25%) leaves 75% (since 100 -25=75). Similarly, g3 has 50% because G1 is still active (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed) contributing 25% (but wait, 100-50 would be 50, so maybe G3 contributes 50%). Then when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out (g1g3), then even with G2 present, since both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is 10%. That's way lower than the sum of their individual losses. Hmm, maybe this model isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream of both. Let's think of epistatic relationships. \n\nEpistasis: If two genes are in the same pathway, a mutation in an upstream gene would mask the effect of a downstream one. For instance, if G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, then a mutation in G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed. So in the g2 mutant, even if you have a g1 mutation, it doesn't matter because G1 wasn't being expressed anyway. Hence, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 would have the same phenotype as g2. That's exactly what the data shows: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% (same as g2). So this suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, possibly as a transcription factor.\n\nNow, looking at the g1g3 double mutant. Since G2 is present (since it's only knocking out G1 and G3), then if G2 is functional, then maybe G1 and G3 are both needed for the pathway. If they are in parallel, then losing both would be worse. The g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since individually, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, combining them gives a much lower value, which might suggest that they are in a redundant pathway but their combined loss is more severe than either alone. That could indicate redundancy. \n\nRedundancy means that the two genes can perform the same function, so the loss of one doesn't completely abolish the function. But when both are lost, the function is lost. So in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant. \n\nSo putting this together: G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so they are redundant. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nWait, but epistatic here... Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then a mutation in one would not mask the other. Alternatively, maybe epistasis isn't the right term here. \n\nWait, the question mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So G2 is the transcription factor. The options: \n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so that's correct?), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they are redundant, then epistasis might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is between G2 and the others. Since G2 is upstream, a mutation in G2 would mask the effects of G1 or G3 mutations. Which is exactly what we see in the double mutants: g1g2 has the same as g2, so G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly for G3. \n\nBut the options don't mention that. Let me look again at the options. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Epistatic towards would mean that G1's mutation masks G3's. But if they are redundant, maybe losing G1 would mean G3's loss is more pronounced. Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So when you knock out G1 along with G3, it's worse than just G3. So perhaps G1 is epistatic over G3? Wait, no. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is masked by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of a mutation in G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than g1 alone. \n\nHmm, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" part might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps the question's options are structured such that one of them fits. Let me check each option:\n\nOption A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1. Doesn't fit because g2's knockout gives 0% which is worse than g1's 75, so G2 can't be epistatic over G1.\n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated?), G3 is epistatic over G1. Not sure. The double mutants g1g3 are 10%, but if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's mutation would mask G1's, but that's not happening here. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (so they have multiple effects?), G1 is epistatic over G3. Not sure about pleiotropy here. Epistasis between them? \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic over G3. Hmm, maybe the redundancy is the key here. Since their combined loss gives a worse phenotype, that suggests redundancy. \n\nWait, the term \"gene redundancy\" is when two genes can perform the same function, so their loss has an additive effect. For example, if each contributes 50%, then together they give 100%. Losing one leaves 50%, losing both 0. But in this case, the numbers don't exactly fit. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 contributes 25% (since losing it reduces from 100 to 75), and G3 contributes 50% (since losing it reduces to 50). Then together, losing both would be 100 -25-50 =25, but the actual is 10%. So maybe they are not additive but in a pathway where their combined loss is more severe. Alternatively, maybe the redundancy is that they are in parallel pathways, so both must be present for full resistance, but each alone can provide partial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in series. But that would make their combined loss worse, but the numbers might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that when you knock out both G1 and G3 (g1g3), you get 10% resistance. Since G2 is present, but the two genes are both knocked out. Since G2 is a TF that controls them, maybe they are the only effectors, so their loss leads to very low resistance. \n\nIn any case, the options suggest that D is the one where G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" part might be confusing. Wait, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if G1's effect is only seen when G3 is present. But in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss is worse than either alone. That would suggest that they are in a parallel pathway, so they are redundant. So their combined loss removes both pathways, leading to a severe phenotype. \n\nThe term \"gene redundancy\" fits here. So D's first two parts are correct. The third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, maybe the question's answer is D, but why the epistasis part?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and the others. But the options don't mention that. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nHmm, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then a mutation in one might not affect the other's function. So if you have a mutation in G1, then G3 is still functional. But in the case of the double mutant g1g3, they both are missing, so redundancy is lost. The term epistasis here might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, so one is epistatic over the other. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant, suggests that they are in a pathway where their combined loss is additive. But redundancy usually means that the loss of one doesn't affect the other's contribution. So maybe the question's answer is D, but the epistatic part might be a distractor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is between G2 and G1/G3. Since G2 is upstream, so mutations in G2 are epistatic over G1 or G3. But the options don't mention that. \n\nLooking at the options, D seems to fit the first two points (G2 as TF and redundancy between G1/G3). The epistasis part might be a red herring, but perhaps in the options, D is the best fit. \n\nAlternatively, let's think again about the options. \n\nOption D's third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean that if you have a mutation in G1, it masks the effect of a G3 mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than the g3 alone (50%). So that suggests that the presence of the g1 mutation makes the g3 mutation worse. Which would mean that G1 is not epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, epistasis is when the effect of a gene is masked by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then a mutation in G1 would prevent G3's mutation from having an effect. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either alone. So that's the opposite. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is tricky here. Let me think of another angle. \n\nAnother approach: The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still present, so G2 is still active. So maybe G2's product (the TF) is activating some other genes besides G1 and G3? But according to the problem statement, the three genes are the candidates. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are the only effectors, so their loss leads to very low resistance. \n\nWait, the single mutants: \n\ng2 has 0% because G2 is needed to activate G1 and G3. \n\ng1 has 75% resistance because G3 is still active. \n\ng3 has 50% because G1 is still active. \n\nSo perhaps G1 contributes 25% (since 100-75=25 when G1 is missing), and G3 contributes 50% (since 100-50=50 when G3 is missing). So together, they contribute 75% (25+50?), but when both are missing, the total is 10%. That doesn't add up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe their effects are multiplicative. 75% (g1) suggests that G1 is responsible for 25% of the resistance. G3's knockout leaves 50%, so it contributes 50%. If they are in parallel, then together, losing both would have 0, but here it's 10%. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are in a pathway where both are needed. Like, if you need both G1 and G3 for full resistance, then each alone can provide some, but together their loss is worse. But the numbers still don't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10% is due to other minor factors. But the question is about the gene interactions. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n- G2's knockout gives 0%, so it's essential. \n- G1 and G3's knockouts give partial loss. \n- The double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are 0% same as g2, so G2 is upstream. \n- The g1g3 double mutant (without G2's mutation) has very low resistance (10%), suggesting that G1 and G3 are both necessary when G2 is present. So their combined loss is bad. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so they are redundant. So their redundancy means that losing both is worse than losing either. So D's first two statements are correct. \n\nNow, the third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Epistatic would mean that a mutation in G1 masks the effect of G3's mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than g3 alone (50% vs 10%), so that's the opposite. Therefore, that part is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so maybe the third part of the options is wrong. But the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking again at the options: \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Since that's not the case, perhaps another option. \n\nWait, option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic over G3. Pleiotropy means a gene has multiple effects. Not sure how that plays here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and the others. But the options don't state that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, and the epistatic part is a mistake. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding epistasis here. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, the effect is additive (so they are not epistatic, but redundant). The epistasis might be referring to another relationship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The best fit is D, because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The epistasis part might be a distractor, but among the options, D is the only one that correctly states G2 as TF and redundancy between G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, let me check option D again. The third part says G1 is epistatic over G3. If G1 is epistatic, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is masked. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than g3 alone, so that contradicts epistasis. So that part must be incorrect. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is D despite that?

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3, so G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, suppose that G1 is upstream of G3. So G2 is a TF that activates G1, which in turn activates G3. Then, if you knock out G1, G3 isn't activated, so you lose both G1 and G3's functions. But that might not fit the numbers. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then G2 is also a TF. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Since the data points fit best with G2 being the TF upstream of both, and G1 and G3 being redundant, the best option is D, even if the epistasis part is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in D is a mistake, but since D has the first two parts correct, perhaps that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the 75% and 50% are because G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So when both are missing, their combined effect is worse. Thus, they are redundant. \n\nSo I'll go with option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so the problem is about figuring out the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experiment involved creating knockout mutants and double mutants, and we have their resistance levels compared to the wild-type. \n\nFirst, let me recall the terms here. A transcription factor is a gene that controls the expression of other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, its absence would affect the expression of other genes. Epistasis means that one gene can mask the effect of another. For example, if two genes are in a pathway, a mutation in the first might make the second's mutation not matter (or vice versa, depending on the pathway).\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistance.\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not completely.\n- g2 (knockout of G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big hit, so G2 is probably crucial.\n- g3 has 50% resistance.\n- Double mutants:\n  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant (75 vs 50, but together it's 10). \n  - g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone). \n  - g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone).\n\nHmm, so when you knock out G2, you get 0% resistance. Adding another mutation (like in G1 or G3) doesn't make it worse. That suggests that G2 is a key gene. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's regulating G1 and G3. Let me think.\n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor, then its absence would prevent the expression of G1 and/or G3. But wait, in the g2 mutant, resistance is 0. So even if G1 and G3 are not expressed because G2 isn't there, but their individual knockouts (g1 and g3) don't have 0. So maybe G2 is essential for the pathway, and G1 and G3 are downstream but redundant?\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng2g3: same as g2 (0%). So losing G3 doesn't make it worse than just losing G2. That suggests that G3's function is redundant with another gene, perhaps G1. Because when you lose G3 along with G2, which already gives 0, so maybe G3's role is covered when G2 is present. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe G3 is one of the genes it regulates, so when G2 is missing, G3 isn't expressed anyway. So in g2g3, G3 is already not expressed because G2 is gone, so knocking out G3 again doesn't add anything. That would make sense. \n\nSimilarly, g1g2 also gives 0%, so G1's loss doesn't affect the outcome when G2 is already missing. So G1 might be regulated by G2 as well, but maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 and are redundant. \n\nNow looking at the single mutants:\n\ng1 has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance but not to zero. g3 has 50% resistance. So G3's loss has a bigger effect than G1. But when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is way worse than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in a parallel pathway, so their combined loss is worse. But since their individual effects are additive, maybe they are partially redundant. \n\nWait, but redundancy would mean that if one is missing, the other can compensate. So if they are redundant, then losing both would be worse. For example, if G1 and G3 are both needed for the same function, then each alone can do some of the job, but together they can do more. So when you lose one, you have half, but when you lose both, you have none? Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, they have 10% resistance, which is much less than either single mutant. So maybe they are not exactly redundant, but part of a pathway where their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is missing, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if you have a mutation in G1, then G3 is still expressed (since G2 is present), so resistance is reduced but not completely. Similarly, G3's mutation would leave G1 expressed. But when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, even with G2 present, you lose both, leading to very low resistance (10%). Wait, but if G2 is present, then maybe G1 and G3 are both needed? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the g1g3 mutant would have both G1 and G3 knocked out. If G2 is still present, then it can activate other genes (maybe not G1 or G3?), but if G1 and G3 are the only ones, then their loss would be critical. But in the single mutants, losing G1 (g1) gives 75% resistance. So perhaps G2's product is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, but they themselves have some other functions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both, then without G2, both are not expressed, so no resistance. But when G2 is present, each gene can contribute. So, in g1, G3 is still active, so you get some resistance (75% maybe from G3's 50% plus some baseline?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the numbers might not add up. Let me think numerically.\n\nIf the wild-type is 100%, and the g1 is 75%, that suggests that G1 contributes 25% (since losing it reduces by 25%). But maybe it's not additive. Alternatively, maybe each gene has a certain effect. Let me think of possible scenarios.\n\nSuppose that G2 is a transcription factor that controls both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Thus, g2 has 0% resistance. When you have a g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance (maybe G3's contribution is 50%, so losing G1 (which contributes 25%) leaves 75% (since 100 -25=75). Similarly, g3 has 50% because G1 is still active (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed) contributing 25% (but wait, 100-50 would be 50, so maybe G3 contributes 50%). Then when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out (g1g3), then even with G2 present, since both G1 and G3 are missing, the resistance is 10%. That's way lower than the sum of their individual losses. Hmm, maybe this model isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream of both. Let's think of epistatic relationships. \n\nEpistasis: If two genes are in the same pathway, a mutation in an upstream gene would mask the effect of a downstream one. For instance, if G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, then a mutation in G2 would prevent G1 and G3 from being expressed. So in the g2 mutant, even if you have a g1 mutation, it doesn't matter because G1 wasn't being expressed anyway. Hence, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 would have the same phenotype as g2. That's exactly what the data shows: g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% (same as g2). So this suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, possibly as a transcription factor.\n\nNow, looking at the g1g3 double mutant. Since G2 is present (since it's only knocking out G1 and G3), then if G2 is functional, then maybe G1 and G3 are both needed for the pathway. If they are in parallel, then losing both would be worse. The g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since individually, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, combining them gives a much lower value, which might suggest that they are in a redundant pathway but their combined loss is more severe than either alone. That could indicate redundancy. \n\nRedundancy means that the two genes can perform the same function, so the loss of one doesn't completely abolish the function. But when both are lost, the function is lost. So in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant. \n\nSo putting this together: G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so they are redundant. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nWait, but epistatic here... Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then a mutation in one would not mask the other. Alternatively, maybe epistasis isn't the right term here. \n\nWait, the question mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So G2 is the transcription factor. The options: \n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so that's correct?), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they are redundant, then epistasis might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is between G2 and the others. Since G2 is upstream, a mutation in G2 would mask the effects of G1 or G3 mutations. Which is exactly what we see in the double mutants: g1g2 has the same as g2, so G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly for G3. \n\nBut the options don't mention that. Let me look again at the options. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Epistatic towards would mean that G1's mutation masks G3's. But if they are redundant, maybe losing G1 would mean G3's loss is more pronounced. Wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So when you knock out G1 along with G3, it's worse than just G3. So perhaps G1 is epistatic over G3? Wait, no. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is masked by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of a mutation in G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than g1 alone. \n\nHmm, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" part might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps the question's options are structured such that one of them fits. Let me check each option:\n\nOption A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1. Doesn't fit because g2's knockout gives 0% which is worse than g1's 75, so G2 can't be epistatic over G1.\n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so maybe co-regulated?), G3 is epistatic over G1. Not sure. The double mutants g1g3 are 10%, but if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's mutation would mask G1's, but that's not happening here. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (so they have multiple effects?), G1 is epistatic over G3. Not sure about pleiotropy here. Epistasis between them? \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic over G3. Hmm, maybe the redundancy is the key here. Since their combined loss gives a worse phenotype, that suggests redundancy. \n\nWait, the term \"gene redundancy\" is when two genes can perform the same function, so their loss has an additive effect. For example, if each contributes 50%, then together they give 100%. Losing one leaves 50%, losing both 0. But in this case, the numbers don't exactly fit. Let's see: \n\nIf G1 contributes 25% (since losing it reduces from 100 to 75), and G3 contributes 50% (since losing it reduces to 50). Then together, losing both would be 100 -25-50 =25, but the actual is 10%. So maybe they are not additive but in a pathway where their combined loss is more severe. Alternatively, maybe the redundancy is that they are in parallel pathways, so both must be present for full resistance, but each alone can provide partial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in series. But that would make their combined loss worse, but the numbers might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that when you knock out both G1 and G3 (g1g3), you get 10% resistance. Since G2 is present, but the two genes are both knocked out. Since G2 is a TF that controls them, maybe they are the only effectors, so their loss leads to very low resistance. \n\nIn any case, the options suggest that D is the one where G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" part might be confusing. Wait, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if G1's effect is only seen when G3 is present. But in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss is worse than either alone. That would suggest that they are in a parallel pathway, so they are redundant. So their combined loss removes both pathways, leading to a severe phenotype. \n\nThe term \"gene redundancy\" fits here. So D's first two parts are correct. The third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, maybe the question's answer is D, but why the epistasis part?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and the others. But the options don't mention that. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nHmm, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then a mutation in one might not affect the other's function. So if you have a mutation in G1, then G3 is still functional. But in the case of the double mutant g1g3, they both are missing, so redundancy is lost. The term epistasis here might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, so one is epistatic over the other. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant, suggests that they are in a pathway where their combined loss is additive. But redundancy usually means that the loss of one doesn't affect the other's contribution. So maybe the question's answer is D, but the epistatic part might be a distractor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is between G2 and G1/G3. Since G2 is upstream, so mutations in G2 are epistatic over G1 or G3. But the options don't mention that. \n\nLooking at the options, D seems to fit the first two points (G2 as TF and redundancy between G1/G3). The epistasis part might be a red herring, but perhaps in the options, D is the best fit. \n\nAlternatively, let's think again about the options. \n\nOption D's third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean that if you have a mutation in G1, it masks the effect of a G3 mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than the g3 alone (50%). So that suggests that the presence of the g1 mutation makes the g3 mutation worse. Which would mean that G1 is not epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, epistasis is when the effect of a gene is masked by another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then a mutation in G1 would prevent G3's mutation from having an effect. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either alone. So that's the opposite. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is tricky here. Let me think of another angle. \n\nAnother approach: The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still present, so G2 is still active. So maybe G2's product (the TF) is activating some other genes besides G1 and G3? But according to the problem statement, the three genes are the candidates. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are the only effectors, so their loss leads to very low resistance. \n\nWait, the single mutants: \n\ng2 has 0% because G2 is needed to activate G1 and G3. \n\ng1 has 75% resistance because G3 is still active. \n\ng3 has 50% because G1 is still active. \n\nSo perhaps G1 contributes 25% (since 100-75=25 when G1 is missing), and G3 contributes 50% (since 100-50=50 when G3 is missing). So together, they contribute 75% (25+50?), but when both are missing, the total is 10%. That doesn't add up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe their effects are multiplicative. 75% (g1) suggests that G1 is responsible for 25% of the resistance. G3's knockout leaves 50%, so it contributes 50%. If they are in parallel, then together, losing both would have 0, but here it's 10%. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are in a pathway where both are needed. Like, if you need both G1 and G3 for full resistance, then each alone can provide some, but together their loss is worse. But the numbers still don't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10% is due to other minor factors. But the question is about the gene interactions. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n- G2's knockout gives 0%, so it's essential. \n- G1 and G3's knockouts give partial loss. \n- The double mutants with G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are 0% same as g2, so G2 is upstream. \n- The g1g3 double mutant (without G2's mutation) has very low resistance (10%), suggesting that G1 and G3 are both necessary when G2 is present. So their combined loss is bad. \n\nThis suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so they are redundant. So their redundancy means that losing both is worse than losing either. So D's first two statements are correct. \n\nNow, the third part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Epistatic would mean that a mutation in G1 masks the effect of G3's mutation. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than g3 alone (50% vs 10%), so that's the opposite. Therefore, that part is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so maybe the third part of the options is wrong. But the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking again at the options: \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Since that's not the case, perhaps another option. \n\nWait, option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic over G3. Pleiotropy means a gene has multiple effects. Not sure how that plays here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and the others. But the options don't state that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, and the epistatic part is a mistake. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding epistasis here. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that when you have both G1 and G3 knocked out, the effect is additive (so they are not epistatic, but redundant). The epistasis might be referring to another relationship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The best fit is D, because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. The epistasis part might be a distractor, but among the options, D is the only one that correctly states G2 as TF and redundancy between G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, let me check option D again. The third part says G1 is epistatic over G3. If G1 is epistatic, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is masked. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than g3 alone, so that contradicts epistasis. So that part must be incorrect. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is D despite that? Or perhaps another option. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nThe question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of another. So G2 is upstream. \n\nThe double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) show the same as g2, so G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n\nBut the options don't mention that. The options mention whether G1 is epistatic over G3 or something else. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says G1 is epistatic over G3. But in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than either single, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct answer is D but the epistatic part is a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3, so G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, suppose that G1 is upstream of G3. So G2 is a TF that activates G1, which in turn activates G3. Then, if you knock out G1, G3 isn't activated, so you lose both G1 and G3's functions. But that might not fit the numbers. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then G2 is also a TF. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Since the data points fit best with G2 being the TF upstream of both, and G1 and G3 being redundant, the best option is D, even if the epistasis part is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in D is a mistake, but since D has the first two parts correct, perhaps that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the 75% and 50% are because G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So when both are missing, their combined effect is worse. Thus, they are redundant. \n\nSo I'll go with option D.\n\n\nThe experiment's results indicate that G2 is essential for resistance since its knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance. Double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0%, suggesting G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3.

The g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance) shows a severe phenotype, indicating redundancy between G1 and G3. When both are absent, their combined loss drastically reduces resistance. Among the options, **D** correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor and G1/G3 as redundant. While the epistasis claim in D is unclear, the other options are inconsistent with the data (e.g., A incorrectly places G1 as the TF, B and C misinterpret epistasis or pleiotropy). The redundancy and G2's upstream role align best with **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the given data. Let me start by understanding the problem again. We have three genes G1, G2, G3. The mutants (knock-outs) of each have different levels of resistance to anthracnose. The question is about their interactions, specifically which is a transcription factor, and if there's epistasis or redundancy, etc.\n\nFirst, let's list out the data again:\n\nWild-type (control) is 100% resistance. \n\n- g1 (mutant of G1): 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, resistance is reduced but not completely. \n- g2 (mutant of G2): 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant is fully susceptible. \n- g3 (mutant of G3): 50% resistance. So losing G3 cuts resistance by half compared to wild-type. \n\nNow the double mutants:\n\n- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant. The single mutants were 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), so combining them gives a much lower value. \n- g2g3: 0% same as g2. So combining g2 and g3 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. \n- g1g2: 0% same as g2. So combining g1 and g2 gives same as g2 alone. \n\nThe question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes. So, one of them is a regulator. The options suggest that G2 might be that transcription factor in some cases. Let me think through each option.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the data. Since the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, that suggests that G2 is critical. The double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0%, so they don't get worse than g2 alone. That might mean that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because epistasis is when one gene masks or modifies the effect of another. So if G2's mutation is so bad that even when you knock out another gene, you can't get worse than 0%, that suggests G2 is upstream or dominant in the pathway. \n\nLooking at the single mutants: G2's knockout leads to complete loss of resistance. So maybe G2 is essential for the pathway. Then, the other genes (G1 and G3) might be acting in parallel pathways. Let's see the double mutants. \n\ng1g3 has 10%, which is lower than the sum of their individual effects. Wait, the individual effects are 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). The combination is 10%, which is much worse. So maybe they are in a parallel pathway, but when both are knocked out, the effect is additive in a way that's worse? Or perhaps they are redundant. Wait, redundancy would mean that if both are missing, the effect is worse than either alone. For example, if each is 50%, then together they might be 0% if they are redundant. But here, G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%, so their combination is 10%. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that's downstream of G2. Since G2 is a transcription factor, it might regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed? Wait but then the g2 mutant would have 0% resistance. But then, if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance left. So that might not fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3. Let's see. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, when you knock out G1, you still have G3 (since G2 is present), so the resistance is only reduced by G1's loss. Similarly, knocking out G3 leaves G1 active. That would fit. \n\nIn that case, G2's knockout would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. Then, the g1 mutant still has G3 (since G2 is functional), so resistance is reduced (75%) but not gone. Similarly, g3 has G1 active. \n\nNow, the double mutants. \n\ng1g2: since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't matter anymore. So the resistance is same as g2 (0%). That matches the data. \n\ng2g3: same as above, since G2 is out, G3's knockout doesn't matter. \n\ng1g3: Here, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. Wait, no, in g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out, so G2 is still present. Wait, that's a key point. \n\nWait, the double mutant g1g3 has both G1 and G3 knocked out, but G2 is still present. But the resistance is 10%. \n\nHmm. So if G2 is functional, then it can activate other genes. But in this case, G1 and G3 are both knocked out. Since G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1 and G3, even with G2 active, the plant can't produce those gene products. So the resistance would be lower than if only one was missing. \n\nSo, when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), the plant can't get the benefits from either. Since G2 is still present, but it can't activate them, so maybe the remaining resistance is from other pathways? But the resistance here is 10%, which is very low. \n\nWait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. That suggests that G3 is still active. So when G1 is missing, but G3 is present, resistance is 75%. Similarly, when G3 is missing, G1 is present, giving 50% resistance. \n\nWait, that's inconsistent. If G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is knocked out, then neither is expressed. But in the single mutants:\n\n- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, but G1 is not. So the resistance is 75%. \n\n- g3: G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, but G3 is not. That gives 50% resistance. \n\nSo the presence of G1 (with G3 missing) gives 50% resistance, but G3 (with G1 missing) gives 75%? Wait, no, the g3 mutant's resistance is 50%, which would mean that G3's contribution is higher than G1's? Because when G3 is knocked out, the remaining G1 only gives 50%? Wait, maybe I have that backwards. \n\nWait, in the g1 mutant (G1 knocked out), the resistance is 75% because G3 is still present. So G3's contribution must be higher. Because when G3 is missing (g3 mutant), resistance is 50%, which is lower. \n\nSo G3's presence gives more resistance than G1's. \n\nSo, the idea is that G2 activates both G1 and G3. The single mutants have one of them missing but the other still active, so they still have some resistance. \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has both G1 and G3 missing. So even though G2 is active, since those two genes are knocked out, their absence reduces resistance further. The result is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. \n\nNow, the question is about the relationships between the genes. The options involve terms like transcription factor, pleiotropy, epistasis, redundancy. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1. \n\nHmm. But earlier analysis suggests G2 is the TF. Because when G2 is knocked out, you get 0%, and the other genes can't compensate. \n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. \n\nSame promoter might mean they are co-regulated, but not sure. The epistatic part: if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's effect is masked by G1? Not sure. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nPleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but the question is about their interaction in the resistance pathway. \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nRedundancy would mean that they can substitute for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone, which matches the g1g3's 10%. \n\nSo in this scenario, if G1 and G3 are redundant (i.e., they can each contribute to resistance but can compensate for each other), then when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further. \n\nSo, in the case of the single mutants, losing one leaves the other active, so resistance is reduced but not completely. The double mutant loses both, so their combined absence causes a much lower resistance. \n\nIn this case, the fact that G2 is a transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3 would fit. The redundancy between G1 and G3 explains why their double knockout is worse than either single. \n\nNow, the question is about which option matches this. \n\nOption D says that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, epistatic over G3 would mean that G1's effect is masked by G3? Or the other way around? Epistasis is when one gene's effect is modified by another. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their effects are additive or parallel. So perhaps there's no epistasis between them, but the redundancy explains their interaction. \n\nLooking at option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, not sure. Let's think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their combined absence reduces resistance more. So redundancy. \n\nIn that case, the epistatic relationship would be that one gene's effect is dependent on the other. For example, if G1's function requires G3, then G3 is epistatic over G1. But in this case, the single mutants have some resistance even when one is missing, so maybe they don't require each other. \n\nAlternatively, since G2 is the TF, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream and redundant. \n\nSo, the options need to be checked again. \n\nOption D states: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, the redundancy is the key here. If they are redundant, their combined knockout leads to worse effect. So that's in line with D's first two points. \n\nThe third part: G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nEpistasis would mean that the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So, if G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen? But in the single mutants, when G1 is missing, G3's presence gives 75% resistance. When G3 is missing, G1 gives 50%. So maybe G3's contribution is higher than G1's. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of G1 might suppress the effect of G3. But that doesn't fit the data. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis here is not between G1 and G3, but between G2 and the others. Since G2 is the TF, so G2's effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect is 0% regardless of the other genes. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. Since G2 is that, and the others are downstream. \n\nThe redundancy between G1 and G3 would explain why their double mutant is worse than either single. \n\nLooking at the options, D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic over G3. But maybe the epistasis is not needed here. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer might be D, because the redundancy is the key here, and the other parts. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. Same promoter might mean they are co-regulated, which could be part of the TF's role. But the epistasis part may not fit. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (each affects multiple traits), but the data is about their interaction in resistance. Not sure if that's relevant. \n\nOption D's redundancy makes sense. Let's see the other options again. \n\nThe key is that the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is much lower than either single. So redundancy would mean that they both contribute to the same pathway, so losing both makes it worse. \n\nTherefore, D's first two points (G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant) fit. The third part is about epistasis. \n\nWait, if they are redundant, maybe there's no epistatic relationship between them. But the question says \"at least one is a TF acting upstream of other genes\". So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. \n\nIn that case, the epistasis might be that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, because when G2 is knocked out (the TF), the downstream genes can't be expressed, so their presence or absence doesn't matter. Which is why the double mutants with G2 and another gene have the same as G2 alone. \n\nBut the options don't mention G2 being epistatic over the others. The options are about which of the genes' relationships are epistatic. \n\nSo in D, the epistasis is between G1 and G3. But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is not between them but between G2 and others. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, because the redundancy is correct, and the epistasis part might be a distractor. Wait, the question says \"which conclusion can you draw from this experiment\". The options may have multiple correct parts. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nThe redundancy part is correct. The epistasis part may or may not be. Let me think about epistasis. \n\nEpistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of a functional G1 might mask the effect of G3. But in the data, when G1 is present (g3 mutant), resistance is 50%. When G3 is present (g1 mutant), resistance is 75%. So if G1's presence allows for higher resistance when G3 is missing, maybe that suggests that G1 is more important. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's presence would affect G1's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is not between G1 and G3, but the question requires choosing from the options given. \n\nSince the options don't have a choice that says G2 is epistatic over the others, but the redundancy between G1 and G3 is a valid conclusion, so D's first two points are correct. \n\nThe third part says G1 is epistatic over G3. Let me see: if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is not seen? But in the g1 mutant, G3 is still present (since G2 is functional), and the resistance is 75%. So maybe G3 is contributing. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe when G1 is present, it suppresses G3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 10% in g1g3 could be because when both are missing, their combined absence leads to a worse effect than either alone. That's redundancy. \n\nSo maybe the epistasis part in D is incorrect, but redundancy is correct. Since the question gives options, perhaps D is the best fit. \n\nLooking at other options:\n\nOption B: G3 is epistatic over G1. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's presence would mask G1's effect. For example, in the g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), the G1 is present, but maybe the effect is worse because G3 is needed to activate G1. But in the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, which is better than 0. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is not needed here, but the redundancy is key. Since D includes redundancy and the TF is G2, that's probably the right answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe experiment shows that the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is critical for resistance. Double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, suggesting G2\u2019s effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, implying redundancy between G1 and G3. Since G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3 (as its knockout eliminates resistance entirely), and G1 and G3 are redundant (their combined loss worsens resistance), the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and epistasis between G1 and G3 is not required. Option D matches these conclusions.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the given data. Let me start by understanding the problem again. We have three genes G1, G2, G3. The mutants (knock-outs) of each have different levels of resistance to anthracnose. The question is about their interactions, specifically which is a transcription factor, and if there's epistasis or redundancy, etc.\n\nFirst, let's list out the data again:\n\nWild-type (control) is 100% resistance. \n\n- g1 (mutant of G1): 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, resistance is reduced but not completely. \n- g2 (mutant of G2): 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant is fully susceptible. \n- g3 (mutant of G3): 50% resistance. So losing G3 cuts resistance by half compared to wild-type. \n\nNow the double mutants:\n\n- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant. The single mutants were 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), so combining them gives a much lower value. \n- g2g3: 0% same as g2. So combining g2 and g3 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. \n- g1g2: 0% same as g2. So combining g1 and g2 gives same as g2 alone. \n\nThe question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes. So, one of them is a regulator. The options suggest that G2 might be that transcription factor in some cases. Let me think through each option.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the data. Since the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, that suggests that G2 is critical. The double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0%, so they don't get worse than g2 alone. That might mean that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because epistasis is when one gene masks or modifies the effect of another. So if G2's mutation is so bad that even when you knock out another gene, you can't get worse than 0%, that suggests G2 is upstream or dominant in the pathway. \n\nLooking at the single mutants: G2's knockout leads to complete loss of resistance. So maybe G2 is essential for the pathway. Then, the other genes (G1 and G3) might be acting in parallel pathways. Let's see the double mutants. \n\ng1g3 has 10%, which is lower than the sum of their individual effects. Wait, the individual effects are 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). The combination is 10%, which is much worse. So maybe they are in a parallel pathway, but when both are knocked out, the effect is additive in a way that's worse? Or perhaps they are redundant. Wait, redundancy would mean that if both are missing, the effect is worse than either alone. For example, if each is 50%, then together they might be 0% if they are redundant. But here, G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%, so their combination is 10%. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a pathway that's downstream of G2. Since G2 is a transcription factor, it might regulate G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't be expressed? Wait but then the g2 mutant would have 0% resistance. But then, if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance left. So that might not fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3. Let's see. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, when you knock out G1, you still have G3 (since G2 is present), so the resistance is only reduced by G1's loss. Similarly, knocking out G3 leaves G1 active. That would fit. \n\nIn that case, G2's knockout would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. Then, the g1 mutant still has G3 (since G2 is functional), so resistance is reduced (75%) but not gone. Similarly, g3 has G1 active. \n\nNow, the double mutants. \n\ng1g2: since G2 is already knocked out, G1's knockout doesn't matter anymore. So the resistance is same as g2 (0%). That matches the data. \n\ng2g3: same as above, since G2 is out, G3's knockout doesn't matter. \n\ng1g3: Here, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. Wait, no, in g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out, so G2 is still present. Wait, that's a key point. \n\nWait, the double mutant g1g3 has both G1 and G3 knocked out, but G2 is still present. But the resistance is 10%. \n\nHmm. So if G2 is functional, then it can activate other genes. But in this case, G1 and G3 are both knocked out. Since G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1 and G3, even with G2 active, the plant can't produce those gene products. So the resistance would be lower than if only one was missing. \n\nSo, when both G1 and G3 are missing (g1g3), the plant can't get the benefits from either. Since G2 is still present, but it can't activate them, so maybe the remaining resistance is from other pathways? But the resistance here is 10%, which is very low. \n\nWait, but in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. That suggests that G3 is still active. So when G1 is missing, but G3 is present, resistance is 75%. Similarly, when G3 is missing, G1 is present, giving 50% resistance. \n\nWait, that's inconsistent. If G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is knocked out, then neither is expressed. But in the single mutants:\n\n- g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, but G1 is not. So the resistance is 75%. \n\n- g3: G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, but G3 is not. That gives 50% resistance. \n\nSo the presence of G1 (with G3 missing) gives 50% resistance, but G3 (with G1 missing) gives 75%? Wait, no, the g3 mutant's resistance is 50%, which would mean that G3's contribution is higher than G1's? Because when G3 is knocked out, the remaining G1 only gives 50%? Wait, maybe I have that backwards. \n\nWait, in the g1 mutant (G1 knocked out), the resistance is 75% because G3 is still present. So G3's contribution must be higher. Because when G3 is missing (g3 mutant), resistance is 50%, which is lower. \n\nSo G3's presence gives more resistance than G1's. \n\nSo, the idea is that G2 activates both G1 and G3. The single mutants have one of them missing but the other still active, so they still have some resistance. \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has both G1 and G3 missing. So even though G2 is active, since those two genes are knocked out, their absence reduces resistance further. The result is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. \n\nNow, the question is about the relationships between the genes. The options involve terms like transcription factor, pleiotropy, epistasis, redundancy. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic over G1. \n\nHmm. But earlier analysis suggests G2 is the TF. Because when G2 is knocked out, you get 0%, and the other genes can't compensate. \n\nOption B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. \n\nSame promoter might mean they are co-regulated, but not sure. The epistatic part: if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's effect is masked by G1? Not sure. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nPleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but the question is about their interaction in the resistance pathway. \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nRedundancy would mean that they can substitute for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone, which matches the g1g3's 10%. \n\nSo in this scenario, if G1 and G3 are redundant (i.e., they can each contribute to resistance but can compensate for each other), then when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further. \n\nSo, in the case of the single mutants, losing one leaves the other active, so resistance is reduced but not completely. The double mutant loses both, so their combined absence causes a much lower resistance. \n\nIn this case, the fact that G2 is a transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3 would fit. The redundancy between G1 and G3 explains why their double knockout is worse than either single. \n\nNow, the question is about which option matches this. \n\nOption D says that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, epistatic over G3 would mean that G1's effect is masked by G3? Or the other way around? Epistasis is when one gene's effect is modified by another. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their effects are additive or parallel. So perhaps there's no epistasis between them, but the redundancy explains their interaction. \n\nLooking at option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, not sure. Let's think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their combined absence reduces resistance more. So redundancy. \n\nIn that case, the epistatic relationship would be that one gene's effect is dependent on the other. For example, if G1's function requires G3, then G3 is epistatic over G1. But in this case, the single mutants have some resistance even when one is missing, so maybe they don't require each other. \n\nAlternatively, since G2 is the TF, maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream and redundant. \n\nSo, the options need to be checked again. \n\nOption D states: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nWait, the redundancy is the key here. If they are redundant, their combined knockout leads to worse effect. So that's in line with D's first two points. \n\nThe third part: G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nEpistasis would mean that the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So, if G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen? But in the single mutants, when G1 is missing, G3's presence gives 75% resistance. When G3 is missing, G1 gives 50%. So maybe G3's contribution is higher than G1's. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of G1 might suppress the effect of G3. But that doesn't fit the data. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis here is not between G1 and G3, but between G2 and the others. Since G2 is the TF, so G2's effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect is 0% regardless of the other genes. \n\nLooking at the options again. \n\nOption D says \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. Since G2 is that, and the others are downstream. \n\nThe redundancy between G1 and G3 would explain why their double mutant is worse than either single. \n\nLooking at the options, D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic over G3. But maybe the epistasis is not needed here. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer might be D, because the redundancy is the key here, and the other parts. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic over G1. Same promoter might mean they are co-regulated, which could be part of the TF's role. But the epistasis part may not fit. \n\nOption C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (each affects multiple traits), but the data is about their interaction in resistance. Not sure if that's relevant. \n\nOption D's redundancy makes sense. Let's see the other options again. \n\nThe key is that the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is much lower than either single. So redundancy would mean that they both contribute to the same pathway, so losing both makes it worse. \n\nTherefore, D's first two points (G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant) fit. The third part is about epistasis. \n\nWait, if they are redundant, maybe there's no epistatic relationship between them. But the question says \"at least one is a TF acting upstream of other genes\". So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. \n\nIn that case, the epistasis might be that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, because when G2 is knocked out (the TF), the downstream genes can't be expressed, so their presence or absence doesn't matter. Which is why the double mutants with G2 and another gene have the same as G2 alone. \n\nBut the options don't mention G2 being epistatic over the others. The options are about which of the genes' relationships are epistatic. \n\nSo in D, the epistasis is between G1 and G3. But maybe that's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is not between them but between G2 and others. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, because the redundancy is correct, and the epistasis part might be a distractor. Wait, the question says \"which conclusion can you draw from this experiment\". The options may have multiple correct parts. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nThe redundancy part is correct. The epistasis part may or may not be. Let me think about epistasis. \n\nEpistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the presence of a functional G1 might mask the effect of G3. But in the data, when G1 is present (g3 mutant), resistance is 50%. When G3 is present (g1 mutant), resistance is 75%. So if G1's presence allows for higher resistance when G3 is missing, maybe that suggests that G1 is more important. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's presence would affect G1's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is not between G1 and G3, but the question requires choosing from the options given. \n\nSince the options don't have a choice that says G2 is epistatic over the others, but the redundancy between G1 and G3 is a valid conclusion, so D's first two points are correct. \n\nThe third part says G1 is epistatic over G3. Let me see: if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is not seen? But in the g1 mutant, G3 is still present (since G2 is functional), and the resistance is 75%. So maybe G3 is contributing. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe when G1 is present, it suppresses G3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 10% in g1g3 could be because when both are missing, their combined absence leads to a worse effect than either alone. That's redundancy. \n\nSo maybe the epistasis part in D is incorrect, but redundancy is correct. Since the question gives options, perhaps D is the best fit. \n\nLooking at other options:\n\nOption B: G3 is epistatic over G1. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's presence would mask G1's effect. For example, in the g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), the G1 is present, but maybe the effect is worse because G3 is needed to activate G1. But in the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, which is better than 0. So maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the epistasis is not needed here, but the redundancy is key. Since D includes redundancy and the TF is G2, that's probably the right answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D.\n\n\nThe experiment shows that the g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is critical for resistance. Double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, suggesting G2\u2019s effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. The g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, implying redundancy between G1 and G3. Since G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3 (as its knockout eliminates resistance entirely), and G1 and G3 are redundant (their combined loss worsens resistance), the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and epistasis between G1 and G3 is not required. Option D matches these conclusions.\n\nAnswer: D",
