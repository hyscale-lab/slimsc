      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about a Pi(+) meson decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The Pi(+) is stationary, and they give the rest masses of both particles. The options are A to D with different kinetic energy pairs. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, right. Since the Pi(+) is at rest, the decay must conserve momentum and energy. Let me recall the conservation laws here. Because the initial momentum is zero (since Pi is stationary), the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. \n\nThe energy part: the total energy of the products should equal the rest energy of the Pi(+) meson. Because energy is conserved. The rest energy of Pi(+) is its mass times c squared, but since all the energies are given in MeV, I can just use the mass values directly in MeV/c\u00b2, so the rest energy is 139.6 MeV. \n\nThe muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is massless? Wait, neutrinos do have some mass, but maybe in this problem they're assuming it's negligible. Since the problem doesn't mention the neutrino's mass, I think I can treat it as a massless particle. So the neutrino's energy would be equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles, in natural units where c=1). \n\nLet me write down the equations. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p (opposite direction). Since they have to cancel each other out. \n\nThe total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. \n\nThe energy of the muon is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no. Wait, energy for a particle is E = gamma m c\u00b2. Alternatively, in terms of momentum, E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. Since we can work in units where c=1, so E\u00b2 = p\u00b2 + m\u00b2. \n\nSo for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ), and the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p (since E = |p| when mass is zero). \n\nThe total energy must equal the rest energy of the Pi(+) meson. So,\n\nE_mu + E_nu = m_Pi\n\nSubstituting:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that equation down again. Let me use variables for clarity. Let me denote m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV. Let me also let p be the magnitude of the momentum (since direction is accounted for by the signs). \n\nSo the equation is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi.\n\nI need to solve for p. Let me rearrange this equation. Let me call sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p. Then, squaring both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p \n\nThen solving for p:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2\n\nSo p = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_pi squared is (139.6)^2, m_mu squared is (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me compute numerator first: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. Hmm, that's a difference of squares, so (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). Let's calculate that.\n\n139.6 minus 105.7 is 33.9. 139.6 + 105.7 is 245.3. So 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that:\n\n33.9 * 200 = 6,780\n\n33.9 * 45.3 = Let's see, 33.9*40 = 1,356, 33.9*5.3 = ~180.67. So total 1,356 + 180.67 = 1,536.67. So total numerator is 6,780 + 1,536.67 = 8,316.67 approximately. \n\nThen denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo p \u2248 8,316.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let me divide that. Let's see, 279.2 * 30 = 8,376. Which is a bit more than 8,316.67. So 30 - (8,376 -8,316.67)/279.2. The difference is 59.33. So 59.33 /279.2 \u2248 0.213. So approximately 30 - 0.213 \u2248 29.787. Wait, but that's if the numerator is 8,316.67. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 139.6 squared is (140 -0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488 +0.16 is 19488.16. \n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49.\n\nSo m_pi squared minus m_mu squared is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's subtract:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49:\n\n19488.16 - 11000 = 8488.16\n\nThen subtract 172.49: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67. So numerator is 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 100 to make it 83.1567 / 2.792.\n\nHmm, 2.792 * 29 = 81. So 2.792*29.6 = ?\n\nWait 2.792 * 29 = 81. 2.792 *0.6 is 1.6752. So total 81 +1.6752 = 82.6752. \n\nBut 83.1567 is the numerator. So 29.6 gives 82.6752. The difference is 83.1567 -82.6752 = 0.4815. \n\nSo how much more? 0.4815 /2.792 \u2248 0.172. So total p \u2248 29.6 +0.172 \u2248 29.772. So approximately 29.77 MeV/c? Wait, units here. Since the masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, the momentum p would be in units of MeV/c. Because when you square p (MeV/c) and add to (m c^2)^2, you get (E)^2. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units. Let me just proceed numerically.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.77 MeV/c (approximate value). \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is equal to p (since E = pc for massless particles), so E_nu = p \u224829.77 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute that. \n\np\u00b2 is (29.77)^2 \u2248 886. \n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2 = 11,172.49 as before.\n\nSo sqrt(886 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12058.49). Let me compute sqrt(12058.49). \n\nWell, sqrt(12000) is about 109.54. Let's see 109.5^2 = (110 -0.5)^2= 12100 -110 +0.25= 12100-110 is 11990 +0.25= 11990.25. Hmm, so 109.5 squared is 11990.25, but we need sqrt(12058.49). The difference between 12058.49 and 11990.25 is ~68.24. So each additional 0.1 in the sqrt adds roughly (using derivative approximation):\n\nd/dx sqrt(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)). At x=11990.25, sqrt is 109.5. So delta_x = 68.24, so delta_x \u2248 (delta sqrt(x))*(2*109.5). \n\nSo delta sqrt(x) \u2248 68.24/(2*109.5) \u2248 68.24 / 219 \u2248 ~0.312. So total sqrt is 109.5 +0.312\u2248109.81. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.81 MeV. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.81 -105.7 \u22484.11 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is 29.77 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy (since it's massless), so KE_nu is 29.77 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. But let me check my calculations again for possible errors. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the neutrino's kinetic energy. Wait, if the neutrino is massless, then its rest mass is zero, so all its energy is kinetic. So yes, KE_nu is E_nu, which is p. So that part is okay. \n\nThe muon's kinetic energy is correct. So the two KEs are approximately 4.11 and 29.77. The closest option is D: 4.12 and 29.8. So that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Let me see the options again. \n\nOption D is 4.12 and 29.8. Option A is 2.84 and 26.8, which is lower. Option B is 7.2 and 32.8. Hmm, why am I getting 4.1 and ~30?\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation is missing a step. Let me check the equations again. \n\nWait the initial total energy of Pi is 139.6. The muon's energy plus neutrino's energy must equal that. \n\nWait in my calculation, the muon's energy was sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) which is ~109.8, plus p ~29.77 gives total ~139.57, which matches the 139.6. So that's correct. \n\nSo the KE of mu is ~4.1, KE of neutrino ~29.8. So option D. \n\nWait but let me see another way. Let me compute the exact value of p. \n\nThe numerator was (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. \n\n139.6 squared: 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that precisely:\n\n139 *139 = (140-1)^2=19600-280+1=19321. But 139.6 is 0.6 more. Let's do 139.6^2:\n\n(140 -0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 +0.16=19488.16\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7*105.7. Let me compute 105^2 = 11025, plus 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2. \n\nWait 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.49 = 11025 + 147 +0.49= 11172.49. \n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67. \n\nDivide by 2*139.6: 279.2. \n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do this division precisely. \n\n279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 \u00d730 = 8,376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2 = 8096.8? Wait no, 279.2 \u00d7 30 is 8,376. So 279.2 \u00d729 = 8,376 -279.2 = 8,376 -279.2 = 8,096.8. \n\nBut the numerator is 8,315.67. \n\nSo 29 gives 8,096.8. The difference between 8,315.67 and 8,096.8 is 218.87. \n\nNow 279.2 \u00d70.78 = let's see. 279.2 \u00d70.7 = 195.44, 279.2 \u00d70.08=22.336 \u2192 total 195.44 +22.336=217.776. \n\nSo 0.78 would give 217.776. Which is close to 218.87. So total p =29.78 approximately. \n\nSo p\u224829.78 MeV/c. \n\nThen E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCalculating (29.78)^2: 29.78 squared. Let's see, 30^2 is 900. Subtract (0.22)^2 and cross terms. \n\n(30 -0.22)^2 = 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.22 +0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 +0.0484 = 886.8484. \n\nSo 29.78 squared is ~886.85. \n\nAdding to 105.7 squared (11172.49), total under sqrt is 886.85 +11172.49=12059.34. \n\nSquare root of that: sqrt(12059.34). Let me see 109.8 squared is (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04. \n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. The value is 12059.34, which is 3.3 more. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 109.8 + (3.3)/(2*109.8). \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=12056.04 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) =1/(2*109.8) \u22480.00455. \n\nSo delta x is 3.3, so delta sqrt is approx 3.3 *0.00455 \u22480.015. \n\nThus sqrt \u2248109.8 +0.015 \u2248109.815. \n\nSo E_mu is ~109.815 MeV. \n\nThus KE_mu is 109.815 -105.7 = 4.115 MeV, which rounds to 4.12. \n\nAnd the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which rounds to 29.8. So D is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. Option D is exactly that. So the answer should be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the neutrino is massless? The problem didn't specify. But since neutrinos have very small masses, but in many problems like this, especially when not given a mass, they are treated as massless. So that's probably correct. \n\nAnother way to check: The sum of the kinetic energies plus the rest mass of the muon should equal the Pi's rest mass? Wait no, because the total energy is the sum of the energies. The total energy of the muon is its KE + rest mass, and the neutrino's energy is its KE (since rest mass is zero). So total energy is (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu = m_pi. \n\nSo KE_mu + KE_nu + m_mu = m_pi. \n\nSo KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu =139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, the sum of the two KEs in each option must be 33.9. \n\nCheck each option: \n\nA: 2.84 +26.8 = 29.64 \u2192 no. \n\nB:7.2+32.8=40 \u2192 no. \n\nC:3.52 +20.8=24.32 \u2192 no. \n\nD:4.12+29.8=33.92 \u2192 which is approximately 33.9, so that's correct. \n\nSo that confirms it. So D must be the answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n",

So numerator is 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 100 to make it 83.1567 / 2.792.\n\nHmm, 2.792 * 29 = 81. So 2.792*29.6 = ?\n\nWait 2.792 * 29 = 81. 2.792 *0.6 is 1.6752. So total 81 +1.6752 = 82.6752. \n\nBut 83.1567 is the numerator. So 29.6 gives 82.6752. The difference is 83.1567 -82.6752 = 0.4815. \n\nSo how much more? 0.4815 /2.792 \u2248 0.172. So total p \u2248 29.6 +0.172 \u2248 29.772. So approximately 29.77 MeV/c? Wait, units here. Since the masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, the momentum p would be in units of MeV/c. Because when you square p (MeV/c) and add to (m c^2)^2, you get (E)^2. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units. Let me just proceed numerically.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.77 MeV/c (approximate value). \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is equal to p (since E = pc for massless particles), so E_nu = p \u224829.77 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute that. \n\np\u00b2 is (29.77)^2 \u2248 886. \n\nm_mu squared is (105.7)^2 = 11,172.49 as before.\n\nSo sqrt(886 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12058.49). Let me compute sqrt(12058.49). \n\nWell, sqrt(12000) is about 109.54. Let's see 109.5^2 = (110 -0.5)^2= 12100 -110 +0.25= 12100-110 is 11990 +0.25= 11990.25. Hmm, so 109.5 squared is 11990.25, but we need sqrt(12058.49). The difference between 12058.49 and 11990.25 is ~68.24. So each additional 0.1 in the sqrt adds roughly (using derivative approximation):\n\nd/dx sqrt(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(x)). At x=11990.25, sqrt is 109.5. So delta_x = 68.24, so delta_x \u2248 (delta sqrt(x))*(2*109.5). \n\nSo delta sqrt(x) \u2248 68.24/(2*109.5) \u2248 68.24 / 219 \u2248 ~0.312. So total sqrt is 109.5 +0.312\u2248109.81. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.81 MeV. \n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.81 -105.7 \u22484.11 MeV.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is 29.77 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy (since it's massless), so KE_nu is 29.77 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. But let me check my calculations again for possible errors. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the neutrino's kinetic energy. Wait, if the neutrino is massless, then its rest mass is zero, so all its energy is kinetic. So yes, KE_nu is E_nu, which is p. So that part is okay. \n\nThe muon's kinetic energy is correct. So the two KEs are approximately 4.11 and 29.77. The closest option is D: 4.12 and 29.8. So that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options. Let me see the options again. \n\nOption D is 4.12 and 29.8. Option A is 2.84 and 26.8, which is lower. Option B is 7.2 and 32.8. Hmm, why am I getting 4.1 and ~30?\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation is missing a step. Let me check the equations again. \n\nWait the initial total energy of Pi is 139.6. The muon's energy plus neutrino's energy must equal that. \n\nWait in my calculation, the muon's energy was sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) which is ~109.8, plus p ~29.77 gives total ~139.57, which matches the 139.6. So that's correct. \n\nSo the KE of mu is ~4.1, KE of neutrino ~29.8. So option D. \n\nWait but let me see another way. Let me compute the exact value of p. \n\nThe numerator was (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. \n\n139.6 squared: 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that precisely:\n\n139 *139 = (140-1)^2=19600-280+1=19321. But 139.6 is 0.6 more. Let's do 139.6^2:\n\n(140 -0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 +0.16=19488.16\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7*105.7. Let me compute 105^2 = 11025, plus 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2. \n\nWait 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.49 = 11025 + 147 +0.49= 11172.49. \n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67. \n\nDivide by 2*139.6: 279.2. \n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do this division precisely. \n\n279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 \u00d730 = 8,376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2 = 8096.8? Wait no, 279.2 \u00d7 30 is 8,376. So 279.2 \u00d729 = 8,376 -279.2 = 8,376 -279.2 = 8,096.8. \n\nBut the numerator is 8,315.67. \n\nSo 29 gives 8,096.8. The difference between 8,315.67 and 8,096.8 is 218.87. \n\nNow 279.2 \u00d70.78 = let's see. 279.2 \u00d70.7 = 195.44, 279.2 \u00d70.08=22.336 \u2192 total 195.44 +22.336=217.776. \n\nSo 0.78 would give 217.776. Which is close to 218.87. So total p =29.78 approximately. \n\nSo p\u224829.78 MeV/c. \n\nThen E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nE_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nCalculating (29.78)^2: 29.78 squared. Let's see, 30^2 is 900. Subtract (0.22)^2 and cross terms. \n\n(30 -0.22)^2 = 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.22 +0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 +0.0484 = 886.8484. \n\nSo 29.78 squared is ~886.85. \n\nAdding to 105.7 squared (11172.49), total under sqrt is 886.85 +11172.49=12059.34. \n\nSquare root of that: sqrt(12059.34). Let me see 109.8 squared is (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04. \n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. The value is 12059.34, which is 3.3 more. \n\nSo sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 109.8 + (3.3)/(2*109.8). \n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) at x=12056.04 is 1/(2*sqrt(x)) =1/(2*109.8) \u22480.00455. \n\nSo delta x is 3.3, so delta sqrt is approx 3.3 *0.00455 \u22480.015. \n\nThus sqrt \u2248109.8 +0.015 \u2248109.815. \n\nSo E_mu is ~109.815 MeV. \n\nThus KE_mu is 109.815 -105.7 = 4.115 MeV, which rounds to 4.12. \n\nAnd the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which rounds to 29.8. So D is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. Option D is exactly that. So the answer should be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the neutrino is massless? The problem didn't specify. But since neutrinos have very small masses, but in many problems like this, especially when not given a mass, they are treated as massless. So that's probably correct. \n\nAnother way to check: The sum of the kinetic energies plus the rest mass of the muon should equal the Pi's rest mass? Wait no, because the total energy is the sum of the energies. The total energy of the muon is its KE + rest mass, and the neutrino's energy is its KE (since rest mass is zero). So total energy is (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu = m_pi. \n\nSo KE_mu + KE_nu + m_mu = m_pi. \n\nSo KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu =139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, the sum of the two KEs in each option must be 33.9. \n\nCheck each option: \n\nA: 2.84 +26.8 = 29.64 \u2192 no. \n\nB:7.2+32.8=40 \u2192 no. \n\nC:3.52 +20.8=24.32 \u2192 no. \n\nD:4.12+29.8=33.92 \u2192 which is approximately 33.9, so that's correct. \n\nSo that confirms it. So D must be the answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the decay products (muon and neutrino) must be zero, implying their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The total energy of the products equals the rest energy of the pion.\n\nLet \\( m_\\pi = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV} \\), \\( m_\\mu = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV} \\), and \\( p \\) be the magnitude of the muon's momentum.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about the decay of a Pi+ meson into a muon+ and a neutrino. The Pi+ is stationary, and their rest masses are given. The options are A to D with different KE values. Hmm, I need to recall how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the Pi+ is initially stationary, its momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. That means their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nThe rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? Because neutrinos have very tiny masses, so maybe we can treat it as massless for this problem? That might simplify things.\n\nSo the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the Pi+: E_initial = m_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy must equal that. The energy of each particle is their relativistic energy: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). But since the neutrino is massless (assuming), its energy would just be E_\u03bd = p_\u03bd c. And since their momenta are equal and opposite, the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p. So p_mu = p, and p_\u03bd = p, but in opposite directions. \n\nWait, so the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite. Therefore, their vector sum is zero, which satisfies conservation of momentum.\n\nThe total energy after decay is E_mu + E_\u03bd. Let's write that:\n\nE_mu + E_\u03bd = E_initial = 139.6 MeV.\n\nExpressing each energy:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nE_\u03bd = p c (since m_\u03bd is negligible)\n\nSo substituting:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6\n\nHmm, so I need to solve for p here. Let me set variables to simplify. Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nNow rearrange terms to solve for x:\n\n2*139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nCompute the right-hand side. Let me calculate that:\n\nFirst, compute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2. Let me do that step by step. 140^2 is 19600, subtract (0.4)^2 and cross terms. Wait, maybe better to just multiply 139.6 * 139.6. Alternatively, note that (a)^2 - (b)^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right! That's a good point. So (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). Let's compute that.\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nSo the product is 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that. \n\n33 * 245.3 = 33*(240 +5.3) = 33*240=7920, 33*5.3=174.9 \u2192 total 7920+174.9=8094.9\n\nThen 0.9 *245.3 is 220.77. Adding to the previous gives 8094.9 + 220.77 \u2248 8315.67? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 33.9 is 33 +0.9, so the total is (33)(245.3) + 0.9*(245.3) = 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67. \n\nSo RHS is 8315.67 (MeV squared? Because the units are in MeV? Wait, actually, the original terms were in MeV, so the squared terms would be (MeV)^2. But when we take the difference, it's (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) MeV\u00b2. So the right side is 33.9 *245.3 \u22488315.67 (MeV)^2.\n\nSo back to the equation:\n\n2*139.6 x = 8315.67 (MeV\u00b2) \u2192 solving for x:\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6)\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 *139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo x \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDividing 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's see: 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So maybe around 29.7?\n\nWait let me do it more precisely.\n\n279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30 -0.3) = 279.2*30 = 8376, minus 279.2*0.3 = 83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76 = 8292.24. Hmm, that's still a bit under. The numerator is 8315.67. So difference between 8292.24 and 8315.67 is 23.43. So 29.7 + (23.43 /279.2). Since 23.43/279.2 \u22480.084. So total x\u224829.784 MeV. Wait, units? Since x was p c, so the units here are in MeV? Wait, actually, let me check units again.\n\nWait, in the equation, when I set x = p c, so the momentum is p = x/(c). But in the equation above, when I set variables, I used MeV as the energy units. Since in natural units, c is taken as 1, so perhaps the units here are consistent. Because the rest mass energy is in MeV, so the momentum terms would be in MeV/c. So perhaps the x here is in MeV. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider all terms in MeV units, where pc is in MeV (since c is 1 in natural units). Because in particle physics, it's common to use units where c=1, so pc is in MeV, and mass is also in MeV. So that's okay.\n\nSo x \u2248 let's see:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do this division step by step. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. \n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(20+9) = 5584 + 2512.8 = 8096.8. So 29 gives 8096.8. The numerator is 8315.67. So subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo remaining 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 ~0.784. So total x \u224829.784 MeV. So x is approx 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait so x is the value of p c, which is the energy of the neutrino? Because E_\u03bd = p c. So the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. \n\nThen, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute 29.78 squared: 29.78^2 \u2248 (30 -0.22)^2 \u2248 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 \u2248 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo adding the two terms under the sqrt: 886.8484 + 11172.49 \u2248 12059.34 (MeV\u00b2). The square root of that is sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 109.8 MeV.\n\nWait, so the muon's energy is approximately 109.8 MeV. Then the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. Adding those gives 109.8 +29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the initial 139.6, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest energy.\n\nFor the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.\n\nFor the neutrino: KE_\u03bd = E_\u03bd - m_\u03bd c\u00b2. Since m_\u03bd is negligible, the KE is just E_\u03bd, which is 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait but the options are given as pairs. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2.84, 26.8\n\nB)7.2, 32.8\n\nC)3.52,20.8\n\nD)4.12,29.8\n\nHmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.1 and 29.8, which is option D. So that's probably the answer. \n\nWait but let me check my calculations again to be precise. Because maybe I approximated too much. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.\n\nStarting again with the equation:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me compute x again precisely.\n\nWe had:\n\n2 *139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: 279.2 x\n\nRight side: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nCalculating (139.6)^2:\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139 *139 = (140 -1)^2 = 140\u00b2 -2*140 +1 = 19600 -280 +1 = 19321. \n\nBut 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139\u00b2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6\u00b2 = 19321 + 166.8 +0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8 +0.36=19488.16.\n\nWait wait, actually, 139.6 squared:\n\nAlternatively, 139.6 * 139.6:\n\nLet me compute 139 *139 = 19321.\n\nThen 139 *0.6 = 83.4, so 139.6 *139.6 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139\u00b2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6\u00b2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8 plus 0.36 gives 19488.16. So (139.6)^2 =19488.16 (MeV)^2.\n\nSimilarly, (105.7)^2:\n\n105.7 squared. 105^2 = 11025. Then, (105 +0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 = 11025+147 is 11172 +0.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nSo 279.2 x = 8315.67 \u2192 x = 8315.67 /279.2.\n\nLet me compute that division precisely:\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nLet me see:\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 \u00d7 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8\n\nSubtract that from 8315.67:\n\n8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87\n\nSo remaining is 218.87. Now 279.2 \u00d7 0.78 = ?\n\n279.2 \u00d70.7 = 195.44\n\n279.2 \u00d70.08 = 22.336 \u2192 total 195.44 +22.336 =217.776.\n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776. The remaining 218.87 -217.776 =1.094. \n\nSo total x is 29 +0.78 + (1.094/279.2). The 1.094/279.2 is about 0.0039. So total x \u224829.78 +0.0039 \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo x \u224829.784 MeV. \n\nThus, the neutrino's energy is x \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2). Let me compute that again with more precision.\n\nx squared is (29.784)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n29.784 squared:\n\n29^2 =841, 0.784^2 =0.614, cross term 2*29*0.784 =2*22.736 =45.472.\n\nWait, actually, 29.784 is 29 +0.784.\n\nWait, better to compute as (29.784)^2 = (30 -0.216)^2 = 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 =900 -12.96 +0.046656 \u2248900-12.96=887.04 +0.046656\u2248887.086656.\n\nWait that's not right. Wait 30 -0.216 is 29.784. But 29.784 squared:\n\nAlternatively, 29.784 *29.784:\n\nLet me compute 29 *29 =841\n\n29 *0.784 =22.736\n\n0.784 *29 =22.736\n\n0.784 *0.784 \u22480.614.\n\nSo total:\n\n(29 +0.784)^2 =29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.784 +0.784\u00b2 = 841 + 2*22.736 +0.614656\n\n2*22.736 is 45.472. So 841 +45.472=886.472 +0.614656 \u2248887.086656.\n\nSo x squared is \u2248887.086656 (MeV)^2.\n\nAdding (105.7)^2 which was 11172.49 gives total under sqrt:\n\n887.086656 +11172.49 \u2248 12059.576656 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.576656). Let me see, sqrt(12059.58). \n\nWell, 110 squared is 12100. So sqrt(12059.58) is just a bit less than 110. Let me compute 109.8 squared:\n\n109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 =12100 - 2*110*0.2 +0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. The target is 12059.58, which is about 3.54 higher. \n\nEach 0.1 increase in the square root adds roughly 2*109.8*0.1 +0.01 = 21.96 +0.01 =21.97. \n\nWait, perhaps better to use linear approximation. Let me let y =109.8 + delta, such that (y)^2 =12059.58.\n\nWe have (109.8)^2 =12056.04. The difference is 12059.58 -12056.04 =3.54. \n\nSo 2*109.8 * delta \u22483.54 \u2192 delta \u22483.54/(219.6)\u22480.0161.\n\nSo y\u2248109.8 +0.0161\u2248109.816 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nThus, KE_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's KE is 29.784 MeV, which rounds to about 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the pair is approximately (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV), which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the neutrino's KE. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve for the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino in the decay $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$, we use conservation of energy and momentum.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles in a decay process. The question is about the decay of a Pi+ meson into a muon+ and a neutrino. The Pi+ is stationary, and their rest masses are given. The options are A to D with different KE values. Hmm, I need to recall how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the Pi+ is initially stationary, its momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. That means their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nThe rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? Because neutrinos have very tiny masses, so maybe we can treat it as massless for this problem? That might simplify things.\n\nSo the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the Pi+: E_initial = m_\u03c0 c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV.\n\nAfter decay, the total energy must equal that. The energy of each particle is their relativistic energy: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). But since the neutrino is massless (assuming), its energy would just be E_\u03bd = p_\u03bd c. And since their momenta are equal and opposite, the magnitudes of their momenta are the same. Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p. So p_mu = p, and p_\u03bd = p, but in opposite directions. \n\nWait, so the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite. Therefore, their vector sum is zero, which satisfies conservation of momentum.\n\nThe total energy after decay is E_mu + E_\u03bd. Let's write that:\n\nE_mu + E_\u03bd = E_initial = 139.6 MeV.\n\nExpressing each energy:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nE_\u03bd = p c (since m_\u03bd is negligible)\n\nSo substituting:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6\n\nHmm, so I need to solve for p here. Let me set variables to simplify. Let me denote x = p c. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x\n\nNow square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nx\u00b2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x\n\nNow rearrange terms to solve for x:\n\n2*139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nCompute the right-hand side. Let me calculate that:\n\nFirst, compute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2. Let me do that step by step. 140^2 is 19600, subtract (0.4)^2 and cross terms. Wait, maybe better to just multiply 139.6 * 139.6. Alternatively, note that (a)^2 - (b)^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right! That's a good point. So (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). Let's compute that.\n\n139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nSo the product is 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that. \n\n33 * 245.3 = 33*(240 +5.3) = 33*240=7920, 33*5.3=174.9 \u2192 total 7920+174.9=8094.9\n\nThen 0.9 *245.3 is 220.77. Adding to the previous gives 8094.9 + 220.77 \u2248 8315.67? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 33.9 is 33 +0.9, so the total is (33)(245.3) + 0.9*(245.3) = 8094.9 + 220.77 = 8315.67. \n\nSo RHS is 8315.67 (MeV squared? Because the units are in MeV? Wait, actually, the original terms were in MeV, so the squared terms would be (MeV)^2. But when we take the difference, it's (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) MeV\u00b2. So the right side is 33.9 *245.3 \u22488315.67 (MeV)^2.\n\nSo back to the equation:\n\n2*139.6 x = 8315.67 (MeV\u00b2) \u2192 solving for x:\n\nx = 8315.67 / (2 *139.6)\n\nLet me compute denominator first: 2 *139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo x \u2248 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDividing 8315.67 by 279.2. Let's see: 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315. So maybe around 29.7?\n\nWait let me do it more precisely.\n\n279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30 -0.3) = 279.2*30 = 8376, minus 279.2*0.3 = 83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76 = 8292.24. Hmm, that's still a bit under. The numerator is 8315.67. So difference between 8292.24 and 8315.67 is 23.43. So 29.7 + (23.43 /279.2). Since 23.43/279.2 \u22480.084. So total x\u224829.784 MeV. Wait, units? Since x was p c, so the units here are in MeV? Wait, actually, let me check units again.\n\nWait, in the equation, when I set x = p c, so the momentum is p = x/(c). But in the equation above, when I set variables, I used MeV as the energy units. Since in natural units, c is taken as 1, so perhaps the units here are consistent. Because the rest mass energy is in MeV, so the momentum terms would be in MeV/c. So perhaps the x here is in MeV. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider all terms in MeV units, where pc is in MeV (since c is 1 in natural units). Because in particle physics, it's common to use units where c=1, so pc is in MeV, and mass is also in MeV. So that's okay.\n\nSo x \u2248 let's see:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do this division step by step. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. \n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(20+9) = 5584 + 2512.8 = 8096.8. So 29 gives 8096.8. The numerator is 8315.67. So subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.\n\nSo remaining 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 ~0.784. So total x \u224829.784 MeV. So x is approx 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait so x is the value of p c, which is the energy of the neutrino? Because E_\u03bd = p c. So the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. \n\nThen, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's compute 29.78 squared: 29.78^2 \u2248 (30 -0.22)^2 \u2248 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 \u2248 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484.\n\n105.7 squared: 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo adding the two terms under the sqrt: 886.8484 + 11172.49 \u2248 12059.34 (MeV\u00b2). The square root of that is sqrt(12059.34) \u2248 109.8 MeV.\n\nWait, so the muon's energy is approximately 109.8 MeV. Then the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. Adding those gives 109.8 +29.78 \u2248139.58 MeV, which is close to the initial 139.6, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of each particle is their total energy minus their rest energy.\n\nFor the muon: KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.\n\nFor the neutrino: KE_\u03bd = E_\u03bd - m_\u03bd c\u00b2. Since m_\u03bd is negligible, the KE is just E_\u03bd, which is 29.78 MeV. \n\nWait but the options are given as pairs. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2.84, 26.8\n\nB)7.2, 32.8\n\nC)3.52,20.8\n\nD)4.12,29.8\n\nHmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.1 and 29.8, which is option D. So that's probably the answer. \n\nWait but let me check my calculations again to be precise. Because maybe I approximated too much. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.\n\nStarting again with the equation:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6\n\nLet me compute x again precisely.\n\nWe had:\n\n2 *139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: 279.2 x\n\nRight side: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2\n\nCalculating (139.6)^2:\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139 *139 = (140 -1)^2 = 140\u00b2 -2*140 +1 = 19600 -280 +1 = 19321. \n\nBut 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139\u00b2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6\u00b2 = 19321 + 166.8 +0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8 +0.36=19488.16.\n\nWait wait, actually, 139.6 squared:\n\nAlternatively, 139.6 * 139.6:\n\nLet me compute 139 *139 = 19321.\n\nThen 139 *0.6 = 83.4, so 139.6 *139.6 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139\u00b2 + 2*139*0.6 +0.6\u00b2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8 plus 0.36 gives 19488.16. So (139.6)^2 =19488.16 (MeV)^2.\n\nSimilarly, (105.7)^2:\n\n105.7 squared. 105^2 = 11025. Then, (105 +0.7)^2 = 105\u00b2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 = 11025+147 is 11172 +0.49 =11172.49.\n\nSo (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV squared). \n\nSo 279.2 x = 8315.67 \u2192 x = 8315.67 /279.2.\n\nLet me compute that division precisely:\n\nDivide 8315.67 by 279.2.\n\nLet me see:\n\n279.2 \u00d7 29 = 279.2 \u00d7 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8\n\nSubtract that from 8315.67:\n\n8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87\n\nSo remaining is 218.87. Now 279.2 \u00d7 0.78 = ?\n\n279.2 \u00d70.7 = 195.44\n\n279.2 \u00d70.08 = 22.336 \u2192 total 195.44 +22.336 =217.776.\n\nSo 0.78 gives 217.776. The remaining 218.87 -217.776 =1.094. \n\nSo total x is 29 +0.78 + (1.094/279.2). The 1.094/279.2 is about 0.0039. So total x \u224829.78 +0.0039 \u224829.7839 MeV.\n\nSo x \u224829.784 MeV. \n\nThus, the neutrino's energy is x \u224829.784 MeV.\n\nThe muon's energy is sqrt(x\u00b2 + (105.7)^2). Let me compute that again with more precision.\n\nx squared is (29.784)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n29.784 squared:\n\n29^2 =841, 0.784^2 =0.614, cross term 2*29*0.784 =2*22.736 =45.472.\n\nWait, actually, 29.784 is 29 +0.784.\n\nWait, better to compute as (29.784)^2 = (30 -0.216)^2 = 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 =900 -12.96 +0.046656 \u2248900-12.96=887.04 +0.046656\u2248887.086656.\n\nWait that's not right. Wait 30 -0.216 is 29.784. But 29.784 squared:\n\nAlternatively, 29.784 *29.784:\n\nLet me compute 29 *29 =841\n\n29 *0.784 =22.736\n\n0.784 *29 =22.736\n\n0.784 *0.784 \u22480.614.\n\nSo total:\n\n(29 +0.784)^2 =29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.784 +0.784\u00b2 = 841 + 2*22.736 +0.614656\n\n2*22.736 is 45.472. So 841 +45.472=886.472 +0.614656 \u2248887.086656.\n\nSo x squared is \u2248887.086656 (MeV)^2.\n\nAdding (105.7)^2 which was 11172.49 gives total under sqrt:\n\n887.086656 +11172.49 \u2248 12059.576656 MeV\u00b2.\n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(12059.576656). Let me see, sqrt(12059.58). \n\nWell, 110 squared is 12100. So sqrt(12059.58) is just a bit less than 110. Let me compute 109.8 squared:\n\n109.8^2 = (110 -0.2)^2 =12100 - 2*110*0.2 +0.04 = 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.\n\nHmm, so 109.8 squared is 12056.04. The target is 12059.58, which is about 3.54 higher. \n\nEach 0.1 increase in the square root adds roughly 2*109.8*0.1 +0.01 = 21.96 +0.01 =21.97. \n\nWait, perhaps better to use linear approximation. Let me let y =109.8 + delta, such that (y)^2 =12059.58.\n\nWe have (109.8)^2 =12056.04. The difference is 12059.58 -12056.04 =3.54. \n\nSo 2*109.8 * delta \u22483.54 \u2192 delta \u22483.54/(219.6)\u22480.0161.\n\nSo y\u2248109.8 +0.0161\u2248109.816 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's energy is approximately 109.816 MeV.\n\nThus, KE_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV.\n\nAnd the neutrino's KE is 29.784 MeV, which rounds to about 29.8 MeV.\n\nSo the pair is approximately (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV), which matches option D. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the neutrino's KE. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve for the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino in the decay $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The initial rest energy of the pion is $E_{\\text{initial}} = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero, meaning their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nLet $p$ be the magnitude of the momentum of each particle. The neutrino's energy is $E_\\nu = pc$ (since its rest mass is negligible), and the muon's energy is $E_\\mu = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2}$. Conservation of energy gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7)^2} + pc = 139.6\n\\]\n\nLet $x = pc$. Solving the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2\n\\]\n\\[\n279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49\n\\]\n\\[\n279.2x = 8315.67\n\\]\n\\[\nx \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is $E_\\nu = 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}$ (since its rest mass is negligible). The muon's energy is:\n\n\\[\nE_\\mu = \\sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\approx 109.8 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nThus, the muon's KE is:\n\n\\[\nKE_\\mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the KE values are approximately $4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}$ for the muon and $29.8 \\, \\text{MeV}$ for the neutrino, matching option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
