      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics. \n\nFirst, the operator P must be a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z given as matrices. The question provides each component as a matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Since these components resemble the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2, maybe P is analogous to the Pauli spin matrices but for the muon. Wait, the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 particles, so muons, being leptons with spin 1/2, would use these operators. So each P_i is (\u0127/2)\u03c3_i, where \u03c3_i are the Pauli matrices. \n\nThe problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector n has components (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, 0, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6) or something like that? Wait, actually, since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So maybe the direction is given by some angle \u03b8 from the z-axis towards the x direction? Let me think. Let's parametrize the direction. Since it's in x-z plane, we can use an angle \u03b8 measured from the z-axis, so the unit vector n would be (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Alternatively, maybe \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis? But usually, in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is polar angle from the z-axis, but maybe here it's different. The problem says \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so maybe the direction can be written as n_x, n_y=0, n_z. So the components of n are (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis? Not sure, but maybe it's better to denote the direction as (a, 0, b), where a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. \n\nThe operator for the component along n would be P \u00b7 n, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so the operator simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me write that out. Each P component is (\u0127/2) times their respective matrices. So P \u00b7 n would be (\u0127/2)(n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z). Since we need the eigenvector corresponding to +\u0127/2, the eigenvalue equation is (P \u00b7 n) |v\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2) |v\u27e9. \n\nLet me write the matrix for P \u00b7 n. Let's compute the matrix first. \n\nFirst, \u03c3_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], \u03c3_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So n_x \u03c3_x would be n_x times that matrix. Similarly for n_z \u03c3_z. Adding them together:\n\nThe matrix for (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) is:\n\nFirst row: [n_z, n_x]\n\nSecond row: [n_x, -n_z]\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe \u03c3_x term gives (for first row first element) 0, but multiplied by n_x. Wait, no. Wait, \u03c3_x has first row [0,1], so n_x \u03c3_x would be [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]. Similarly, n_z \u03c3_z is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. \n\nAdding them together:\n\nFirst row: [n_z, n_x]\n\nSecond row: [n_x, -n_z]\n\nSo the matrix (n_x \u03c3_x + n_z \u03c3_z) is:\n\n[ n_z    n_x ]\n\n[ n_x   -n_z ]\n\nThen, multiplied by \u0127/2, but since we can factor out \u0127/2, the eigenvalue equation becomes:\n\n( (\u0127/2) [n_z n_x; n_x -n_z] ) |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127/2:\n\n[ n_z n_x; n_x -n_z ] |v> = |v>\n\nSo, the eigenvalue equation for the matrix (let's call it M) is M |v> = 1*|v>, since the eigenvalue is 1 in these units (since we divided by \u0127/2). \n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n( M - I ) |v> = 0, where I is identity matrix.\n\nSo the matrix (M - I) is:\n\n[ n_z -1    n_x     ]\n\n[ n_x     -n_z -1 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(n_z -1)v1 + n_x v2 = 0\n\nn_x v1 + (-n_z -1)v2 =0 \n\nThese two equations must be consistent. Let me write them out:\n\nEquation 1: (n_z -1)v1 + n_x v2 =0\n\nEquation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1)v2 =0\n\nTo find non-trivial solutions, determinant of the matrix must be zero. But since we already know that this is for the eigenvalue 1, it's okay. \n\nWe can solve one equation for the ratio of v1 and v2. Let's take equation 1:\n\n(n_z -1)v1 = -n_x v2 => v1/v2 = -n_x/(n_z -1 )\n\nAlternatively, equation 2 gives:\n\nn_x v1 = (n_z +1)v2 => v1/v2 = (n_z +1)/n_x \n\nWait, but both equations must agree. Let me see, perhaps there's a relation between n_x and n_z since the direction is a unit vector. Since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with equation 1. Let me set v2 =1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), then v1 = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] * v2. So v1 = -n_x/(n_z -1). Then the eigenvector is proportional to [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of trigonometric functions since the direction is parametrized by an angle. Let me parametrize n. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, let's let \u03b8 be the angle between n and the z-axis. So then n_z = cos\u03b8, n_x = sin\u03b8. Because in spherical coordinates, if \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, then the x component would be sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so cos\u03c6 is \u00b11, but maybe just set \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, substituting n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8 into the eigenvector components.\n\nSo then, v1 = -n_x/(n_z -1) = -sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1 )\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying that. Let's compute:\n\nsin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) can be written as - sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos\u03b8):\n\nsin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) / [ (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) ] = sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)/ (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nThus, sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1 ) = - (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, original expression: - sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) = sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). So v1 = sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). \n\nSo then the eigenvector components would be [ sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8), 1 ]. \n\nBut this is messy. Maybe it's better to use a different approach. Since the operator is a Pauli matrix combination, perhaps the eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of standard spin states. \n\nAlternatively, note that for a general direction n, the eigenvector corresponding to +1 (in units of \u0127/2) is given by the normalized vector:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2) ]\n\n[ e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nWait, that's the standard result for the spin-up state in the direction n. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 would be 0 (since in x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is 0 for the x direction and \u03c0 for the negative x, but since it's in x-z, perhaps \u03c6 is zero). Wait, let's think about the standard parametrization. \n\nIn the standard spherical coordinates, the unit vector n is given by (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). Since it's in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0, which implies \u03c6=0 or \u03c0. So \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So the direction is either in the x-z plane along positive or negative x. But the angle \u03b8 here is measured from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, the standard eigenvector for a direction n with spherical angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 (with \u03c6=0 here) would have the form:\n\n|n+\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T. Since \u03c6=0, it becomes [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T. But wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, actually, in the standard notation, the spin-up state along the direction n is:\n\n|n+\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8/2)|z+\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)|z-\u27e9, where |z+\u27e9 is [1,0]^T and |z-\u27e9 is [0,1]^T. So written as a vector, that would be [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. Since in our case, \u03c6 is 0 because it's in x-z plane, so the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nBut wait, let's confirm with the matrix approach. Let me take a specific example. Suppose \u03b8 = 0, pointing along the z-axis. Then n_z =1, n_x =0. Then the operator P \u00b7 n is P_z. The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 should be [1,0]^T. Let's see the expression [cos(0/2), sin(0/2)] = [1,0], which matches. \n\nAnother test: \u03b8=\u03c0, pointing opposite to z-axis. Then the eigenvector for +\u0127/2 would actually be the -1 eigenvalue of P_z? Wait, wait. Wait when \u03b8 is \u03c0, n_z = -1. The operator P \u00b7 n would be -P_z. So the eigenvalue equation becomes -P_z |v> = +\u0127/2 |v>, so P_z |v> = -\u0127/2 |v>, which is the eigenvector [0,1]^T. But according to the formula [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], when \u03b8=\u03c0, cos(\u03c0/2)=0, sin(\u03c0/2)=1, so [0,1], which is correct. \n\nAnother test: \u03b8=\u03c0/2, so pointing along x-axis. Then n_x=1, n_z=0. The operator is P_x. The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 of P_x is [1,1]^T normalized. The formula gives cos(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, sin(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, so the vector is [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2]^T, which when normalized is correct. \n\nSo the formula [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T is indeed the normalized eigenvector for the + eigenvalue when the direction is in x-z plane with angle \u03b8 from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Wait, but let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)), which matches. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the direction is in the x-z plane. So in the standard parametrization, \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, but in option B it's (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Hmm. Wait, option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, but option C has cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). \n\nSo according to my previous analysis, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the original matrix approach again. Suppose I use \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Then the eigenvector components are proportional to [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ].\n\nLet me compute that with \u03b8. Let's take \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (along x-axis):\n\nn_x =1, n_z=0. Then v1 = -1/(0-1) = 1. So the vector is [1,1]^T, which when normalized is (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2), which matches the standard eigenvector for P_x. So the eigenvector is [1,1]^T, which when normalized is [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]. But according to the expression from the formula, cos(\u03b8/2) when \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is cos(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, so that's exactly the normalized vector. \n\nSo the ratio before normalization would be [1,1], so the formula from the matrix approach gives v1/v2 =1, so the vector is (1,1). The normalized version is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) when \u03b8=pi/2, which is (\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2), so that's correct. \n\nAnother example: theta =0 (along z). Then n_z=1, n_x=0. The eigenvector would be [ -0/(1-1), 1 ] but division by zero here, but in limit theta approaches 0, let's see:\n\nTake theta approaching 0, so n_x ~ theta, n_z ~1 - theta\u00b2/2. Then v1 = -n_x/(n_z-1) ~ - (theta)/( - theta\u00b2/2 ) ~ 2/theta, which would go to infinity. Hmm, that suggests that the previous approach might not be the best here. Alternatively, maybe I should parametrize differently. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the equations again. For theta =0, the direction is along z. The eigenvector for +1 is [1,0]^T. Let me plug into the equations:\n\nThe matrix M for theta=0 (n_x=0, n_z=1):\n\n[1, 0; 0, -1]. The eigenvalue +1 corresponds to [1,0]^T. \n\nFrom the previous solution, when theta is 0, the formula gives [cos(0), sin(0)] but wait no, cos(theta/2) when theta=0 is cos(0)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so [1,0], which is correct. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nTherefore, the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B has cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). That seems to be the unnormalized version or maybe for a different parametrization. Option C is the one that matches the standard result. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem's options again. The question says \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\". Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is normalized because cos\u00b2 + sin\u00b2 =1. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

Because in spherical coordinates, if \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, then the x component would be sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, but since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so cos\u03c6 is \u00b11, but maybe just set \u03c6=0, so n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, substituting n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8 into the eigenvector components.\n\nSo then, v1 = -n_x/(n_z -1) = -sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1 )\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying that. Let's compute:\n\nsin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) can be written as - sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos\u03b8):\n\nsin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) / [ (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) ] = sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)/ (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nThus, sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1 ) = - (1 + cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, original expression: - sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 -1) = sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). So v1 = sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8). \n\nSo then the eigenvector components would be [ sin\u03b8/(1 - cos\u03b8), 1 ]. \n\nBut this is messy. Maybe it's better to use a different approach. Since the operator is a Pauli matrix combination, perhaps the eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of standard spin states. \n\nAlternatively, note that for a general direction n, the eigenvector corresponding to +1 (in units of \u0127/2) is given by the normalized vector:\n\n[ cos(\u03b8/2) ]\n\n[ e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nWait, that's the standard result for the spin-up state in the direction n. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 would be 0 (since in x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is 0 for the x direction and \u03c0 for the negative x, but since it's in x-z, perhaps \u03c6 is zero). Wait, let's think about the standard parametrization. \n\nIn the standard spherical coordinates, the unit vector n is given by (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8). Since it's in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0, which implies \u03c6=0 or \u03c0. So \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So the direction is either in the x-z plane along positive or negative x. But the angle \u03b8 here is measured from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, the standard eigenvector for a direction n with spherical angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 (with \u03c6=0 here) would have the form:\n\n|n+\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T. Since \u03c6=0, it becomes [ cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ]^T. But wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, actually, in the standard notation, the spin-up state along the direction n is:\n\n|n+\u27e9 = cos(\u03b8/2)|z+\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)|z-\u27e9, where |z+\u27e9 is [1,0]^T and |z-\u27e9 is [0,1]^T. So written as a vector, that would be [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. Since in our case, \u03c6 is 0 because it's in x-z plane, so the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nBut wait, let's confirm with the matrix approach. Let me take a specific example. Suppose \u03b8 = 0, pointing along the z-axis. Then n_z =1, n_x =0. Then the operator P \u00b7 n is P_z. The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 should be [1,0]^T. Let's see the expression [cos(0/2), sin(0/2)] = [1,0], which matches. \n\nAnother test: \u03b8=\u03c0, pointing opposite to z-axis. Then the eigenvector for +\u0127/2 would actually be the -1 eigenvalue of P_z? Wait, wait. Wait when \u03b8 is \u03c0, n_z = -1. The operator P \u00b7 n would be -P_z. So the eigenvalue equation becomes -P_z |v> = +\u0127/2 |v>, so P_z |v> = -\u0127/2 |v>, which is the eigenvector [0,1]^T. But according to the formula [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], when \u03b8=\u03c0, cos(\u03c0/2)=0, sin(\u03c0/2)=1, so [0,1], which is correct. \n\nAnother test: \u03b8=\u03c0/2, so pointing along x-axis. Then n_x=1, n_z=0. The operator is P_x. The eigenvector for +\u0127/2 of P_x is [1,1]^T normalized. The formula gives cos(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, sin(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, so the vector is [\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2]^T, which when normalized is correct. \n\nSo the formula [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T is indeed the normalized eigenvector for the + eigenvalue when the direction is in x-z plane with angle \u03b8 from the z-axis. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Wait, but let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C says (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)), which matches. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the direction is in the x-z plane. So in the standard parametrization, \u03c6 would be 0 or \u03c0, but in option B it's (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Hmm. Wait, option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, but option C has cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). \n\nSo according to my previous analysis, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the original matrix approach again. Suppose I use \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Then the eigenvector components are proportional to [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ].\n\nLet me compute that with \u03b8. Let's take \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (along x-axis):\n\nn_x =1, n_z=0. Then v1 = -1/(0-1) = 1. So the vector is [1,1]^T, which when normalized is (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2), which matches the standard eigenvector for P_x. So the eigenvector is [1,1]^T, which when normalized is [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]. But according to the expression from the formula, cos(\u03b8/2) when \u03b8=\u03c0/2 is cos(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, so that's exactly the normalized vector. \n\nSo the ratio before normalization would be [1,1], so the formula from the matrix approach gives v1/v2 =1, so the vector is (1,1). The normalized version is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)) when \u03b8=pi/2, which is (\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2), so that's correct. \n\nAnother example: theta =0 (along z). Then n_z=1, n_x=0. The eigenvector would be [ -0/(1-1), 1 ] but division by zero here, but in limit theta approaches 0, let's see:\n\nTake theta approaching 0, so n_x ~ theta, n_z ~1 - theta\u00b2/2. Then v1 = -n_x/(n_z-1) ~ - (theta)/( - theta\u00b2/2 ) ~ 2/theta, which would go to infinity. Hmm, that suggests that the previous approach might not be the best here. Alternatively, maybe I should parametrize differently. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the equations again. For theta =0, the direction is along z. The eigenvector for +1 is [1,0]^T. Let me plug into the equations:\n\nThe matrix M for theta=0 (n_x=0, n_z=1):\n\n[1, 0; 0, -1]. The eigenvalue +1 corresponds to [1,0]^T. \n\nFrom the previous solution, when theta is 0, the formula gives [cos(0), sin(0)] but wait no, cos(theta/2) when theta=0 is cos(0)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so [1,0], which is correct. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nTherefore, the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption B has cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). That seems to be the unnormalized version or maybe for a different parametrization. Option C is the one that matches the standard result. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem's options again. The question says \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\". Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is normalized because cos\u00b2 + sin\u00b2 =1. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane with eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, we start by noting that the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ correspond to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\\hbar/2$. The direction $\\vec{n}$ can be parametrized using an angle $\\theta$ from the z-axis, giving components $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$ (since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$).\n\nThe operator for the component along $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z)$. The eigenvalue equation $(\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n})|\\psi\\rangle = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}|\\psi\\rangle$ simplifies to solving for eigenvectors of the matrix $(n_x \\sigma_x + n_z \\sigma_z)$ with eigenvalue $1$ (after factoring out $\\hbar/2$).\n\nUsing standard results for spin-1/2 particles, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the $+\\hbar/2$ eigenvalue for a direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane (with azimuthal angle $\\phi = 0$) is given by:\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThis matches option C, which specifies the elements as $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. Other options either use incorrect trigonometric functions or include extraneous terms like $\\hbar$ or $\\phi$, which are unnecessary for the normalized eigenvector in this context.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin operators have eigenvectors that depend on the direction. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the vector n has components along x and z, but not y. \n\nThe problem gives the components of the operator P. The X-component P_x is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row [0 1] and second [1 0]. Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row [0 -i] and second [i 0], and P_z is (\u0127/2) times diag(1, -1). \n\nWait, so the operator P is probably the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2. Because the Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 particles are exactly like that. The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z have those forms. So P must be the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So P is the vector operator (P_x, P_y, P_z) which corresponds to (\u0127/2 \u03c3_x, \u0127/2 \u03c3_y, \u0127/2 \u03c3_z).\n\nThe question is about the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let me recall that for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors of the spin operator along a direction n = (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8) are given by the vectors (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)) and (sin(\u03b8/2), -e^{i\u03c6} cos(\u03b8/2)), corresponding to eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively. Wait, but here the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and the direction is in x-z, so the angle \u03c6 around the z-axis would be either 0 or \u03c0/2? Wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then the direction vector n can be written as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), since the y-component is zero. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, z is cos\u03b8. But if it's in x-z plane, then \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0 (so cos\u03c6 is 1 or -1, but since direction can be adjusted, maybe we can take \u03c6=0 without loss of generality). Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\", so the direction can have any angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, and the angle around the z-axis (\u03c6) would be either 0 or \u03c0, but since it's in x-z plane, the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So the angle \u03b8 is between the direction n and the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for such a direction would be analogous to the standard spin eigenstates. Let me think. The general formula for the eigenvector corresponding to +\u0127/2 along a direction n is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)). But here, since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, so the e^{-i\u03c6} term would be either 1 or -1. Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", so maybe the answer just needs to have the form with \u03b8, but since \u03c6 is determined by the direction being in x-z plane. Wait, actually, maybe \u03c6 is fixed here because it's in x-z plane. Wait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\". So the direction can have any \u03b8 between 0 and \u03c0, and \u03c6 is 0 (since in x-z plane, the angle around the z-axis is 0, but actually, in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the x-y plane, so for x-z direction, maybe \u03c6 is fixed. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the operator along direction n in x-z plane.\n\nThe operator P_n would be the dot product of P with n. Since P is (P_x, P_y, P_z), then P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me denote n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Then P_n = (sin\u03b8) P_x + (cos\u03b8) P_z.\n\nSubstituting the given components:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so sin\u03b8 times that is (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nSimilarly, P_z is (\u0127/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]], so cos\u03b8 times that is (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me write the matrix explicitly:\n\nThe top left element: sin\u03b8 * 0 + cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8\n\nTop right: sin\u03b8 * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom left: sin\u03b8 * 1 (since the first element of the second row in P_x is 1) + cos\u03b8 * 0 (since the second row first element of P_z is 0) \u2192 sin\u03b8\n\nBottom right: sin\u03b8 * 0 + cos\u03b8*(-1) \u2192 -cos\u03b8\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me re-calculate each element:\n\nFor the first row first column:\n\nsin\u03b8 * (0 from P_x's (1,1) element) + cos\u03b8*(1 from P_z's (1,1) element) \u2192 cos\u03b8.\n\nFirst row second column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(1 from P_x's (1,2)) + cos\u03b8*(0 from P_z's (1,2)) \u2192 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond row first column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(1 from P_x's (2,1)) + cos\u03b8*(0 from P_z's (2,1)) \u2192 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond row second column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(0 from P_x's (2,2)) + cos\u03b8*(-1 from P_z's (2,2)) \u2192 -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the matrix:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P_n) v = (+\u0127/2) v.\n\nSo, ( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * v = (\u0127/2) v.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to eliminate \u0127/2:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = v.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1 ] ] * v = 0.\n\nWait, actually, let me rephrase the equation:\n\nThe matrix times v must equal the eigenvalue (which is 1 here, after scaling) times v. Wait, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, but after scaling by 2/\u0127, the eigenvalue becomes 1. So the equation is:\n\n( Matrix - 1 * Identity ) v = 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo subtract 1 from the diagonal entries to get the matrix for (Matrix - I):\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue equation is (Matrix) v = 1 * v, so the matrix minus identity times v is zero. So the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must hold. Let me see if they are consistent.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \u2192 v2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1.\n\nHmm, that's a standard trigonometric identity. Let me recall that (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = tan(\u03b8/2). Because 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2), so (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2). So v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To make it a normalized vector, we can set v1 such that |v1|\u00b2 + |tan(\u03b8/2) v1|\u00b2 =1. Let me compute that:\n\nLet v1 = a (a complex number, but since the direction is in x-z plane, maybe the eigenvector can be written with real coefficients? Wait, but in the options, there's a term with e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, so perhaps there's a phase. Hmm, but in the problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is real? Let me check the matrix entries. The matrix for P_n is real because P_x and P_z are real matrices. So the operator P_n here has real entries. Therefore, the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Because the matrix is Hermitian (since Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and linear combinations with real coefficients are Hermitian), so its eigenvectors can be chosen real if the matrix is real and symmetric.\n\nWait, the matrix is:\n\n[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]\n\nYes, this is symmetric. So the eigenvectors can be real. Therefore, the components can be real numbers. So in that case, the eigenvector can be written as (v1, v2) where v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 * v1. Let's compute this.\n\nLet me set v1 = 1 for simplicity, then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2). Then the vector is (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To normalize it:\n\nThe norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Because 1/sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2), so each component multiplied by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\nWait, let me see. Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8/2) = sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8/2) = 1/cos(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ). Because (1/cos(\u03b8/2)) * (1, tan\u03b8/2) = (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nYes, exactly. So the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Option B has a phase term e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the phase \u03c6 would be determined. Wait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. The options might include a phase because sometimes eigenvectors are written with phases depending on the direction's angle in the plane. Wait, but in this case, since the direction is along x-z, the angle \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) is zero (since it's in x-z plane, so maybe \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, but since it's arbitrary direction, perhaps we need to consider the general case where the direction can be in any angle in x-z plane, so the angle from z-axis is theta, but the phi is fixed at 0? Wait, perhaps in the problem's coordinate system, the direction is parameterized by theta (angle from z-axis) and phi=0 because it's in x-z. So the eigenvector doesn't need any phase, so the answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Hmm, so the question is, does the eigenvector involve theta/2 or theta? The calculation shows that it's theta/2, so option C is correct. The other options have different angles. \n\nWait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\". The eigenvector formula I derived is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is exactly option C. The other options have different forms. For example, option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 terms, which would be for a different operator. So the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, let me think again. The standard formula for the spin up state along an arbitrary direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)). However, in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0 (since it's in x-z plane). For example, if the direction is along the x-axis, then \u03b8 would be 90 degrees (\u03c0/2), so \u03c6 would be \u03c0/2? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is along the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is either 0 (for the x direction) or \u03c0 (for the negative x direction), but the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. \n\nWait, actually, when the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 (so in the x-z plane, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. For instance, a direction at angle \u03b8 from the z-axis in the x-z plane would have \u03c6=0 (so direction is x-z with x positive) or \u03c6=\u03c0 (x negative). So in that case, e^{-i\u03c6} would be 1 or -1, so the phase would be incorporated into the sine term. But since the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", perhaps the phase is accounted for by the angle theta. Wait, but in the calculation above, the eigenvector came out as (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which has no phase, implying that \u03c6 is zero. So perhaps the question assumes that the direction is parameterized such that phi is zero, so the eigenvector can be written as in option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the steps. \n\nStarting over, the operator matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2)[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is (Matrix)v = (\u0127/2)(+\u0127/2? Wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue given is +\u0127/2. Wait, the operator P_n has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11 when multiplied by \u0127/2, so yes. So setting up the equation (Matrix)v = (1)(v) after scaling by 2/\u0127. So the matrix equation is correct.\n\nThe equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nWait, wait, the second equation is from the second row: sin\u03b8 *v1 + (-cos\u03b8)*v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 ?\n\nHmm, let me re-express the equations properly. Let me write the equations again:\n\nFirst equation: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0\n\nWait, but if I take the first equation: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)v2 \u2192 v2 = [ sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1\n\nSo both expressions for v2 must be equal. Let me check if they are consistent:\n\n[ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 = [ sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1 \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/(sin\u03b8) = sin\u03b8/(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nCross multiply: (1 - cos\u03b8)^2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ?\n\nWait, no, let me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos\u03b8):\n\n[ (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) ] / [ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8)/[ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] \n\nBut 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so this becomes sin\u00b2\u03b8 / [ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] = sin\u03b8/(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nWhich is exactly the other expression. So they are equal. So the two equations are consistent. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is correct. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ), which simplifies to (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). \n\nNormalizing, the norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), since 1/cos(\u03b8/2) * tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) * 1/cos(\u03b8/2) ? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. The unnormalized vector is (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To normalize, multiply by 1/sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = cos(\u03b8/2), since 1 + tan\u00b2 = sec\u00b2, so sqrt(sec\u00b2) = 1/cos(\u03b8/2). Wait, so multiplying each component by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\nFirst component: 1 * cos(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond component: tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = (sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2)) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo yes, the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC) (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2))\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got. The other options have different forms. Option B has e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, but since we're in the x-z plane, the phase \u03c6 might not be necessary here. The question doesn't mention any phase, so the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin operators have eigenvectors that depend on the direction. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the vector n has components along x and z, but not y. \n\nThe problem gives the components of the operator P. The X-component P_x is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row [0 1] and second [1 0]. Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row [0 -i] and second [i 0], and P_z is (\u0127/2) times diag(1, -1). \n\nWait, so the operator P is probably the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2. Because the Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 particles are exactly like that. The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z have those forms. So P must be the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. So P is the vector operator (P_x, P_y, P_z) which corresponds to (\u0127/2 \u03c3_x, \u0127/2 \u03c3_y, \u0127/2 \u03c3_z).\n\nThe question is about the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let me recall that for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvectors of the spin operator along a direction n = (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8) are given by the vectors (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)) and (sin(\u03b8/2), -e^{i\u03c6} cos(\u03b8/2)), corresponding to eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2, respectively. Wait, but here the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, and the direction is in x-z, so the angle \u03c6 around the z-axis would be either 0 or \u03c0/2? Wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then the direction vector n can be written as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), since the y-component is zero. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, z is cos\u03b8. But if it's in x-z plane, then \u03c6 must be 0 or \u03c0 (so cos\u03c6 is 1 or -1, but since direction can be adjusted, maybe we can take \u03c6=0 without loss of generality). Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\", so the direction can have any angle \u03b8 from the z-axis, and the angle around the z-axis (\u03c6) would be either 0 or \u03c0, but since it's in x-z plane, the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So the angle \u03b8 is between the direction n and the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for such a direction would be analogous to the standard spin eigenstates. Let me think. The general formula for the eigenvector corresponding to +\u0127/2 along a direction n is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)). But here, since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, so the e^{-i\u03c6} term would be either 1 or -1. Wait, but the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", so maybe the answer just needs to have the form with \u03b8, but since \u03c6 is determined by the direction being in x-z plane. Wait, actually, maybe \u03c6 is fixed here because it's in x-z plane. Wait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\". So the direction can have any \u03b8 between 0 and \u03c0, and \u03c6 is 0 (since in x-z plane, the angle around the z-axis is 0, but actually, in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the angle in the x-y plane, so for x-z direction, maybe \u03c6 is fixed. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the operator along direction n in x-z plane.\n\nThe operator P_n would be the dot product of P with n. Since P is (P_x, P_y, P_z), then P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me denote n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. Then P_n = (sin\u03b8) P_x + (cos\u03b8) P_z.\n\nSubstituting the given components:\n\nP_x is (\u0127/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so sin\u03b8 times that is (\u0127/2) sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nSimilarly, P_z is (\u0127/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]], so cos\u03b8 times that is (\u0127/2) cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2) [ sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me write the matrix explicitly:\n\nThe top left element: sin\u03b8 * 0 + cos\u03b8 * 1 = cos\u03b8\n\nTop right: sin\u03b8 * 1 + cos\u03b8 * 0 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom left: sin\u03b8 * 1 (since the first element of the second row in P_x is 1) + cos\u03b8 * 0 (since the second row first element of P_z is 0) \u2192 sin\u03b8\n\nBottom right: sin\u03b8 * 0 + cos\u03b8*(-1) \u2192 -cos\u03b8\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me re-calculate each element:\n\nFor the first row first column:\n\nsin\u03b8 * (0 from P_x's (1,1) element) + cos\u03b8*(1 from P_z's (1,1) element) \u2192 cos\u03b8.\n\nFirst row second column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(1 from P_x's (1,2)) + cos\u03b8*(0 from P_z's (1,2)) \u2192 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond row first column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(1 from P_x's (2,1)) + cos\u03b8*(0 from P_z's (2,1)) \u2192 sin\u03b8.\n\nSecond row second column:\n\nsin\u03b8*(0 from P_x's (2,2)) + cos\u03b8*(-1 from P_z's (2,2)) \u2192 -cos\u03b8.\n\nSo the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the matrix:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (P_n) v = (+\u0127/2) v.\n\nSo, ( (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] ) * v = (\u0127/2) v.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to eliminate \u0127/2:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * v = v.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1 ] ] * v = 0.\n\nWait, actually, let me rephrase the equation:\n\nThe matrix times v must equal the eigenvalue (which is 1 here, after scaling) times v. Wait, the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2, but after scaling by 2/\u0127, the eigenvalue becomes 1. So the equation is:\n\n( Matrix - 1 * Identity ) v = 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo subtract 1 from the diagonal entries to get the matrix for (Matrix - I):\n\n[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]\n\nWait, but the eigenvalue equation is (Matrix) v = 1 * v, so the matrix minus identity times v is zero. So the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must hold. Let me see if they are consistent.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \u2192 v2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1.\n\nHmm, that's a standard trigonometric identity. Let me recall that (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = tan(\u03b8/2). Because 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2), so (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2). So v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To make it a normalized vector, we can set v1 such that |v1|\u00b2 + |tan(\u03b8/2) v1|\u00b2 =1. Let me compute that:\n\nLet v1 = a (a complex number, but since the direction is in x-z plane, maybe the eigenvector can be written with real coefficients? Wait, but in the options, there's a term with e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, so perhaps there's a phase. Hmm, but in the problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is real? Let me check the matrix entries. The matrix for P_n is real because P_x and P_z are real matrices. So the operator P_n here has real entries. Therefore, the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Because the matrix is Hermitian (since Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and linear combinations with real coefficients are Hermitian), so its eigenvectors can be chosen real if the matrix is real and symmetric.\n\nWait, the matrix is:\n\n[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8]\n\n[sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]\n\nYes, this is symmetric. So the eigenvectors can be real. Therefore, the components can be real numbers. So in that case, the eigenvector can be written as (v1, v2) where v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 * v1. Let's compute this.\n\nLet me set v1 = 1 for simplicity, then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2). Then the vector is (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To normalize it:\n\nThe norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Because 1/sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2), so each component multiplied by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\nWait, let me see. Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8/2) = sqrt(sec\u00b2\u03b8/2) = 1/cos(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2) ). Because (1/cos(\u03b8/2)) * (1, tan\u03b8/2) = (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)).\n\nYes, exactly. So the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Option B has a phase term e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, the phase \u03c6 would be determined. Wait, but in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. The options might include a phase because sometimes eigenvectors are written with phases depending on the direction's angle in the plane. Wait, but in this case, since the direction is along x-z, the angle \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) is zero (since it's in x-z plane, so maybe \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0, but since it's arbitrary direction, perhaps we need to consider the general case where the direction can be in any angle in x-z plane, so the angle from z-axis is theta, but the phi is fixed at 0? Wait, perhaps in the problem's coordinate system, the direction is parameterized by theta (angle from z-axis) and phi=0 because it's in x-z. So the eigenvector doesn't need any phase, so the answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Hmm, so the question is, does the eigenvector involve theta/2 or theta? The calculation shows that it's theta/2, so option C is correct. The other options have different angles. \n\nWait, the problem says \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\". The eigenvector formula I derived is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is exactly option C. The other options have different forms. For example, option B has cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 terms, which would be for a different operator. So the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, let me think again. The standard formula for the spin up state along an arbitrary direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) is (cos(\u03b8/2), e^{-i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)). However, in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0 (since it's in x-z plane). For example, if the direction is along the x-axis, then \u03b8 would be 90 degrees (\u03c0/2), so \u03c6 would be \u03c0/2? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is along the x-z plane, then the angle \u03c6 is either 0 (for the x direction) or \u03c0 (for the negative x direction), but the polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. \n\nWait, actually, when the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 (so in the x-z plane, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. For instance, a direction at angle \u03b8 from the z-axis in the x-z plane would have \u03c6=0 (so direction is x-z with x positive) or \u03c6=\u03c0 (x negative). So in that case, e^{-i\u03c6} would be 1 or -1, so the phase would be incorporated into the sine term. But since the problem says \"arbitrary direction\", perhaps the phase is accounted for by the angle theta. Wait, but in the calculation above, the eigenvector came out as (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which has no phase, implying that \u03c6 is zero. So perhaps the question assumes that the direction is parameterized such that phi is zero, so the eigenvector can be written as in option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the steps. \n\nStarting over, the operator matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2)[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is (Matrix)v = (\u0127/2)(+\u0127/2? Wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue given is +\u0127/2. Wait, the operator P_n has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \u00b11 when multiplied by \u0127/2, so yes. So setting up the equation (Matrix)v = (1)(v) after scaling by 2/\u0127. So the matrix equation is correct.\n\nThe equations are:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nWait, wait, the second equation is from the second row: sin\u03b8 *v1 + (-cos\u03b8)*v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1 ) v2 ?\n\nHmm, let me re-express the equations properly. Let me write the equations again:\n\nFirst equation: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2 =0\n\nWait, but if I take the first equation: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 +1)v2 \u2192 v2 = [ sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1\n\nSo both expressions for v2 must be equal. Let me check if they are consistent:\n\n[ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 = [ sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 +1) ] v1 \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/(sin\u03b8) = sin\u03b8/(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nCross multiply: (1 - cos\u03b8)^2 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 ?\n\nWait, no, let me compute (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8) / sin\u03b8 ] \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos\u03b8):\n\n[ (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) ] / [ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] = (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8)/[ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] \n\nBut 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8, so this becomes sin\u00b2\u03b8 / [ sin\u03b8 (1 + cos\u03b8) ) ] = sin\u03b8/(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nWhich is exactly the other expression. So they are equal. So the two equations are consistent. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is correct. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ), which simplifies to (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). \n\nNormalizing, the norm squared is 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), since 1/cos(\u03b8/2) * tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2) * 1/cos(\u03b8/2) ? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. The unnormalized vector is (1, tan(\u03b8/2)). To normalize, multiply by 1/sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = cos(\u03b8/2), since 1 + tan\u00b2 = sec\u00b2, so sqrt(sec\u00b2) = 1/cos(\u03b8/2). Wait, so multiplying each component by cos(\u03b8/2):\n\nFirst component: 1 * cos(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond component: tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = (sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2)) * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo yes, the normalized vector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC) (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2))\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got. The other options have different forms. Option B has e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, but since we're in the x-z plane, the phase \u03c6 might not be necessary here. The question doesn't mention any phase, so the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\) for the operator \\(\\vec{P}\\) along an arbitrary direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane must be derived. The operator components are given as scaled Pauli matrices. The direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the z-axis. The operator \\(P_n\\) is constructed as \\(n_x P_x + n_z P_z\\), resulting in a matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nSolving the eigenvalue equation for \\(+\\hbar/2\\) yields eigenvectors proportional to \\((1, \\tan(\\theta/2))\\). Normalizing this vector gives components \\(\\cos(\\theta/2)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta/2)\\), corresponding to option C. Other options either use incorrect trigonometric arguments or introduce unnecessary phases not required for the x-z plane direction.\n\nAnswer: C",
