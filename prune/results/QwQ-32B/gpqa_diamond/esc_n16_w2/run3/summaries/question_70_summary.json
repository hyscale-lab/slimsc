      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the question mentions several reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The key here is to identify each substance so that I can determine what E is, then figure out its molecular symmetry. \n\nStarting with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Bright red products in chemistry often make me think of compounds like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is red, but maybe something else? Wait, another possibility is the reaction of a metal with a gas. For instance, when iron reacts with sulfur, but sulfur is a solid. Alternatively, maybe copper(II) oxide reacting with something? Hmm, but the product is bright red. Wait, another thought: the bright red color is characteristic of mercuric iodide (HgI2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of a metal with oxygen? For example, copper oxide isn't bright red. Wait, perhaps the product is a coordination compound? \n\nWait, another angle. Let's think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Let me think of common reactions. For example, maybe the reaction of copper with sulfur? But sulfur is solid. Alternatively, consider the reaction of iron with sulfuric acid, but that's not gas. Hmm. Alternatively, the reaction of a metal with oxygen gas. Let me think of iron reacting with oxygen. But iron oxide is Fe2O3, which is reddish, but the stoichiometry would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. But here the ratio is 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A (solid). So if B is O2, then maybe 8 moles of O2 per A? Let's see, perhaps a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is between a metal and a halogen gas. For instance, when iron reacts with chlorine gas, but that might form FeCl3. Let me think of the bright red product. Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and nitrogen? No, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide. For example, if A is vanadium and B is O2? Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction of a metal with sulfur trioxide? Hmm, but that's a liquid. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is mercury(II) oxide? No, but mercury(II) oxide decomposes when heated. Alternatively, maybe the product C is mercuric iodide? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the other reactions given. \n\nThe next reaction: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. \n\nLet me try to piece this together. Let's consider the possibility that A is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with gas B (maybe a halogen?), forming a salt. \n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of copper with sulfuric acid. But sulfuric acid isn't a gas. Alternatively, maybe the solid is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between lead(II) oxide and hydrogen iodide gas? Wait, but the product C is bright red. \n\nAlternatively, think of the reaction of copper with sulfur. Copper(I) sulfide is a red compound. For example, copper(I) oxide is red, but maybe that's a stretch. Wait, another thought: the bright red product could be mercury(II) iodide (HgI2), which is bright red. Let's see if that fits. \n\nSuppose A is mercury (Hg), but mercury is a liquid. Hmm, maybe the solid A is mercury(II) oxide (HgO). When HgO reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B. Let's see, if B is I2 vapor? But iodine is a solid at room temp, but maybe as a gas. HgO + I2? Let me think of the reaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between mercury and iodine. Hg (solid) + I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. But how many equivalents? The formula of HgI2 is HgI2, so 1 mole Hg with 2 moles I2 would give HgI2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is lead(II) oxide (PbO). If gas B is hydrogen iodide (HI), which is a gas. The reaction: PbO + 8 HI \u2192 PbI4? No, maybe. Wait, perhaps a more common reaction. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe product E is extremely hazardous. That might be a clue. For example, phosgene (COCl2) is highly toxic, but maybe something else. Let me see the reactions again. \n\nC reacts with D to form E. Then, when C is treated with water, it reforms A plus two acids. So, C must be a compound that can hydrolyze to give A and two acids. Let's think of a metal chloride and another acid? Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Not sure. \n\nWait, if C is a metal oxide, like Fe2O3, then reacting with water might not produce acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is a metal, B is sulfur, then C is a sulfide. Then when C reacts with water, maybe it forms metal hydroxide and H2S (an acid). But H2S is a weak acid. Then another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's try to think of the acids. The two acids F (strong) and G (weak). Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids like H2CO3, HCN, etc. \n\nSuppose that when C reacts with water, it gives A (a metal oxide?) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal sulfate, then maybe hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong) and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis of a metal nitrate gives HNO3 and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction of a metal with a halogen. For example, if A is Cu, and B is Cl2 (gas), then Cu reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2 (but that's green, not red). Alternatively, maybe the reaction of Cu with I2 to form CuI2? But copper(I) iodide is red. The reaction: 2 Cu + I2 \u2192 2 CuI? No, that would be 2 moles Cu with 1 mole I2. Wait, but the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A. So if A is Cu, then maybe 8 moles of I2? That doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is Pb (lead) and B is O2. But lead oxide is not bright red. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, think of the reaction of a metal with sulfur. For example, Cu + S \u2192 CuS. But copper(I) sulfide is black. Not red. \n\nWait, another approach: The product E is extremely hazardous. Maybe it's chlorine gas (Cl2)? But that's a gas. Or maybe something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen cyanide (HCN)? But that's a weak acid. \n\nWait, the reaction between C and D produces E. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids. Let me think of the hydrolysis reaction. Suppose C is a metal nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2. Then reacting with water might decompose into PbO (A?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal perchlorate, which when hydrolyzed would release HClO4 (strong acid) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nWait, another angle. The solvent H is formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. Let's think of common solvents made from two gases. For example, if D is NH3 and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Hmm. Alternatively, D is H2O and B is something else? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then maybe they form SOCl2, which is a solvent. Wait, sulfur dichloride oxide (SOCl2) is a solvent. The reaction would be SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2, but that's a 1:1 ratio? Let me check the stoichiometry. The balanced equation is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2. Yes, 1 mole each. So maybe D is SO2 and B is Cl2. Then H is SOCl2. \n\nIf that's the case, then let's see. Then D is SO2 and B is Cl2. Then product E comes from C reacting with D (SO2). Let's see. \n\nNow, the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) \u2192 C (bright red). So what solid A would react with 8 Cl2? Let me think of the formula. Suppose A is a metal. Let's suppose A is Fe. Then Fe reacting with Cl2 would form FeCl3. But how many equivalents? The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. So 3 moles Cl2 per 2 Fe. Not 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal with a lower valence. Let's think of vanadium. Suppose V reacting with Cl2. For example, V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl5? Let's see: V has a valence of +5. The reaction would be V + (5/2) Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. So 2.5 moles Cl2 per mole V. Not 8. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose A is a metal that forms a high valence chloride. For instance, if A is uranium. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the metal is in a different oxidation state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal oxide. For example, suppose A is CuO, and B is Cl2. Then CuO + Cl2? Not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and chlorine gas to form a metal chloride. Let me think of a metal that forms a red compound when combined with Cl. For example, lead(II) chloride is white. Iron(III) chloride is yellow-brown. Copper(I) chloride is white, but copper(II) chloride is green. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the bright red product is mercury(II) chloride (calomel), which is Hg2Cl2. Calomel is a red compound. Let me check. The formula for calomel is Hg2Cl2, so two Hg+ ions and two Cl-? Wait, actually, it's Hg2^2+ and Cl-. The structure is Hg2Cl2. \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the reaction is between mercury (Hg) and Cl2. The reaction would be Hg (solid) + Cl2 (gas) \u2192 HgCl2 (mercuric chloride, which is white). Wait, but calomel is Hg2Cl2. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between mercury and chlorine gas. The reaction could be: Hg + Cl2 \u2192 HgCl2. For each mole of Hg, 1 mole Cl2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2). So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the product E. Since E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. \n\nIf E is phosgene, then the reaction would be between C and D. Let's see. Suppose that C is something that reacts with D (maybe CO and Cl2?), but not sure. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, and D is Cl2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think of another possibility: if B is O2 and D is NO, then they could form N2O4, but that's a gas. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, forming HCl, but that's a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a solid. \n\nAlternatively, if B is CO and D is Cl2, forming COCl2 (phosgene), which is a solvent? Wait, phosgene is a toxic gas, not a solvent. Maybe the solvent is something like dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), but that's made from methane and Cl2. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a different angle. Let me think of the acids F and G produced when C reacts with water. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Strong acids like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak could be H2CO3, H3PO4, etc. \n\nSuppose that when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid like HCl and a weak acid like H2O? No, that's not two different acids. Wait, maybe two acids like HCl and H2SO4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hydrolysis of a metal nitrate? For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would give HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfate. When hydrolyzed, it could release H2SO4 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the metal is in a higher oxidation state that hydrolyzes to release an acid. For example, if C is a metal perchlorate (like Pb(ClO4)2), then hydrolysis would give HClO4 (strong) and another acid. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water would form H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2? But that's not an acid. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Then reacting with water would not produce acids. \n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate that decomposes in water to form HNO3 and another acid? Maybe if it's a mixed anion. For example, if C is something like Pb(NO3)2\u00b7H2O, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, metal oxides are usually basic. So when they react with water, they form metal hydroxides, which are bases. Unless it's a non-metal oxide. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) is an acid anhydride. So if C were SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (strong acid). But where's the second acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture of oxides. Hmm. \n\nWait, let me think again about the first reaction. The product C is bright red. Let me list some common bright red substances in chemistry. \n\n- Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reddish-brown, like rust. \n- Mercury(I) chloride (calomel, Hg2Cl2) is white, but maybe I was wrong earlier. Wait, calomel is white? Or is mercuric iodide red? \n- Lead(II) oxide is red lead (Pb3O4), which is reddish. \n- Copper(I) oxide is red. \n- Mercury(II) iodide (HgI2) is bright red. \n- The compound cadmium selenide (CdSe) is used in red pigments, but that's a semiconductor. \n\nHmm, mercury(II) iodide is bright red. So maybe C is HgI2. \n\nIf that's the case, then let's see the reactions. \n\nFirst reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form HgI2. \n\nSo what would A and B be? Let's see. HgI2 has the formula HgI2. So if A is mercury (Hg), then Hg (solid) reacts with I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. But the stoichiometry would be 1 mole Hg + 1 mole I2 \u2192 HgI2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A. So that would require 8 moles of I2 per Hg, which is not possible. So maybe A is a different compound. \n\nWait, maybe A is mercury(II) oxide (HgO). Suppose HgO reacts with I2 (gas) to form HgI2 and O2? Let me see:\n\nHgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2?\n\nBut balancing this: \n\nHgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2 \n\nHg: 1 on each side. \n\nI: 2 on each side. \n\nO: 1 on left, 2 on right. \n\nHmm, not balanced. Alternatively:\n\n2 HgO + I2 \u2192 2 HgI2 + O2 \n\nWait, let's try:\n\nLet me balance the equation properly. Let's suppose the reaction is HgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2. \n\nLeft side: Hg:1, O:1, I:2. \n\nRight side: Hg:1, I:2, O:2. \n\nSo to balance O, we need 2 HgO on the left. \n\n2 HgO + I2 \u2192 2 HgI2 + O2 \n\nNow:\n\nHg: 2 left, 2 right. \n\nO: 2 left, 2 right (O2 has 2). \n\nI: 2 left, 4 right (since 2 HgI2 has 4 I). \n\nHmm, not balanced. Let me try again. \n\nMaybe:\n\nHgO + 2 I2 \u2192 HgI4? But that's not HgI2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is Hg (solid), and B is HI (hydrogen iodide gas). Then the reaction would be Hg + 2 HI \u2192 HgI2 + H2? But that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, Hg + I2 \u2192 HgI2. So 1 mole of Hg and 1 mole I2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas). So maybe B is another gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between mercury(II) oxide and hydrogen iodide. Let me see: \n\nHgO + 2 HI \u2192 HgI2 + H2O \n\nThat's a balanced equation. Here, 1 mole HgO reacts with 2 moles HI. But the problem states that solid A (HgO) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (HI). \n\nIf the stoichiometry is 1 A (HgO) : 2 HI, then 8 equivalents of B would mean 4 times the reaction. Hmm, but maybe the question is using \"equivalents\" in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction requires more HI. Let's think of another possibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is lead(II) oxide (PbO) and B is hydrogen iodide (HI). The reaction would be PbO + HI \u2192 PbI2 + H2O. Let's see:\n\nPbO + 2 HI \u2192 PbI2 + H2O \n\nSo 1 mole PbO with 2 HI. Again, not 8 equivalents. \n\nHmm. Maybe the bright red product isn't HgI2. Let's think again. \n\nAnother possibility: the bright red product is iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). But how would that form? \n\nSuppose solid A is iron (Fe) reacting with oxygen (O2) gas. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for every 2 moles of Fe2O3 (product C), you need 4 Fe and 3 O2. So the ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4. But the problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2). So 8 equivalents of O2 per A (Fe). \n\nWait, let's see. Let's say the reaction is: \n\nFe + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 \n\nThe balanced equation is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nSo for each 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 4 Fe and 3 O2. \n\nThe ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4. \n\nSo if the problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2), then the ratio is O2/Fe = 8. \n\nSo that would require that the stoichiometric ratio is O2/Fe = 8. \n\nBut in the balanced equation, it's 3/4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the solid A is something else. Let's consider another angle. \n\nThe product E is extremely hazardous. If it's something like phosgene (COCl2), then that's a possible candidate. Let's see how that would fit. \n\nPhosgene is made from CO and Cl2. \n\nCO + Cl2 \u2192 COCl2 \n\nBut the problem says that E comes from C reacting with D (gas D). So if D is Cl2, then C must be CO. \n\nBut then C would be carbon monoxide, which is a gas. But the first reaction produces a solid (product C). \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that releases CO and Cl2 when reacting with something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is highly toxic. HCN is a weak acid. The reaction to form HCN could be from a metal cyanide reacting with an acid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is something like hydrogen fluoride (HF), but that's a gas and a weak acid. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to consider the solvent H. If H is formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. \n\nSuppose B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H would be SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a common solvent. The reaction is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2 (but actually, the reaction requires a catalyst and the balanced equation is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2, so yes, 1:1). \n\nSo if that's the case, then B is Cl2 (gas), D is SO2 (gas). \n\nThen, product E is from C reacting with D (SO2). Let's see. \n\nNow, the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of Cl2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nIf C is a compound that reacts with SO2 (D) to form E, then what could that be? \n\nWait, if C is a metal chloride, maybe FeCl3? But FeCl3 is yellow-brown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride), which is a liquid but can be bright? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a red metal chloride. \n\nWait, let me think again of the hydrolysis reaction. When C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G (strong and weak). \n\nSuppose C is Pb(NO3)2. Then hydrolysis might produce HNO3 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbCl2, then hydrolysis would form HCl (strong) and Pb(OH)2 (a base). But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if C is a metal sulfate. For example, PbSO4 is a solid. Hydrolysis might not produce acids. \n\nHmm. Let me try to consider the possibility that C is mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2). \n\nHgCl2 is white, but if it's Hg2Cl2 (calomel), it's white too. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first reaction again. \n\nIf A is a metal and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean that the metal has a high valence. For instance, if the metal has a +8 oxidation state? That's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is in a lower oxidation state, and the reaction involves multiple steps. \n\nWait, maybe the solid A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is PbO. Then reacting with Cl2 (B) could form PbCl2 and O2? \n\nPbO + Cl2 \u2192 PbCl2 + O2 \n\nBut balancing that equation would require 2 PbO + 2 Cl2 \u2192 2 PbCl2 + O2 \n\nSo here, 2 moles PbO (A) reacts with 2 moles Cl2 (B) to give 2 moles PbCl2 (C) and O2. \n\nBut the problem states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. So if A is PbO, then the ratio is 2 PbO : 2 Cl2 \u2192 1:1. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles Cl2 per mole of A. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nLet me think of the acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Let's say F is HCl (strong) and G is H2O (not an acid). Not. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO3? \n\nWait, if C is a metal sulfate, then hydrolysis might not produce acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis could produce HNO3 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal perchlorate, like Pb(ClO4)2. Hydrolysis might give HClO4 (strong) and another acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfite, but that's more likely to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe another? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, non-metal oxides can form acids. For example, SO3 reacts with water to form H2SO4. So if C is SO3, then A would be S and B O2? But the first reaction would be S + O2 \u2192 SO3. But SO3 is a solid? No, it's a liquid or gas. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S (sulfur) and B is O2. Then, 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. So for each 2 moles of A (S), you need 3 O2. So ratio is 1.5. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think again about the product E being extremely hazardous. Maybe it's something like cyanogen chloride (CNCl), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a compound like Hg(CN)2. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbS and D is O2, then reacting could produce PbSO4 and maybe some other product. Not sure. \n\nWait, let me try to consider the solvent H. If D reacts with B (Cl2) to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride). \n\nSo D is SO2. \n\nNow, the reaction of C with D (SO2) produces E. \n\nIf C is a metal chloride, like PbCl2, then reacting with SO2 might form PbSO4 and HCl? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is HgCl2 (mercuric chloride), reacting with SO2 (D) would produce HgSO4, HCl, and maybe SO3? \n\nBut I'm not sure what E would be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a compound that when reacted with SO2 forms a toxic substance like SOCl2? No, that's H. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the product E is sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which is toxic. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to think of the entire pathway again. \n\nFirst reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nSecond reaction: C + 2 D (gas) \u2192 E (hazardous). \n\nThird reaction: C + H2O \u2192 A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). \n\nFourth reaction: D + B \u2192 H (solvent, 1:1). \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2. \n\nThen, for the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus F and G. \n\nSuppose C is PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride). When PbCl4 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form PbO2 (which could be A?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is PbCl2. Then hydrolysis would produce Pb(OH)2 (a base) and HCl. But that gives a base and an acid, but the problem says two acids. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would give HNO3 (strong acid) and Pb(OH)2 (base). Again, not two acids. \n\nWait, what if C is a metal sulfate? Like PbSO4. Then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Like PbCO3. Then hydrolysis would give CO2 (acidic) and maybe another acid. Not sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, like a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid). But where's the second acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture of oxides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S (sulfur), B is O2. Then C would be SO3. But the first reaction would be S + O2 \u2192 SO3, but the ratio is 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. So for each S, 1.5 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is P (phosphorus), and B is Cl2. The reaction could be P4 + Cl2 \u2192 PCl5. The balanced equation is P4 + 10 Cl2 \u2192 4 PCl5. So for each P4 (4 moles A), you need 10 Cl2. That would be 2.5 Cl2 per A (P atom). But the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if A is V (vanadium), and B is Cl2. The reaction might be V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. The balanced equation is V + (5/2) Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. So 2.5 Cl2 per V. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal in a low oxidation state, and the reaction produces a higher oxidation state. Let's think of chromium. \n\nCr (solid) reacts with Cl2 to form CrCl3? \n\nThe reaction is Cr + Cl2 \u2192 CrCl3. \n\nBalanced: 2 Cr + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 CrCl3. \n\nSo ratio Cl2/Cr is 3/2. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is in a different form. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first reaction's stoichiometry. 8 equivalents of B per A. So the reaction is A + 8 B \u2192 C. \n\nSo the formula of C would be A B8? \n\nHmm, possible compounds with 8 B atoms. \n\nFor example, if B is O (oxygen), then maybe a compound like UO2 (uranium oxide?), but 8 O would be UO8? Not common. \n\nAlternatively, if B is Cl, then maybe a compound like S8Cl8? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if B is I (iodine), then maybe a compound like HI8? No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is A B8, but that's not common. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a redox where each B molecule contributes multiple atoms. \n\nWait, if B is O2 (each molecule has 2 O atoms), then 8 equivalents of O2 would be 16 O atoms. \n\nSuppose A is a metal that forms an oxide with 16 O atoms? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a gas that has multiple atoms. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is aluminum, and B is F2. Al reacts with F2 to form AlF3. The balanced equation is 2 Al + 3 F2 \u2192 2 AlF3. So ratio F2/Al = 3/2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of the molecular symmetry groups of possible E candidates. \n\nThe options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nThe molecular symmetry groups: \n\n- D\u221eh is for linear molecules like CO2, O2, CO, etc. \n\n- D4h is for square planar molecules like XeF4, or maybe certain transition metal complexes. \n\n- C2v is for molecules with two planes of symmetry, like water (H2O), or a tetrahedral molecule with some symmetry. \n\n- C2 is a lower symmetry, like something that has a C2 axis but no plane. \n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), which has a planar structure (trigonal planar?), so its symmetry is C2v. \n\nWait, phosgene is a trigonal planar molecule. The structure is similar to BF3, with the central C atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. So the symmetry is C2v because it has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule) and a C2 axis perpendicular to that. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is carbon disulfide (CS2), which has D\u221eh symmetry because it's linear. \n\nWait, let's think of possible candidates for E. \n\nSuppose E is phosgene (COCl2). Then its symmetry is C2v. \n\nIf E is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is part of the solvent H. But the question says E is formed from C and D. If H is SOCl2, then E can't be that because D and B form H. So maybe E is something else. \n\nAlternatively, if E is sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which has a structure of S-Cl-S-Cl, forming a chain. The symmetry would be C2. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (symmetry D4h). \n\nAlternatively, if E is O2 (D\u221eh). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction of C with D (SO2) produces a compound like SOCl2, but that's H, not E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is SO3 (symmetry D3h?), but not listed. \n\nWait, the options given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf the answer is C2v, that would be phosgene or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule like carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), which has Td symmetry, but that's not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nIf C is FeCl3 (yellow-brown), then reacting with D (SO2) might form some compound. But that's not red. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the first reaction again. Bright red product C. Maybe the product is iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3. \n\nFe2O3 is a solid, bright red (like rust). \n\nSo if A is iron (Fe) and B is O2 (gas), then the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nHere, the ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4 per mole of Fe2O3. \n\nThe problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C (Fe2O3). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nSo for every 4 Fe (A), you need 3 O2 (B). The moles of B per A is 3/4. \n\nBut the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between Fe and Cl2 to form FeCl3. \n\nThe balanced equation is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. \n\nRatio Cl2/Fe is 3/2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal that forms a different compound. Let's think of titanium. \n\nTi reacts with Cl2 to form TiCl4. \n\nThe reaction is Ti + 2 Cl2 \u2192 TiCl4. \n\nSo ratio Cl2/Ti is 2. \n\nStill not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal that forms a hexachloride. Like MoCl6. \n\nMo + 3 Cl2 \u2192 MoCl6. \n\nRatio Cl2/Mo = 3. \n\nStill not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas B is not Cl2 but something else. Let me consider B as O3 (ozone). \n\nBut then the product C would have to be something with 8 O atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a different gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and a gas in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal and B is H2O (gas). But then product C is bright red. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is carbon and B is O2. Then CO2 is formed, but that's not red. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I might need to make an educated guess here. \n\nGiven that the product E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is SOCl2 (D\u221eh?), but no, SOCl2 is trigonal pyramidal, so C2v. \n\nWait, SOCl2 has a structure with sulfur in the center, bonded to O, Cl, and Cl. The molecule is trigonal pyramidal, so its symmetry is C2v. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if E is SOCl2, but that's H. \n\nWait, the question says that D and B form H in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2. \n\nThen, E is formed from C and D (SO2). \n\nSuppose C is a compound that reacts with SO2 to form something else. \n\nIf C is FeCl3, then reacting with SO2 might form FeCl2 and H2SO4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbCl2, reacting with SO2 could form PbSO4 and HCl. \n\nThen E would be PbSO4, which has a symmetry group? \n\nPbSO4 is a solid with a crystal structure, but molecular symmetry is more about individual molecules. PbSO4 is ionic, so maybe the molecule isn't isolated. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if C is HgCl2, then reacting with SO2 (D) might produce HgSO4 and HCl. Then E would be HgSO4, which is ionic. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like ClO2, which is chlorine dioxide. ClO2 has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which has a structure like Cl-S-S-Cl. The symmetry would be C2. \n\nSo, between the options given, if E has C2 symmetry, then answer A. \n\nAlternatively, if it's phosgene (C2v), then D. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the product E is SO3. \n\nThe molecular symmetry of SO3 is D3h, but that's not an option here. \n\nThe options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf I can't figure out exactly, maybe I should consider the most likely candidate. \n\nSince the question mentions that E is extremely hazardous, phosgene is a strong candidate. Phosgene has C2v symmetry. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be D) C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is COCl2 (phosgene), then yes. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction pathway again. \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2 (solvent). \n\nC is a compound formed from A and 8 Cl2. \n\nIf A is Pb (lead), then the reaction could be Pb + 4 Cl2 \u2192 PbCl4. \n\nWait, PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride) is a possible compound. The reaction would be Pb + 2 Cl2 \u2192 PbCl4. \n\nSo for 1 mole of Pb (A), you need 2 moles Cl2 (B). But the question says 8 equivalents. So that's 2 vs 8. Doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, if the reaction is 2 Pb + 8 Cl2 \u2192 2 PbCl5? No, that's not a real compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is uranium and B is O2. \n\nU + O2 \u2192 UO2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a +8 oxidation state. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is V2O5 (vanadium pentoxide), which is dark yellow or orange. Not bright red. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll have to go with the best guess here. \n\nGiven that phosgene (COCl2) has C2v symmetry (option D), and it's a hazardous substance, I'll choose D as the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of chemical reactions. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Reaction of Solid A with Gas B**: The bright red product C suggests a compound like mercury(II) iodide (HgI\u2082), which is bright red. However, the stoichiometry of 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A (solid) complicates this assumption. Another possibility is that C is iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), but the ratio of O\u2082 to Fe does not match. \n\n2. **Reaction of C with Gas D**: Product E must be extremely hazardous. Phosgene (COCl\u2082) is a highly toxic compound, fitting this description. \n\n3. **Hydrolysis of C**: When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids (F and G). If C is a metal chloride like PbCl\u2082, hydrolysis could yield HCl (strong acid) and a base, but the problem specifies two acids. However, if C is a different compound, like a metal nitrate or perchlorate, hydrolysis might produce two acids, though specifics are unclear.\n\n4. **Formation of Solvent H**: Gas D reacts with B (1:1 ratio) to form H. If B is Cl\u2082 and D is SO\u2082, their reaction produces thionyl chloride (SOCl\u2082), a common solvent. This fits the 1:1 ratio.\n\n5. **Symmetry of E**: Assuming E is phosgene (COCl\u2082), its molecular structure is trigonal planar with a central carbon atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. This symmetry corresponds to **C\u2082v** (option D).\n\n**Answer: D**  \nThe molecular symmetry group of phosgene (COCl\u2082), a likely candidate for E, is **C\u2082v**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the question mentions several reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The key here is to identify each substance so that I can determine what E is, then figure out its molecular symmetry. \n\nStarting with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Bright red products in chemistry often make me think of compounds like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is red, but maybe something else? Wait, another possibility is the reaction of a metal with a gas. For instance, when iron reacts with sulfur, but sulfur is a solid. Alternatively, maybe copper(II) oxide reacting with something? Hmm, but the product is bright red. Wait, another thought: the bright red color is characteristic of mercuric iodide (HgI2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of a metal with oxygen? For example, copper oxide isn't bright red. Wait, perhaps the product is a coordination compound? \n\nWait, another angle. Let's think of reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Let me think of common reactions. For example, maybe the reaction of copper with sulfur? But sulfur is solid. Alternatively, consider the reaction of iron with sulfuric acid, but that's not gas. Hmm. Alternatively, the reaction of a metal with oxygen gas. Let me think of iron reacting with oxygen. But iron oxide is Fe2O3, which is reddish, but the stoichiometry would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. But here the ratio is 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A (solid). So if B is O2, then maybe 8 moles of O2 per A? Let's see, perhaps a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is between a metal and a halogen gas. For instance, when iron reacts with chlorine gas, but that might form FeCl3. Let me think of the bright red product. Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and nitrogen? No, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide. For example, if A is vanadium and B is O2? Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction of a metal with sulfur trioxide? Hmm, but that's a liquid. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is mercury(II) oxide? No, but mercury(II) oxide decomposes when heated. Alternatively, maybe the product C is mercuric iodide? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the other reactions given. \n\nThe next reaction: when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. \n\nLet me try to piece this together. Let's consider the possibility that A is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with gas B (maybe a halogen?), forming a salt. \n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of copper with sulfuric acid. But sulfuric acid isn't a gas. Alternatively, maybe the solid is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between lead(II) oxide and hydrogen iodide gas? Wait, but the product C is bright red. \n\nAlternatively, think of the reaction of copper with sulfur. Copper(I) sulfide is a red compound. For example, copper(I) oxide is red, but maybe that's a stretch. Wait, another thought: the bright red product could be mercury(II) iodide (HgI2), which is bright red. Let's see if that fits. \n\nSuppose A is mercury (Hg), but mercury is a liquid. Hmm, maybe the solid A is mercury(II) oxide (HgO). When HgO reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B. Let's see, if B is I2 vapor? But iodine is a solid at room temp, but maybe as a gas. HgO + I2? Let me think of the reaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between mercury and iodine. Hg (solid) + I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. But how many equivalents? The formula of HgI2 is HgI2, so 1 mole Hg with 2 moles I2 would give HgI2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is lead(II) oxide (PbO). If gas B is hydrogen iodide (HI), which is a gas. The reaction: PbO + 8 HI \u2192 PbI4? No, maybe. Wait, perhaps a more common reaction. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe product E is extremely hazardous. That might be a clue. For example, phosgene (COCl2) is highly toxic, but maybe something else. Let me see the reactions again. \n\nC reacts with D to form E. Then, when C is treated with water, it reforms A plus two acids. So, C must be a compound that can hydrolyze to give A and two acids. Let's think of a metal chloride and another acid? Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Not sure. \n\nWait, if C is a metal oxide, like Fe2O3, then reacting with water might not produce acids. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is a metal, B is sulfur, then C is a sulfide. Then when C reacts with water, maybe it forms metal hydroxide and H2S (an acid). But H2S is a weak acid. Then another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's try to think of the acids. The two acids F (strong) and G (weak). Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids like H2CO3, HCN, etc. \n\nSuppose that when C reacts with water, it gives A (a metal oxide?) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal sulfate, then maybe hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong) and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis of a metal nitrate gives HNO3 and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction of a metal with a halogen. For example, if A is Cu, and B is Cl2 (gas), then Cu reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2 (but that's green, not red). Alternatively, maybe the reaction of Cu with I2 to form CuI2? But copper(I) iodide is red. The reaction: 2 Cu + I2 \u2192 2 CuI? No, that would be 2 moles Cu with 1 mole I2. Wait, but the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A. So if A is Cu, then maybe 8 moles of I2? That doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is Pb (lead) and B is O2. But lead oxide is not bright red. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, think of the reaction of a metal with sulfur. For example, Cu + S \u2192 CuS. But copper(I) sulfide is black. Not red. \n\nWait, another approach: The product E is extremely hazardous. Maybe it's chlorine gas (Cl2)? But that's a gas. Or maybe something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen cyanide (HCN)? But that's a weak acid. \n\nWait, the reaction between C and D produces E. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids. Let me think of the hydrolysis reaction. Suppose C is a metal nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2. Then reacting with water might decompose into PbO (A?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal perchlorate, which when hydrolyzed would release HClO4 (strong acid) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nWait, another angle. The solvent H is formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. Let's think of common solvents made from two gases. For example, if D is NH3 and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Hmm. Alternatively, D is H2O and B is something else? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then maybe they form SOCl2, which is a solvent. Wait, sulfur dichloride oxide (SOCl2) is a solvent. The reaction would be SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2, but that's a 1:1 ratio? Let me check the stoichiometry. The balanced equation is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2. Yes, 1 mole each. So maybe D is SO2 and B is Cl2. Then H is SOCl2. \n\nIf that's the case, then let's see. Then D is SO2 and B is Cl2. Then product E comes from C reacting with D (SO2). Let's see. \n\nNow, the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) \u2192 C (bright red). So what solid A would react with 8 Cl2? Let me think of the formula. Suppose A is a metal. Let's suppose A is Fe. Then Fe reacting with Cl2 would form FeCl3. But how many equivalents? The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. So 3 moles Cl2 per 2 Fe. Not 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal with a lower valence. Let's think of vanadium. Suppose V reacting with Cl2. For example, V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl5? Let's see: V has a valence of +5. The reaction would be V + (5/2) Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. So 2.5 moles Cl2 per mole V. Not 8. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose A is a metal that forms a high valence chloride. For instance, if A is uranium. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the metal is in a different oxidation state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal oxide. For example, suppose A is CuO, and B is Cl2. Then CuO + Cl2? Not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and chlorine gas to form a metal chloride. Let me think of a metal that forms a red compound when combined with Cl. For example, lead(II) chloride is white. Iron(III) chloride is yellow-brown. Copper(I) chloride is white, but copper(II) chloride is green. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the bright red product is mercury(II) chloride (calomel), which is Hg2Cl2. Calomel is a red compound. Let me check. The formula for calomel is Hg2Cl2, so two Hg+ ions and two Cl-? Wait, actually, it's Hg2^2+ and Cl-. The structure is Hg2Cl2. \n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the reaction is between mercury (Hg) and Cl2. The reaction would be Hg (solid) + Cl2 (gas) \u2192 HgCl2 (mercuric chloride, which is white). Wait, but calomel is Hg2Cl2. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between mercury and chlorine gas. The reaction could be: Hg + Cl2 \u2192 HgCl2. For each mole of Hg, 1 mole Cl2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2). So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the product E. Since E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. \n\nIf E is phosgene, then the reaction would be between C and D. Let's see. Suppose that C is something that reacts with D (maybe CO and Cl2?), but not sure. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, and D is Cl2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think of another possibility: if B is O2 and D is NO, then they could form N2O4, but that's a gas. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, forming HCl, but that's a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a solid. \n\nAlternatively, if B is CO and D is Cl2, forming COCl2 (phosgene), which is a solvent? Wait, phosgene is a toxic gas, not a solvent. Maybe the solvent is something like dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), but that's made from methane and Cl2. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a different angle. Let me think of the acids F and G produced when C reacts with water. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Strong acids like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak could be H2CO3, H3PO4, etc. \n\nSuppose that when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid like HCl and a weak acid like H2O? No, that's not two different acids. Wait, maybe two acids like HCl and H2SO4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hydrolysis of a metal nitrate? For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would give HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfate. When hydrolyzed, it could release H2SO4 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the metal is in a higher oxidation state that hydrolyzes to release an acid. For example, if C is a metal perchlorate (like Pb(ClO4)2), then hydrolysis would give HClO4 (strong) and another acid. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water would form H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2? But that's not an acid. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Then reacting with water would not produce acids. \n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate that decomposes in water to form HNO3 and another acid? Maybe if it's a mixed anion. For example, if C is something like Pb(NO3)2\u00b7H2O, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, metal oxides are usually basic. So when they react with water, they form metal hydroxides, which are bases. Unless it's a non-metal oxide. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) is an acid anhydride. So if C were SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (strong acid). But where's the second acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture of oxides. Hmm. \n\nWait, let me think again about the first reaction. The product C is bright red. Let me list some common bright red substances in chemistry. \n\n- Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is reddish-brown, like rust. \n- Mercury(I) chloride (calomel, Hg2Cl2) is white, but maybe I was wrong earlier. Wait, calomel is white? Or is mercuric iodide red? \n- Lead(II) oxide is red lead (Pb3O4), which is reddish. \n- Copper(I) oxide is red. \n- Mercury(II) iodide (HgI2) is bright red. \n- The compound cadmium selenide (CdSe) is used in red pigments, but that's a semiconductor. \n\nHmm, mercury(II) iodide is bright red. So maybe C is HgI2. \n\nIf that's the case, then let's see the reactions. \n\nFirst reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form HgI2. \n\nSo what would A and B be? Let's see. HgI2 has the formula HgI2. So if A is mercury (Hg), then Hg (solid) reacts with I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. But the stoichiometry would be 1 mole Hg + 1 mole I2 \u2192 HgI2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A. So that would require 8 moles of I2 per Hg, which is not possible. So maybe A is a different compound. \n\nWait, maybe A is mercury(II) oxide (HgO). Suppose HgO reacts with I2 (gas) to form HgI2 and O2? Let me see:\n\nHgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2?\n\nBut balancing this: \n\nHgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2 \n\nHg: 1 on each side. \n\nI: 2 on each side. \n\nO: 1 on left, 2 on right. \n\nHmm, not balanced. Alternatively:\n\n2 HgO + I2 \u2192 2 HgI2 + O2 \n\nWait, let's try:\n\nLet me balance the equation properly. Let's suppose the reaction is HgO + I2 \u2192 HgI2 + O2. \n\nLeft side: Hg:1, O:1, I:2. \n\nRight side: Hg:1, I:2, O:2. \n\nSo to balance O, we need 2 HgO on the left. \n\n2 HgO + I2 \u2192 2 HgI2 + O2 \n\nNow:\n\nHg: 2 left, 2 right. \n\nO: 2 left, 2 right (O2 has 2). \n\nI: 2 left, 4 right (since 2 HgI2 has 4 I). \n\nHmm, not balanced. Let me try again. \n\nMaybe:\n\nHgO + 2 I2 \u2192 HgI4? But that's not HgI2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is Hg (solid), and B is HI (hydrogen iodide gas). Then the reaction would be Hg + 2 HI \u2192 HgI2 + H2? But that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, Hg + I2 \u2192 HgI2. So 1 mole of Hg and 1 mole I2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas). So maybe B is another gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between mercury(II) oxide and hydrogen iodide. Let me see: \n\nHgO + 2 HI \u2192 HgI2 + H2O \n\nThat's a balanced equation. Here, 1 mole HgO reacts with 2 moles HI. But the problem states that solid A (HgO) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (HI). \n\nIf the stoichiometry is 1 A (HgO) : 2 HI, then 8 equivalents of B would mean 4 times the reaction. Hmm, but maybe the question is using \"equivalents\" in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction requires more HI. Let's think of another possibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is lead(II) oxide (PbO) and B is hydrogen iodide (HI). The reaction would be PbO + HI \u2192 PbI2 + H2O. Let's see:\n\nPbO + 2 HI \u2192 PbI2 + H2O \n\nSo 1 mole PbO with 2 HI. Again, not 8 equivalents. \n\nHmm. Maybe the bright red product isn't HgI2. Let's think again. \n\nAnother possibility: the bright red product is iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). But how would that form? \n\nSuppose solid A is iron (Fe) reacting with oxygen (O2) gas. The reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for every 2 moles of Fe2O3 (product C), you need 4 Fe and 3 O2. So the ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4. But the problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2). So 8 equivalents of O2 per A (Fe). \n\nWait, let's see. Let's say the reaction is: \n\nFe + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 \n\nThe balanced equation is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nSo for each 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 4 Fe and 3 O2. \n\nThe ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4. \n\nSo if the problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2), then the ratio is O2/Fe = 8. \n\nSo that would require that the stoichiometric ratio is O2/Fe = 8. \n\nBut in the balanced equation, it's 3/4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the solid A is something else. Let's consider another angle. \n\nThe product E is extremely hazardous. If it's something like phosgene (COCl2), then that's a possible candidate. Let's see how that would fit. \n\nPhosgene is made from CO and Cl2. \n\nCO + Cl2 \u2192 COCl2 \n\nBut the problem says that E comes from C reacting with D (gas D). So if D is Cl2, then C must be CO. \n\nBut then C would be carbon monoxide, which is a gas. But the first reaction produces a solid (product C). \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that releases CO and Cl2 when reacting with something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is highly toxic. HCN is a weak acid. The reaction to form HCN could be from a metal cyanide reacting with an acid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is something like hydrogen fluoride (HF), but that's a gas and a weak acid. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to consider the solvent H. If H is formed from D and B in 1:1 ratio. \n\nSuppose B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H would be SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a common solvent. The reaction is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2 (but actually, the reaction requires a catalyst and the balanced equation is SO2 + Cl2 \u2192 SOCl2, so yes, 1:1). \n\nSo if that's the case, then B is Cl2 (gas), D is SO2 (gas). \n\nThen, product E is from C reacting with D (SO2). Let's see. \n\nNow, the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of Cl2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nIf C is a compound that reacts with SO2 (D) to form E, then what could that be? \n\nWait, if C is a metal chloride, maybe FeCl3? But FeCl3 is yellow-brown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride), which is a liquid but can be bright? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a red metal chloride. \n\nWait, let me think again of the hydrolysis reaction. When C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G (strong and weak). \n\nSuppose C is Pb(NO3)2. Then hydrolysis might produce HNO3 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbCl2, then hydrolysis would form HCl (strong) and Pb(OH)2 (a base). But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if C is a metal sulfate. For example, PbSO4 is a solid. Hydrolysis might not produce acids. \n\nHmm. Let me try to consider the possibility that C is mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2). \n\nHgCl2 is white, but if it's Hg2Cl2 (calomel), it's white too. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first reaction again. \n\nIf A is a metal and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean that the metal has a high valence. For instance, if the metal has a +8 oxidation state? That's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is in a lower oxidation state, and the reaction involves multiple steps. \n\nWait, maybe the solid A is a metal oxide. Let's say A is PbO. Then reacting with Cl2 (B) could form PbCl2 and O2? \n\nPbO + Cl2 \u2192 PbCl2 + O2 \n\nBut balancing that equation would require 2 PbO + 2 Cl2 \u2192 2 PbCl2 + O2 \n\nSo here, 2 moles PbO (A) reacts with 2 moles Cl2 (B) to give 2 moles PbCl2 (C) and O2. \n\nBut the problem states that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. So if A is PbO, then the ratio is 2 PbO : 2 Cl2 \u2192 1:1. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles Cl2 per mole of A. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nLet me think of the acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Let's say F is HCl (strong) and G is H2O (not an acid). Not. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO3? \n\nWait, if C is a metal sulfate, then hydrolysis might not produce acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis could produce HNO3 (strong) and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal perchlorate, like Pb(ClO4)2. Hydrolysis might give HClO4 (strong) and another acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfite, but that's more likely to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe another? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, non-metal oxides can form acids. For example, SO3 reacts with water to form H2SO4. So if C is SO3, then A would be S and B O2? But the first reaction would be S + O2 \u2192 SO3. But SO3 is a solid? No, it's a liquid or gas. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S (sulfur) and B is O2. Then, 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. So for each 2 moles of A (S), you need 3 O2. So ratio is 1.5. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think again about the product E being extremely hazardous. Maybe it's something like cyanogen chloride (CNCl), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a compound like Hg(CN)2. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbS and D is O2, then reacting could produce PbSO4 and maybe some other product. Not sure. \n\nWait, let me try to consider the solvent H. If D reacts with B (Cl2) to form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride). \n\nSo D is SO2. \n\nNow, the reaction of C with D (SO2) produces E. \n\nIf C is a metal chloride, like PbCl2, then reacting with SO2 might form PbSO4 and HCl? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is HgCl2 (mercuric chloride), reacting with SO2 (D) would produce HgSO4, HCl, and maybe SO3? \n\nBut I'm not sure what E would be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a compound that when reacted with SO2 forms a toxic substance like SOCl2? No, that's H. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the product E is sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which is toxic. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to think of the entire pathway again. \n\nFirst reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nSecond reaction: C + 2 D (gas) \u2192 E (hazardous). \n\nThird reaction: C + H2O \u2192 A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). \n\nFourth reaction: D + B \u2192 H (solvent, 1:1). \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2. \n\nThen, for the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus F and G. \n\nSuppose C is PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride). When PbCl4 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form PbO2 (which could be A?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is PbCl2. Then hydrolysis would produce Pb(OH)2 (a base) and HCl. But that gives a base and an acid, but the problem says two acids. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would give HNO3 (strong acid) and Pb(OH)2 (base). Again, not two acids. \n\nWait, what if C is a metal sulfate? Like PbSO4. Then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate. Like PbCO3. Then hydrolysis would give CO2 (acidic) and maybe another acid. Not sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form an acid. Wait, like a non-metal oxide. For example, if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid). But where's the second acid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture of oxides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S (sulfur), B is O2. Then C would be SO3. But the first reaction would be S + O2 \u2192 SO3, but the ratio is 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. So for each S, 1.5 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is P (phosphorus), and B is Cl2. The reaction could be P4 + Cl2 \u2192 PCl5. The balanced equation is P4 + 10 Cl2 \u2192 4 PCl5. So for each P4 (4 moles A), you need 10 Cl2. That would be 2.5 Cl2 per A (P atom). But the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if A is V (vanadium), and B is Cl2. The reaction might be V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. The balanced equation is V + (5/2) Cl2 \u2192 VCl5. So 2.5 Cl2 per V. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal in a low oxidation state, and the reaction produces a higher oxidation state. Let's think of chromium. \n\nCr (solid) reacts with Cl2 to form CrCl3? \n\nThe reaction is Cr + Cl2 \u2192 CrCl3. \n\nBalanced: 2 Cr + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 CrCl3. \n\nSo ratio Cl2/Cr is 3/2. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is in a different form. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first reaction's stoichiometry. 8 equivalents of B per A. So the reaction is A + 8 B \u2192 C. \n\nSo the formula of C would be A B8? \n\nHmm, possible compounds with 8 B atoms. \n\nFor example, if B is O (oxygen), then maybe a compound like UO2 (uranium oxide?), but 8 O would be UO8? Not common. \n\nAlternatively, if B is Cl, then maybe a compound like S8Cl8? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if B is I (iodine), then maybe a compound like HI8? No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is A B8, but that's not common. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is a redox where each B molecule contributes multiple atoms. \n\nWait, if B is O2 (each molecule has 2 O atoms), then 8 equivalents of O2 would be 16 O atoms. \n\nSuppose A is a metal that forms an oxide with 16 O atoms? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a gas that has multiple atoms. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is aluminum, and B is F2. Al reacts with F2 to form AlF3. The balanced equation is 2 Al + 3 F2 \u2192 2 AlF3. So ratio F2/Al = 3/2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of the molecular symmetry groups of possible E candidates. \n\nThe options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nThe molecular symmetry groups: \n\n- D\u221eh is for linear molecules like CO2, O2, CO, etc. \n\n- D4h is for square planar molecules like XeF4, or maybe certain transition metal complexes. \n\n- C2v is for molecules with two planes of symmetry, like water (H2O), or a tetrahedral molecule with some symmetry. \n\n- C2 is a lower symmetry, like something that has a C2 axis but no plane. \n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), which has a planar structure (trigonal planar?), so its symmetry is C2v. \n\nWait, phosgene is a trigonal planar molecule. The structure is similar to BF3, with the central C atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. So the symmetry is C2v because it has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule) and a C2 axis perpendicular to that. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is carbon disulfide (CS2), which has D\u221eh symmetry because it's linear. \n\nWait, let's think of possible candidates for E. \n\nSuppose E is phosgene (COCl2). Then its symmetry is C2v. \n\nIf E is SOCl2 (thionyl chloride), which is part of the solvent H. But the question says E is formed from C and D. If H is SOCl2, then E can't be that because D and B form H. So maybe E is something else. \n\nAlternatively, if E is sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which has a structure of S-Cl-S-Cl, forming a chain. The symmetry would be C2. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (symmetry D4h). \n\nAlternatively, if E is O2 (D\u221eh). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction of C with D (SO2) produces a compound like SOCl2, but that's H, not E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is SO3 (symmetry D3h?), but not listed. \n\nWait, the options given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf the answer is C2v, that would be phosgene or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule like carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), which has Td symmetry, but that's not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nIf C is FeCl3 (yellow-brown), then reacting with D (SO2) might form some compound. But that's not red. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the first reaction again. Bright red product C. Maybe the product is iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3. \n\nFe2O3 is a solid, bright red (like rust). \n\nSo if A is iron (Fe) and B is O2 (gas), then the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nHere, the ratio of O2 to Fe is 3/4 per mole of Fe2O3. \n\nThe problem states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C (Fe2O3). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. \n\nSo for every 4 Fe (A), you need 3 O2 (B). The moles of B per A is 3/4. \n\nBut the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between Fe and Cl2 to form FeCl3. \n\nThe balanced equation is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. \n\nRatio Cl2/Fe is 3/2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal that forms a different compound. Let's think of titanium. \n\nTi reacts with Cl2 to form TiCl4. \n\nThe reaction is Ti + 2 Cl2 \u2192 TiCl4. \n\nSo ratio Cl2/Ti is 2. \n\nStill not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal that forms a hexachloride. Like MoCl6. \n\nMo + 3 Cl2 \u2192 MoCl6. \n\nRatio Cl2/Mo = 3. \n\nStill not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas B is not Cl2 but something else. Let me consider B as O3 (ozone). \n\nBut then the product C would have to be something with 8 O atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a different gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and a gas in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal and B is H2O (gas). But then product C is bright red. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is carbon and B is O2. Then CO2 is formed, but that's not red. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I might need to make an educated guess here. \n\nGiven that the product E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is SOCl2 (D\u221eh?), but no, SOCl2 is trigonal pyramidal, so C2v. \n\nWait, SOCl2 has a structure with sulfur in the center, bonded to O, Cl, and Cl. The molecule is trigonal pyramidal, so its symmetry is C2v. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if E is SOCl2, but that's H. \n\nWait, the question says that D and B form H in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2. \n\nThen, E is formed from C and D (SO2). \n\nSuppose C is a compound that reacts with SO2 to form something else. \n\nIf C is FeCl3, then reacting with SO2 might form FeCl2 and H2SO4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if C is PbCl2, reacting with SO2 could form PbSO4 and HCl. \n\nThen E would be PbSO4, which has a symmetry group? \n\nPbSO4 is a solid with a crystal structure, but molecular symmetry is more about individual molecules. PbSO4 is ionic, so maybe the molecule isn't isolated. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if C is HgCl2, then reacting with SO2 (D) might produce HgSO4 and HCl. Then E would be HgSO4, which is ionic. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like ClO2, which is chlorine dioxide. ClO2 has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which has a structure like Cl-S-S-Cl. The symmetry would be C2. \n\nSo, between the options given, if E has C2 symmetry, then answer A. \n\nAlternatively, if it's phosgene (C2v), then D. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the product E is SO3. \n\nThe molecular symmetry of SO3 is D3h, but that's not an option here. \n\nThe options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf I can't figure out exactly, maybe I should consider the most likely candidate. \n\nSince the question mentions that E is extremely hazardous, phosgene is a strong candidate. Phosgene has C2v symmetry. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be D) C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is COCl2 (phosgene), then yes. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction pathway again. \n\nIf B is Cl2 and D is SO2, then H is SOCl2 (solvent). \n\nC is a compound formed from A and 8 Cl2. \n\nIf A is Pb (lead), then the reaction could be Pb + 4 Cl2 \u2192 PbCl4. \n\nWait, PbCl4 (lead tetrachloride) is a possible compound. The reaction would be Pb + 2 Cl2 \u2192 PbCl4. \n\nSo for 1 mole of Pb (A), you need 2 moles Cl2 (B). But the question says 8 equivalents. So that's 2 vs 8. Doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, if the reaction is 2 Pb + 8 Cl2 \u2192 2 PbCl5? No, that's not a real compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is uranium and B is O2. \n\nU + O2 \u2192 UO2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a +8 oxidation state. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is V2O5 (vanadium pentoxide), which is dark yellow or orange. Not bright red. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll have to go with the best guess here. \n\nGiven that phosgene (COCl2) has C2v symmetry (option D), and it's a hazardous substance, I'll choose D as the answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of chemical reactions. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Reaction of Solid A with Gas B**: The bright red product C suggests a compound like mercury(II) iodide (HgI\u2082), which is bright red. However, the stoichiometry of 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A (solid) complicates this assumption. Another possibility is that C is iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), but the ratio of O\u2082 to Fe does not match. \n\n2. **Reaction of C with Gas D**: Product E must be extremely hazardous. Phosgene (COCl\u2082) is a highly toxic compound, fitting this description. \n\n3. **Hydrolysis of C**: When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids (F and G). If C is a metal chloride like PbCl\u2082, hydrolysis could yield HCl (strong acid) and a base, but the problem specifies two acids. However, if C is a different compound, like a metal nitrate or perchlorate, hydrolysis might produce two acids, though specifics are unclear.\n\n4. **Formation of Solvent H**: Gas D reacts with B (1:1 ratio) to form H. If B is Cl\u2082 and D is SO\u2082, their reaction produces thionyl chloride (SOCl\u2082), a common solvent. This fits the 1:1 ratio.\n\n5. **Symmetry of E**: Assuming E is phosgene (COCl\u2082), its molecular structure is trigonal planar with a central carbon atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. This symmetry corresponds to **C\u2082v** (option D).\n\n**Answer: D**  \nThe molecular symmetry group of phosgene (COCl\u2082), a likely candidate for E, is **C\u2082v**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about molecular symmetry groups, specifically for product E. I need to figure out what E is and then determine its point group.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information given. The reactions are described in steps. Let me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I know that some red-colored compounds might be things like copper(II) compounds, but maybe more likely something like iron(III) thiocyanate? Wait, but that's usually blood red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeS2 (pyrite), reacting with O2 (gas B?), but I need to think more.\n\nWait, let's look at the next reactions. \n\n2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. \n\nLet me try to deduce the substances involved. Let's think of common reactions. \n\nThe bright red product C might be something like iron(III) oxide, but iron(III) oxide is more of a dark red or brown. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II) oxide? No, mercury(II) oxide is red, but when heated decomposes. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a nitrate or perchlorate? Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Alternatively, the classic red precipitate in some reactions is maybe lead(II) iodide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction steps again. Let me try to think of possible substances for each letter. \n\nStarting with the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). Let's think of common reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Maybe something like the reaction of a metal with oxygen? For example, iron reacting with oxygen to form iron(III) oxide. But the stoichiometry would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. Hmm, but the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) per A. Wait, maybe the solid A is something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a sulfide. For instance, if A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide), reacting with O2 (gas B). Let's see: FeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 + SO2? Let me check the balanced equation. \n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. But that's 7 O2 per 4 FeS. Not exactly 8 equivalents of O2 per FeS. Hmm. Not quite matching.\n\nWait, maybe the solid is aluminum? Like Al reacting with Cl2? But that's not producing a red solid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves copper. For example, copper metal with nitric acid, but that's an acid, not a gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is copper(II) oxide? If gas B is H2, but that might not lead to a bright red product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is sulfur? S8 reacting with O2? No, that would form SO2 or SO3. \n\nWait, another thought: the product C is bright red, which could be mercuric oxide (HgO), which is red. Let me think. If A is mercury, but mercury is a liquid. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination complex. For instance, iron(III) thiocyanate is blood red. The formula is Fe(SCN)\u2083. But how would that form from a reaction with a gas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen. Let's think of the reaction of lead sulfide (PbS) with oxygen. The reaction would be 2 PbS + 3 O2 \u2192 2 PbO + 2 SO2. But the product PbO is lead(II) oxide, which is black. Not red. \n\nHmm, maybe the product C is V\u2082O\u2085 (vanadium pentoxide), which is bright orange-red. Let's see: if A is V, then reacting with O2 (gas B). The reaction would be 4 V + 5 O2 \u2192 2 V2O5. But that requires 5 O2 per 4 V atoms. Not exactly 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is something like Sb4O6 (antimony trioxide?), reacting with O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the second reaction. C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio (C: D) to form E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. \n\nSuppose that C is a metal oxide. Let's think of a metal oxide that when reacts with water gives an acid. For example, non-metal oxides are acidic. Wait, but C is a product of a reaction with a gas. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the last reaction: D reacts with B (gas) in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio. For example, maybe D is Cl2 and B is H2, forming HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, then maybe? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: D is NH3 (gas) and B is HCl (gas), reacting to form NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps D is H2 and B is Cl2, forming HCl? But again, HCl is a gas. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, maybe? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is SO3? Then reaction would form H2SO4, but that's not a solvent. \n\nWait, the solvent H could be something like H2O, but that's formed from H2 and O2. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something like CCl4? No, that's made from C and Cl2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is H2S and B is O2? Then reacting them would form H2O and S? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the product E, which is hazardous. Hazardous chemicals could be things like HClO4 (perchloric acid?), but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe E is a compound like NO2 or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reactions are part of the production of sulfuric acid? Let me think. \n\nWait, let's think step by step again. \n\nThe first reaction: A(solid) + 8 B(gas) \u2192 C(bright red). \n\nSecond: C + 2 D(gas) \u2192 E(hazardous). \n\nThird: C + H2O \u2192 A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). \n\nFourth: D + B \u2192 H (solvent). \n\nSo, if C reacts with water to form A plus two acids, then C must be an oxide. Because when metal oxides react with water, they form hydroxides, but if it's a non-metal oxide, it would form an acid. Wait, but the problem says \"two different acids F and G\". So maybe C is a mixture? Or perhaps the oxide is of a metal that can form two different acids. Wait, maybe it's a metal oxide that can form an acid upon reaction with water. Wait, perhaps the oxide is of a metal that can form a salt with two different acids? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a compound that can form two acids when hydrolyzed. For instance, maybe C is a sulfide? When sulfides react with water, they form H2S (a weak acid) and a metal hydroxide (which would be a base, but maybe another acid? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the product is a nitrate? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the acids F and G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is something like acetic acid (weak). But how would that come from C reacting with water? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two acids are sulfuric acid (strong) and another acid like H2SO3 (weak)? But that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are H2SO4 (strong) and HCl (strong), but then both are strong. Hmm. \n\nWait, let's try to think of possible reactions where a metal oxide reacts with water to produce an acid. For example, if the oxide is of a non-metal. Let's think of the oxide of sulfur, like SO3. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (strong acid). But that's just one acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen to form a sulfate and sulfuric acid? Not sure. \n\nLet me try to consider possible substances for each letter. Let's think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from two gases in 1:1 ratio, perhaps D and B are HCl and something else? Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2S? Then reacting them would form H2O and S? But then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Wait, H2O is a solvent. So maybe D is H2S and B is O2? Then their reaction would be 2 H2S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 H2O + 2 SO2? Not 1:1. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Their reaction would form HCl, but HCl is a gas. Unless H is HCl dissolved in something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O? But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the solvent H is H2O, so the reaction between B and D is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1. \n\nHmm. Let's think of other solvents. Acetone (C3H6O) is a solvent, but that's not from gases. Ethanol? Not from gases. \n\nWait, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol? No, that's made from ethylene and water. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like benzene? No. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solvent is a compound like HClO4? Not a solvent. \n\nWait, maybe H is NH3? But ammonia is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, liquid ammonia is a solvent, but maybe that's stretching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is H2O, so the reaction between B and D must be H2 + O2 \u2192 H2O, but that requires a 2:1 ratio. The problem says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, maybe the solvent is something like H2SO4? But that's an acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is a different compound. Let me think again. \n\nLet me try to think of a different approach. Let's consider the product E, which is hazardous. Common hazardous substances could be like phosgene (COCl2), which is toxic. Or maybe something like HCN, but how would that form? \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a compound like NO2, but that's a gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reactions involve nitric acid. Let me think again of the first reaction. \n\nSuppose that solid A is copper metal, and gas B is nitric acid. Wait, but nitric acid is a liquid. The problem states gas B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe gas B is NO2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is copper(II) oxide reacting with something else. \n\nWait, let's try to consider the possibility that the bright red product C is mercuric oxide (HgO), which is red. Let's see:\n\nIf A is Hg (but it's a liquid), so maybe not. Alternatively, if A is HgO, but then reacting with gas B? Not sure. \n\nHmm, maybe C is lead(II) oxide? No, that's not red. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of sulfur with oxygen. S8 + O2 \u2192 SO3? But SO3 is a gas. \n\nWait, another possibility: The bright red product could be Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide), which is a reddish-brown. Maybe that's close enough. Let me see:\n\nSuppose A is Fe, and gas B is O2. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 O2 per 4 Fe atoms, so the ratio isn't 8 equivalents of O2 per Fe. So for each Fe atom, 3/4 O2. Not 8. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Maybe something like the formation of a sulfate from a metal sulfide. For example, consider the reaction of PbS (lead(II) sulfide) with oxygen:\n\n2 PbS + 3 O2 \u2192 2 PbO + 2 SO2. \n\nBut again, the ratio here is 3 O2 per 2 PbS. So per PbS, 1.5 O2. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a different metal. Let's think of a reaction that requires more oxygen. For example, perhaps the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas? Like aluminum reacting with Cl2:\n\n4 Al + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 AlCl3. \n\nThat's 3 Cl2 per 4 Al. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is a compound. Let's think of the reaction of iron(II) sulfide with oxygen. \n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 + SO2. Let me balance this:\n\n4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. \n\nSo 7 O2 per 4 FeS. So per FeS, 7/4 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is something like titanium, reacting with oxygen? Let me see: \n\n4 Ti + 3 O2 \u2192 2 TiO2. Again, 3 O2 per 4 Ti atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not of a metal with oxygen but another gas. Let's think of gas B being something else. \n\nSuppose gas B is Cl2, and solid A is Fe. The reaction could be Fe + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3. But that's 3 Cl2 per 2 Fe. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is a metal reacting with another gas. Let me think of a reaction where the gas is in a higher ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen to form a sulfate. For example, consider the reaction of FeS with O2 to form Fe2(SO4)3? \n\nBut let's see: \n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. The balanced equation would be:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nSo, 11 O2 per 4 FeS. That's 11/4 O2 per FeS, which is 2.75. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a different metal. Let me think of lead. \n\nLead sulfide (PbS) reacting with O2 to form PbO and SO2. As before, the ratio is 3 O2 per 2 PbS. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is carbon? Like carbon reacting with O2 to form CO2. But that's a gas, not a solid product. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. Let me think of a reaction where the gas is in 8 equivalents. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid is a metal that reacts with a gas in such a way that the stoichiometry is 8:1. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the solid A is aluminum and the gas B is chlorine. \n\nThe reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 AlCl3. So 3 Cl2 per 2 Al atoms. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a gas that requires more equivalents. Let me think of sodium reacting with oxygen. \n\n4 Na + O2 \u2192 2 Na2O. So 1 O2 per 4 Na. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a compound. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe product C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So C must be an oxide that can form two acids when hydrolyzed. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then reacting with water might not form acids. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's suppose C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it can form H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (which is a base, but maybe another reaction path? Or maybe it's a different oxide. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two acids are sulfuric acid and another acid. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the second reaction where C reacts with gas D to form E. Suppose that E is a compound like HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is hazardous. But how would that form? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and D is Cl2. For example, if C is FeO and D is Cl2, then FeO + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is HCl, which is a gas. But HCl is a solvent in some cases, but not a common one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like H2SO4. But that's an acid. \n\nHmm. Let me try to think of another angle. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So perhaps I can think of possible E molecules and their point groups. The options given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nD\u221eh is the point group for linear molecules like CO2, O2, HCl, etc. C2v is for molecules with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, like water or methane (but methane is tetrahedral, which is Td, so maybe a different shape). D4h is for something like a square planar molecule, like XeF4 (which has D4h symmetry). C2 is a lower symmetry, maybe like a bent molecule with a C2 axis but no higher symmetry. \n\nHmm, so if E is a linear molecule, then it would be D\u221eh. If it's something like CO2, which is linear, but the options include D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule, but that's Td, which isn't an option here. \n\nWait, the options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. Let me think of possible E compounds. \n\nSuppose that E is a molecule like sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is octahedral (Oh), but that's not listed. \n\nAlternatively, if E is CO, which has D\u221eh symmetry. Or maybe O2, which is also D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is bent and has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like H2O (C2v), but that's a solvent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like SO3 (trigonal planar, D3h symmetry, not listed). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a square planar molecule, like XeF4 (D4h). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like SO2. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2 (both D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let's think of possible E compounds based on the reactions. \n\nLet me try to think of possible scenarios. \n\nLet me consider that the solvent H is H2O. Then, the reaction between D and B must form H2O. But for that, B and D must be H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem states 1:1. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like HCl, formed from H2 and Cl2 (1:1). But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent is something like H2SO4? But that's made from SO3 and H2O. \n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's think of the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, so possible candidates are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HBr, HI. G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH, H2CO3, HCN, H3PO4 (depending on concentration), etc. \n\nSo, if C reacting with water produces A plus a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's suppose that C is a metal oxide that can form two different acids. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal carbonate? No, because carbonates reacting with water don't form acids. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate, which when hydrolyzed gives H+ and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water: FeS + H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Here, H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. But the problem states that when C reacts with water, it forms A (the original solid) plus two acids. Hmm, so maybe the solid A is Fe, but Fe(OH)2 isn't Fe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then reacting with water would form HNO3 (strong acid) and Pb(OH)2, which is a base. But that's only one acid. \n\nHmm. Maybe the two acids are from the same compound. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces a metal hydroxide (base) and two acids. But that seems conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture, but that's unlikely. \n\nWait, another idea: suppose that A is a metal sulfide, B is O2. Then the reaction of A with O2 forms C, which could be a sulfate. Let's say A is PbS, reacting with O2 to form PbSO4 (lead sulfate). The balanced equation would be: \n\n2 PbS + 3 O2 + 2 H2O \u2192 2 PbSO4 + 2 H2O? Wait, not sure. Let me balance properly:\n\nPbS + 4 O2 \u2192 PbSO4. \n\nSo, 4 O2 per PbS. \n\nBut the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) per A. So if the ratio here is 4 O2 per 1 PbS, then that's 4 equivalents. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of FeS with O2 forms Fe2(SO4)3. Let me see:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nBalancing: \n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nSo 11 O2 per 4 FeS \u2192 2.75 O2 per FeS. Still not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal that reacts with chlorine gas. Let's think of titanium reacting with chlorine:\n\nTi + 2 Cl2 \u2192 TiCl4. So 2 Cl2 per Ti. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a gas in a different ratio. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the product E being something like phosgene (COCl2). That's a toxic gas. Phosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. \n\nSuppose that C reacts with D (which is Cl2) to form phosgene. \n\nBut then C would have to be CO. But CO is a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is something else. \n\nAlternatively, if E is phosgene, then its molecular symmetry group is C2v, since it's a planar molecule with a central C atom, two Cl atoms, and one O atom arranged in a trigonal planar structure. Wait, actually, phosgene has a structure with C in the center, bonded to Cl, Cl, and O. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (through the carbon and the oxygen), and two mirror planes. Let me confirm: \n\nIn phosgene (COCl2), the molecule is planar with the carbon in the center, two Cl atoms and one O. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h? Wait no, because the molecule has a central atom with three atoms around it. Wait, actually, in phosgene, the structure is such that the three substituents are two Cl and one O. Since the substituents are not all the same, the point group is C2v. Because there are two mirror planes perpendicular to the C2 axis. \n\nWait, the structure is like: \n\n   Cl\n   |\nCl-C-O\n   |\n   Cl?\n\nNo, no, wait. The actual structure of phosgene is: \n\nThe central carbon is bonded to two Cl atoms and one O atom, arranged in a trigonal planar structure. So the molecule has a C2 axis along the C-O bond. The mirror planes are the plane containing the C-O and one Cl, and the other plane perpendicular to that through the other Cl. So the point group is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if the molecule is linear, like CO2, then it's D\u221eh. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule like carbon dioxide (CO2), which is linear with D\u221eh symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nLet me try to think of possible scenarios where the reactions can be matched. \n\nSuppose the following:\n\n- Solid A is copper (Cu), gas B is nitric acid (but gas?), no, nitric acid is liquid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal like copper reacting with chlorine gas. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following possible scenario:\n\nA is FeS (iron(II) sulfide), gas B is O2. The reaction of FeS with O2 forms Fe2(SO4)3 (iron(III) sulfate), but let's see the balanced equation:\n\n4 FeS + 7 O2 + 2 H2O \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 H2O. \n\nWait, that's not right. Let me balance properly:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nTo balance Fe: 2 FeS \u2192 2 Fe in Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nFor sulfur: 2 FeS gives 2 S \u2192 in Fe2(SO4)3, each S is in SO4^2- \u2192 2*(SO4) \u2192 2 S. So that's balanced. \n\nOxygen: On the right, each SO4 has 4 O, so 3*(SO4) gives 12 O per Fe2(SO4)3. Since there are two FeS, the total O from the sulfate is 12 O. \n\nThe left side has O2. Let's write the equation:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3 \n\nLet me count O:\n\nOn right: 2 Fe2(SO4)3 has 3*4*2 = 24 O from sulfate, so total O is 24. \n\nOn left: 11 O2 gives 22 O atoms. Wait, discrepancy here. Hmm, perhaps I need to include H2O? \n\nWait, maybe the reaction produces H2SO4 as well. Let me try again. \n\nSuppose:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3 + H2O \n\nBut need to balance with H2O. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with H2O. \n\nWait, the first reaction is between A (solid) and 8 equivalents of gas B. \n\nLet me try to think of A as S (sulfur). Then, S reacts with O2 to form SO3. \n\nThe reaction: S + O2 \u2192 SO3. \n\nBalanced: 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. \n\nSo for each S, 1.5 O2. Not 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S8 (sulfur in its solid form). \n\nThen: S8 + O2 \u2192 SO3. \n\nLet's balance. \n\nS8 + 12 O2 \u2192 8 SO3. \n\nSo per S8 (which is 8 S atoms), we have 12 O2. So per S atom, 12/8 = 1.5 O2. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a gas to form a metal oxide. Let's consider that C is the metal oxide. \n\nSuppose A is a metal M, and B is O2. The reaction M + O2 \u2192 MOx. The stoichiometry requires that 8 O2 are used per M. \n\nSuppose the formula is M + 4 O2 \u2192 MO8? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a compound. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal sulfide, and B is Cl2. \n\nFor example, FeS + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S. \n\nThe balanced equation: FeS + 3 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S + 3 Cl2? Wait, no. \n\nWait, FeS + 4 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S + 4 Cl? No. \n\nAlternatively, 2 FeS + 7 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3 + 2 S + 6 Cl2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is FeCl3. \n\nBut then when C reacts with D (gas), it forms E. \n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think of the possible answers and see which point group fits. \n\nThe question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2, which have D\u221eh symmetry, that would be option C. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like CO2 (linear, D\u221eh), same as option C. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v), which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (D4h), option B. \n\nAlternatively, a molecule like O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. Let's think of possible reactions where E is a hazardous product. \n\nAnother possibility: the first reaction is the formation of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) from iron and oxygen. But as before, the stoichiometry isn't matching. \n\nWait, maybe the solid A is a metal that forms a metal nitrate when reacted with oxygen and something else. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between copper and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), but gas B would be HNO3's gas form? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is copper reacting with nitric acid (as a liquid), but the problem states gas B. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is sulfur (S8) and gas B is O2, forming SO3. Then C is SO3 (which is a liquid at room temperature, but can be a solid?), which is a bright red? No, SO3 is white. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a red-colored compound like Pb3O4 (lead(II,IV) oxide), which is red. \n\nThe reaction could be: \n\n2 Pb + O2 \u2192 2 PbO (black), but not red. \n\nAlternatively, 3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ...? \n\nWait, let's look up lead oxide reactions. \n\nThe formation of Pb3O4 from Pb and O2:\n\n2 Pb + O2 \u2192 2 PbO \n\nThen, further oxidation of PbO with O2:\n\n2 PbO + O2 \u2192 2 PbO2 \n\nBut Pb3O4 is a mixture of PbO and PbO2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is: \n\n3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ... ?\n\nHmm, perhaps the solid A is Pb, and gas B is O2. The reaction forms Pb3O4. \n\nThe balanced equation would be 3 Pb + 4 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4. \n\nSo, for each Pb, 4/3 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following scenario:\n\nSolid A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide). \n\nGas B is O2. \n\nThe reaction forms Fe2O3 and SO3. \n\nWait, let's balance:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO3. \n\nSo for each FeS, 11/4 O2. \n\nNot 8 equivalents. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of Sb4O6 (antimony trioxide) with O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a halogen. Let's think of titanium reacting with Cl2. \n\n4 Ti + 7 Cl2 \u2192 4 TiCl3. \n\nNo, that's not. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like sodium, and gas B is Cl2. \n\n4 Na + Cl2 \u2192 2 NaCl. \n\nThe ratio is 1 Cl2 per 4 Na. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nWait, perhaps the gas B is a different gas like HCl? But HCl is a gas. \n\nSuppose A is Zn, reacting with HCl (gas) to form ZnCl2, but that's not a solid product. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to think of the possible answers and see which is more likely. \n\nThe question asks for the symmetry group of E. \n\nIf E is a diatomic molecule like O2, N2, Cl2, then D\u221eh (option C). \n\nIf E is a linear molecule like CO2, then also D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v, option D), or O3 (C2v). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (D4h, option B). \n\nAlternatively, a molecule like H2O (C2v). \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother possibility: The product E could be a compound like phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like carbon disulfide (CS2), which is linear (D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let's think of the reactions again. \n\nSuppose that the solvent H is H2O. Then D and B must form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. That would require D is H2 and B is O2, but that's a 2:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, but that's a 2:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is HCl, so D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nH2 + Cl2 \u2192 2 HCl. \n\nThat's a 1:1 ratio. So H is HCl gas. \n\nSo, in this case, solvent H is HCl. \n\nThen, D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nNow, proceeding:\n\nThe first reaction: A (solid) + 8 equivalents of H2 (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nSo A reacts with 8 H2 to form C. \n\nWhat solid reacts with H2 in an 8:1 ratio? \n\nHmm, maybe a metal that forms a hydride. For example, titanium reacts with H2 to form TiH2. The reaction is Ti + H2 \u2192 TiH2. So per Ti atom, 1 H2. \n\nIf A is Ti, then to get 8 H2 per Ti, the formula would be Ti + 4 H2 \u2192 TiH8? Not common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with another gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like Fe reacting with Cl2 (gas B). \n\nBut in this scenario, B is H2, so that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to think of C as the bright red product. \n\nIf C is V2O5 (vanadium pentoxide), which is bright yellow-orange. \n\nSuppose A is V (vanadium), gas B is O2. \n\nThe reaction would be 4 V + 5 O2 \u2192 2 V2O5. \n\nSo 5 O2 per 4 V atoms. \n\nIf B is O2, then per V atom, 5/4 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the following possibility: \n\nSuppose the solid A is copper, and gas B is nitric acid vapor (but it's a liquid). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide that is bright red. \n\nWait, lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4) is red. \n\nSuppose the reaction is 3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ... \n\nWait, the balanced equation for forming Pb3O4 from Pb and O2 is 3 Pb + 5/2 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4. \n\nSo per 3 Pb, 2.5 O2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide, and gas B is O2 forming a metal sulfate. \n\nSuppose A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide). \n\nThe reaction: 4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. \n\nBut the product Fe2O3 is a red-brown solid. \n\nSo C is Fe2O3. \n\nThen, when C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents), forming E. \n\nWhat gas D could react with Fe2O3? \n\nFe2O3 is a metal oxide. If D is CO, then the reaction is Fe2O3 + 3 CO \u2192 2 Fe + 3 CO2. But that requires 3 CO per Fe2O3, but the question says 2 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, if D is H2, then Fe2O3 + 3 H2 \u2192 2 Fe + 3 H2O. Again, 3 H2 per Fe2O3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is a different gas. \n\nIf E is a hazardous product, perhaps it's something like chlorine gas, but that's D in this scenario. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with another gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is SO3, reacting with Fe2O3 to form Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nFe2O3 + 3 SO3 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nBut that would need 3 equivalents of SO3, not 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with nitric acid, but D would need to be a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of Fe2O3 with Cl2. \n\nFe2O3 + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + O2? \n\nNot sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to see what happens when C reacts with water. \n\nIf C is Fe2O3, then reacting with water would form Fe(OH)3, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit the problem's description where F and G are acids. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different oxide. \n\nSuppose C is PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), which is red. \n\nThe reaction of PbO2 with water would form Pb(OH)4^2- (a weak acid?), but not sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate. \n\nWait, if C is HgO (mercuric oxide), which is red. \n\nThen, when HgO reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. Let's see: \n\nHgO + D \u2192 E. \n\nSuppose D is SO3, then HgO + SO3 \u2192 HgSO4 (mercury sulfate). \n\nBut then E is HgSO4, which is a solid. Not sure if that's hazardous. \n\nAlternatively, D could be H2 to form Hg + H2O. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent H is H2O, and the reaction between B and D is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O, but that's 2:1 ratio. \n\nWait, but the problem says 1:1. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like H2SO4, formed from SO3 and H2O. \n\nBut then B and D would have to be SO3 and H2O, but H2O is a liquid. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should try to think of possible E molecules and their point groups. \n\nIf E is a diatomic gas like O2, then D\u221eh (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like COCl2 (phosgene), which is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh). \n\nHmm. \n\nThe question mentions that E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is very toxic, so that fits. Ozone is also hazardous. \n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its point group is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is NO2, also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a compound like HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is linear and has D\u221eh symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction where C reacts with D. Suppose C is FeCl3 and D is Cl2, forming FeCl4^- (not sure). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reactions are as follows: \n\nA is FeS (solid), B is O2 (gas). \n\nFeS reacts with O2 to form Fe2O3 and SO3. \n\nFe2O3 is the bright red product (C). \n\nThen, C (Fe2O3) reacts with gas D (maybe SO3) to form Fe2(SO4)3 (E). \n\nFe2O3 + 3 SO3 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nThis requires 3 equivalents of SO3, but the problem states 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is HCl gas. \n\nFe2O3 + 6 HCl \u2192 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2O. \n\nBut that would form FeCl3 and H2O. Not sure if that's E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, and D is something else. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the solvent H is H2O, so D and B must form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nIf B is H2 and D is O2, but their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O (2:1 ratio). \n\nSo that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2, forming HCl. \n\nThen H is HCl, which is a solvent (like in hydrochloric acid solution). \n\nSo, D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nFirst reaction: A + 8 H2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nWhat solid reacts with H2 in an 8:1 ratio? \n\nMaybe a metal that forms a hydride with a high H content. \n\nFor example, titanium can form TiH2, but that's 1 H2 per Ti. \n\nAlternatively, maybe uranium? \n\nHmm, perhaps the solid is something like calcium carbide (CaC2) reacting with H2 to form something else. \n\nCaC2 + 2 H2 \u2192 CaH2 + C2H2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with H2 to form a metal hydride. \n\nFor instance, if A is a metal M, then: \n\nM + 8 H2 \u2192 MH16? That seems unlikely. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 (B) in the first reaction. \n\nWait, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then the solvent H is HCl. \n\nFirst reaction: A (solid) + 8 Cl2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nWhat metal reacts with Cl2 in 8 equivalents to form a red product? \n\nMaybe iron? \n\nFe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. \n\nSo per Fe, 1.5 Cl2. \n\nTo get 8 Cl2 per A, perhaps A is a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like sodium, but sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl, which is white. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is antimony, reacting with Cl2: \n\nSb + 3 Cl2 \u2192 SbCl3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide. \n\nWait, let's try to think of C as the red product, and E as a hazardous product formed from C and D. \n\nIf C is Fe2O3 (red), and D is SO3, then E is Fe2(SO4)3, which is a strong acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CO, reacting with Fe2O3 to form CO2 and Fe. \n\nBut that's not hazardous. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the possible answers. \n\nIf E is a diatomic gas like O2, which has D\u221eh (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v, option D). \n\nThe question states that E is extremely hazardous. \n\nPhosgene (COCl2) is very toxic and has C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is Cl2O, which is a hazardous gas. Cl2O has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is also hazardous and has C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction forms a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh), but that's less hazardous. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is C2v (option D). \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces a molecule like O3 (ozone), which is also C2v. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction between C and D produces a square planar molecule, like maybe XeF4. But I can't see how that would come from the given reactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like CCl4, but that would require B and D to be C and Cl2? Not sure. \n\nGiven the options, and considering common hazardous substances and their symmetry groups, I think the most likely answer is C2v (option D). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product E is CO2 (D\u221eh), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide like FeO reacting with Cl2 (gas D), then FeO + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl2 + O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is Fe2O3 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + Cl2O. \n\nBut Cl2O has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction produces Cl2O, which is a hazardous gas with C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product E is O3 (ozone), formed from O2 and another substance. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll go with the common hazardous molecules and their symmetry groups. \n\nPhosgene (COCl2) is C2v, so option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is Cl2O (also C2v). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's SO2, which is C2v. \n\nAll of these are C2v, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D4h (option B), but I can't think of a common hazardous molecule with that symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh), but that's less hazardous. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll choose option D: C2v.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The reactions are analyzed step by step:\n\n1. **Reaction of Solid A with Gas B**: The bright red product C suggests it might be a metal oxide like Fe\u2082O\u2083 (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish-brown. However, the exact identity is less critical than the subsequent reactions.\n\n2. **Reaction of C with Gas D**: The hazardous product E must be a toxic compound. Common candidates include phosgene (COCl\u2082), sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), or ozone (O\u2083), all of which are hazardous and have specific molecular symmetries.\n\n3. **Hydrolysis of C**: Producing two acids (strong and weak) implies C might be a metal oxide reacting with water to form an acid and a base. However, the acids' identities suggest C could be a compound that hydrolyzes into both strong and weak acids, such as a sulfate or nitrate, but the exact mechanism isn't critical here.\n\n4. **Formation of Solvent H**: The solvent H is likely H\u2082O, formed from gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., H\u2082 and O\u2082), but their reaction requires a 2:1 ratio. This inconsistency suggests H might be HCl (from H\u2082 and Cl\u2082), a common solvent in specific contexts.\n\nConsidering the molecular symmetry groups:\n- **Phosgene (COCl\u2082)** has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom bonded to two Cl and one O atom, giving it **C\u2082v symmetry**.\n- **Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082)** and **ozone (O\u2083)** also have **C\u2082v symmetry** due to their bent structures.\n- **Diatomic gases** like O\u2082 or CO\u2082 have **D\u221eh symmetry**, but they are less likely to be the hazardous E in this context.\n\nGiven the hazardous nature of E and common toxic molecules with bent geometries, **C\u2082v symmetry (option D)** is the most plausible answer.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about molecular symmetry groups, specifically for product E. I need to figure out what E is and then determine its point group.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information given. The reactions are described in steps. Let me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I know that some red-colored compounds might be things like copper(II) compounds, but maybe more likely something like iron(III) thiocyanate? Wait, but that's usually blood red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeS2 (pyrite), reacting with O2 (gas B?), but I need to think more.\n\nWait, let's look at the next reactions. \n\n2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. \n\nLet me try to deduce the substances involved. Let's think of common reactions. \n\nThe bright red product C might be something like iron(III) oxide, but iron(III) oxide is more of a dark red or brown. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II) oxide? No, mercury(II) oxide is red, but when heated decomposes. Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a nitrate or perchlorate? Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Alternatively, the classic red precipitate in some reactions is maybe lead(II) iodide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction steps again. Let me try to think of possible substances for each letter. \n\nStarting with the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). Let's think of common reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Maybe something like the reaction of a metal with oxygen? For example, iron reacting with oxygen to form iron(III) oxide. But the stoichiometry would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. Hmm, but the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) per A. Wait, maybe the solid A is something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a sulfide. For instance, if A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide), reacting with O2 (gas B). Let's see: FeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 + SO2? Let me check the balanced equation. \n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. But that's 7 O2 per 4 FeS. Not exactly 8 equivalents of O2 per FeS. Hmm. Not quite matching.\n\nWait, maybe the solid is aluminum? Like Al reacting with Cl2? But that's not producing a red solid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves copper. For example, copper metal with nitric acid, but that's an acid, not a gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is copper(II) oxide? If gas B is H2, but that might not lead to a bright red product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is sulfur? S8 reacting with O2? No, that would form SO2 or SO3. \n\nWait, another thought: the product C is bright red, which could be mercuric oxide (HgO), which is red. Let me think. If A is mercury, but mercury is a liquid. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination complex. For instance, iron(III) thiocyanate is blood red. The formula is Fe(SCN)\u2083. But how would that form from a reaction with a gas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen. Let's think of the reaction of lead sulfide (PbS) with oxygen. The reaction would be 2 PbS + 3 O2 \u2192 2 PbO + 2 SO2. But the product PbO is lead(II) oxide, which is black. Not red. \n\nHmm, maybe the product C is V\u2082O\u2085 (vanadium pentoxide), which is bright orange-red. Let's see: if A is V, then reacting with O2 (gas B). The reaction would be 4 V + 5 O2 \u2192 2 V2O5. But that requires 5 O2 per 4 V atoms. Not exactly 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is something like Sb4O6 (antimony trioxide?), reacting with O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the second reaction. C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio (C: D) to form E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids F and G. \n\nSuppose that C is a metal oxide. Let's think of a metal oxide that when reacts with water gives an acid. For example, non-metal oxides are acidic. Wait, but C is a product of a reaction with a gas. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the last reaction: D reacts with B (gas) in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio. For example, maybe D is Cl2 and B is H2, forming HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, then maybe? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: D is NH3 (gas) and B is HCl (gas), reacting to form NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps D is H2 and B is Cl2, forming HCl? But again, HCl is a gas. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, maybe? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is SO3? Then reaction would form H2SO4, but that's not a solvent. \n\nWait, the solvent H could be something like H2O, but that's formed from H2 and O2. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something like CCl4? No, that's made from C and Cl2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is H2S and B is O2? Then reacting them would form H2O and S? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the product E, which is hazardous. Hazardous chemicals could be things like HClO4 (perchloric acid?), but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe E is a compound like NO2 or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reactions are part of the production of sulfuric acid? Let me think. \n\nWait, let's think step by step again. \n\nThe first reaction: A(solid) + 8 B(gas) \u2192 C(bright red). \n\nSecond: C + 2 D(gas) \u2192 E(hazardous). \n\nThird: C + H2O \u2192 A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). \n\nFourth: D + B \u2192 H (solvent). \n\nSo, if C reacts with water to form A plus two acids, then C must be an oxide. Because when metal oxides react with water, they form hydroxides, but if it's a non-metal oxide, it would form an acid. Wait, but the problem says \"two different acids F and G\". So maybe C is a mixture? Or perhaps the oxide is of a metal that can form two different acids. Wait, maybe it's a metal oxide that can form an acid upon reaction with water. Wait, perhaps the oxide is of a metal that can form a salt with two different acids? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a compound that can form two acids when hydrolyzed. For instance, maybe C is a sulfide? When sulfides react with water, they form H2S (a weak acid) and a metal hydroxide (which would be a base, but maybe another acid? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the product is a nitrate? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the acids F and G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is something like acetic acid (weak). But how would that come from C reacting with water? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two acids are sulfuric acid (strong) and another acid like H2SO3 (weak)? But that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are H2SO4 (strong) and HCl (strong), but then both are strong. Hmm. \n\nWait, let's try to think of possible reactions where a metal oxide reacts with water to produce an acid. For example, if the oxide is of a non-metal. Let's think of the oxide of sulfur, like SO3. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (strong acid). But that's just one acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen to form a sulfate and sulfuric acid? Not sure. \n\nLet me try to consider possible substances for each letter. Let's think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from two gases in 1:1 ratio, perhaps D and B are HCl and something else? Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2S? Then reacting them would form H2O and S? But then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Wait, H2O is a solvent. So maybe D is H2S and B is O2? Then their reaction would be 2 H2S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 H2O + 2 SO2? Not 1:1. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Their reaction would form HCl, but HCl is a gas. Unless H is HCl dissolved in something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O? But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the solvent H is H2O, so the reaction between B and D is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1. \n\nHmm. Let's think of other solvents. Acetone (C3H6O) is a solvent, but that's not from gases. Ethanol? Not from gases. \n\nWait, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol? No, that's made from ethylene and water. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like benzene? No. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solvent is a compound like HClO4? Not a solvent. \n\nWait, maybe H is NH3? But ammonia is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, liquid ammonia is a solvent, but maybe that's stretching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is H2O, so the reaction between B and D must be H2 + O2 \u2192 H2O, but that requires a 2:1 ratio. The problem says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, maybe the solvent is something like H2SO4? But that's an acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is a different compound. Let me think again. \n\nLet me try to think of a different approach. Let's consider the product E, which is hazardous. Common hazardous substances could be like phosgene (COCl2), which is toxic. Or maybe something like HCN, but how would that form? \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a compound like NO2, but that's a gas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reactions involve nitric acid. Let me think again of the first reaction. \n\nSuppose that solid A is copper metal, and gas B is nitric acid. Wait, but nitric acid is a liquid. The problem states gas B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe gas B is NO2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is copper(II) oxide reacting with something else. \n\nWait, let's try to consider the possibility that the bright red product C is mercuric oxide (HgO), which is red. Let's see:\n\nIf A is Hg (but it's a liquid), so maybe not. Alternatively, if A is HgO, but then reacting with gas B? Not sure. \n\nHmm, maybe C is lead(II) oxide? No, that's not red. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of sulfur with oxygen. S8 + O2 \u2192 SO3? But SO3 is a gas. \n\nWait, another possibility: The bright red product could be Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide), which is a reddish-brown. Maybe that's close enough. Let me see:\n\nSuppose A is Fe, and gas B is O2. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 O2 per 4 Fe atoms, so the ratio isn't 8 equivalents of O2 per Fe. So for each Fe atom, 3/4 O2. Not 8. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 molar ratio. Maybe something like the formation of a sulfate from a metal sulfide. For example, consider the reaction of PbS (lead(II) sulfide) with oxygen:\n\n2 PbS + 3 O2 \u2192 2 PbO + 2 SO2. \n\nBut again, the ratio here is 3 O2 per 2 PbS. So per PbS, 1.5 O2. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a different metal. Let's think of a reaction that requires more oxygen. For example, perhaps the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas? Like aluminum reacting with Cl2:\n\n4 Al + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 AlCl3. \n\nThat's 3 Cl2 per 4 Al. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is a compound. Let's think of the reaction of iron(II) sulfide with oxygen. \n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2O3 + SO2. Let me balance this:\n\n4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. \n\nSo 7 O2 per 4 FeS. So per FeS, 7/4 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is something like titanium, reacting with oxygen? Let me see: \n\n4 Ti + 3 O2 \u2192 2 TiO2. Again, 3 O2 per 4 Ti atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is not of a metal with oxygen but another gas. Let's think of gas B being something else. \n\nSuppose gas B is Cl2, and solid A is Fe. The reaction could be Fe + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3. But that's 3 Cl2 per 2 Fe. Not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is a metal reacting with another gas. Let me think of a reaction where the gas is in a higher ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is of a metal sulfide with oxygen to form a sulfate. For example, consider the reaction of FeS with O2 to form Fe2(SO4)3? \n\nBut let's see: \n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. The balanced equation would be:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nSo, 11 O2 per 4 FeS. That's 11/4 O2 per FeS, which is 2.75. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a different metal. Let me think of lead. \n\nLead sulfide (PbS) reacting with O2 to form PbO and SO2. As before, the ratio is 3 O2 per 2 PbS. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is carbon? Like carbon reacting with O2 to form CO2. But that's a gas, not a solid product. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. Let me think of a reaction where the gas is in 8 equivalents. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid is a metal that reacts with a gas in such a way that the stoichiometry is 8:1. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the solid A is aluminum and the gas B is chlorine. \n\nThe reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 AlCl3. So 3 Cl2 per 2 Al atoms. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a gas that requires more equivalents. Let me think of sodium reacting with oxygen. \n\n4 Na + O2 \u2192 2 Na2O. So 1 O2 per 4 Na. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a compound. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe product C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So C must be an oxide that can form two acids when hydrolyzed. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? For example, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then reacting with water might not form acids. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's suppose C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it can form H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (which is a base, but maybe another reaction path? Or maybe it's a different oxide. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two acids are sulfuric acid and another acid. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the second reaction where C reacts with gas D to form E. Suppose that E is a compound like HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is hazardous. But how would that form? \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and D is Cl2. For example, if C is FeO and D is Cl2, then FeO + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is HCl, which is a gas. But HCl is a solvent in some cases, but not a common one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like H2SO4. But that's an acid. \n\nHmm. Let me try to think of another angle. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. So perhaps I can think of possible E molecules and their point groups. The options given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nD\u221eh is the point group for linear molecules like CO2, O2, HCl, etc. C2v is for molecules with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, like water or methane (but methane is tetrahedral, which is Td, so maybe a different shape). D4h is for something like a square planar molecule, like XeF4 (which has D4h symmetry). C2 is a lower symmetry, maybe like a bent molecule with a C2 axis but no higher symmetry. \n\nHmm, so if E is a linear molecule, then it would be D\u221eh. If it's something like CO2, which is linear, but the options include D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a tetrahedral molecule, but that's Td, which isn't an option here. \n\nWait, the options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. Let me think of possible E compounds. \n\nSuppose that E is a molecule like sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is octahedral (Oh), but that's not listed. \n\nAlternatively, if E is CO, which has D\u221eh symmetry. Or maybe O2, which is also D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is bent and has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like H2O (C2v), but that's a solvent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like SO3 (trigonal planar, D3h symmetry, not listed). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a square planar molecule, like XeF4 (D4h). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like SO2. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2 (both D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let's think of possible E compounds based on the reactions. \n\nLet me try to think of possible scenarios. \n\nLet me consider that the solvent H is H2O. Then, the reaction between D and B must form H2O. But for that, B and D must be H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem states 1:1. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like HCl, formed from H2 and Cl2 (1:1). But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent is something like H2SO4? But that's made from SO3 and H2O. \n\nHmm. Let's try another approach. Let's think of the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, so possible candidates are HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HBr, HI. G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH, H2CO3, HCN, H3PO4 (depending on concentration), etc. \n\nSo, if C reacting with water produces A plus a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's suppose that C is a metal oxide that can form two different acids. \n\nWait, maybe C is a metal carbonate? No, because carbonates reacting with water don't form acids. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate, which when hydrolyzed gives H+ and another acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water: FeS + H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Here, H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. But the problem states that when C reacts with water, it forms A (the original solid) plus two acids. Hmm, so maybe the solid A is Fe, but Fe(OH)2 isn't Fe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, if C is Pb(NO3)2, then reacting with water would form HNO3 (strong acid) and Pb(OH)2, which is a base. But that's only one acid. \n\nHmm. Maybe the two acids are from the same compound. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces a metal hydroxide (base) and two acids. But that seems conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a mixture, but that's unlikely. \n\nWait, another idea: suppose that A is a metal sulfide, B is O2. Then the reaction of A with O2 forms C, which could be a sulfate. Let's say A is PbS, reacting with O2 to form PbSO4 (lead sulfate). The balanced equation would be: \n\n2 PbS + 3 O2 + 2 H2O \u2192 2 PbSO4 + 2 H2O? Wait, not sure. Let me balance properly:\n\nPbS + 4 O2 \u2192 PbSO4. \n\nSo, 4 O2 per PbS. \n\nBut the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) per A. So if the ratio here is 4 O2 per 1 PbS, then that's 4 equivalents. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of FeS with O2 forms Fe2(SO4)3. Let me see:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nBalancing: \n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nSo 11 O2 per 4 FeS \u2192 2.75 O2 per FeS. Still not 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the solid A is a metal that reacts with chlorine gas. Let's think of titanium reacting with chlorine:\n\nTi + 2 Cl2 \u2192 TiCl4. So 2 Cl2 per Ti. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a gas in a different ratio. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the product E being something like phosgene (COCl2). That's a toxic gas. Phosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. \n\nSuppose that C reacts with D (which is Cl2) to form phosgene. \n\nBut then C would have to be CO. But CO is a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is something else. \n\nAlternatively, if E is phosgene, then its molecular symmetry group is C2v, since it's a planar molecule with a central C atom, two Cl atoms, and one O atom arranged in a trigonal planar structure. Wait, actually, phosgene has a structure with C in the center, bonded to Cl, Cl, and O. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (through the carbon and the oxygen), and two mirror planes. Let me confirm: \n\nIn phosgene (COCl2), the molecule is planar with the carbon in the center, two Cl atoms and one O. The structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is D3h? Wait no, because the molecule has a central atom with three atoms around it. Wait, actually, in phosgene, the structure is such that the three substituents are two Cl and one O. Since the substituents are not all the same, the point group is C2v. Because there are two mirror planes perpendicular to the C2 axis. \n\nWait, the structure is like: \n\n   Cl\n   |\nCl-C-O\n   |\n   Cl?\n\nNo, no, wait. The actual structure of phosgene is: \n\nThe central carbon is bonded to two Cl atoms and one O atom, arranged in a trigonal planar structure. So the molecule has a C2 axis along the C-O bond. The mirror planes are the plane containing the C-O and one Cl, and the other plane perpendicular to that through the other Cl. So the point group is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if the molecule is linear, like CO2, then it's D\u221eh. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule like carbon dioxide (CO2), which is linear with D\u221eh symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nLet me try to think of possible scenarios where the reactions can be matched. \n\nSuppose the following:\n\n- Solid A is copper (Cu), gas B is nitric acid (but gas?), no, nitric acid is liquid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal like copper reacting with chlorine gas. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following possible scenario:\n\nA is FeS (iron(II) sulfide), gas B is O2. The reaction of FeS with O2 forms Fe2(SO4)3 (iron(III) sulfate), but let's see the balanced equation:\n\n4 FeS + 7 O2 + 2 H2O \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 H2O. \n\nWait, that's not right. Let me balance properly:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nTo balance Fe: 2 FeS \u2192 2 Fe in Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nFor sulfur: 2 FeS gives 2 S \u2192 in Fe2(SO4)3, each S is in SO4^2- \u2192 2*(SO4) \u2192 2 S. So that's balanced. \n\nOxygen: On the right, each SO4 has 4 O, so 3*(SO4) gives 12 O per Fe2(SO4)3. Since there are two FeS, the total O from the sulfate is 12 O. \n\nThe left side has O2. Let's write the equation:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2(SO4)3 \n\nLet me count O:\n\nOn right: 2 Fe2(SO4)3 has 3*4*2 = 24 O from sulfate, so total O is 24. \n\nOn left: 11 O2 gives 22 O atoms. Wait, discrepancy here. Hmm, perhaps I need to include H2O? \n\nWait, maybe the reaction produces H2SO4 as well. Let me try again. \n\nSuppose:\n\nFeS + O2 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3 + H2O \n\nBut need to balance with H2O. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with H2O. \n\nWait, the first reaction is between A (solid) and 8 equivalents of gas B. \n\nLet me try to think of A as S (sulfur). Then, S reacts with O2 to form SO3. \n\nThe reaction: S + O2 \u2192 SO3. \n\nBalanced: 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. \n\nSo for each S, 1.5 O2. Not 8 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is S8 (sulfur in its solid form). \n\nThen: S8 + O2 \u2192 SO3. \n\nLet's balance. \n\nS8 + 12 O2 \u2192 8 SO3. \n\nSo per S8 (which is 8 S atoms), we have 12 O2. So per S atom, 12/8 = 1.5 O2. Still not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a gas to form a metal oxide. Let's consider that C is the metal oxide. \n\nSuppose A is a metal M, and B is O2. The reaction M + O2 \u2192 MOx. The stoichiometry requires that 8 O2 are used per M. \n\nSuppose the formula is M + 4 O2 \u2192 MO8? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a compound. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal sulfide, and B is Cl2. \n\nFor example, FeS + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S. \n\nThe balanced equation: FeS + 3 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S + 3 Cl2? Wait, no. \n\nWait, FeS + 4 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + S + 4 Cl? No. \n\nAlternatively, 2 FeS + 7 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3 + 2 S + 6 Cl2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is FeCl3. \n\nBut then when C reacts with D (gas), it forms E. \n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think of the possible answers and see which point group fits. \n\nThe question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. \n\nIf E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or N2, which have D\u221eh symmetry, that would be option C. \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like CO2 (linear, D\u221eh), same as option C. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v), which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (D4h), option B. \n\nAlternatively, a molecule like O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. Let's think of possible reactions where E is a hazardous product. \n\nAnother possibility: the first reaction is the formation of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) from iron and oxygen. But as before, the stoichiometry isn't matching. \n\nWait, maybe the solid A is a metal that forms a metal nitrate when reacted with oxygen and something else. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between copper and concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), but gas B would be HNO3's gas form? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is copper reacting with nitric acid (as a liquid), but the problem states gas B. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is sulfur (S8) and gas B is O2, forming SO3. Then C is SO3 (which is a liquid at room temperature, but can be a solid?), which is a bright red? No, SO3 is white. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a red-colored compound like Pb3O4 (lead(II,IV) oxide), which is red. \n\nThe reaction could be: \n\n2 Pb + O2 \u2192 2 PbO (black), but not red. \n\nAlternatively, 3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ...? \n\nWait, let's look up lead oxide reactions. \n\nThe formation of Pb3O4 from Pb and O2:\n\n2 Pb + O2 \u2192 2 PbO \n\nThen, further oxidation of PbO with O2:\n\n2 PbO + O2 \u2192 2 PbO2 \n\nBut Pb3O4 is a mixture of PbO and PbO2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is: \n\n3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ... ?\n\nHmm, perhaps the solid A is Pb, and gas B is O2. The reaction forms Pb3O4. \n\nThe balanced equation would be 3 Pb + 4 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4. \n\nSo, for each Pb, 4/3 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following scenario:\n\nSolid A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide). \n\nGas B is O2. \n\nThe reaction forms Fe2O3 and SO3. \n\nWait, let's balance:\n\n4 FeS + 11 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO3. \n\nSo for each FeS, 11/4 O2. \n\nNot 8 equivalents. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of Sb4O6 (antimony trioxide) with O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a halogen. Let's think of titanium reacting with Cl2. \n\n4 Ti + 7 Cl2 \u2192 4 TiCl3. \n\nNo, that's not. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like sodium, and gas B is Cl2. \n\n4 Na + Cl2 \u2192 2 NaCl. \n\nThe ratio is 1 Cl2 per 4 Na. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nWait, perhaps the gas B is a different gas like HCl? But HCl is a gas. \n\nSuppose A is Zn, reacting with HCl (gas) to form ZnCl2, but that's not a solid product. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to think of the possible answers and see which is more likely. \n\nThe question asks for the symmetry group of E. \n\nIf E is a diatomic molecule like O2, N2, Cl2, then D\u221eh (option C). \n\nIf E is a linear molecule like CO2, then also D\u221eh. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v, option D), or O3 (C2v). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a square planar molecule like XeF4 (D4h, option B). \n\nAlternatively, a molecule like H2O (C2v). \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother possibility: The product E could be a compound like phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like carbon disulfide (CS2), which is linear (D\u221eh). \n\nWait, let's think of the reactions again. \n\nSuppose that the solvent H is H2O. Then D and B must form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. That would require D is H2 and B is O2, but that's a 2:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, but that's a 2:1 ratio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is HCl, so D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nH2 + Cl2 \u2192 2 HCl. \n\nThat's a 1:1 ratio. So H is HCl gas. \n\nSo, in this case, solvent H is HCl. \n\nThen, D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nNow, proceeding:\n\nThe first reaction: A (solid) + 8 equivalents of H2 (gas) \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nSo A reacts with 8 H2 to form C. \n\nWhat solid reacts with H2 in an 8:1 ratio? \n\nHmm, maybe a metal that forms a hydride. For example, titanium reacts with H2 to form TiH2. The reaction is Ti + H2 \u2192 TiH2. So per Ti atom, 1 H2. \n\nIf A is Ti, then to get 8 H2 per Ti, the formula would be Ti + 4 H2 \u2192 TiH8? Not common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with another gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like Fe reacting with Cl2 (gas B). \n\nBut in this scenario, B is H2, so that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to think of C as the bright red product. \n\nIf C is V2O5 (vanadium pentoxide), which is bright yellow-orange. \n\nSuppose A is V (vanadium), gas B is O2. \n\nThe reaction would be 4 V + 5 O2 \u2192 2 V2O5. \n\nSo 5 O2 per 4 V atoms. \n\nIf B is O2, then per V atom, 5/4 O2. Not 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with a different gas. \n\nWait, let me try to think of the following possibility: \n\nSuppose the solid A is copper, and gas B is nitric acid vapor (but it's a liquid). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide that is bright red. \n\nWait, lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4) is red. \n\nSuppose the reaction is 3 Pb + 8 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4 + ... \n\nWait, the balanced equation for forming Pb3O4 from Pb and O2 is 3 Pb + 5/2 O2 \u2192 Pb3O4. \n\nSo per 3 Pb, 2.5 O2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide, and gas B is O2 forming a metal sulfate. \n\nSuppose A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide). \n\nThe reaction: 4 FeS + 7 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2. \n\nBut the product Fe2O3 is a red-brown solid. \n\nSo C is Fe2O3. \n\nThen, when C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents), forming E. \n\nWhat gas D could react with Fe2O3? \n\nFe2O3 is a metal oxide. If D is CO, then the reaction is Fe2O3 + 3 CO \u2192 2 Fe + 3 CO2. But that requires 3 CO per Fe2O3, but the question says 2 equivalents. \n\nAlternatively, if D is H2, then Fe2O3 + 3 H2 \u2192 2 Fe + 3 H2O. Again, 3 H2 per Fe2O3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is a different gas. \n\nIf E is a hazardous product, perhaps it's something like chlorine gas, but that's D in this scenario. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with another gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is SO3, reacting with Fe2O3 to form Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nFe2O3 + 3 SO3 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nBut that would need 3 equivalents of SO3, not 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with nitric acid, but D would need to be a gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of Fe2O3 with Cl2. \n\nFe2O3 + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + O2? \n\nNot sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to see what happens when C reacts with water. \n\nIf C is Fe2O3, then reacting with water would form Fe(OH)3, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit the problem's description where F and G are acids. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different oxide. \n\nSuppose C is PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), which is red. \n\nThe reaction of PbO2 with water would form Pb(OH)4^2- (a weak acid?), but not sure. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate. \n\nWait, if C is HgO (mercuric oxide), which is red. \n\nThen, when HgO reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. Let's see: \n\nHgO + D \u2192 E. \n\nSuppose D is SO3, then HgO + SO3 \u2192 HgSO4 (mercury sulfate). \n\nBut then E is HgSO4, which is a solid. Not sure if that's hazardous. \n\nAlternatively, D could be H2 to form Hg + H2O. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent H is H2O, and the reaction between B and D is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O, but that's 2:1 ratio. \n\nWait, but the problem says 1:1. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like H2SO4, formed from SO3 and H2O. \n\nBut then B and D would have to be SO3 and H2O, but H2O is a liquid. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should try to think of possible E molecules and their point groups. \n\nIf E is a diatomic gas like O2, then D\u221eh (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if E is something like NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like COCl2 (phosgene), which is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh). \n\nHmm. \n\nThe question mentions that E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is very toxic, so that fits. Ozone is also hazardous. \n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its point group is C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is NO2, also C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a compound like HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is linear and has D\u221eh symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction where C reacts with D. Suppose C is FeCl3 and D is Cl2, forming FeCl4^- (not sure). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reactions are as follows: \n\nA is FeS (solid), B is O2 (gas). \n\nFeS reacts with O2 to form Fe2O3 and SO3. \n\nFe2O3 is the bright red product (C). \n\nThen, C (Fe2O3) reacts with gas D (maybe SO3) to form Fe2(SO4)3 (E). \n\nFe2O3 + 3 SO3 \u2192 Fe2(SO4)3. \n\nThis requires 3 equivalents of SO3, but the problem states 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is HCl gas. \n\nFe2O3 + 6 HCl \u2192 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2O. \n\nBut that would form FeCl3 and H2O. Not sure if that's E. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, and D is something else. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the solvent H is H2O, so D and B must form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. \n\nIf B is H2 and D is O2, but their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O (2:1 ratio). \n\nSo that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2, forming HCl. \n\nThen H is HCl, which is a solvent (like in hydrochloric acid solution). \n\nSo, D is Cl2 and B is H2. \n\nFirst reaction: A + 8 H2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nWhat solid reacts with H2 in an 8:1 ratio? \n\nMaybe a metal that forms a hydride with a high H content. \n\nFor example, titanium can form TiH2, but that's 1 H2 per Ti. \n\nAlternatively, maybe uranium? \n\nHmm, perhaps the solid is something like calcium carbide (CaC2) reacting with H2 to form something else. \n\nCaC2 + 2 H2 \u2192 CaH2 + C2H2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with H2 to form a metal hydride. \n\nFor instance, if A is a metal M, then: \n\nM + 8 H2 \u2192 MH16? That seems unlikely. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 (B) in the first reaction. \n\nWait, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then the solvent H is HCl. \n\nFirst reaction: A (solid) + 8 Cl2 \u2192 C (bright red). \n\nWhat metal reacts with Cl2 in 8 equivalents to form a red product? \n\nMaybe iron? \n\nFe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. \n\nSo per Fe, 1.5 Cl2. \n\nTo get 8 Cl2 per A, perhaps A is a different metal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal like sodium, but sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl, which is white. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is antimony, reacting with Cl2: \n\nSb + 3 Cl2 \u2192 SbCl3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is of a metal with oxygen to form a metal oxide. \n\nWait, let's try to think of C as the red product, and E as a hazardous product formed from C and D. \n\nIf C is Fe2O3 (red), and D is SO3, then E is Fe2(SO4)3, which is a strong acid? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CO, reacting with Fe2O3 to form CO2 and Fe. \n\nBut that's not hazardous. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the possible answers. \n\nIf E is a diatomic gas like O2, which has D\u221eh (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if E is a bent molecule like SO2 (C2v, option D). \n\nThe question states that E is extremely hazardous. \n\nPhosgene (COCl2) is very toxic and has C2v symmetry (option D). \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is Cl2O, which is a hazardous gas. Cl2O has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is also hazardous and has C2v. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction forms a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh), but that's less hazardous. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is C2v (option D). \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces a molecule like O3 (ozone), which is also C2v. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction between C and D produces a square planar molecule, like maybe XeF4. But I can't see how that would come from the given reactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like CCl4, but that would require B and D to be C and Cl2? Not sure. \n\nGiven the options, and considering common hazardous substances and their symmetry groups, I think the most likely answer is C2v (option D). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product E is CO2 (D\u221eh), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide like FeO reacting with Cl2 (gas D), then FeO + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl2 + O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is Fe2O3 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3 + Cl2O. \n\nBut Cl2O has C2v symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction produces Cl2O, which is a hazardous gas with C2v symmetry. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product E is O3 (ozone), formed from O2 and another substance. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll go with the common hazardous molecules and their symmetry groups. \n\nPhosgene (COCl2) is C2v, so option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is Cl2O (also C2v). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's SO2, which is C2v. \n\nAll of these are C2v, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D4h (option B), but I can't think of a common hazardous molecule with that symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 (D\u221eh), but that's less hazardous. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll choose option D: C2v.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The reactions are analyzed step by step:\n\n1. **Reaction of Solid A with Gas B**: The bright red product C suggests it might be a metal oxide like Fe\u2082O\u2083 (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish-brown. However, the exact identity is less critical than the subsequent reactions.\n\n2. **Reaction of C with Gas D**: The hazardous product E must be a toxic compound. Common candidates include phosgene (COCl\u2082), sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), or ozone (O\u2083), all of which are hazardous and have specific molecular symmetries.\n\n3. **Hydrolysis of C**: Producing two acids (strong and weak) implies C might be a metal oxide reacting with water to form an acid and a base. However, the acids' identities suggest C could be a compound that hydrolyzes into both strong and weak acids, such as a sulfate or nitrate, but the exact mechanism isn't critical here.\n\n4. **Formation of Solvent H**: The solvent H is likely H\u2082O, formed from gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio (e.g., H\u2082 and O\u2082), but their reaction requires a 2:1 ratio. This inconsistency suggests H might be HCl (from H\u2082 and Cl\u2082), a common solvent in specific contexts.\n\nConsidering the molecular symmetry groups:\n- **Phosgene (COCl\u2082)** has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom bonded to two Cl and one O atom, giving it **C\u2082v symmetry**.\n- **Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082)** and **ozone (O\u2083)** also have **C\u2082v symmetry** due to their bent structures.\n- **Diatomic gases** like O\u2082 or CO\u2082 have **D\u221eh symmetry**, but they are less likely to be the hazardous E in this context.\n\nGiven the hazardous nature of E and common toxic molecules with bent geometries, **C\u2082v symmetry (option D)** is the most plausible answer.\n\nAnswer: D",
