      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The problem states that the gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. The mutants were created using EMS, which typically causes point mutations, like single nucleotide changes. The question is asking which of the four mutants (1-4) would most likely stop the production of the compound.\n\nFirst, I should look at each mutant's sequence and compare it to the intact gene. The key here is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the gene is responsible for making the anti-nutritional compound, the best outcome would be a mutation that either stops the gene from being transcribed or, more likely, leads to a non-functional protein. \n\nLooking at the sequences, the mutations are all in the first exon. Since exons are coding regions, any change here could affect the protein. Let me write down the intact gene's first part and the mutants to see where the differences are. \n\nThe intact gene starts with:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nNow, let's compare each mutant:\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nWait, actually, looking again, maybe I should parse each sequence carefully. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe the first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nComparing with Mutant 1: the sequence given is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nHmm, let me check each nucleotide step by step. Let me break down the first part:\n\nIntact gene starts with:\n\nATG (start codon) then T T T C TC G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compare the first few nucleotides. Let me write them out:\n\nIntact gene's first exon sequence (the part given) starts at 5' end:\n\nPositions (assuming the first 3 are ATG as start):\n\n1: A (position 1)\n2: T (position 2)\n3: G (position3, start codon)\n4: T (position4)\n5: T (position5)\n6: T (position6)\n7: C (position7)\n8: T (position8)\n9: C (position9)\n10: G (position10)\n11: C (position11)\n12: T (position12)\n13: G (position13)\n14: G (position14)\n15: T (position15)\n16: A (position16)\n17: C (position17)\n18: T (position18)\n19: T (position19)\n20: C (position20)\n21: T (position21)\n22: G (position22)\n23: T (position23)\n24: G (position24)\n25: G (position25)\n26: A (position26)\n27: T (position27)\n28: G (position28)\n29: A (position29)\n30: A (position30)\n31: C (position31)\n32: A (position32)\n33: T (position33)\n34: A (position34)\n35: T (position35)\n36: T (position36)\n37: T (position37)\n38: A (position38)\n39: T (position39)\n40: T (position40)\n41: G (position41)\n42: T (position42)\n43: C (position43)\n44: G (position44)\n45: T (position45)\n... and so on until TGA (stop codon at the end).\n\nNow looking at each mutant's first part. Let's go step by step.\n\nMutant 1's sequence is:\n\nATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, the first part after ATG:\n\nOriginal (intact):\n\nPositions 4-6 are TTT (positions 4-6). \n\nMutant 1: \n\nLooking at the sequence after ATG:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC...\n\nMutant 1's sequence after ATG is TTCTAC... \n\nWait let's parse:\n\nMutant1's first part after ATG is T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal (positions 1-12):\n\nATG (positions 1-3) followed by T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWait, maybe better to align the sequences:\n\nIntact: \nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1:\nATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, so let me write each sequence's first part:\n\nIntact: \n\nPositions 1-3 (start): ATG\n\nThen positions 4-6: T T T\n\nPosition 7: C (from TTTCTC... so after TTT, next is C at position7?)\n\nWait maybe better to write the first 20 nucleotides:\n\nIntact (starting at 5' end):\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T\n\n22: G\n\n23: T\n\n24: G\n\n25: G\n\n26: A\n\n27: T\n\n28: G\n\n29: A\n\n30: A\n\n31: C\n\n32: A\n\n33: T\n\n34: A\n\n35: T\n\n36: T\n\n37: T\n\n38: A\n\n39: T\n\n40: T\n\n41: G\n\n42: T\n\n43: C\n\n44: G\n\n45: T\n\n... etc.\n\nNow Mutant1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the mutant1 sequence is written as:\n\nATG followed by T T T (positions4-6?), then the next part: \n\nLooking at the next nucleotides after the first few letters:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT is CT, so the next part is CT. In mutant1, after ATGTTT, the next letters are TAC?\n\nWait let's parse mutant1's sequence step by step:\n\nMutant1's sequence: \n\nStarting at 5' end:\n\nATG (positions1-3)\n\nThen the next letters: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, maybe the first part after ATG is:\n\nMutant1:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3), the next nucleotides:\n\nPosition4: T\n\nPosition5: T\n\nPosition6: C (so here, the original had T at position6, but mutant1 has a C here?)\n\nWait original position6 was T (part of the TTT triplet). Let me check again.\n\nWait in the intact gene, the sequence after ATG is TTTCTC... So the first four letters after ATG are TTT C. So positions 4-7 are T, T, T, C.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nLooking at the mutant1 sequence: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACT...\n\nWait the first letters after ATG are T T T C T A C G C T...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1 has a change at position 7?\n\nWait let me compare character by character.\n\nOriginal (intact gene):\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\nATG (positions1-3)\n\nThen:\n\nPositions 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T\n\n22: G\n\n23: T\n\n24: G\n\n25: G\n\n26: A\n\n27: T\n\n28: G\n\n29: A\n\n30: A\n\n31: C\n\n32: A\n\n33: T\n\n34: A\n\n35: T\n\n36: T\n\n37: T\n\n38: A\n\n39: T\n\n40: T\n\n41: G\n\n42: T\n\n43: C\n\n44: G\n\n45: T\n\n...\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\nStarting at 5', the first part:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo let's parse:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (same as original).\n\nPosition4: T (same)\n\nPosition5: T (same)\n\nPosition6: T (same as original here? Wait, but wait:\n\nWait the mutant1's next part after ATG is written as \"TTCTAC...\"? Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant1's sequence is written as:\n\n\"ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nWait after ATG, the next letters are TTT (positions4-6?), then the next part is \"CTAC...\"?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nOriginal after ATG is \"TTTCTC...\" so the 7th position is C.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is \"TTTCTAC...\" so the 7th position is T (since after TTT, the next is T? Wait, perhaps I need to parse each letter step by step.\n\nLet me write the first 15 nucleotides of mutant1:\n\nATG (positions1-3)\n\nThen next letters: T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, the first 10 letters after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-13:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C (same as original?)\n\nWait, no, wait the next after that. Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant1 sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-10:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so positions4-6 are TTT, same as original here)\n\nPosition7: C (same as original's position7 was C?)\n\nWait original position7 was C (since original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC... so the 7th is C?)\n\nWait original's position7 is C, so that's same as mutant1's position7?\n\nHmm, perhaps the difference comes later. Let's see where the first discrepancy is.\n\nWait in the mutant1's sequence after the first few letters, perhaps at position 8?\n\nWait in the original, after position7 (C), the next (position8) is T (since the original sequence after TTTCTC would be T at position8? Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...\n\nBreaking down letters:\n\nAfter ATG (3 letters):\n\nPositions4: T (4)\n\n5: T (5)\n\n6: T (6)\n\n7: C (7)\n\n8: T (8)\n\n9: C (9)\n\n10: G (10)\n\n11: C (11)\n\n12: T (12)\n\n13: G (13)\n\n14: G (14)\n\n15: T (15)\n\n...\n\nNow, mutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3), the next is T T T (positions4-6). Then the next letters: \n\nposition7: C (same as original's C here). \n\nposition8: T (original has T here, so same?)\n\nWait then position9: the original has C at position9. Let's see mutant1's next letters:\n\nAfter position7 C, the next is T? Wait the mutant's sequence is written as TAC... so perhaps after position7 C, the next is T A C?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the mutant1's sequence as:\n\nAfter ATG, the next letters are T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, so position7 is C (original same), then position8 is T (same as original's T at 8?), then position9 is A (but original had C at position9). Oh, here's a difference!\n\nOriginal position9: C (from the original sequence's \"CTC\" at positions7-9: C at 7, T at8, C at9?)\n\nWait let's confirm:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG is TTTCTC (positions4-9). Wait TTT (4-6), then C (7), T (8), C (9). So position9 is C.\n\nMutant1 at position9: Let's see:\n\nThe sequence after ATG's first few letters:\n\nAfter the first TTT (positions4-6), then position7 is C (same as original). The next is T (position8?), then A (position9?) so mutant1 has a change here.\n\nOriginal position9 is C, mutant1 has A here. That's a mutation at position9 (C\u2192A).\n\nSo in mutant1, at position9, the C becomes A. So that's a point mutation.\n\nWhat's the effect of that? Let's see the codons.\n\nThe gene is a coding sequence, so exons are translated. The first exon is being considered here. Let's figure out the codons.\n\nThe start codon is ATG (positions1-3). Then the next codons would be:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (codon 2)\n\nPositions7-9: CTC (codon3 in original; but in mutant1, position9 is A, so CTA)\n\nWait original codon3 (positions7-9) is CTC (which is Leu), but mutant1 would have CTA (Leu as well?), since both CTC and CTA code for Leucine (Leu). So no change in amino acid here. Hmm, maybe that's not a big deal.\n\nWait maybe the mutation is in an earlier position. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the position numbering. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write the first part of each sequence:\n\nOriginal (intact gene):\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nStart with ATG (Met).\n\nThen the next triplet is TTT (position4-6: TTT) which is Phe.\n\nNext triplet is CT C (positions7-9: CTC) which is Leu.\n\nThen positions10-12: GCT (Ala).\n\nThen positions13-15: GGT (Gly).\n\nThen positions16-18: ACT (Thr).\n\nWait let me confirm:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (Met)\n\n4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\n7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\n19-21: TTC (Phe)\n\n22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\n25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\n28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\n31-33: CAT (His)\n\n34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\n37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\n40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n43-45: C G T (Wait, but the end is TGA, so maybe I'm getting ahead).\n\nNow, looking at the mutant sequences:\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nATG (start)\n\nTTT (Phe, same as original)\n\nNext triplet after that: positions7-9: in original it's CTC (Leu), but mutant1's sequence here is:\n\nLooking at the letters after TTT:\n\nOriginal: CTC...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGC...\n\nWait, the next letters after TTT (positions4-6) would be positions7-9:\n\nThe mutant1's next letters are TAC?\n\nWait let me parse:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next nucleotides are:\n\nposition7: C (same as original)\n\nposition8: T (same as original?)\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nSo after TTT (positions4-6), the next is CT (positions7-8?), then A?\n\nWait let me do this step by step:\n\nThe first 9 nucleotides (after ATG) in mutant1:\n\nPositions 4-9:\n\nPositions4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so TTT)\n\nThen position7: C (same as original's C here)\n\nposition8: T (original has T here, so same?)\n\nposition9: A (original had C here, so here's a mutation: C\u2192A at position9)\n\nTherefore, the codon at positions7-9 in mutant1 is CTA (since positions7-9: C T A), whereas original was CTC (C T C).\n\nCTA is still Leu (Leu is CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG), so the codon is still Leu. So no change in amino acid here.\n\nHmm, so that mutation may not affect the protein.\n\nNext, moving on to the next codon. The next triplet after positions7-9 (Leu) would be positions10-12 in the original was GCT (Ala). Let's see mutant1's sequence here.\n\nIn mutant1's sequence after the CTA (positions7-9), the next letters are GCT (positions10-12?), so same as original.\n\nSo that codon is still GCT (Ala).\n\nContinuing, the next codon would be positions13-15: in original, that's GGT (Gly). In mutant1's sequence, after GCT comes GGT? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence after the first part:\n\n\"CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nWait, after the first few letters, the next part after GCT (positions10-12) would be GGT (positions13-15). So that seems unchanged. \n\nSo up to here, the mutations in mutant1 only caused a C\u2192A at position9, but that didn't change the amino acid. So the protein would still be the same here. So mutant1 might not be the right answer.\n\nNow, looking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG was TTTCTC...\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TTCTAA GCT...\n\nWait let's break it down:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nPositions4-6:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nMutant2's sequence here is T T C (positions4-6?), so:\n\nPosition4: T\n\nPosition5: T\n\nPosition6: C (so original had T at position6, now C here. So position6 is mutated T\u2192C.\n\nSo the first triplet after ATG is now TTC (positions4-6) instead of TTT (original).\n\nTTC is also Phe (same as TTT), so no change in amino acid here.\n\nThen moving on, the next triplet would be positions7-9:\n\nOriginal had CTC (Leu). Let's see mutant2's sequence here.\n\nThe sequence after the first 6 nucleotides (ATG followed by TTC):\n\nThe next nucleotides in mutant2 are AAG?\n\nWait the sequence is written as \"...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nWait, let me parse the first part:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, after ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T C (so TTC)\n\nThen positions7-9: AAG (since next letters after TTC are A A G? Wait let's see:\n\nWait the sequence after TTC (positions4-6) would be the next nucleotides. Let's see:\n\nThe mutant2's sequence is \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nSo after TCT (positions4-6?), no, let me count step by step.\n\nWait:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG\n\n4: T (position4)\n\n5: T (position5)\n\n6: C (position6 \u2192 mutation here T\u2192C)\n\nThen positions7-9:\n\nLooking at the next letters after position6 (C), the next is A (position7?), then A (position8?), G (position9?).\n\nWait the sequence after position6 (C) is \"AAG...\" so positions7-9: A A G.\n\nThus, the codon at positions7-9 is AAG (Lys), whereas original was CTC (Leu). That's a significant change. \n\nOriginal codon 3 (positions7-9): CTC (Leu)\n\nMutant2's codon3: AAG (Lys). \n\nSo that's an amino acid change from Leu to Lys. This could affect the protein's function, but it's not clear if it would stop the gene's function entirely. Since the question wants to eliminate the compound, perhaps a stop codon would be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation leads to a frameshift?\n\nWait, no, since it's a point mutation (EMS usually causes point mutations), so changing one nucleotide here is a missense mutation (unless it's a stop codon).\n\nWait, but in this case, the mutation at position6 (T\u2192C) changes the second codon from TTT to TTC (still Phe, no change), and the third codon (positions7-9) is now AAG (Lys) instead of CTC (Leu). So the protein would have a different amino acid here. Maybe this mutation disrupts the protein's function enough to stop the compound's production, but it's not certain yet. Let's check other mutants.\n\nMutant3:\n\nSequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nSo let's parse:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nThen positions4-6: T T T (same as original's TTT, since the first part is ATGTTTT... so after the first T, there's another T? Wait, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps the first part after ATG is TTTT?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG\n\nThen position4: T (position4)\n\nposition5: T (position5)\n\nposition6: T (position6) \u2192 TTT (same as original's first codon after start)\n\nThen position7: T (original had C here, so this is a mutation: C\u2192T at position7)\n\nWait original's position7 was C (as in the original sequence's TTTCTC... so position7 is C). \n\nMutant3's position7 is T, so that's a C\u2192T change here.\n\nSo the codon at positions7-9 would be:\n\nOriginal: positions7-9: CTC \u2192 Leu\n\nMutant3: positions7-9: T (position7), then next two?\n\nWait the next letters after the first part:\n\nThe mutant3 sequence after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?) Wait, let me parse step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (4)\n\n5: T (5)\n\n6: T (6 \u2192 TTT, same as original first codon)\n\n7: T (position7 \u2192 original had C here, so mutation C\u2192T here)\n\nposition8: C (original had T here at position8? Wait original's position8 was T (from TTTCTC...)\n\nWait original's positions7-9: C (7), T (8), C (9). \n\nIn mutant3, position7 is T, so the codon at 7-9 would be T C G? Wait let me see:\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after position7 (T) is:\n\nLooking at the given sequence: after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?), the next letters are ACG? \n\nWait the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?):\n\nWait the first 7 letters after ATG are TTTT? Wait:\n\nWait the sequence starts with ATG followed by TTTT (so positions4-7: T T T T?), but that would mean that the first codon after the start is TTT (positions4-6) and the next codon starts at position7. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider codons properly.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at codons:\n\nFirst codon after start (positions4-6): TTT (original and mutant3 same here).\n\nSecond codon (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (Leu)\n\nMutant3: The 7th position is T (from C\u2192T mutation), so the codon is T followed by the next two nucleotides.\n\nLooking at the mutant3's sequence after position7: \n\nThe next letters after position7 (T) would be C (position8?), G (position9?), so the codon at 7-9 is TCG (Ser). \n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after ATGTTTT is \"ACG...\"?\n\nWait, let me check the exact letters:\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo positions4-7: T T T T (so positions4-6 are TTT (codon1), then position7 is T (start of codon2). Codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nposition7: T\n\nposition8: A (since the next letters after TTT are TAC... so position8 is A?)\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's parse the first part of mutant3's sequence step by step:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG\n\nPositions4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so first codon after start: TTT (positions4-6))\n\nPosition7: T (so codon2 starts at position7)\n\nPosition8: A (the next letter is A, from TAC...)\n\nPosition9: C\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9): TAC (which is Tyr). \n\nOriginal codon2 was CTC (Leu). So here, the mutation at position7 (C\u2192T) changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. \n\nBut then, looking further, the next part of the sequence in mutant3: \n\nAfter TAC (positions7-9), the next triplet would be GCT (positions10-12). Original had GCT (Ala), so same here. \n\nHmm, so this mutation changes Leu to Tyr. Again, not a stop, but an amino acid change. \n\nWait, but the mutant3's sequence continues as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait, perhaps there's a frameshift? Wait, no, it's a point mutation, so no frameshift unless the mutation is an insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations. \n\nHmm. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the options again. \n\nNow, moving to Mutant4:\n\nMutant4's sequence: \n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nParsing this:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original's first codon TTT)\n\nPosition7: T (mutation here again, original had C at position7 \u2192 C\u2192T)\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nposition7: T\n\nposition8: A (from the sequence TAC...)\n\nposition9: C \u2192 so TAC (Tyr), same as mutant3's codon here?\n\nWait, let's parse mutant4's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\npositions4-6: TTT (same as before)\n\nposition7: T (mutation C\u2192T)\n\nposition8: A (from the sequence TAC...)\n\nposition9: C \u2192 so codon7-9 is TAC (Tyr)\n\nThen positions10-12: G T A? Wait the sequence after TAC is \"GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nWait let me look carefully:\n\nThe mutant4's sequence after the first part is \"TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nWait positions10-12 would be positions after TAC (positions7-9):\n\npositions10: G (position10), position11: C (position11), position12: T (position12). \n\nWait original's positions10-12 were GCT (Ala). \n\nIn mutant4's sequence, after TAC (positions7-9), the next nucleotides are GCT (positions10-12) \u2192 so same as original. \n\nWait, but then the next part: \n\nAfter GCT (positions10-12) comes ACT (positions13-15?), but original had GGT (Gly). \n\nWait let's see:\n\nMutant4's sequence after GCT:\n\nThe next letters are ACT (positions13-15?), so codon would be ACT (Thr). \n\nOriginal had GGT (Gly) at positions13-15. \n\nSo here, positions13-15 in mutant4: A C T \u2192 ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). That's another amino acid change.\n\nHmm, so mutant4 has two mutations: position7 (C\u2192T) leading to Tyr instead of Leu, and then at positions13-15, ACT instead of GGT. \n\nBut perhaps there's a deletion or insertion here?\n\nWait the original sequence after GCT (positions10-12) was GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT. Wait, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence:\n\nAfter GCT comes ACT. The original had GGT there, so perhaps there's a mutation at position13? Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions13-15: GGT (positions13: G, 14: G, 15:T)\n\nMutant4's sequence here: A (position13?), C (14?), T (15?) \u2192 so G\u2192A at position13, then G\u2192C, T\u2192T? Not sure. Maybe a different mutation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift. Wait, but the question states that EMS was used, which usually causes point mutations, so maybe it's a point mutation here.\n\nWait the mutant4's sequence shows \"TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe key is to find a mutation that leads to a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), which would truncate the protein, making it non-functional. Alternatively, a mutation that disrupts the start codon (but start is ATG in all mutants, so that's not it here). \n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence for possible stop codons early on.\n\nThe stop codon is TGA at the end, but the question is whether any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.\n\nLet me check each mutant for premature stop codons.\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe sequence ends with TGA, so the original stop is there. Any other TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequence before the end?\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence given as \"...TGA-3\u2019\". The part before the TGA is \"...TCGC...TGA\". The TGA is the stop. Are there any other stop codons?\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nMutant1's sequence after the start has codons like:\n\nATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TTC (Phe), TGG (Trp), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), ... and ending with TGA.\n\nWait, the first few codons are okay. The mutation in mutant1 was position9 C\u2192A (making CTA instead of CTC), but that's still Leu. So no stop.\n\nMutant2:\n\nThe mutation at position7-9 (changing CTC to AAG). The rest continues. The stop is still TGA at the end. Are there any other stops?\n\nLooking at the codons after the mutation:\n\nThe first codon after the mutation (AAG) would be the next triplet. Let's see:\n\nAfter AAG (positions7-9), the next codon is positions10-12: in original it was GCT (Ala). In mutant2, after AAG, what's next?\n\nWait mutant2's sequence after ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nThe sequence after AAG (positions7-9) is CTGGT... so positions10-12 would be C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). Then the following codons proceed normally. So no stop codons introduced.\n\nMutant3:\n\nLooking at the sequence provided, mutant3's sequence is \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait, perhaps looking for a stop codon. Let me see:\n\nThe mutation in mutant3 introduced TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu) at positions7-9, but then the rest continues. Unless a stop is introduced later, but the given sequence ends with TGA. \n\nWait in mutant3's sequence, after the first part, there's a part where the sequence might have a stop. Let me see:\n\nThe mutant3's sequence is written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nLooking at the part GTG TCA CTC TGT GG... \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGTG (Val), TCA (Ser), CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. So no stop codon.\n\nMutant4:\n\nThe sequence given is \"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait let me parse the mutant4's sequence again. The sequence after the initial mutations:\n\nMutant4's sequence after the start is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter the start codon (ATG):\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\nPositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\nPositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nPositions13-15: ACT (Thr) \u2192 this is a change from original's GGT (Gly)\n\nThen positions16-18: TTC (Phe, same as original?)\n\nWait, the next part of the sequence is \"TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait positions16-18 would be TCT (positions16-18?):\n\nWait let's see:\n\nAfter ACT (positions13-15):\n\npositions16: T (from \"TTCTGT...\" so position16: T)\n\nposition17: C (position17)\n\nposition18: T (position18 \u2192 TCT (Ser))\n\nHmm, so the codon at 16-18 is TCT (Ser), which may have been different before. \n\nBut where is the stop codon?\n\nThe original stop is TGA at the end. The question is, does mutant4 have any premature stop?\n\nWait, looking at the sequence given for mutant4:\n\n\"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait, perhaps in the part \"CTTCTGTGGATGA...\", let's parse codons:\n\nSuppose after the first part, the sequence continues:\n\n...ACT (positions13-15), then TCT (positions16-18), GTG (positions19-21?), TGG (positions22-24?), etc. \n\nWait, let's consider that in mutant4's sequence, after the ACT (Thr at positions13-15), the next codons might be:\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... until the TGA stop.\n\nNo stop codons introduced here. \n\nHmm, so none of the mutants so far have a premature stop codon. \n\nWait maybe I missed something. Let me check each mutant again for possible frameshift mutations. \n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns, but the mutations are in the first exon. Since introns are spliced out, mutations in exons affect the coding sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. Frameshift would occur if there's an insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes). \n\nWait, let's check if any of the mutations caused a frameshift by changing a nucleotide which might cause a shift in reading frame. \n\nWait, a frameshift requires a deletion or insertion, but a point mutation (single nucleotide change) won't cause a frameshift. So frameshift is out. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a stop codon within the coding region. \n\nLooking again, maybe I missed a stop codon in one of the sequences. \n\nLet me check mutant3's sequence again. \n\nThe mutant3's sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nLooking at the \"TGTCACTTCTG...\" part. Let me break it into codons:\n\nFor example, after some point:\n\nSuppose the sequence has ...TGT CAC TTC TGT...\n\nWait, but maybe there's a TGA somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a stop?\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after the start: \n\n\"TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nBreaking down the letters after the start:\n\nAfter the initial part:\n\npositions1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: TAC\n\n10-12: GCT\n\n13-15: ACT\n\n16-18: TCT\n\n19-21: GTG\n\n22-24: TGG\n\n25-27: GAT\n\n28-30: GAA\n\n31-33: CAT\n\n34-36: ATT\n\n37-39: TAT\n\n40-42: TGT\n\n...\n\nContinuing until TGA. \n\nWait, the part \"CTTCTGTGGATGA...\" \n\nWait, positions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n...\n\nLooking at the letters after that, perhaps in the middle there's a TGA?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant2's sequence, after the mutation at positions7-9 (AAG), the next codons might form a stop. \n\nMutant2's sequence after the AAG (positions7-9):\n\npositions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu)\n\npositions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val)\n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: TGG (Trp)\n\n... So no stops.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I'm missing something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation in Mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide, but the question says EMS, which is a point mutagen. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement again: \"you sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.\"\n\nThe key might be that the mutation causes the gene to not be transcribed, but since exons are coding regions, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon early on, so the protein is truncated and non-functional. \n\nWait, looking at the given sequences again, perhaps I made an error in analyzing Mutant3 or 4. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait let me look at the part where it says \"GTGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nBreaking that into codons:\n\nGTG TCA CTC TGT... \n\nWait, the \"GTGTCA\" would be split as GTG TCA (Val-Ser), then CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys)... \n\nBut maybe there's a TGA in there?\n\nWait the sequence after GTG TCA CTC TGT is \"...TGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLooking at \"TGGATGA...\", breaking into codons:\n\nTGG (Trp), ATG (Met), AAT (Asn), CAT (His)... \n\nWait, here is a TGA in \"ATGA\" ?\n\nWait \"ATGA\" would be ATG (start codon) followed by A, but in the sequence, after TGG comes ATG. \n\nWait, the part \"TGGATGAACATAT...\" would have TGG (positions?), then ATG (positions?), then AAT, CAT...\n\nWait, the codon after TGG would be ATG (positions?), which is a start codon. But since it's in the middle of the coding sequence, that could be problematic, but it's not a stop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4's sequence, after some point there's a TGA?\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence: \"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nWait \"GATGAAC...\" \u2192 GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His)... \n\nHmm, no stop there. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide. Let me see the sequence again. \n\nThe intact gene's sequence after the first part is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nMutant4's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nWait, the original after the start was:\n\nTTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nWait, the difference between the intact and mutant4's sequence at the start:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC (positions4-9: T T T C T C)\n\nMutant4 has TTTTAC (positions4-9: T T T T A C). \n\nWait, this suggests that between positions4-9, there's an extra T (making it TTTT instead of TTT), but that would require an insertion, which isn't a point mutation. Wait no, let me count the letters:\n\nOriginal's first few letters after ATG: TTTCTC (positions4-9: T T T C T C).\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTAC (positions4-9: T T T T A C). \n\nSo the original had 6 nucleotides (positions4-9: 6 letters), mutant4 also has 6 letters (T T T T A C). So no insertion or deletion here. \n\nWait, perhaps the mutation is a T insertion at position7? No, it's a point mutation. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the sequence provided for mutant4:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nPosition7-9: CTC (positions7-9)\n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: T (mutation from C\u2192T)\n\nPosition8: A (original had T here?)\n\nWait, original's position8 was T (from TTTCTC... the 8th position is T). \n\nSo mutant4's position8 is A, changing from T\u2192A.\n\nSo codon at positions7-9 is T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) \u2192 TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu).\n\nThen the next codon is positions10-12: GCT (Ala), same as original.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in mutant4, the mutation caused a premature stop codon. Let me check the rest of the sequence more carefully.\n\nWait, the mutant4's sequence ends with \"...TGA\" so the stop is there, but perhaps earlier?\n\nLooking at the part after \"ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, the sequence after ACT (positions13-15) is TCT (positions16-18: TCT), then GTG (positions19-21?), TGG (positions22-24?), etc. \n\nWait maybe there's a stop codon like TGA in there. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nAfter the ACT (Thr), the sequence continues as TCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nBreaking down into codons:\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\n19-21: GTG (Val)\n\n22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\n25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\n28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\n31-33: CAT (His)\n\n34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\n37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\n40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... \n\nNo TGA until the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4? Or maybe I missed a mutation leading to a stop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about disrupting the start codon, but all start with ATG. \n\nWait, another possibility: the mutation causes the gene to not be expressed. But since the question is about the compound being synthesized by the gene, maybe knocking out the gene's function is the key. \n\nAlternatively, the mutation could be in a splice site, but since the mutations are in the first exon, not near introns. The first exon's intron is after the first exon? Wait the gene has five exons, so the first exon would have an intron after it (between exon1 and exon2). \n\nBut since the mutation is in the first exon, maybe it doesn't affect splicing. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4 because it has a deletion? Wait, the problem says EMS, which causes point mutations. \n\nWait, looking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nThe original sequence after the first few nucleotides is:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence is \"...ACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, comparing the original and mutant3's sequences:\n\nOriginal after the first part: \n\nPositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\nMutant3's sequence after positions10-12 (GCT):\n\npositions13-15: GGT \u2192 but in mutant3's sequence, after GCT comes G (position13?), T (position14?), G (position15?)? Or maybe it's different. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence after GCT is \"GGTGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nWait, so positions13-15 would be GGT (same as original?), but then the next codon is GTC (positions16-18?), which is different. \n\nWait maybe in mutant3's sequence, after the first part, there's a change in the codon that leads to a stop. \n\nWait looking at the part \"GTCACTTCTGTGG...\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... \n\nNo stop there. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the mutations. Let me think differently. \n\nThe question asks which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". That means the mutation should prevent the gene from producing the protein. \n\nThe most effective way would be to introduce a premature stop codon early in the gene, leading to a truncated protein that can't function. \n\nIf any of the mutants have a premature stop, that's the answer. \n\nLooking again:\n\nMutant4's sequence has a change at position7 (C\u2192T), leading to TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). \n\nThen, continuing:\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: GGT (Gly) in original, but in mutant4, after ACT (positions13-15?), perhaps a different codon? Wait I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, the mutation at position7 (C\u2192T) and another mutation later causes a stop. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"TGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nTGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys)... \n\nNo stop. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe I need to consider that the mutation in mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. But the question states EMS, which is a point mutagen. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Mutant4 because the mutation causes a frameshift? But how?\n\nWait the problem says the gene has five exons and four introns. If the first exon is where the mutation is, and if the mutation is in a splice site, but since it's in the exon, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 is a nonsense mutation (premature stop). \n\nWait, let me look again at the first part of mutant4's sequence:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter the start codon (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... and so on until TGA. \n\nNo premature stop. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is mutant2. Let me think again. \n\nMutant2's mutation changes the third codon (positions7-9) from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). But then, what if further down the line, this leads to a stop? \n\nWait, let's see further codons in mutant2:\n\nAfter AAG (Lys at positions7-9), the next codons would be positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\npositions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val). \n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser). \n\npositions19-21: TGG (Trp). \n\npositions22-24: GAT (Asp). \n\npositions25-27: GAA (Glu). \n\npositions28-30: CAT (His). \n\npositions31-33: ATT (Ile). \n\npositions34-36: TAT (Tyr). \n\npositions37-39: TGT (Cys). \n\n... and so on. \n\nNo stop codons here. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is the mutation that changes the start codon, but none of them do. \n\nWait looking at the sequences again: \n\nThe intact gene starts with ATG. \n\nMutant1's first three nucleotides are ATG \u2192 same as original.\n\nMutant2: same.\n\nMutant3: same.\n\nMutant4: same.\n\nSo no change in start codon. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation is in the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon. \n\nWait the first exon is part of the coding sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the first mutation in mutant1 causes a change from CTC to CTA (still Leu), so no effect. \n\nMutant2 changes CTC to AAG (Lys), which might disrupt the protein's function. \n\nMutant3 changes CTC to TAC (Tyr) \u2192 also a change. \n\nMutant4 also changes CTC to TAC (Tyr) like mutant3, but also has a change in another codon. \n\nBut the question says to \"eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\", which would require the gene to not produce the protein. \n\nSo the best way is to have a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or frameshift. \n\nSince none of the options have a premature stop, maybe the answer is the one that introduces a nonsense mutation later, but I didn't find any. \n\nWait wait, looking at mutant3's sequence again:\n\nThe sequence given for mutant3 is \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"TGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" \n\nBreaking into codons near the end:\n\nLooking for TGA somewhere in the middle. \n\nWait, the part \"GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" \n\nBreaking down:\n\nG (position?), T (position?), G (position?) \u2192 GTG (Val) \n\nGAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys)... \n\nNo. \n\nWait maybe I missed a TGA in the sequence. \n\nWait, the intact gene's sequence ends with TGA, so the mutants also have that. The question is whether any of the mutants have an early stop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has two mutations, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first mutation in mutant4's first codon after start is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). \n\nWait no, the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) in all cases. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing mutant3's sequence. Let me look at the first part of mutant3's sequence again:\n\nMutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the first part after the start:\n\nATG (start)\n\nThen TTT (positions4-6: Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: GTG (Val) \u2192 because the next letters are G T G?\n\nWait, in the original, positions13-15 were GGT (Gly), but in mutant3, it's GTG (Val). \n\nSo that's a change from GGT (Gly) to GTG (Val). \n\nHmm, so two amino acid changes. \n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation in mutant3 causes a frameshift? \n\nWait, no, it's a point mutation. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because the mutation creates a stop codon in the next codon. Let me see:\n\nMutant2's sequence after the mutation (AAG at positions7-9):\n\nThe next codon is positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\nNo stop. \n\nWait I'm stuck here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the first mutation causing a stop codon in the first exon. \n\nWait, let's look at the first few codons again:\n\nIn mutant2, the third codon is AAG (positions7-9). \n\nThe next codon is positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\nThen positions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val). \n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser). \n\npositions19-21: T G G \u2192 TGG (Trp). \n\npositions22-24: G A T \u2192 GAT (Asp). \n\npositions25-27: G A A \u2192 GAA (Glu). \n\npositions28-30: C A T \u2192 CAT (His). \n\npositions31-33: A T T \u2192 ATT (Ile). \n\npositions34-36: T A T \u2192 TAT (Tyr). \n\npositions37-39: T G T \u2192 TGT (Cys). \n\n... and so on. \n\nNo stop codons here. \n\nWait, maybe the first mutation in mutant2 causes a stop codon in a later codon due to a chain of events? For example, a mutation that leads to a stop further down, but I don't see it. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the first mutation in mutant2 (changing CTC to AAG) causes a premature stop codon in the next codon. \n\nWait, the next codon after AAG is CTG (Leu), so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the correct answer is the one that disrupts the first exon's splicing. \n\nWait, but the first exon's intron is after it, so the splice sites are between exon1 and exon2. If the mutation is in the first exon's sequence, it doesn't affect the splice site unless it's near the exon-intron boundary. But the problem states the mutation is in the beginning of the first exon, so maybe not near the splice site. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a mutation that causes the gene to be non-functional. For example, the first mutation (changing CTC to TAC) alters an important region of the protein, preventing it from functioning. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, but I can't see why. \n\nWait, let's look back at the options and see what the question is asking for. The question is which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". \n\nSince the compound is produced by the gene's product, the best way to eliminate it is to knock out the gene's function. The most effective way is a premature stop, but since none are present, maybe a frameshift. \n\nWait, but EMS causes point mutations, so frameshift requires an insertion/deletion. \n\nWait, perhaps one of the mutations caused a change that introduces a stop codon. \n\nWait, looking at mutant3's sequence again: \n\nThe sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"CACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nBreaking down:\n\nC A C (CAC) \u2192 His\n\nT T C (TTC) \u2192 Phe\n\nT G T (TGT) \u2192 Cys\n\nG G A (GGA) \u2192 Gly\n\nT G A (TGA) \u2192 Stop codon! \n\nWait, here we go. \n\nWait let me parse this part carefully:\n\nIn mutant3's sequence, after some codons:\n\nLooking at the letters \"CACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\npositions (let's say after some point):\n\nC A C \u2192 CAC (His)\n\nT T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\nT G T \u2192 TGT (Cys)\n\nG G A \u2192 GGA (Gly)\n\nT G A \u2192 TGA (Stop codon!)\n\nAh!

      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the sequences for premature stop codons or disruptive mutations. \n\n**Key Analysis:**\n- **Mutant 1**: The mutation at position 9 (C\u2192A) changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), which does not alter the amino acid. No premature stop codon is introduced.\n- **Mutant 2**: The mutation at positions 7-9 (CTC\u2192AAG) changes codon 3 from Leu to Lys. This missense mutation may disrupt function but does not introduce a premature stop codon.\n- **Mutant 3**: The mutation at position 7 (C\u2192T) changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Further downstream, the sequence introduces a premature stop codon (TGA) at positions 25-27. This truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional.\n- **Mutant 4**: The mutation at position 7 (C\u2192T) changes codon 3 to TAC (Tyr). While there are other amino acid changes, no premature stop codon is introduced.\n\n**Conclusion**: Mutant 3 introduces a premature stop codon, ensuring the protein is non-functional, thereby eliminating the compound.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The problem states that the gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. The mutants were created using EMS, which typically causes point mutations, like single nucleotide changes. The question is asking which of the four mutants (1-4) would most likely stop the production of the compound.\n\nFirst, I should look at each mutant's sequence and compare it to the intact gene. The key here is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the gene is responsible for making the anti-nutritional compound, the best outcome would be a mutation that either stops the gene from being transcribed or, more likely, leads to a non-functional protein. \n\nLooking at the sequences, the mutations are all in the first exon. Since exons are coding regions, any change here could affect the protein. Let me write down the intact gene's first part and the mutants to see where the differences are. \n\nThe intact gene starts with:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nNow, let's compare each mutant:\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nWait, actually, looking again, maybe I should parse each sequence carefully.

Wait TTT (4-6), then C (7), T (8), C (9). So position9 is C.\n\nMutant1 at position9: Let's see:\n\nThe sequence after ATG's first few letters:\n\nAfter the first TTT (positions4-6), then position7 is C (same as original). The next is T (position8?), then A (position9?) so mutant1 has a change here.\n\nOriginal position9 is C, mutant1 has A here. That's a mutation at position9 (C\u2192A).\n\nSo in mutant1, at position9, the C becomes A. So that's a point mutation.\n\nWhat's the effect of that? Let's see the codons.\n\nThe gene is a coding sequence, so exons are translated. The first exon is being considered here. Let's figure out the codons.\n\nThe start codon is ATG (positions1-3). Then the next codons would be:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (codon 2)\n\nPositions7-9: CTC (codon3 in original; but in mutant1, position9 is A, so CTA)\n\nWait original codon3 (positions7-9) is CTC (which is Leu), but mutant1 would have CTA (Leu as well?), since both CTC and CTA code for Leucine (Leu). So no change in amino acid here. Hmm, maybe that's not a big deal.\n\nWait maybe the mutation is in an earlier position. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the position numbering. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write the first part of each sequence:\n\nOriginal (intact gene):\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nStart with ATG (Met).\n\nThen the next triplet is TTT (position4-6: TTT) which is Phe.\n\nNext triplet is CT C (positions7-9: CTC) which is Leu.\n\nThen positions10-12: GCT (Ala).\n\nThen positions13-15: GGT (Gly).\n\nThen positions16-18: ACT (Thr).\n\nWait let me confirm:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (Met)\n\n4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\n7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\n19-21: TTC (Phe)\n\n22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\n25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\n28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\n31-33: CAT (His)\n\n34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\n37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\n40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n43-45: C G T (Wait, but the end is TGA, so maybe I'm getting ahead).\n\nNow, looking at the mutant sequences:\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nATG (start)\n\nTTT (Phe, same as original)\n\nNext triplet after that: positions7-9: in original it's CTC (Leu), but mutant1's sequence here is:\n\nLooking at the letters after TTT:\n\nOriginal: CTC...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGC...\n\nWait, the next letters after TTT (positions4-6) would be positions7-9:\n\nThe mutant1's next letters are TAC?\n\nWait let me parse:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next nucleotides are:\n\nposition7: C (same as original)\n\nposition8: T (same as original?)\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nSo after TTT (positions4-6), the next is CT (positions7-8?), then A?\n\nWait let me do this step by step:\n\nThe first 9 nucleotides (after ATG) in mutant1:\n\nPositions 4-9:\n\nPositions4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so TTT)\n\nThen position7: C (same as original's C here)\n\nposition8: T (original has T here, so same?)\n\nposition9: A (original had C here, so here's a mutation: C\u2192A at position9)\n\nTherefore, the codon at positions7-9 in mutant1 is CTA (since positions7-9: C T A), whereas original was CTC (C T C).\n\nCTA is still Leu (Leu is CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG), so the codon is still Leu. So no change in amino acid here.\n\nHmm, so that mutation may not affect the protein.\n\nNext, moving on to the next codon. The next triplet after positions7-9 (Leu) would be positions10-12 in the original was GCT (Ala). Let's see mutant1's sequence here.\n\nIn mutant1's sequence after the CTA (positions7-9), the next letters are GCT (positions10-12?), so same as original.\n\nSo that codon is still GCT (Ala).\n\nContinuing, the next codon would be positions13-15: in original, that's GGT (Gly). In mutant1's sequence, after GCT comes GGT? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence after the first part:\n\n\"CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nWait, after the first few letters, the next part after GCT (positions10-12) would be GGT (positions13-15). So that seems unchanged. \n\nSo up to here, the mutations in mutant1 only caused a C\u2192A at position9, but that didn't change the amino acid. So the protein would still be the same here. So mutant1 might not be the right answer.\n\nNow, looking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG was TTTCTC...\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TTCTAA GCT...\n\nWait let's break it down:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nPositions4-6:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nMutant2's sequence here is T T C (positions4-6?), so:\n\nPosition4: T\n\nPosition5: T\n\nPosition6: C (so original had T at position6, now C here. So position6 is mutated T\u2192C.\n\nSo the first triplet after ATG is now TTC (positions4-6) instead of TTT (original).\n\nTTC is also Phe (same as TTT), so no change in amino acid here.\n\nThen moving on, the next triplet would be positions7-9:\n\nOriginal had CTC (Leu). Let's see mutant2's sequence here.\n\nThe sequence after the first 6 nucleotides (ATG followed by TTC):\n\nThe next nucleotides in mutant2 are AAG?\n\nWait the sequence is written as \"...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nWait, let me parse the first part:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, after ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T C (so TTC)\n\nThen positions7-9: AAG (since next letters after TTC are A A G? Wait let's see:\n\nWait the sequence after TTC (positions4-6) would be the next nucleotides. Let's see:\n\nThe mutant2's sequence is \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nSo after TCT (positions4-6?), no, let me count step by step.\n\nWait:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG\n\n4: T (position4)\n\n5: T (position5)\n\n6: C (position6 \u2192 mutation here T\u2192C)\n\nThen positions7-9:\n\nLooking at the next letters after position6 (C), the next is A (position7?), then A (position8?), G (position9?).\n\nWait the sequence after position6 (C) is \"AAG...\" so positions7-9: A A G.\n\nThus, the codon at positions7-9 is AAG (Lys), whereas original was CTC (Leu). That's a significant change. \n\nOriginal codon 3 (positions7-9): CTC (Leu)\n\nMutant2's codon3: AAG (Lys). \n\nSo that's an amino acid change from Leu to Lys. This could affect the protein's function, but it's not clear if it would stop the gene's function entirely. Since the question wants to eliminate the compound, perhaps a stop codon would be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation leads to a frameshift?\n\nWait, no, since it's a point mutation (EMS usually causes point mutations), so changing one nucleotide here is a missense mutation (unless it's a stop codon).\n\nWait, but in this case, the mutation at position6 (T\u2192C) changes the second codon from TTT to TTC (still Phe, no change), and the third codon (positions7-9) is now AAG (Lys) instead of CTC (Leu). So the protein would have a different amino acid here. Maybe this mutation disrupts the protein's function enough to stop the compound's production, but it's not certain yet. Let's check other mutants.\n\nMutant3:\n\nSequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nSo let's parse:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nThen positions4-6: T T T (same as original's TTT, since the first part is ATGTTTT... so after the first T, there's another T? Wait, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps the first part after ATG is TTTT?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG\n\nThen position4: T (position4)\n\nposition5: T (position5)\n\nposition6: T (position6) \u2192 TTT (same as original's first codon after start)\n\nThen position7: T (original had C here, so this is a mutation: C\u2192T at position7)\n\nWait original's position7 was C (as in the original sequence's TTTCTC... so position7 is C). \n\nMutant3's position7 is T, so that's a C\u2192T change here.\n\nSo the codon at positions7-9 would be:\n\nOriginal: positions7-9: CTC \u2192 Leu\n\nMutant3: positions7-9: T (position7), then next two?\n\nWait the next letters after the first part:\n\nThe mutant3 sequence after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?) Wait, let me parse step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (4)\n\n5: T (5)\n\n6: T (6 \u2192 TTT, same as original first codon)\n\n7: T (position7 \u2192 original had C here, so mutation C\u2192T here)\n\nposition8: C (original had T here at position8? Wait original's position8 was T (from TTTCTC...)\n\nWait original's positions7-9: C (7), T (8), C (9). \n\nIn mutant3, position7 is T, so the codon at 7-9 would be T C G? Wait let me see:\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after position7 (T) is:\n\nLooking at the given sequence: after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?), the next letters are ACG? \n\nWait the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down after ATGTTTT (positions1-7?):\n\nWait the first 7 letters after ATG are TTTT? Wait:\n\nWait the sequence starts with ATG followed by TTTT (so positions4-7: T T T T?), but that would mean that the first codon after the start is TTT (positions4-6) and the next codon starts at position7. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider codons properly.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at codons:\n\nFirst codon after start (positions4-6): TTT (original and mutant3 same here).\n\nSecond codon (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (Leu)\n\nMutant3: The 7th position is T (from C\u2192T mutation), so the codon is T followed by the next two nucleotides.\n\nLooking at the mutant3's sequence after position7: \n\nThe next letters after position7 (T) would be C (position8?), G (position9?), so the codon at 7-9 is TCG (Ser). \n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after ATGTTTT is \"ACG...\"?\n\nWait, let me check the exact letters:\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo positions4-7: T T T T (so positions4-6 are TTT (codon1), then position7 is T (start of codon2). Codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nposition7: T\n\nposition8: A (since the next letters after TTT are TAC... so position8 is A?)\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's parse the first part of mutant3's sequence step by step:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG\n\nPositions4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so first codon after start: TTT (positions4-6))\n\nPosition7: T (so codon2 starts at position7)\n\nPosition8: A (the next letter is A, from TAC...)\n\nPosition9: C\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9): TAC (which is Tyr). \n\nOriginal codon2 was CTC (Leu). So here, the mutation at position7 (C\u2192T) changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. \n\nBut then, looking further, the next part of the sequence in mutant3: \n\nAfter TAC (positions7-9), the next triplet would be GCT (positions10-12). Original had GCT (Ala), so same here. \n\nHmm, so this mutation changes Leu to Tyr. Again, not a stop, but an amino acid change. \n\nWait, but the mutant3's sequence continues as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait, perhaps there's a frameshift? Wait, no, it's a point mutation, so no frameshift unless the mutation is an insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations. \n\nHmm. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the options again. \n\nNow, moving to Mutant4:\n\nMutant4's sequence: \n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the sequence is written as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nParsing this:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions1-3).\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original's first codon TTT)\n\nPosition7: T (mutation here again, original had C at position7 \u2192 C\u2192T)\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nposition7: T\n\nposition8: A (from the sequence TAC...)\n\nposition9: C \u2192 so TAC (Tyr), same as mutant3's codon here?\n\nWait, let's parse mutant4's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\npositions4-6: TTT (same as before)\n\nposition7: T (mutation C\u2192T)\n\nposition8: A (from the sequence TAC...)\n\nposition9: C \u2192 so codon7-9 is TAC (Tyr)\n\nThen positions10-12: G T A? Wait the sequence after TAC is \"GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nWait let me look carefully:\n\nThe mutant4's sequence after the first part is \"TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nWait positions10-12 would be positions after TAC (positions7-9):\n\npositions10: G (position10), position11: C (position11), position12: T (position12). \n\nWait original's positions10-12 were GCT (Ala). \n\nIn mutant4's sequence, after TAC (positions7-9), the next nucleotides are GCT (positions10-12) \u2192 so same as original. \n\nWait, but then the next part: \n\nAfter GCT (positions10-12) comes ACT (positions13-15?), but original had GGT (Gly). \n\nWait let's see:\n\nMutant4's sequence after GCT:\n\nThe next letters are ACT (positions13-15?), so codon would be ACT (Thr). \n\nOriginal had GGT (Gly) at positions13-15. \n\nSo here, positions13-15 in mutant4: A C T \u2192 ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). That's another amino acid change.\n\nHmm, so mutant4 has two mutations: position7 (C\u2192T) leading to Tyr instead of Leu, and then at positions13-15, ACT instead of GGT. \n\nBut perhaps there's a deletion or insertion here?\n\nWait the original sequence after GCT (positions10-12) was GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, after GCT comes ACT. Wait, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence:\n\nAfter GCT comes ACT. The original had GGT there, so perhaps there's a mutation at position13? Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions13-15: GGT (positions13: G, 14: G, 15:T)\n\nMutant4's sequence here: A (position13?), C (14?), T (15?) \u2192 so G\u2192A at position13, then G\u2192C, T\u2192T? Not sure. Maybe a different mutation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion causing a frameshift. Wait, but the question states that EMS was used, which usually causes point mutations, so maybe it's a point mutation here.\n\nWait the mutant4's sequence shows \"TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe key is to find a mutation that leads to a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), which would truncate the protein, making it non-functional. Alternatively, a mutation that disrupts the start codon (but start is ATG in all mutants, so that's not it here). \n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence for possible stop codons early on.\n\nThe stop codon is TGA at the end, but the question is whether any of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.\n\nLet me check each mutant for premature stop codons.\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe sequence ends with TGA, so the original stop is there. Any other TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequence before the end?\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence given as \"...TGA-3\u2019\". The part before the TGA is \"...TCGC...TGA\". The TGA is the stop. Are there any other stop codons?\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nMutant1's sequence after the start has codons like:\n\nATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TTC (Phe), TGG (Trp), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), ... and ending with TGA.\n\nWait, the first few codons are okay. The mutation in mutant1 was position9 C\u2192A (making CTA instead of CTC), but that's still Leu. So no stop.\n\nMutant2:\n\nThe mutation at position7-9 (changing CTC to AAG). The rest continues. The stop is still TGA at the end. Are there any other stops?\n\nLooking at the codons after the mutation:\n\nThe first codon after the mutation (AAG) would be the next triplet. Let's see:\n\nAfter AAG (positions7-9), the next codon is positions10-12: in original it was GCT (Ala). In mutant2, after AAG, what's next?\n\nWait mutant2's sequence after ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nThe sequence after AAG (positions7-9) is CTGGT... so positions10-12 would be C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). Then the following codons proceed normally. So no stop codons introduced.\n\nMutant3:\n\nLooking at the sequence provided, mutant3's sequence is \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait, perhaps looking for a stop codon. Let me see:\n\nThe mutation in mutant3 introduced TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu) at positions7-9, but then the rest continues. Unless a stop is introduced later, but the given sequence ends with TGA. \n\nWait in mutant3's sequence, after the first part, there's a part where the sequence might have a stop. Let me see:\n\nThe mutant3's sequence is written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nLooking at the part GTG TCA CTC TGT GG... \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGTG (Val), TCA (Ser), CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly), etc. So no stop codon.\n\nMutant4:\n\nThe sequence given is \"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait let me parse the mutant4's sequence again. The sequence after the initial mutations:\n\nMutant4's sequence after the start is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter the start codon (ATG):\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\nPositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\nPositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nPositions13-15: ACT (Thr) \u2192 this is a change from original's GGT (Gly)\n\nThen positions16-18: TTC (Phe, same as original?)\n\nWait, the next part of the sequence is \"TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait positions16-18 would be TCT (positions16-18?):\n\nWait let's see:\n\nAfter ACT (positions13-15):\n\npositions16: T (from \"TTCTGT...\" so position16: T)\n\nposition17: C (position17)\n\nposition18: T (position18 \u2192 TCT (Ser))\n\nHmm, so the codon at 16-18 is TCT (Ser), which may have been different before. \n\nBut where is the stop codon?\n\nThe original stop is TGA at the end. The question is, does mutant4 have any premature stop?\n\nWait, looking at the sequence given for mutant4:\n\n\"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait, perhaps in the part \"CTTCTGTGGATGA...\", let's parse codons:\n\nSuppose after the first part, the sequence continues:\n\n...ACT (positions13-15), then TCT (positions16-18), GTG (positions19-21?), TGG (positions22-24?), etc. \n\nWait, let's consider that in mutant4's sequence, after the ACT (Thr at positions13-15), the next codons might be:\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... until the TGA stop.\n\nNo stop codons introduced here. \n\nHmm, so none of the mutants so far have a premature stop codon. \n\nWait maybe I missed something. Let me check each mutant again for possible frameshift mutations. \n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns, but the mutations are in the first exon. Since introns are spliced out, mutations in exons affect the coding sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. Frameshift would occur if there's an insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes). \n\nWait, let's check if any of the mutations caused a frameshift by changing a nucleotide which might cause a shift in reading frame. \n\nWait, a frameshift requires a deletion or insertion, but a point mutation (single nucleotide change) won't cause a frameshift. So frameshift is out. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a stop codon within the coding region. \n\nLooking again, maybe I missed a stop codon in one of the sequences. \n\nLet me check mutant3's sequence again. \n\nThe mutant3's sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nLooking at the \"TGTCACTTCTG...\" part. Let me break it into codons:\n\nFor example, after some point:\n\nSuppose the sequence has ...TGT CAC TTC TGT...\n\nWait, but maybe there's a TGA somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a stop?\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after the start: \n\n\"TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nBreaking down the letters after the start:\n\nAfter the initial part:\n\npositions1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: TAC\n\n10-12: GCT\n\n13-15: ACT\n\n16-18: TCT\n\n19-21: GTG\n\n22-24: TGG\n\n25-27: GAT\n\n28-30: GAA\n\n31-33: CAT\n\n34-36: ATT\n\n37-39: TAT\n\n40-42: TGT\n\n...\n\nContinuing until TGA. \n\nWait, the part \"CTTCTGTGGATGA...\" \n\nWait, positions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n...\n\nLooking at the letters after that, perhaps in the middle there's a TGA?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant2's sequence, after the mutation at positions7-9 (AAG), the next codons might form a stop. \n\nMutant2's sequence after the AAG (positions7-9):\n\npositions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu)\n\npositions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val)\n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: TGG (Trp)\n\n... So no stops.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I'm missing something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation in Mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide, but the question says EMS, which is a point mutagen. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement again: \"you sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.\"\n\nThe key might be that the mutation causes the gene to not be transcribed, but since exons are coding regions, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon early on, so the protein is truncated and non-functional. \n\nWait, looking at the given sequences again, perhaps I made an error in analyzing Mutant3 or 4. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait let me look at the part where it says \"GTGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nBreaking that into codons:\n\nGTG TCA CTC TGT... \n\nWait, the \"GTGTCA\" would be split as GTG TCA (Val-Ser), then CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys)... \n\nBut maybe there's a TGA in there?\n\nWait the sequence after GTG TCA CTC TGT is \"...TGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLooking at \"TGGATGA...\", breaking into codons:\n\nTGG (Trp), ATG (Met), AAT (Asn), CAT (His)... \n\nWait, here is a TGA in \"ATGA\" ?\n\nWait \"ATGA\" would be ATG (start codon) followed by A, but in the sequence, after TGG comes ATG. \n\nWait, the part \"TGGATGAACATAT...\" would have TGG (positions?), then ATG (positions?), then AAT, CAT...\n\nWait, the codon after TGG would be ATG (positions?), which is a start codon. But since it's in the middle of the coding sequence, that could be problematic, but it's not a stop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4's sequence, after some point there's a TGA?\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence: \"...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nWait \"GATGAAC...\" \u2192 GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His)... \n\nHmm, no stop there. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide. Let me see the sequence again. \n\nThe intact gene's sequence after the first part is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nMutant4's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nWait, the original after the start was:\n\nTTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nWait, the difference between the intact and mutant4's sequence at the start:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC (positions4-9: T T T C T C)\n\nMutant4 has TTTTAC (positions4-9: T T T T A C). \n\nWait, this suggests that between positions4-9, there's an extra T (making it TTTT instead of TTT), but that would require an insertion, which isn't a point mutation. Wait no, let me count the letters:\n\nOriginal's first few letters after ATG: TTTCTC (positions4-9: T T T C T C).\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTAC (positions4-9: T T T T A C). \n\nSo the original had 6 nucleotides (positions4-9: 6 letters), mutant4 also has 6 letters (T T T T A C). So no insertion or deletion here. \n\nWait, perhaps the mutation is a T insertion at position7? No, it's a point mutation. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the sequence provided for mutant4:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nPosition7-9: CTC (positions7-9)\n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: T (mutation from C\u2192T)\n\nPosition8: A (original had T here?)\n\nWait, original's position8 was T (from TTTCTC... the 8th position is T). \n\nSo mutant4's position8 is A, changing from T\u2192A.\n\nSo codon at positions7-9 is T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) \u2192 TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu).\n\nThen the next codon is positions10-12: GCT (Ala), same as original.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in mutant4, the mutation caused a premature stop codon. Let me check the rest of the sequence more carefully.\n\nWait, the mutant4's sequence ends with \"...TGA\" so the stop is there, but perhaps earlier?\n\nLooking at the part after \"ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, the sequence after ACT (positions13-15) is TCT (positions16-18: TCT), then GTG (positions19-21?), TGG (positions22-24?), etc. \n\nWait maybe there's a stop codon like TGA in there. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nAfter the ACT (Thr), the sequence continues as TCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nBreaking down into codons:\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\n19-21: GTG (Val)\n\n22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\n25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\n28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\n31-33: CAT (His)\n\n34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\n37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\n40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... \n\nNo TGA until the end. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4? Or maybe I missed a mutation leading to a stop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about disrupting the start codon, but all start with ATG. \n\nWait, another possibility: the mutation causes the gene to not be expressed. But since the question is about the compound being synthesized by the gene, maybe knocking out the gene's function is the key. \n\nAlternatively, the mutation could be in a splice site, but since the mutations are in the first exon, not near introns. The first exon's intron is after the first exon? Wait the gene has five exons, so the first exon would have an intron after it (between exon1 and exon2). \n\nBut since the mutation is in the first exon, maybe it doesn't affect splicing. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4 because it has a deletion? Wait, the problem says EMS, which causes point mutations. \n\nWait, looking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nThe original sequence after the first few nucleotides is:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence is \"...ACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, comparing the original and mutant3's sequences:\n\nOriginal after the first part: \n\nPositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\nMutant3's sequence after positions10-12 (GCT):\n\npositions13-15: GGT \u2192 but in mutant3's sequence, after GCT comes G (position13?), T (position14?), G (position15?)? Or maybe it's different. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence after GCT is \"GGTGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nWait, so positions13-15 would be GGT (same as original?), but then the next codon is GTC (positions16-18?), which is different. \n\nWait maybe in mutant3's sequence, after the first part, there's a change in the codon that leads to a stop. \n\nWait looking at the part \"GTCACTTCTGTGG...\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys), GGA (Gly)... \n\nNo stop there. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the mutations. Let me think differently. \n\nThe question asks which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". That means the mutation should prevent the gene from producing the protein. \n\nThe most effective way would be to introduce a premature stop codon early in the gene, leading to a truncated protein that can't function. \n\nIf any of the mutants have a premature stop, that's the answer. \n\nLooking again:\n\nMutant4's sequence has a change at position7 (C\u2192T), leading to TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). \n\nThen, continuing:\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: GGT (Gly) in original, but in mutant4, after ACT (positions13-15?), perhaps a different codon? Wait I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, the mutation at position7 (C\u2192T) and another mutation later causes a stop. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"TGTCACTTCTGT...\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nTGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTC (Phe), TGT (Cys)... \n\nNo stop. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe I need to consider that the mutation in mutant4 caused a deletion of a nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. But the question states EMS, which is a point mutagen. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Mutant4 because the mutation causes a frameshift? But how?\n\nWait the problem says the gene has five exons and four introns. If the first exon is where the mutation is, and if the mutation is in a splice site, but since it's in the exon, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 is a nonsense mutation (premature stop). \n\nWait, let me look again at the first part of mutant4's sequence:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter the start codon (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: TGG (Trp)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (His)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions37-39: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions40-42: TGT (Cys)\n\n... and so on until TGA. \n\nNo premature stop. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is mutant2. Let me think again. \n\nMutant2's mutation changes the third codon (positions7-9) from CTC (Leu) to AAG (Lys). But then, what if further down the line, this leads to a stop? \n\nWait, let's see further codons in mutant2:\n\nAfter AAG (Lys at positions7-9), the next codons would be positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\npositions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val). \n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser). \n\npositions19-21: TGG (Trp). \n\npositions22-24: GAT (Asp). \n\npositions25-27: GAA (Glu). \n\npositions28-30: CAT (His). \n\npositions31-33: ATT (Ile). \n\npositions34-36: TAT (Tyr). \n\npositions37-39: TGT (Cys). \n\n... and so on. \n\nNo stop codons here. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is the mutation that changes the start codon, but none of them do. \n\nWait looking at the sequences again: \n\nThe intact gene starts with ATG. \n\nMutant1's first three nucleotides are ATG \u2192 same as original.\n\nMutant2: same.\n\nMutant3: same.\n\nMutant4: same.\n\nSo no change in start codon. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation is in the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon. \n\nWait the first exon is part of the coding sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the first mutation in mutant1 causes a change from CTC to CTA (still Leu), so no effect. \n\nMutant2 changes CTC to AAG (Lys), which might disrupt the protein's function. \n\nMutant3 changes CTC to TAC (Tyr) \u2192 also a change. \n\nMutant4 also changes CTC to TAC (Tyr) like mutant3, but also has a change in another codon. \n\nBut the question says to \"eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\", which would require the gene to not produce the protein. \n\nSo the best way is to have a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or frameshift. \n\nSince none of the options have a premature stop, maybe the answer is the one that introduces a nonsense mutation later, but I didn't find any. \n\nWait wait, looking at mutant3's sequence again:\n\nThe sequence given for mutant3 is \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"TGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" \n\nBreaking into codons near the end:\n\nLooking for TGA somewhere in the middle. \n\nWait, the part \"GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" \n\nBreaking down:\n\nG (position?), T (position?), G (position?) \u2192 GTG (Val) \n\nGAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys)... \n\nNo. \n\nWait maybe I missed a TGA in the sequence. \n\nWait, the intact gene's sequence ends with TGA, so the mutants also have that. The question is whether any of the mutants have an early stop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has two mutations, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first mutation in mutant4's first codon after start is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). \n\nWait no, the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) in all cases. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing mutant3's sequence. Let me look at the first part of mutant3's sequence again:\n\nMutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the first part after the start:\n\nATG (start)\n\nThen TTT (positions4-6: Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: GTG (Val) \u2192 because the next letters are G T G?\n\nWait, in the original, positions13-15 were GGT (Gly), but in mutant3, it's GTG (Val). \n\nSo that's a change from GGT (Gly) to GTG (Val). \n\nHmm, so two amino acid changes. \n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation in mutant3 causes a frameshift? \n\nWait, no, it's a point mutation. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2 because the mutation creates a stop codon in the next codon. Let me see:\n\nMutant2's sequence after the mutation (AAG at positions7-9):\n\nThe next codon is positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\nNo stop. \n\nWait I'm stuck here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the first mutation causing a stop codon in the first exon. \n\nWait, let's look at the first few codons again:\n\nIn mutant2, the third codon is AAG (positions7-9). \n\nThe next codon is positions10-12: C T G \u2192 CTG (Leu). \n\nThen positions13-15: G T G \u2192 GTG (Val). \n\npositions16-18: T C T \u2192 TCT (Ser). \n\npositions19-21: T G G \u2192 TGG (Trp). \n\npositions22-24: G A T \u2192 GAT (Asp). \n\npositions25-27: G A A \u2192 GAA (Glu). \n\npositions28-30: C A T \u2192 CAT (His). \n\npositions31-33: A T T \u2192 ATT (Ile). \n\npositions34-36: T A T \u2192 TAT (Tyr). \n\npositions37-39: T G T \u2192 TGT (Cys). \n\n... and so on. \n\nNo stop codons here. \n\nWait, maybe the first mutation in mutant2 causes a stop codon in a later codon due to a chain of events? For example, a mutation that leads to a stop further down, but I don't see it. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the first mutation in mutant2 (changing CTC to AAG) causes a premature stop codon in the next codon. \n\nWait, the next codon after AAG is CTG (Leu), so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the correct answer is the one that disrupts the first exon's splicing. \n\nWait, but the first exon's intron is after it, so the splice sites are between exon1 and exon2. If the mutation is in the first exon's sequence, it doesn't affect the splice site unless it's near the exon-intron boundary. But the problem states the mutation is in the beginning of the first exon, so maybe not near the splice site. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a mutation that causes the gene to be non-functional. For example, the first mutation (changing CTC to TAC) alters an important region of the protein, preventing it from functioning. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, but I can't see why. \n\nWait, let's look back at the options and see what the question is asking for. The question is which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". \n\nSince the compound is produced by the gene's product, the best way to eliminate it is to knock out the gene's function. The most effective way is a premature stop, but since none are present, maybe a frameshift. \n\nWait, but EMS causes point mutations, so frameshift requires an insertion/deletion. \n\nWait, perhaps one of the mutations caused a change that introduces a stop codon. \n\nWait, looking at mutant3's sequence again: \n\nThe sequence is written as \"...TGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\".\n\nThe part \"CACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nBreaking down:\n\nC A C (CAC) \u2192 His\n\nT T C (TTC) \u2192 Phe\n\nT G T (TGT) \u2192 Cys\n\nG G A (GGA) \u2192 Gly\n\nT G A (TGA) \u2192 Stop codon! \n\nWait, here we go. \n\nWait let me parse this part carefully:\n\nIn mutant3's sequence, after some codons:\n\nLooking at the letters \"CACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\npositions (let's say after some point):\n\nC A C \u2192 CAC (His)\n\nT T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\nT G T \u2192 TGT (Cys)\n\nG G A \u2192 GGA (Gly)\n\nT G A \u2192 TGA (Stop codon!)\n\nAh! Here's a premature stop codon. \n\nSo in mutant3's sequence, there's a TGA at positions... let's see:\n\nIf the sequence has \"TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\" \n\nWait, the part \"GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nG T G \u2192 GTG (Val)\n\nGAT \u2192 GAT (Asp)\n\nGAA \u2192 GAA (Glu)\n\nCAT \u2192 CAT (His)\n\nATT \u2192 ATT (Ile)\n\nTAT \u2192 TAT (Tyr)\n\nTGT \u2192 TGT (Cys)\n\n... \n\nBut the part I thought earlier might be incorrect. \n\nWait let me re-examine the sequence provided for mutant3:\n\nThe mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLooking at the part \"GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\":\n\nLet's parse the letters step by step:\n\nStarting from the point after \"GTG\" (the first three letters here are G, T, G):\n\nSuppose the letters are:\n\nG T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T\u2026\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nG T G \u2192 GTG (Val)\n\nT C A \u2192 TCA (Ser)\n\nC T T \u2192 CTT (Leu)\n\nC T G \u2192 CTG (Leu)\n\nT G G \u2192 TGG (Trp)\n\nA T G \u2192 ATG (Met)\n\nA A C \u2192 AAC (Asn)\n\nA T A \u2192 ATA (Ile)\n\nT T T \u2192 TTT (Phe)\n\nA T T \u2192 ATT (Ile)\n\nG T C \u2192 GTC (Val)\n\nG T \u2192 but the sequence ends with TGA at the end. \n\nWait, here's the key part: \n\nThe sequence after TGG (Trp) is A T G \u2192 ATG (start codon again?), then A A C (Asn). \n\nBut the stop codon TGA is only at the end. \n\nHmm, so my earlier thought of a premature stop was incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon breakdown. \n\nWait let me look for \"TGA\" in the middle:\n\nLooking at the part \"GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\":\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys)... \n\nNo TGA here. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the first part again. \n\nWait the mutant3's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA.\n\nLooking at the letters between \"ACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLet me write them out sequentially:\n\nAfter the start and first few codons, the letters are:\n\n... A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T\u2026\n\nWait, the sequence \"GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nGGT \u2192 Gly\n\nGTC \u2192 Val\n\nACT \u2192 Thr\n\nTCT \u2192 Ser\n\nGTG \u2192 Val\n\nGGA \u2192 Gly\n\nTGA \u2192 Stop codon! \n\nAh! Here it is. \n\nWait, let me parse this part step by step:\n\nStarting from \"GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLetters:\n\nG G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nPositions (assuming after previous codons):\n\nGGT (Gly)\n\nGTC (Val)\n\nACT (Thr)\n\nTCT (Ser)\n\nGTG (Val)\n\nGGA (Gly)\n\nTGA (Stop codon!) \n\nYes! Here, the sequence has \"GGA TGA\", which is TGA as the stop codon. \n\nSo the codons are:\n\nGGA \u2192 Gly (positions... let's say 22-24)\n\nTGA \u2192 Stop (positions25-27)\n\nSo this introduces a premature stop codon at position25-27, truncating the protein early. \n\nAh! So mutant3's sequence has a TGA stop codon earlier than the original's TGA. \n\nTherefore, mutant3's mutation causes a premature stop codon, which would eliminate the protein's function, thus stopping the compound from being produced. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Mutant3.\n\n\nTo determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the sequences for premature stop codons or disruptive mutations. \n\n**Key Analysis:**\n- **Mutant 1**: The mutation at position 9 (C\u2192A) changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), which does not alter the amino acid. No premature stop codon is introduced.\n- **Mutant 2**: The mutation at positions 7-9 (CTC\u2192AAG) changes codon 3 from Leu to Lys. This missense mutation may disrupt function but does not introduce a premature stop codon.\n- **Mutant 3**: The mutation at position 7 (C\u2192T) changes codon 3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Further downstream, the sequence introduces a premature stop codon (TGA) at positions 25-27. This truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional.\n- **Mutant 4**: The mutation at position 7 (C\u2192T) changes codon 3 to TAC (Tyr). While there are other amino acid changes, no premature stop codon is introduced.\n\n**Conclusion**: Mutant 3 introduces a premature stop codon, ensuring the protein is non-functional, thereby eliminating the compound.\n\nAnswer: B",

The mutants were created using EMS, which typically causes point mutations, probably single nucleotide changes. The task is to look at the sequences of each mutant's first exon and see which mutation would most likely stop the production of that compound.\n\nFirst, I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with ATG (the start codon), then continues with TTTCTCGCTGGTACTT... The TGA at the end is the stop codon. \n\nLooking at Mutant 1: The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC... but in Mutant 1, the 7th and 8th nucleotides (counting after ATG) are changed. Let's parse the sequences carefully. The original is:\n\nOriginal first exon (starting from the beginning):\n5\u2019-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTC GT\u2026 TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, maybe breaking down the nucleotides in triplets would help. Let me write them out. The original sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTC GT...\n\nWait, but the exact sequence of each mutant's first exon is given. Let me look again.\n\nThe intact gene's first part is: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\n\nMutant 1's sequence is: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA\n\nWait, let me compare each base step by step.\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTC GT...\n\nWait, perhaps better to write out the first part in the exact order.\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nStarting from the beginning (positions 1 to, say, 25):\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (start codon)\n4-6: TTT (first codon after start)\n7-9: CTC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: ACT\n19-21: TCT\n22-24: GTG\n25-27: GAT\nand so on.\n\nNow, the mutants:\n\nMutant 1's sequence is: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\nMutant1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first part, after the initial ATG, the next part is TTT (positions 4-6 same). Then the original has CTC (positions 7-9), but mutant1 has CT A (positions 7-9? Let me check the exact letters. Wait, let's write out the sequences up to where they differ.\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\nOriginal first part:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (same)\n4-6: TTT (same)\n7: C (original)\nMutant1's 7th nucleotide: C (same)\nPosition 8: Original is T (from the 8th position?), wait maybe I need to look at each character.\n\nWait, let's look at the exact sequences as written.\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nMutant1: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nSo, starting from the beginning:\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, let me write the first 15 characters:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6 (T T T)\nThen positions 7-9: C T C (the next three letters after TTT are CTC)\nThen the next three (positions 10-12) are G C T (GCT)\nThen G G T (positions 13-15), etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are T T T C T A C G C T...\n\nWait, so positions 4-6: TTT (same as original)\nPosition 7: C (same as original's 7th)\nPosition 8: T (original had T here?), wait no:\n\nWait, original's sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCT... So:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4: T (4th base)\n5: T (5th)\n6: T (6th) \u2192 TTT\nThen position 7: C (7th)\n8: T (8th)\n9: C (9th) \u2192 CTC\nThen position 10: G (10th)\n11: C (11th)\n12: T (12th) \u2192 GCT\nSo the first few codons after start are TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is TTTCTACGCT... So let's see:\n\nAfter the first TTT (positions 4-6), the next part is T A C (positions 7-9?):\n\nWait, let me parse Mutant1's sequence step by step:\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCT... \nMutant1's sequence after ATG is TTTCTACGCT...\n\nWait, so the 7th nucleotide (position 7) is C (same as original), position 8 is T (original had T?), no wait:\n\nWait, let me write out the letters:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nPosition 4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 TTT\n\nThen positions 7-9: C (7), T (8), C (9) \u2192 CTC.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nSame first 6 (T T T), then at position 7: C (same as original), position 8: T vs. original? Wait, the mutant's next is TAC, so after the initial TTT, the next letters are T A C?\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused. Let's write the letters for the first part of each:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCT... \nBreaking down letters:\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nSo the first few letters after ATG (positions 4 onwards):\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 TTT (codon 1)\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 CTC (codon 2)\n10: G, 11: C, 12: T \u2192 GCT (codon3)\n13: G, 14: G, 15: T \u2192 GGT (codon4)\n16: A, 17: C, 18: T \u2192 ACT (codon5)\nand so on.\n\nNow Mutant1's sequence:\n\nMutant1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo after the initial ATG, the next letters are:\n\nPositions 4-6: T T T (same as original)\nPosition 7: C (same as original's 7)\nPosition 8: T (original had T here, so same?) Wait, then position 9?\n\nWait, let me parse Mutant1's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are:\n\nPosition4: T, 5:T, 6:T \u2192 TTT (same)\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (original had T here, so same? Wait, original's position8 is T (from CTC's second T?), yes. Wait original's positions 7-9: C T C. So position8 is T. \n\nMutant1's position8 is T as well? Wait, but in the mutant's sequence after TTT, the next letters are TAC?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the letters in the mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant1's is TTTCTACGCT...\n\nWait, so after TTT, the next letters are TAC. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: after TTT is CTC (positions7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant1: after TTT is T A C (positions7-9: T A C?), but that would be different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me write out the exact letters:\n\nOriginal: After ATG, the next letters are T T T C T C G C T...\n\nWait, so the sequence is:\n\nOriginal: ...CTC (positions7-9), then GCT (positions10-12).\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is written as \"TTTCTACGCT...\" So the letters after TTT are T A C G C T. Wait:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter the initial ATG TTT (positions1-6), the next part in Mutant1 is TAC GCT...\n\nWait, so positions7-9: T A C (TAC), and positions10-12: G C T (GCT same as original's GCT? Because original had GCT at 10-12.\n\nWait, so the first difference is at position8. Let me see:\n\nOriginal at position7: C (from CTC), position8: T, position9: C.\n\nMutant1's position7: T? Wait no. Wait let me parse each character:\n\nWait, the mutant1 sequence is written as:\n\nMutant1's first exon starts with:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\nAfter the ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T\n6: T \u2192 TTT (same)\nPosition7: C (same as original's position7, which is C)\nPosition8: T (original had T here, so same? Wait, but then position9 would be A in mutant1.\n\nWait, let me list each position:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 7-9:\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 C T C \u2192 CTC.\n\nMutant1's positions7-9:\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next letters are C T A C G C T...\n\nWait, perhaps I need to count each character carefully. Let me do that for the first part.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 1-3):\n\nPositions 4-21 (for example):\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same)\n5: T (same)\n6: T (same)\n7: C (same as original)\n8: T (same as original's position8 is T)\nWait, but then position9 in mutant1 would be A, because the next letters after the first 8 positions would be:\n\nWait, let's write each character step by step:\n\nOriginal:\n\n1: A\n2: T\n3: G\n4: T\n5: T\n6: T\n7: C\n8: T\n9: C\n10: G\n11: C\n12: T\n13: G\n14: G\n15: T\n16: A\n17: C\n18: T\n19: T\n20: C\n21: T\n22: G\n23: T\n24: G\n25: G\n26: A\n27: T\n...\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\nSame up to position6 (T at 6):\n\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (same as original's 8)\nPosition9: A (original had C here, because original's position9 is C)\nAh, here's the difference. So in mutant1, position9 is A instead of C. Because the original sequence at position9 is C (from the CTC codon), but mutant1's position9 is A. So the mutation is at position9: original C becomes A.\n\nSo the codon at positions7-9 in original is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu? Wait, CTA is Leu as well, but maybe a different codon? Or is it a different amino acid?\n\nWait, CTA is also Leu (Leucine). So the codon changes from CTC to CTA, which is still Leu. So that would be a silent mutation if the amino acid is the same. But maybe the codon is different but still codes for the same amino acid. So that might not affect the protein.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the exact letters again. Wait, maybe the mutant1 has a different change.\n\nWait, looking at the written sequences:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1's is TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, comparing the letters after TTT (positions4-6):\n\nOriginal: C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1: T A C G C T...\n\nWait, so after the TTT (positions4-6), the next three are:\n\nOriginal: CTC (positions7-9)\nMutant1: TAC (positions7-9?)\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the letters again:\n\nOriginal after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1 after ATG: T T T C T A C G C T...\n\nAh! Wait, the mutant1 has an extra T? No, let's see:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6) followed by C T C (positions7-9)\nMutant1: TTT followed by T A C (positions7-9). Wait, how?\n\nWait, maybe the mutant1's sequence after TTT is T A C, but that would require that position7 is T instead of C. But according to the original's sequence, position7 is C.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sequence's first part after ATG is written as:\n\n\"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T \u2192 TTT\n\nPosition7: C (from the next part \"CTC\")\n\nSo the letters are:\n\nPositions 7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 CTC.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\n\"ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nBreaking down after ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T \u2192 same as original.\n\nPosition7: C (same as original's position7: C)\n\nPosition8: T (original's position8 is T, so same?)\n\nPosition9: A (original's position9 is C here. Wait, original's position9 is the third in the CTC codon, so position9 is C. So in mutant1, position9 is A. So the codon at positions7-9 is CTA instead of CTC. Both code for Leucine (CTC is Leu, CTA is also Leu). So that's a silent mutation. But maybe there's another change?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing another difference. Let me look further.\n\nLooking at the next part of mutant1's sequence after TAC. The next letters after TAC are GCT, so positions10-12 are G C T (same as original's GCT at positions10-12). So the GCT is the same. \n\nBut perhaps there's another mutation later. Wait, the options are about the first exon area, so maybe the first few mutations are the key. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check the other mutants.\n\nLooking at Mutant2's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, let's compare to the original:\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT... \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is T T C TAAGCT...\n\nWait, let me parse:\n\nOriginal after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant2: T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, so after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters:\n\nPositions4-6: T T C (original had T T T, so position6 is C here). So the first codon after the start is TTC instead of TTT. \n\nOriginal's first codon after start is TTT (which is Phe), while mutant2's first codon is TTC (also Phe). So that's another silent mutation? But maybe there's a difference later. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me break down mutant2's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T (same)\n6: C (original was T here, so mutation at position6: T\u2192C. So the first three after start (positions4-6) are TTC instead of TTT. Both code for Phe, so that's a synonymous mutation. \n\nThen position7: T (original had C here?), wait, original's position7 was C (from the CTC). Wait, in mutant2's sequence:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant2's sequence after the first 6 bases (ATG followed by TTC):\n\nThe next letters are AAGCT...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATGTTCTAA (wait, maybe I need to parse all letters carefully. Let me try again.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2's is: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (original T)\n5: T (original T)\n6: C (original T \u2192 mutation here)\nPosition7: T (original's position7 is C (from CTC), so here mutant2 has T instead of C. That's a mutation at position7. \n\nWait, so position7 in mutant2 is T, whereas original had C. \n\nSo, the codons in mutant2:\n\nFirst codon (positions4-6): TTC (Phe, same as TTT)\nSecond codon (positions7-9): T A A (TAA is a stop codon!). Wait, hold on. Let's see:\n\nPositions7-9 in mutant2:\n\nPosition7: T (from above)\nPosition8: A (since after TTC comes TAAGCT...)\nWait, let me parse the letters step by step for mutant2:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T\n5: T\n6: C \u2192 TTC (codon 1)\nPosition7: T\n8: A\n9: A \u2192 TAA (codon2, which is a stop codon)\nPosition10: G (so codon3 would be GCT if the next nucleotides are G, C, T, but wait, after TAA (positions7-9), position10 is G, so the next codon would start at position10. But since TAA is a stop codon, the protein would terminate early here.\n\nAh! So in Mutant2, the second codon after the start is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product would be non-functional. Since the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, if the protein is truncated early, the compound might not be produced. So this could be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. If the protein is truncated before it can function, then the compound wouldn't be made. So mutant2's mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which would likely eliminate the protein's function. That's a strong candidate.\n\nNow check other mutants.\n\nMutant3:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT... \n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTACGCT...\n\nWait, let's parse:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant3's after ATG: TTTACGCT...\n\nSo the first few letters:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\nPosition7: A (original had C here (from CTC)), so position7 is mutated from C to A. \n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (Leu)\nMutant3: positions7-9: A C G (since after TTT, the next is ACG...)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant3's positions7-9: A (position7), C (position8?), need to check:\n\nWait, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters are T T T T A C G C T...\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break down:\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let me count positions:\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original TTT)\nPosition7: T (the fourth T?), wait the sequence after ATG is TTTT (so positions4-7 are T's?)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me parse again.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG: TTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after the start is TTT followed by A C G... \n\nWait, perhaps the exact letters are:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\n4: T, 5:T,6:T \u2192 TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: A (original had C here (from CTC)), so mutation at position7 (C\u2192A).\n\nThen position8: C (original's position8 was T (from CTC's second T)), so that's a mutation here as well.\n\nWait, so codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nMutant3's positions7-9: A C G \u2192 ACG (which is Thr).\n\nOriginal was CTC (Leu). So the codon changes from Leu to Thr. That's a missense mutation, changing the amino acid. But would that stop the protein function? It depends where it is. If this is an important residue, maybe, but it's hard to tell. However, the question is about the most probable elimination. A nonsense mutation (premature stop) is more likely to eliminate function than a missense.\n\nLooking at Mutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original)\nPosition7: T (original had C here (from CTC's first C)), so mutation at position7 (C\u2192T).\n\nThen position8: T (original had T here?), so:\n\nCodon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant4's positions7-9: T T C (TTC, which is Phe).\n\nWait, let me parse the letters:\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\nPosition7: T (original C)\nPosition8: T (original T)\nPosition9: C (original C)\nSo codon2 (7-9) becomes TTC (Phe) instead of CTC (Leu). That's a missense mutation, changing Leu to Phe. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another change. Let me check further.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, which would disable the gene product. \n\nSo between the mutants:\n\nMutant1: silent mutation (CTC\u2192CTA, still Leu) or maybe another change?\n\nWait earlier analysis of mutant1 had the 9th position as A (so CTA), which is still Leu. So no change in amino acid. So that's a silent mutation, which wouldn't affect the protein. \n\nMutant2 has a premature stop codon at position7-9 (TAA), which would truncate the protein early, so likely eliminating function. \n\nMutant3 has a missense (Leu\u2192Thr), which might or might not affect function.\n\nMutant4 has a missense (Leu\u2192Phe). \n\nThe question is asking which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the gene is responsible for the compound, knocking out the gene's function would stop its production. A premature stop codon (mutant2) would do that. \n\nWait but let me check the other mutants again. \n\nWait, in mutant3's sequence, after the initial TTT (positions4-6), the next codons:\n\npositions7-9: ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, looking further, maybe there's a frameshift? Wait, no, because it's a single nucleotide change? Wait, EMS typically causes point mutations, so each mutant has a single nucleotide change? Or could there be multiple?\n\nWait the question says \"you sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.\" So each mutant may have one or more changes. But looking at the options, perhaps each mutant has a single mutation, but the way the sequences are written may have multiple differences. Wait, perhaps I need to look for single base changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the mutations are single base substitutions. Let me check each mutant's sequence for the number of differences.\n\nFor Mutant1:\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first part where they differ:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTG...\nMutant1: ...CTACGCTG...\n\nSo between the original's \"CTC\" and mutant1's \"CTAC\" ?\n\nWait, maybe there's an insertion? Wait no, the length is same. Let me look at the exact letters:\n\nThe difference occurs at positions7-9 (original CTC vs mutant1's CTA?), but in the written sequences, perhaps there are two changes?\n\nWait, let me compare each character step by step for Mutant1:\n\nOriginal after ATG (positions4 onwards):\n\n4: T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T,13:G, etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\n4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:A,10:G,11:C,12:T,...\n\nWait so between position9: original C vs mutant1 A. So that's one mutation at position9 (C\u2192A). So codon2 (positions7-9) changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. So no effect. So mutant1's change is silent.\n\nMutant2:\n\nOriginal at position6: T vs mutant2's C (position6: T\u2192C). Also, position7: original C (position7) vs mutant2's T? Wait let's parse:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, let's check each position:\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T (same)\n6: C (original T \u2192 mutation here)\nPosition7: T (original had C here (position7 was C in original's CTC)), so that's a mutation here (C\u2192T)\nPosition8: A (original had T here (position8 in CTC is T)), so another mutation (T\u2192A)\nPosition9: A (original had C here (position9 was C), so C\u2192A)\n\nWait, that's three mutations in mutant2? That can't be right if it's EMS which typically causes single base changes. Hmm, perhaps I made an error here. Wait the question says \"produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen\" and \"sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\". So each mutant may have multiple mutations, but the question is looking for which one would eliminate the compound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences in the written sequences are due to a single mutation causing a frameshift or other changes. Wait, maybe mutant2's sequence has a deletion?\n\nWait looking at the mutant2 sequence: \n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2's sequence after TTT (positions4-6) is TAA GCT... So the letters after position6 (which was changed from T to C) are T A A G C T...\n\nWait, maybe the original was CTCGCT... and mutant2 has TAA GCT...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutation in mutant2 is a single nucleotide change at position7 from C to T, which would make the codon at positions7-9 as TTC (if the next nucleotide is T and A?), no. Wait let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutant2's mutation is at position7 (C\u2192T), leading to the second codon being TTC (Leu? No, TTC is Phe), but then the next nucleotide would be position8: original was T (from CTC's T), but if position7 is T, then position8 is A (as in mutant2's TAA...). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in Mutant2, there's a premature stop codon. Let me see:\n\nIf in mutant2, the codons after the start are:\n\nCodon1 (positions4-6): TTC (Phe, same as original's TTT)\nCodon2 (positions7-9): TAA (stop). \n\nIf that's the case, then the protein would stop here, which is very early. So the gene product is truncated, so the enzyme isn't made, so the anti-nutritional compound isn't produced. That would be the desired outcome. \n\nSo mutant2 would be the answer (option A). \n\nMutant3 has a missense (Leu to Thr), which might not disable the enzyme. Mutant4 has a missense (Leu to Phe). Mutant1 is silent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Mutant2 (Option A).\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function. The key is identifying a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon or significantly disrupts the protein's structure. \n\n- **Mutant 1**: The mutation at position 9 changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), which is a silent mutation (same amino acid). This does not affect the protein.  \n- **Mutant 2**: The mutation at position 7 changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to TAA (stop codon) in the second codon. This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein early and likely eliminating its function.  \n- **Mutant 3**: A missense mutation (CTC \u2192 ACG, Leu \u2192 Thr) occurs. While this alters the amino acid, it may not necessarily disable the protein entirely.  \n- **Mutant 4**: Another missense mutation (CTC \u2192 TTC, Leu \u2192 Phe) occurs. This change might also not fully disrupt the protein's function.  \n\nThe most definitive disruption is caused by **Mutant 2**, which introduces a premature stop codon, ensuring the protein is non-functional and the compound is not produced.  \n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation in the barley gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The mutants were created using EMS, which typically causes point mutations, probably single nucleotide changes. The task is to look at the sequences of each mutant's first exon and see which mutation would most likely stop the production of that compound.\n\nFirst, I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with ATG (the start codon), then continues with TTTCTCGCTGGTACTT... The TGA at the end is the stop codon. \n\nLooking at Mutant 1: The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC... but in Mutant 1, the 7th and 8th nucleotides (counting after ATG) are changed.

Wait, then position 9?\n\nWait, let me parse Mutant1's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are:\n\nPosition4: T, 5:T, 6:T \u2192 TTT (same)\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (original had T here, so same? Wait, original's position8 is T (from CTC's second T?), yes. Wait original's positions 7-9: C T C. So position8 is T. \n\nMutant1's position8 is T as well? Wait, but in the mutant's sequence after TTT, the next letters are TAC?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the letters in the mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant1's is TTTCTACGCT...\n\nWait, so after TTT, the next letters are TAC. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: after TTT is CTC (positions7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant1: after TTT is T A C (positions7-9: T A C?), but that would be different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me write out the exact letters:\n\nOriginal: After ATG, the next letters are T T T C T C G C T...\n\nWait, so the sequence is:\n\nOriginal: ...CTC (positions7-9), then GCT (positions10-12).\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is written as \"TTTCTACGCT...\" So the letters after TTT are T A C G C T. Wait:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter the initial ATG TTT (positions1-6), the next part in Mutant1 is TAC GCT...\n\nWait, so positions7-9: T A C (TAC), and positions10-12: G C T (GCT same as original's GCT? Because original had GCT at 10-12.\n\nWait, so the first difference is at position8. Let me see:\n\nOriginal at position7: C (from CTC), position8: T, position9: C.\n\nMutant1's position7: T? Wait no. Wait let me parse each character:\n\nWait, the mutant1 sequence is written as:\n\nMutant1's first exon starts with:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down each character:\n\nAfter the ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T\n6: T \u2192 TTT (same)\nPosition7: C (same as original's position7, which is C)\nPosition8: T (original had T here, so same? Wait, but then position9 would be A in mutant1.\n\nWait, let me list each position:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 7-9:\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 C T C \u2192 CTC.\n\nMutant1's positions7-9:\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next letters are C T A C G C T...\n\nWait, perhaps I need to count each character carefully. Let me do that for the first part.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 1-3):\n\nPositions 4-21 (for example):\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same)\n5: T (same)\n6: T (same)\n7: C (same as original)\n8: T (same as original's position8 is T)\nWait, but then position9 in mutant1 would be A, because the next letters after the first 8 positions would be:\n\nWait, let's write each character step by step:\n\nOriginal:\n\n1: A\n2: T\n3: G\n4: T\n5: T\n6: T\n7: C\n8: T\n9: C\n10: G\n11: C\n12: T\n13: G\n14: G\n15: T\n16: A\n17: C\n18: T\n19: T\n20: C\n21: T\n22: G\n23: T\n24: G\n25: G\n26: A\n27: T\n...\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\nSame up to position6 (T at 6):\n\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (same as original's 8)\nPosition9: A (original had C here, because original's position9 is C)\nAh, here's the difference. So in mutant1, position9 is A instead of C. Because the original sequence at position9 is C (from the CTC codon), but mutant1's position9 is A. So the mutation is at position9: original C becomes A.\n\nSo the codon at positions7-9 in original is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu? Wait, CTA is Leu as well, but maybe a different codon? Or is it a different amino acid?\n\nWait, CTA is also Leu (Leucine). So the codon changes from CTC to CTA, which is still Leu. So that would be a silent mutation if the amino acid is the same. But maybe the codon is different but still codes for the same amino acid. So that might not affect the protein.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the exact letters again. Wait, maybe the mutant1 has a different change.\n\nWait, looking at the written sequences:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1's is TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, comparing the letters after TTT (positions4-6):\n\nOriginal: C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1: T A C G C T...\n\nWait, so after the TTT (positions4-6), the next three are:\n\nOriginal: CTC (positions7-9)\nMutant1: TAC (positions7-9?)\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the letters again:\n\nOriginal after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1 after ATG: T T T C T A C G C T...\n\nAh! Wait, the mutant1 has an extra T? No, let's see:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6) followed by C T C (positions7-9)\nMutant1: TTT followed by T A C (positions7-9). Wait, how?\n\nWait, maybe the mutant1's sequence after TTT is T A C, but that would require that position7 is T instead of C. But according to the original's sequence, position7 is C.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal sequence's first part after ATG is written as:\n\n\"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T \u2192 TTT\n\nPosition7: C (from the next part \"CTC\")\n\nSo the letters are:\n\nPositions 7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 CTC.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\n\"ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nBreaking down after ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T \u2192 same as original.\n\nPosition7: C (same as original's position7: C)\n\nPosition8: T (original's position8 is T, so same?)\n\nPosition9: A (original's position9 is C here. Wait, original's position9 is the third in the CTC codon, so position9 is C. So in mutant1, position9 is A. So the codon at positions7-9 is CTA instead of CTC. Both code for Leucine (CTC is Leu, CTA is also Leu). So that's a silent mutation. But maybe there's another change?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing another difference. Let me look further.\n\nLooking at the next part of mutant1's sequence after TAC. The next letters after TAC are GCT, so positions10-12 are G C T (same as original's GCT at positions10-12). So the GCT is the same. \n\nBut perhaps there's another mutation later. Wait, the options are about the first exon area, so maybe the first few mutations are the key. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check the other mutants.\n\nLooking at Mutant2's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, let's compare to the original:\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT... \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is T T C TAAGCT...\n\nWait, let me parse:\n\nOriginal after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant2: T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, so after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters:\n\nPositions4-6: T T C (original had T T T, so position6 is C here). So the first codon after the start is TTC instead of TTT. \n\nOriginal's first codon after start is TTT (which is Phe), while mutant2's first codon is TTC (also Phe). So that's another silent mutation? But maybe there's a difference later. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me break down mutant2's sequence step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T (same)\n6: C (original was T here, so mutation at position6: T\u2192C. So the first three after start (positions4-6) are TTC instead of TTT. Both code for Phe, so that's a synonymous mutation. \n\nThen position7: T (original had C here?), wait, original's position7 was C (from the CTC). Wait, in mutant2's sequence:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant2's sequence after the first 6 bases (ATG followed by TTC):\n\nThe next letters are AAGCT...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATGTTCTAA (wait, maybe I need to parse all letters carefully. Let me try again.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2's is: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T (original T)\n5: T (original T)\n6: C (original T \u2192 mutation here)\nPosition7: T (original's position7 is C (from CTC), so here mutant2 has T instead of C. That's a mutation at position7. \n\nWait, so position7 in mutant2 is T, whereas original had C. \n\nSo, the codons in mutant2:\n\nFirst codon (positions4-6): TTC (Phe, same as TTT)\nSecond codon (positions7-9): T A A (TAA is a stop codon!). Wait, hold on. Let's see:\n\nPositions7-9 in mutant2:\n\nPosition7: T (from above)\nPosition8: A (since after TTC comes TAAGCT...)\nWait, let me parse the letters step by step for mutant2:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4: T\n5: T\n6: C \u2192 TTC (codon 1)\nPosition7: T\n8: A\n9: A \u2192 TAA (codon2, which is a stop codon)\nPosition10: G (so codon3 would be GCT if the next nucleotides are G, C, T, but wait, after TAA (positions7-9), position10 is G, so the next codon would start at position10. But since TAA is a stop codon, the protein would terminate early here.\n\nAh! So in Mutant2, the second codon after the start is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product would be non-functional. Since the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, if the protein is truncated early, the compound might not be produced. So this could be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. If the protein is truncated before it can function, then the compound wouldn't be made. So mutant2's mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which would likely eliminate the protein's function. That's a strong candidate.\n\nNow check other mutants.\n\nMutant3:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT... \n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTACGCT...\n\nWait, let's parse:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant3's after ATG: TTTACGCT...\n\nSo the first few letters:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\nPosition7: A (original had C here (from CTC)), so position7 is mutated from C to A. \n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (Leu)\nMutant3: positions7-9: A C G (since after TTT, the next is ACG...)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant3's positions7-9: A (position7), C (position8?), need to check:\n\nWait, the sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, after ATG (positions1-3), the next letters are T T T T A C G C T...\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break down:\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let me count positions:\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original TTT)\nPosition7: T (the fourth T?), wait the sequence after ATG is TTTT (so positions4-7 are T's?)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me parse again.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG: TTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence after the start is TTT followed by A C G... \n\nWait, perhaps the exact letters are:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\n4: T, 5:T,6:T \u2192 TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: A (original had C here (from CTC)), so mutation at position7 (C\u2192A).\n\nThen position8: C (original's position8 was T (from CTC's second T)), so that's a mutation here as well.\n\nWait, so codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nMutant3's positions7-9: A C G \u2192 ACG (which is Thr).\n\nOriginal was CTC (Leu). So the codon changes from Leu to Thr. That's a missense mutation, changing the amino acid. But would that stop the protein function? It depends where it is. If this is an important residue, maybe, but it's hard to tell. However, the question is about the most probable elimination. A nonsense mutation (premature stop) is more likely to eliminate function than a missense.\n\nLooking at Mutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (same as original)\nPosition7: T (original had C here (from CTC's first C)), so mutation at position7 (C\u2192T).\n\nThen position8: T (original had T here?), so:\n\nCodon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: C T C \u2192 CTC (Leu)\nMutant4's positions7-9: T T C (TTC, which is Phe).\n\nWait, let me parse the letters:\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\nPosition7: T (original C)\nPosition8: T (original T)\nPosition9: C (original C)\nSo codon2 (7-9) becomes TTC (Phe) instead of CTC (Leu). That's a missense mutation, changing Leu to Phe. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another change. Let me check further.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, which would disable the gene product. \n\nSo between the mutants:\n\nMutant1: silent mutation (CTC\u2192CTA, still Leu) or maybe another change?\n\nWait earlier analysis of mutant1 had the 9th position as A (so CTA), which is still Leu. So no change in amino acid. So that's a silent mutation, which wouldn't affect the protein. \n\nMutant2 has a premature stop codon at position7-9 (TAA), which would truncate the protein early, so likely eliminating function. \n\nMutant3 has a missense (Leu\u2192Thr), which might or might not affect function.\n\nMutant4 has a missense (Leu\u2192Phe). \n\nThe question is asking which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the gene is responsible for the compound, knocking out the gene's function would stop its production. A premature stop codon (mutant2) would do that. \n\nWait but let me check the other mutants again. \n\nWait, in mutant3's sequence, after the initial TTT (positions4-6), the next codons:\n\npositions7-9: ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, looking further, maybe there's a frameshift? Wait, no, because it's a single nucleotide change? Wait, EMS typically causes point mutations, so each mutant has a single nucleotide change? Or could there be multiple?\n\nWait the question says \"you sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.\" So each mutant may have one or more changes. But looking at the options, perhaps each mutant has a single mutation, but the way the sequences are written may have multiple differences. Wait, perhaps I need to look for single base changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the mutations are single base substitutions. Let me check each mutant's sequence for the number of differences.\n\nFor Mutant1:\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first part where they differ:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTG...\nMutant1: ...CTACGCTG...\n\nSo between the original's \"CTC\" and mutant1's \"CTAC\" ?\n\nWait, maybe there's an insertion? Wait no, the length is same. Let me look at the exact letters:\n\nThe difference occurs at positions7-9 (original CTC vs mutant1's CTA?), but in the written sequences, perhaps there are two changes?\n\nWait, let me compare each character step by step for Mutant1:\n\nOriginal after ATG (positions4 onwards):\n\n4: T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G,11:C,12:T,13:G, etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\n4:T,5:T,6:T,7:C,8:T,9:A,10:G,11:C,12:T,...\n\nWait so between position9: original C vs mutant1 A. So that's one mutation at position9 (C\u2192A). So codon2 (positions7-9) changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. So no effect. So mutant1's change is silent.\n\nMutant2:\n\nOriginal at position6: T vs mutant2's C (position6: T\u2192C). Also, position7: original C (position7) vs mutant2's T? Wait let's parse:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, let's check each position:\n\nPosition4: T (same as original)\n5: T (same)\n6: C (original T \u2192 mutation here)\nPosition7: T (original had C here (position7 was C in original's CTC)), so that's a mutation here (C\u2192T)\nPosition8: A (original had T here (position8 in CTC is T)), so another mutation (T\u2192A)\nPosition9: A (original had C here (position9 was C), so C\u2192A)\n\nWait, that's three mutations in mutant2? That can't be right if it's EMS which typically causes single base changes. Hmm, perhaps I made an error here. Wait the question says \"produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen\" and \"sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\". So each mutant may have multiple mutations, but the question is looking for which one would eliminate the compound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences in the written sequences are due to a single mutation causing a frameshift or other changes. Wait, maybe mutant2's sequence has a deletion?\n\nWait looking at the mutant2 sequence: \n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2's sequence after TTT (positions4-6) is TAA GCT... So the letters after position6 (which was changed from T to C) are T A A G C T...\n\nWait, maybe the original was CTCGCT... and mutant2 has TAA GCT...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutation in mutant2 is a single nucleotide change at position7 from C to T, which would make the codon at positions7-9 as TTC (if the next nucleotide is T and A?), no. Wait let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutant2's mutation is at position7 (C\u2192T), leading to the second codon being TTC (Leu? No, TTC is Phe), but then the next nucleotide would be position8: original was T (from CTC's T), but if position7 is T, then position8 is A (as in mutant2's TAA...). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in Mutant2, there's a premature stop codon. Let me see:\n\nIf in mutant2, the codons after the start are:\n\nCodon1 (positions4-6): TTC (Phe, same as original's TTT)\nCodon2 (positions7-9): TAA (stop). \n\nIf that's the case, then the protein would stop here, which is very early. So the gene product is truncated, so the enzyme isn't made, so the anti-nutritional compound isn't produced. That would be the desired outcome. \n\nSo mutant2 would be the answer (option A). \n\nMutant3 has a missense (Leu to Thr), which might not disable the enzyme. Mutant4 has a missense (Leu to Phe). Mutant1 is silent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Mutant2 (Option A).\n\n\nThe question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function. The key is identifying a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon or significantly disrupts the protein's structure. \n\n- **Mutant 1**: The mutation at position 9 changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), which is a silent mutation (same amino acid). This does not affect the protein.  \n- **Mutant 2**: The mutation at position 7 changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to TAA (stop codon) in the second codon. This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein early and likely eliminating its function.  \n- **Mutant 3**: A missense mutation (CTC \u2192 ACG, Leu \u2192 Thr) occurs. While this alters the amino acid, it may not necessarily disable the protein entirely.  \n- **Mutant 4**: Another missense mutation (CTC \u2192 TTC, Leu \u2192 Phe) occurs. This change might also not fully disrupt the protein's function.  \n\nThe most definitive disruption is caused by **Mutant 2**, which introduces a premature stop codon, ensuring the protein is non-functional and the compound is not produced.  \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. The gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found changes in the first exon. The options are the four mutants, and I need to pick which one would stop the gene from producing the compound.\n\nFirst, I remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) typically causes point mutations, usually G to A or C to T transitions. But maybe here the key is looking at the mutations given, not the mechanism of EMS. The main idea is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the gene's product is the anti-nutritional compound, we need to disable the gene. So the best way would be to cause a premature stop codon, or a frameshift, or a nonsense mutation early on so the protein isn't made properly.\n\nLooking at the sequences, the original starts with ATG (start codon) and ends with TGA (stop).

In mutant1, what's the 7th?\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1 has a change at position 9?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal's 7-9: CTC (positions7-9: C at 7, T at8, C at9)\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT (positions1-6) would be next as TAC? Let me see:\n\nOriginal's 7th base (position7) is C, but in mutant1, maybe the 7th is T?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's look at the mutant1's sequence written as \"ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nWait, the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nSo the original after ATG is:\n\nATG (start) followed by TTT (positions4-6), then CTC (positions7-9), GCT (positions10-12), etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is TTTCTACGCT...\n\nWait, so between the TTT and the next part, the CTC becomes TAC?\n\nSo the original at positions7-9 (CTC) becomes TAC in mutant1?\n\nSo that's a change at position7 from C to T? Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nPositions 4-9 (after ATG):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\nMutant1's same positions:\n\nPositions7: T instead of C?\n\nWait, in the mutant1's sequence, after the first six (ATGTTT), the next three bases are TAC (positions7-9?), so the 7th base is T instead of C?\n\nIf that's the case, then position7 (original C) becomes T in mutant1.\n\nSo that's a mutation at position7: C to T.\n\nWhich would change the codons here. Let's see what codons are being affected.\n\nThe gene's first exon is transcribed into mRNA, then translated. Let's consider the coding sequence (CDS) starts with the ATG, so the first codon is ATG (methionine), then the next codons are the next triplets.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (starting at position1 as ATG):\n\nThe first codon is ATG (positions1-3).\n\nThe second codon is TTT (positions4-6).\n\nThird codon: CTC (positions7-9).\n\nFourth codon: GCT (10-12), etc.\n\nIn mutant1, the third codon (positions7-9) becomes TAC (since original was CTC, but mutant1 has TAC there). So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation, changing an amino acid. But that might not stop the protein. Unless it's an essential part, but the question is about eliminating the compound, so maybe this mutation is not enough. Unless it's a critical amino acid, but we don't know.\n\nNow looking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nMutant2 has after ATG: TCTAAGCTGGTACTT...\n\nSo let's see the differences here. Let's break it down.\n\nOriginal first few bases after ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2 is:\n\nATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nOriginal's first 6 bases after ATG: TTT (positions4-6) followed by CTC...\n\nMutant2's first 6 after ATG: TCT (positions4-6?), then AA GCT...\n\nWait, let's count the bases step by step.\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG (start)\n\nPositions4: T (original)\n\nMutant2's position4: T (same)\n\nPosition5:\n\nOriginal: T (position5)\n\nMutant2: T (same?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the exact changes.\n\nWait, the mutant2's sequence is written as ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nOriginal's first 10 bases after ATG (positions4-13):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TCT (since the next after ATG is TCT instead of TTT?)\n\nWait, original's positions4-6 are TTT (since original is TTTCTC...), so the first three after ATG are TTT (positions4-6).\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts with TCT (positions4-6: T C T?), then AAGCT...\n\nSo the first three bases (positions4-6) in mutant2 are TCT instead of TTT. That's a change at position5 from T to C? Let me check:\n\nOriginal position5 is T, mutant2 has C there?\n\nWait, the mutant2's sequence after ATG is TCTAAGCTGGT... So positions4 is T, 5 is C, 6 is T.\n\nSo position5 (original T) becomes C in mutant2. So that would change the second codon (positions4-6) from TTT to TCT (since positions4-6 would be T C T? Wait, the second codon (positions4-6) in original is TTT (methionine? Wait no, the first codon is ATG (methionine), second is TTT (which is Phe), third codon is CTC (Leu), etc.\n\nIn mutant2, the second codon (positions4-6) becomes TCT (Serine) instead of Phe. That's a missense mutation again. Not a stop.\n\nNow looking at Mutant3:\n\nMutant3's sequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the original sequence had ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nComparing, the mutant3's first part:\n\nAfter ATG, original has TTTCTCGCTG... \n\nMutant3 has TTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion here. Let's see.\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, looking at the first part:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is TTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal's first few bases after ATG:\n\nPositions4-12 (after ATG):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG starts with TTT (positions4-6 same as original?), then the next bases: ACGCTGGT...\n\nWait, the original after positions7-9 is CTC (positions7-9), but in mutant3, it's ACG? So positions7-9 would be A C G instead of C T C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutant3 has a deletion?\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, perhaps there's a substitution that leads to a frameshift. Let me count the bases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a deletion causing a frameshift. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original sequence after the first few bases, perhaps mutant3 has a deletion. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG:\n\n...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps at some point there's a deletion. For example, maybe a deletion of a base which causes a frameshift.\n\nWait, let's look for where the sequences diverge. The original has \"CTCGCTGGTACT...\" whereas mutant3 has \"ACGCTGGTGTCA...\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3, there's an insertion or deletion. Let me see:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 1-12: ATGTTTCTCGCT (after ATG, the first 12 nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTG...?)\n\nWait, perhaps at a certain point there's a frameshift. For example, if a base is deleted, the reading frame shifts, leading to premature stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3, there's a mutation that creates a stop codon early on.\n\nAlternatively, looking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nLooking at the first part, after the ATG, let's see the codons:\n\nOriginal first few codons after ATG:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: CTC (7-9)\n\nCodon4: GCT (10-12)\n\nCodon5: GGT (13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18), etc.\n\nIn mutant3, the sequence after ATG:\n\nFirst codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (same as original, positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9?), wait, not sure. Let me parse mutant3's first codons.\n\nWait, perhaps in mutant3's sequence, after ATG, the next bases are TTTACGCTGGT... So after the first three codons:\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: T A C? Or is it TAC?)\n\nWait, positions7-9 would be TAC if the next bases are TAC. So codon3 would be TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). But that's a missense again.\n\nWait maybe there's an insertion or deletion. Let me see the exact sequence:\n\nLooking at the mutant3's sequence: ...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nOriginal had after the initial part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps in mutant3, there's a substitution leading to a stop codon early?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift mutation. Let me see if there's an insertion or deletion. For example, a deletion of a base would shift the reading frame.\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence, perhaps there's a deletion. Let's see:\n\nSuppose after the first few codons, there's a deletion. For instance, in the original, after the initial part, maybe mutant3 has a deletion of a base which causes the reading frame to shift, leading to a premature stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon).\n\nLooking at the options, the best way to eliminate the gene's function is to create a premature stop codon early in the gene. So which mutation leads to a stop codon?\n\nAlternatively, a frameshift mutation that would lead to a premature stop.\n\nLooking at each mutant's changes:\n\nMutant1: missense (changing CTC to TAC)\n\nMutant2: missense (changing TTT to TCT in second codon?)\n\nWait, in mutant2, the second codon (positions4-6) was TTT (original), becomes TCT (codon TCT is Ser). So that's another missense.\n\nMutant3: Let's see. Maybe there's a frameshift here. Let's check the exact sequence.\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as: \"...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nOriginal after the first part was \"...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nHmm, perhaps a deletion of a base between the first and second exons? Wait, but the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon, so the introns are between exons. Since the mutation is in the first exon, any frameshift or stop codon in the first exon would be before the first intron.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a stop codon in mutant3's sequence. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in mutant3's sequence, after some point, there's a TGA or another stop codon earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a deletion of a base causing a frameshift leading to a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at mutant4's sequence.\n\nMutant4: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG: TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo original after the first few bases (positions7-9) has CTC (Leu), but mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). Wait, but then maybe there's a deletion?\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after the first part: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps a deletion of a few bases here. Let's see:\n\nOriginal has \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" while mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCT...\" which might indicate a deletion of a base, shifting the reading frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion between the first exon's nucleotides.\n\nWait, maybe in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base, causing a frameshift. Let's count the bases to see.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in mutant4, after the first few bases, there's a deletion of a base, causing a frameshift. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in the original, the sequence is:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nIn mutant4's sequence, after the first few bases, it's TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of a base at a certain point. Let's see where the sequences diverge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part, leading to a frameshift that introduces a stop codon early.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a premature stop codon in any of the mutants.\n\nAnother approach: look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) early.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1's sequence ends with ...TGA, same as original. The TGA is the original stop codon. But maybe an earlier stop?\n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. So any premature stop in the first exon would be before the first intron, meaning the mRNA would still have that stop codon. So if a mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon, the mRNA would have a premature stop, leading to a truncated protein, possibly non-functional.\n\nSo let's check each mutant for a stop codon early.\n\nOriginal sequence: starts with ATG, then continues until TGA at the end.\n\nMutant1's sequence: the last part still ends with TGA, but do they have an earlier stop?\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence: the first part after ATG is TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, maybe in the coding sequence, a stop codon appears before the end.\n\nLet me check each mutant's sequence for a TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding region (after the start codon).\n\nStarting with mutant1:\n\nThe first exon's sequence (assuming the entire sequence given is the first exon):\n\nLooking at the first few codons of mutant1:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12: GCT)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18)\n\nCodon7: TCT (19-21: TCT)\n\nCodon8: GTG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: GAA (28-30)\n\nCodon11: CAT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: ATT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TAT (37-39)\n\nCodon14: TGT (40-42?)\n\nWait, but looking for a stop codon (TGA, TAA, TAG) in the sequence before the original TGA.\n\nIn mutant1's sequence, the last part ends with ...TCGC...TGA. Wait, the mutant1's sequence ends with TGA, same as original. So unless there's an earlier stop codon.\n\nLooking at codons in mutant1's sequence:\n\nLooking through the codons listed above, none of them are stop codons except the last TGA.\n\nSo mutant1 does not have an early stop.\n\nMutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts with TCT (second codon TCT) instead of TTT.\n\nCodon2: TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon3: AGC (positions7-9: since mutant2's sequence after the first part is TCTAAGCTGGTACTT...)\n\nWait, let's parse mutant2's codons:\n\nOriginal's first codons after ATG:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TCT (positions4-6: T C T in mutant2)\n\nCodon3: AAG (positions7-9: AAG)\n\nCodon4: CTC (positions10-12: GCT?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse more carefully.\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo codons:\n\nCodon2 (positions4-6): TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon3 (positions7-9): AAG (Lys)\n\nCodon4 (positions10-12): CTC (Leu)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18)\n\nContinuing, so again, no stop codons until the end.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nAfter ATG, the first part is TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLet me parse the codons here.\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12: GCT)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: GTC (positions16-18: GTC)\n\nCodon7: ACT (positions19-21: ACT)\n\nCodon8: TCT (positions22-24: TCT)\n\nCodon9: GTG (25-27)\n\nWait, but looking at mutant3's sequence written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a frameshift here. Let's see if there's an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift.\n\nWait, maybe in mutant3, there's a deletion of a base, causing the reading frame to shift. For instance, if there's a deletion of a base between positions 12 and 13, then the codons after that would shift. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a premature stop:\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nThe sequence given ends with TGA, same as original, but let's see if there's an earlier stop.\n\nLooking at the codons in mutant3's sequence up to where it's written:\n\nAfter the first few codons, maybe later on there's a TGA.\n\nWait, the sequence is \"...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\"\n\nHmm, the part \"TCTGTG\" could be TCT (Ser) and GTG (Val), but not a stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the GTGTCACTTCT... part, perhaps a stop codon appears.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3, a frameshift causes a stop codon.\n\nSuppose there's a deletion of a base in the first exon, causing a frameshift. For example, if there's a deletion at position 12, which is a T in the original, then the reading frame shifts from there.\n\nOriginal at position 12 is T (part of codon4: GCT (positions10-12)). If in mutant3 there's a deletion of that T, then the next codon would start at position13. Let's see:\n\nOriginal codons up to position12: codon4 is GCT (positions10-12).\n\nIf position12 is deleted, then the next codon starts at position13:\n\npositions13-15: GGT (still GGT), then next codon positions16-18 would be TCA (instead of GTC?), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant3's sequence has a frameshift leading to a premature stop. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at mutant4's sequence.\n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal's first part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLooking at the codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nCodon5: ACT (positions13-15: ACT)\n\nCodon6: TCT (positions16-18)\n\nCodon7: GTG (19-21)\n\nCodon8: GAT (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAA (25-27)\n\nCodon10: CAT (28-30)\n\nCodon11: ATT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: TAT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TGT (37-39?)\n\nWait, but looking for a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion here causing a frameshift.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence, maybe there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part. For instance, in the original sequence after the first part, the next bases are GGTACTTCT... but in mutant4 it's ACTTCT... So perhaps a deletion of \"GG\" leading to a frameshift?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion of a base at position 15:\n\nOriginal at positions13-15: GGT (codon5), but in mutant4, perhaps the G is missing, causing the codons to shift.\n\nAlternatively, let me check for a stop codon.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after codon3 (TAC):\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nCodon5: ACT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: TCT (16-18)\n\nCodon7: GTG (19-21)\n\nCodon8: GAT (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAA (25-27)\n\nCodon10: CAT (28-30)\n\nCodon11: ATT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: TAT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TGT (37-39)\n\n... and so on until the final TGA.\n\nHmm, no stop codon there. So maybe frameshift leading to a stop.\n\nAlternatively, let me check mutant4's sequence for a possible frameshift caused by a deletion.\n\nOriginal's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part. For example, in the original, after the first part (positions1-12), the next is GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, the sequence after the first part (positions1-12) is ACT (positions13-15). That suggests that the original GGT is replaced by ACT, which could be a frameshift.\n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a deletion of a base between positions 12 and 13. Let's say original has at position12 a T (part of codon4 GCT), and then position13 is G (start of GGT). If there's a deletion of that G (position13), then the codons shift:\n\nAfter position12 (T), the next codon starts at position14 (T), so codon5 would be TCT (positions14-16?), but this is getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base at position 13, leading to a frameshift. The original codon5 was GGT (positions13-15). If position13 is deleted, then codon5 starts at position14: GT (positions14-16 would be GT? plus next base? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift leads to a premature stop codon. Let's suppose that in mutant4's sequence, after a deletion, a TGA appears early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3 or 4, a frameshift occurs, and then later a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best option is to look for a nonsense mutation (premature stop).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since the question mentions that the gene has introns, so the exons are spliced. However, the mutation is in the first exon, so any mutation that disrupts the coding sequence in the first exon before the first intron would be effective.\n\nThe most effective would be a nonsense mutation (premature stop) in the first exon.\n\nLooking at the options, maybe mutant4 has a deletion causing a frameshift which then leads to a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the options given:\n\nThe question says \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\" so we need the gene to not produce the protein. So the best way is to have a nonsense mutation or frameshift leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nLooking back at the sequences, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a deletion causing a frameshift which introduces a stop codon early.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence:\n\nOriginal first exon's first part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of two bases between the first exon's part, leading to a frameshift. For example, the original had \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" whereas mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCT...\" which could indicate a deletion of \"GGT\" (3 bases?), but that might not be. Alternatively, maybe a deletion of a base causing the frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a frameshift that causes a stop codon within the first exon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3's sequence has a frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in mutant4's sequence, the part after the first few bases is \"ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" The ACTTCT part could have a stop codon.\n\nLooking at ACTTCT: the codons are ACT (Thr) and TCT (Ser), no stop.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the mutations that change the reading frame.\n\nMutant3's sequence: The mutant3's sequence is written as \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, after the first few bases, there's an extra GT? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, there's a deletion of a base leading to a frameshift. Let's suppose that in the first exon, a deletion occurs, causing the reading frame to shift such that a stop codon appears.\n\nFor example, if there's a deletion of a base at position 12 (original T), then the next codon would be shifted. Let's see:\n\nOriginal codons up to position12: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nIf position12 is deleted, then the next codon starts at position13:\n\npositions13-15: GGT (still GGT), then positions16-18: ACT (original was TCT?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion at position 9. Let's say position9 (original C) is deleted. Then codons after would shift.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too involved. Maybe the correct answer is mutant4.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely the one that introduces a premature stop or frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant3 has a frameshift. Let me see the mutant3's sequence again: the original had \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" while mutant3 has \"TTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...\" which might indicate an extra base or deletion. For example, maybe there's a deletion of a base between positions 10-12 causing a frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, after the first few bases, there's an insertion leading to a frameshift. But the question says EMS is used, which is a point mutagen, so insertions/deletions are less likely unless it's a frameshift due to a single base change.\n\nWait, no, EMS typically causes point mutations (single base changes), so insertions/deletions would be rare. So frameshifts would require a single base insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes transitions. So maybe the answer is a nonsense mutation (premature stop).\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the options have a stop codon, so we look for a frameshift which would lead to a premature stop codon.\n\nMutant4's sequence: \"TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLooking at the part \"ACTTCTGTGGATGA...\", the codons here would be ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys)... \n\nWait, but if there's a frameshift, maybe the codons are shifted. For example, a deletion of a base at an early position causes the reading frame to shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the mutation leads to a stop codon.\n\nWait, let me look again at mutant4's sequence. The original sequence after the first few codons includes GGTACTTCT... which is GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... but in mutant4, after the first part, it's ACTTCTGTGGAT... which is ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp)... \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4 because it has a deletion causing a frameshift and a premature stop. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a deletion leading to a frameshift that introduces a stop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first exon's first few codons are crucial. If a mutation leads to a premature stop, that would be best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nThe options are A-D. The question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. To disable the gene, the best is to have a mutation that causes a premature stop codon in the first exon so that the mRNA is non-functional.\n\nLooking again at the sequences, perhaps in mutant4's sequence, there's a point mutation that creates a stop codon early.\n\nWait, let's look at mutant4's sequence again:\n\nMutant4's sequence is: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's first part after ATG:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLooking at the codons:\n\nAfter the start codon:\n\nCodon2: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon3: TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon4: GCT (Ala)\n\nCodon5: ACT (Thr)\n\nCodon6: TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon7: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon8: GAT (Asp)\n\nCodon9: GAA (Glu)\n\nCodon10: CAT (His)\n\nCodon11: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon12: TAT (Tyr)\n\nCodon13: TGT (Cys)\n\n... until TGA.\n\nNo stop codons there. \n\nHmm, this is tough. Maybe I need to look for a frameshift.\n\nWait, the original has at position 13-15: GGT (Gly). In mutant4's sequence, after the first part, the next codons after codon4 (GCT) are ACT (positions13-15). So the original's GGT becomes ACT. That suggests a frameshift. How?\n\nIf there was a deletion of a base between the first exon's bases 12 and 13, then the reading frame would shift. For example, if the original was:\n\nPositions 12 is T (part of codon4: GCT), and position13 is G (start of GGT). If the G at position13 is deleted, then codon5 starts at position14:\n\npositions14-16 would be GT (from GGT's T and next bases). Not sure. Alternatively, the deletion causes the next codon to be TCT (positions13-15?), but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a single base change that creates a stop codon.\n\nWait, looking at the mutant4's sequence:\n\nLooking at codons in mutant4's sequence, maybe somewhere after the first few codons there's a TGA.\n\nWait, the sequence ends with TGA, so the original stop codon is still there. But perhaps an earlier stop?\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant3, because the sequence has a deletion causing a frameshift and a premature stop.\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence: \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nThe part \"GTGTCACTTCT...\" could have a stop codon. Let's see:\n\nThe codons here would be:\n\nGTC (Val), TCA (Ser), CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGG (Gly)... \n\nNo stop there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frameshift leads to a stop codon in the first exon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant2 has a mutation that leads to a premature stop.\n\nMutant2's sequence after the first few codons has codons like TCT (Ser), AAG (Lys), CTC (Leu)... Not a stop.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nThe question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. To eliminate the compound, the gene must be non-functional. The best way is to have a mutation in the first exon that either:\n\n1. Creates a premature stop codon in the first exon (so the mRNA would be cut short before the first intron, so the protein is not made).\n\n2. A frameshift mutation early in the first exon, leading to a premature stop.\n\nLooking at the options, maybe mutant4's mutation causes a frameshift that introduces a stop codon early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4 because the sequence shows a deletion (since the mutant4's sequence is shorter in that region?) \n\nLooking at the sequences provided:\n\nOriginal first exon ends with \"...TGA-3\u2019\".\n\nMutant4's sequence is written as \"...TGA-3\u2019\" but the middle part is shorter? Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: \"TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nMutant4's sequence: \"TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nThe difference is that the original has \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\" whereas mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...\" \n\nIt looks like there's a deletion of \"GGTACT\" (6 bases?), which would cause a frameshift. If a deletion of 6 bases (even number), the reading frame would return, but a deletion of an odd number would cause a frameshift.\n\nSuppose in mutant4 there's a deletion of 5 bases between positions 10 and 15. That would shift the reading frame. For example, deleting from position10 to position14 (5 bases), then the next codon would start at position16, causing a frameshift. This frameshift would eventually lead to a stop codon before the original TGA.\n\nTherefore, the frameshift would introduce a stop codon earlier, making the protein non-functional.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is mutant4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a deletion causing a frameshift.\n\nThe problem states that the mutations are in the beginning of the first exon. So the earliest possible frameshift or stop would be best.\n\nMutant4's sequence may have a deletion causing a frameshift early on.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the earliest possible stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant1 has a mutation in codon3 (CTC\u2192TAC) which is a missense, but mutant3's codon3 is TAC as well. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is mutant4, because the sequence shows a deletion that causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, but considering the options, maybe the answer is D (mutant4).\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The goal is to either introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift mutation early in the first exon, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n1. **Mutant 1**:\n   - The third codon (CTC \u2192 TAC) changes from Leu to Tyr. This is a missense mutation but does not introduce a stop codon or frameshift. The protein might still be functional.\n\n2. **Mutant 2**:\n   - The second codon (TTT \u2192 TCT) changes from Phe to Ser. This is another missense mutation, altering an amino acid but not disabling the gene.\n\n3. **Mutant 3**:\n   - The third codon (CTC \u2192 TAC) changes from Leu to Tyr. Additionally, the sequence shows potential deletions or insertions leading to a frameshift. For example, the deletion of bases could shift the reading frame, but without an explicit stop codon shown in the given sequence, this is less definitive.\n\n4. **Mutant 4**:\n   - The sequence indicates a deletion in the first exon (e.g., \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT\" becomes \"ACGCTACTTCT\"). This deletion likely causes a frameshift mutation. A frameshift early in the exon would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon before the original TGA. This would result in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMutant 4's deletion-induced frameshift is the most likely to introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the protein structure sufficiently to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. The gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found changes in the first exon. The options are the four mutants, and I need to pick which one would stop the gene from producing the compound.\n\nFirst, I remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) typically causes point mutations, usually G to A or C to T transitions. But maybe here the key is looking at the mutations given, not the mechanism of EMS. The main idea is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the gene's product is the anti-nutritional compound, we need to disable the gene. So the best way would be to cause a premature stop codon, or a frameshift, or a nonsense mutation early on so the protein isn't made properly.\n\nLooking at the sequences, the original starts with ATG (start codon) and ends with TGA (stop).

Let's parse each mutant:\n\nMutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC... \n\nWait, let me compare each base step by step. Let's write out the original and each mutant's first exon start.\n\nOriginal first exon's first part (maybe first 20 bases or so):\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG... (I can write out the first part up to where the changes occur.)\n\nLet me look at each mutant's mutation points:\n\nFor Mutant 1:\n\nOriginal: The first few bases after ATG are TTTCTCGC... \n\nIn mutant 1, the sequence changes. Let me compare the sequences base by base.\n\nOriginal sequence from 5' to 3':\n\nStarting at position 1 (ATG is first 3 bases):\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (start codon)\nPositions 4-6: TTT (so positions 4 is T, 5 T, 6 T)\nPosition 7-9: CTC (so position7 C, 8 T, 9 C)\nPosition 10-12: GCT (G C T)\nWait, maybe I need to look at each mutant's sequence and see where the changes are.\n\nWait, let me parse each mutant's sequence step by step. Let's compare each mutant's first exon with the original.\n\nStarting with the original first exon:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst part up to where the mutations occur. Let's see where the changes are in each mutant.\n\nMutant 1's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let's write the original and mutant 1's first part.\n\nOriginal starts:\n\nATG (positions 1-3)\n\nThen next bases: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, let's break down the first part letter by letter.\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (start)\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (so T at positions 4,5,6)\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C (positions 7-9: CTC)\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T (positions 10-12: GCT)\n\nWait, let me see. Let's list the original sequence's first part:\n\nOriginal first 15 bases after ATG (positions 4-18):\n\nPositions:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\nWait maybe I need to look at the actual sequences given for each mutant.\n\nLet me write the original and each mutant's sequence up to where they differ.\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, let me compare the first parts:\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG... \n\nWait, the first exon's first part:\n\nLooking at the original and mutant 1:\n\nOriginal first part after ATG:\n\nThe next bases are TTTCTCGCTG... Let's see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 4- let's see):\n\nOriginal: positions 4-12: T T T C T C G C T (so the first 12 bases after ATG are TTTCTCGCTG? Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant's first few bases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the exact differences. Let me write the first part of each mutant's sequence.\n\nOriginal first exon's first part (starting from 5'):\n\nOriginal:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is in the 7th or 8th position?\n\nWait let me go step by step:\n\nOriginal: ATG (positions 1-3), then next is T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait maybe writing the first part of the mutant's sequences:\n\nMutant 1's first part:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG... \n\nWait, the mutant 1 has after ATG: TTTCTACGCTG...\n\nWait, let's look at the letters:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 4-12 (after ATG):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\nThen 13: G, 14: G, etc.\n\nIn mutant 1, after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-12:\n\nSame as original up to position 7? Let me see:\n\nMutant 1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part after ATG is:\n\nT T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, perhaps I should write the first 10 bases after ATG for each.\n\nOriginal after ATG (positions 4-13):\n\nPositions 4-13: T T T C T C G C T G (so the first 10 bases after ATG are TTTCTCGCTG?)\n\nMutant 1 after ATG:\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nThe sequence is written as \"TTCTACGCTGGT...\" Hmm, maybe I need to compare each base step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the mutations are. Let me see:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing the two:\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGC...\n\nMutant1 has ATGTTTCTACGC...\n\nAh, so between the TTT and the next part. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATGTTT (positions 1-6: ATGTTT) is next CTCGCTG...\n\nWait, original's first 10 bases after ATG:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nATG (1-3), then T (4), T (5), T (6), C (7), T (8), C (9), G (10), C (11), T (12), etc.\n\nMutant1: ATGTTTCTACGC...\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe original at position 7 is C (position 7: 7th base after ATG?), but maybe I should count the bases step by step.\n\nLet me write the first 15 bases of the original and mutant1:\n\nOriginal:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G (start codon)\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n...\n\nMutant1's first 15:\n\n1-3: ATG (same)\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T (same up to here?)\n\nWait, mutant1's sequence is written as ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, after the first 6 bases (ATGTTT), the next is CTACGCT...\n\nWait, original after ATGTTT is CTCGCTGGT...\n\nWait, let's break down the first 10 bases after ATG:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG\n\nThen positions 4-12 (the next 9):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C (position7)\n\n8: T (8)\n\n9: C (9)\n\n10: G (10)\n\n11: C (11)\n\n12: T (12)\n\n13: G (13)\n\n14: G (14)\n\nSo after the initial ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next bases are CTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT (positions1-6 same as original) is CTACGC...\n\nWait, so the 7th base (position7) is C in original. In mutant1, what's the 7th?\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1 has a change at position 9?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal's 7-9: CTC (positions7-9: C at 7, T at8, C at9)\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT (positions1-6) would be next as TAC? Let me see:\n\nOriginal's 7th base (position7) is C, but in mutant1, maybe the 7th is T?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's look at the mutant1's sequence written as \"ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\"\n\nWait, the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nSo the original after ATG is:\n\nATG (start) followed by TTT (positions4-6), then CTC (positions7-9), GCT (positions10-12), etc.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is TTTCTACGCT...\n\nWait, so between the TTT and the next part, the CTC becomes TAC?\n\nSo the original at positions7-9 (CTC) becomes TAC in mutant1?\n\nSo that's a change at position7 from C to T? Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nPositions 4-9 (after ATG):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\nMutant1's same positions:\n\nPositions7: T instead of C?\n\nWait, in the mutant1's sequence, after the first six (ATGTTT), the next three bases are TAC (positions7-9?), so the 7th base is T instead of C?\n\nIf that's the case, then position7 (original C) becomes T in mutant1.\n\nSo that's a mutation at position7: C to T.\n\nWhich would change the codons here. Let's see what codons are being affected.\n\nThe gene's first exon is transcribed into mRNA, then translated. Let's consider the coding sequence (CDS) starts with the ATG, so the first codon is ATG (methionine), then the next codons are the next triplets.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (starting at position1 as ATG):\n\nThe first codon is ATG (positions1-3).\n\nThe second codon is TTT (positions4-6).\n\nThird codon: CTC (positions7-9).\n\nFourth codon: GCT (10-12), etc.\n\nIn mutant1, the third codon (positions7-9) becomes TAC (since original was CTC, but mutant1 has TAC there). So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation, changing an amino acid. But that might not stop the protein. Unless it's an essential part, but the question is about eliminating the compound, so maybe this mutation is not enough. Unless it's a critical amino acid, but we don't know.\n\nNow looking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nMutant2 has after ATG: TCTAAGCTGGTACTT...\n\nSo let's see the differences here. Let's break it down.\n\nOriginal first few bases after ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2 is:\n\nATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nOriginal's first 6 bases after ATG: TTT (positions4-6) followed by CTC...\n\nMutant2's first 6 after ATG: TCT (positions4-6?), then AA GCT...\n\nWait, let's count the bases step by step.\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG (start)\n\nPositions4: T (original)\n\nMutant2's position4: T (same)\n\nPosition5:\n\nOriginal: T (position5)\n\nMutant2: T (same?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the exact changes.\n\nWait, the mutant2's sequence is written as ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nOriginal's first 10 bases after ATG (positions4-13):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TCT (since the next after ATG is TCT instead of TTT?)\n\nWait, original's positions4-6 are TTT (since original is TTTCTC...), so the first three after ATG are TTT (positions4-6).\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts with TCT (positions4-6: T C T?), then AAGCT...\n\nSo the first three bases (positions4-6) in mutant2 are TCT instead of TTT. That's a change at position5 from T to C? Let me check:\n\nOriginal position5 is T, mutant2 has C there?\n\nWait, the mutant2's sequence after ATG is TCTAAGCTGGT... So positions4 is T, 5 is C, 6 is T.\n\nSo position5 (original T) becomes C in mutant2. So that would change the second codon (positions4-6) from TTT to TCT (since positions4-6 would be T C T? Wait, the second codon (positions4-6) in original is TTT (methionine? Wait no, the first codon is ATG (methionine), second is TTT (which is Phe), third codon is CTC (Leu), etc.\n\nIn mutant2, the second codon (positions4-6) becomes TCT (Serine) instead of Phe. That's a missense mutation again. Not a stop.\n\nNow looking at Mutant3:\n\nMutant3's sequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the original sequence had ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nComparing, the mutant3's first part:\n\nAfter ATG, original has TTTCTCGCTG... \n\nMutant3 has TTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion here. Let's see.\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, looking at the first part:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is TTTACGCTGGT... \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal's first few bases after ATG:\n\nPositions4-12 (after ATG):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG starts with TTT (positions4-6 same as original?), then the next bases: ACGCTGGT...\n\nWait, the original after positions7-9 is CTC (positions7-9), but in mutant3, it's ACG? So positions7-9 would be A C G instead of C T C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutant3 has a deletion?\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, perhaps there's a substitution that leads to a frameshift. Let me count the bases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a deletion causing a frameshift. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original sequence after the first few bases, perhaps mutant3 has a deletion. Let's see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG:\n\n...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps at some point there's a deletion. For example, maybe a deletion of a base which causes a frameshift.\n\nWait, let's look for where the sequences diverge. The original has \"CTCGCTGGTACT...\" whereas mutant3 has \"ACGCTGGTGTCA...\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3, there's an insertion or deletion. Let me see:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 1-12: ATGTTTCTCGCT (after ATG, the first 12 nucleotides are TTTCTCGCTG...?)\n\nWait, perhaps at a certain point there's a frameshift. For example, if a base is deleted, the reading frame shifts, leading to premature stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3, there's a mutation that creates a stop codon early on.\n\nAlternatively, looking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nLooking at the first part, after the ATG, let's see the codons:\n\nOriginal first few codons after ATG:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: CTC (7-9)\n\nCodon4: GCT (10-12)\n\nCodon5: GGT (13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18), etc.\n\nIn mutant3, the sequence after ATG:\n\nFirst codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (same as original, positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9?), wait, not sure. Let me parse mutant3's first codons.\n\nWait, perhaps in mutant3's sequence, after ATG, the next bases are TTTACGCTGGT... So after the first three codons:\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: T A C? Or is it TAC?)\n\nWait, positions7-9 would be TAC if the next bases are TAC. So codon3 would be TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). But that's a missense again.\n\nWait maybe there's an insertion or deletion. Let me see the exact sequence:\n\nLooking at the mutant3's sequence: ...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nOriginal had after the initial part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps in mutant3, there's a substitution leading to a stop codon early?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift mutation. Let me see if there's an insertion or deletion. For example, a deletion of a base would shift the reading frame.\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence, perhaps there's a deletion. Let's see:\n\nSuppose after the first few codons, there's a deletion. For instance, in the original, after the initial part, maybe mutant3 has a deletion of a base which causes the reading frame to shift, leading to a premature stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon).\n\nLooking at the options, the best way to eliminate the gene's function is to create a premature stop codon early in the gene. So which mutation leads to a stop codon?\n\nAlternatively, a frameshift mutation that would lead to a premature stop.\n\nLooking at each mutant's changes:\n\nMutant1: missense (changing CTC to TAC)\n\nMutant2: missense (changing TTT to TCT in second codon?)\n\nWait, in mutant2, the second codon (positions4-6) was TTT (original), becomes TCT (codon TCT is Ser). So that's another missense.\n\nMutant3: Let's see. Maybe there's a frameshift here. Let's check the exact sequence.\n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as: \"...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nOriginal after the first part was \"...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nHmm, perhaps a deletion of a base between the first and second exons? Wait, but the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon, so the introns are between exons. Since the mutation is in the first exon, any frameshift or stop codon in the first exon would be before the first intron.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a stop codon in mutant3's sequence. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in mutant3's sequence, after some point, there's a TGA or another stop codon earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a deletion of a base causing a frameshift leading to a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at mutant4's sequence.\n\nMutant4: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG: TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo original after the first few bases (positions7-9) has CTC (Leu), but mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). Wait, but then maybe there's a deletion?\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after the first part: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, perhaps a deletion of a few bases here. Let's see:\n\nOriginal has \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" while mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCT...\" which might indicate a deletion of a base, shifting the reading frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion between the first exon's nucleotides.\n\nWait, maybe in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base, causing a frameshift. Let's count the bases to see.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in mutant4, after the first few bases, there's a deletion of a base, causing a frameshift. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in the original, the sequence is:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nIn mutant4's sequence, after the first few bases, it's TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of a base at a certain point. Let's see where the sequences diverge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part, leading to a frameshift that introduces a stop codon early.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a premature stop codon in any of the mutants.\n\nAnother approach: look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) early.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1's sequence ends with ...TGA, same as original. The TGA is the original stop codon. But maybe an earlier stop?\n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. So any premature stop in the first exon would be before the first intron, meaning the mRNA would still have that stop codon. So if a mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon, the mRNA would have a premature stop, leading to a truncated protein, possibly non-functional.\n\nSo let's check each mutant for a stop codon early.\n\nOriginal sequence: starts with ATG, then continues until TGA at the end.\n\nMutant1's sequence: the last part still ends with TGA, but do they have an earlier stop?\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence: the first part after ATG is TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, maybe in the coding sequence, a stop codon appears before the end.\n\nLet me check each mutant's sequence for a TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding region (after the start codon).\n\nStarting with mutant1:\n\nThe first exon's sequence (assuming the entire sequence given is the first exon):\n\nLooking at the first few codons of mutant1:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12: GCT)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18)\n\nCodon7: TCT (19-21: TCT)\n\nCodon8: GTG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: GAA (28-30)\n\nCodon11: CAT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: ATT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TAT (37-39)\n\nCodon14: TGT (40-42?)\n\nWait, but looking for a stop codon (TGA, TAA, TAG) in the sequence before the original TGA.\n\nIn mutant1's sequence, the last part ends with ...TCGC...TGA. Wait, the mutant1's sequence ends with TGA, same as original. So unless there's an earlier stop codon.\n\nLooking at codons in mutant1's sequence:\n\nLooking through the codons listed above, none of them are stop codons except the last TGA.\n\nSo mutant1 does not have an early stop.\n\nMutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts with TCT (second codon TCT) instead of TTT.\n\nCodon2: TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon3: AGC (positions7-9: since mutant2's sequence after the first part is TCTAAGCTGGTACTT...)\n\nWait, let's parse mutant2's codons:\n\nOriginal's first codons after ATG:\n\nCodon1: ATG (start)\n\nCodon2: TCT (positions4-6: T C T in mutant2)\n\nCodon3: AAG (positions7-9: AAG)\n\nCodon4: CTC (positions10-12: GCT?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse more carefully.\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo codons:\n\nCodon2 (positions4-6): TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon3 (positions7-9): AAG (Lys)\n\nCodon4 (positions10-12): CTC (Leu)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: ACT (16-18)\n\nContinuing, so again, no stop codons until the end.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nAfter ATG, the first part is TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLet me parse the codons here.\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12: GCT)\n\nCodon5: GGT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: GTC (positions16-18: GTC)\n\nCodon7: ACT (positions19-21: ACT)\n\nCodon8: TCT (positions22-24: TCT)\n\nCodon9: GTG (25-27)\n\nWait, but looking at mutant3's sequence written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a frameshift here. Let's see if there's an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift.\n\nWait, maybe in mutant3, there's a deletion of a base, causing the reading frame to shift. For instance, if there's a deletion of a base between positions 12 and 13, then the codons after that would shift. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a premature stop:\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nThe sequence given ends with TGA, same as original, but let's see if there's an earlier stop.\n\nLooking at the codons in mutant3's sequence up to where it's written:\n\nAfter the first few codons, maybe later on there's a TGA.\n\nWait, the sequence is \"...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\"\n\nHmm, the part \"TCTGTG\" could be TCT (Ser) and GTG (Val), but not a stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the GTGTCACTTCT... part, perhaps a stop codon appears.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3, a frameshift causes a stop codon.\n\nSuppose there's a deletion of a base in the first exon, causing a frameshift. For example, if there's a deletion at position 12, which is a T in the original, then the reading frame shifts from there.\n\nOriginal at position 12 is T (part of codon4: GCT (positions10-12)). If in mutant3 there's a deletion of that T, then the next codon would start at position13. Let's see:\n\nOriginal codons up to position12: codon4 is GCT (positions10-12).\n\nIf position12 is deleted, then the next codon starts at position13:\n\npositions13-15: GGT (still GGT), then next codon positions16-18 would be TCA (instead of GTC?), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant3's sequence has a frameshift leading to a premature stop. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at mutant4's sequence.\n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal's first part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLooking at the codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\nCodon2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nCodon3: TAC (positions7-9)\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nCodon5: ACT (positions13-15: ACT)\n\nCodon6: TCT (positions16-18)\n\nCodon7: GTG (19-21)\n\nCodon8: GAT (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAA (25-27)\n\nCodon10: CAT (28-30)\n\nCodon11: ATT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: TAT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TGT (37-39?)\n\nWait, but looking for a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion here causing a frameshift.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence, maybe there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part. For instance, in the original sequence after the first part, the next bases are GGTACTTCT... but in mutant4 it's ACTTCT... So perhaps a deletion of \"GG\" leading to a frameshift?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion of a base at position 15:\n\nOriginal at positions13-15: GGT (codon5), but in mutant4, perhaps the G is missing, causing the codons to shift.\n\nAlternatively, let me check for a stop codon.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after codon3 (TAC):\n\nCodon4: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nCodon5: ACT (positions13-15)\n\nCodon6: TCT (16-18)\n\nCodon7: GTG (19-21)\n\nCodon8: GAT (22-24)\n\nCodon9: GAA (25-27)\n\nCodon10: CAT (28-30)\n\nCodon11: ATT (31-33)\n\nCodon12: TAT (34-36)\n\nCodon13: TGT (37-39)\n\n... and so on until the final TGA.\n\nHmm, no stop codon there. So maybe frameshift leading to a stop.\n\nAlternatively, let me check mutant4's sequence for a possible frameshift caused by a deletion.\n\nOriginal's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of a base between the first exon's part. For example, in the original, after the first part (positions1-12), the next is GGT (positions13-15). In mutant4, the sequence after the first part (positions1-12) is ACT (positions13-15). That suggests that the original GGT is replaced by ACT, which could be a frameshift.\n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a deletion of a base between positions 12 and 13. Let's say original has at position12 a T (part of codon4 GCT), and then position13 is G (start of GGT). If there's a deletion of that G (position13), then the codons shift:\n\nAfter position12 (T), the next codon starts at position14 (T), so codon5 would be TCT (positions14-16?), but this is getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a deletion of a base at position 13, leading to a frameshift. The original codon5 was GGT (positions13-15). If position13 is deleted, then codon5 starts at position14: GT (positions14-16 would be GT? plus next base? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift leads to a premature stop codon. Let's suppose that in mutant4's sequence, after a deletion, a TGA appears early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3 or 4, a frameshift occurs, and then later a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best option is to look for a nonsense mutation (premature stop).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since the question mentions that the gene has introns, so the exons are spliced. However, the mutation is in the first exon, so any mutation that disrupts the coding sequence in the first exon before the first intron would be effective.\n\nThe most effective would be a nonsense mutation (premature stop) in the first exon.\n\nLooking at the options, maybe mutant4 has a deletion causing a frameshift which then leads to a stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the options given:\n\nThe question says \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\" so we need the gene to not produce the protein. So the best way is to have a nonsense mutation or frameshift leading to a premature stop codon.\n\nLooking back at the sequences, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a deletion causing a frameshift which introduces a stop codon early.\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence:\n\nOriginal first exon's first part: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion of two bases between the first exon's part, leading to a frameshift. For example, the original had \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" whereas mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCT...\" which could indicate a deletion of \"GGT\" (3 bases?), but that might not be. Alternatively, maybe a deletion of a base causing the frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant4's sequence has a frameshift that causes a stop codon within the first exon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3's sequence has a frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in mutant4's sequence, the part after the first few bases is \"ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" The ACTTCT part could have a stop codon.\n\nLooking at ACTTCT: the codons are ACT (Thr) and TCT (Ser), no stop.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the mutations that change the reading frame.\n\nMutant3's sequence: The mutant3's sequence is written as \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nWait, after the first few bases, there's an extra GT? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, there's a deletion of a base leading to a frameshift. Let's suppose that in the first exon, a deletion occurs, causing the reading frame to shift such that a stop codon appears.\n\nFor example, if there's a deletion of a base at position 12 (original T), then the next codon would be shifted. Let's see:\n\nOriginal codons up to position12: GCT (positions10-12)\n\nIf position12 is deleted, then the next codon starts at position13:\n\npositions13-15: GGT (still GGT), then positions16-18: ACT (original was TCT?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a deletion at position 9. Let's say position9 (original C) is deleted. Then codons after would shift.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too involved. Maybe the correct answer is mutant4.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely the one that introduces a premature stop or frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant3 has a frameshift. Let me see the mutant3's sequence again: the original had \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\" while mutant3 has \"TTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...\" which might indicate an extra base or deletion. For example, maybe there's a deletion of a base between positions 10-12 causing a frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3's sequence, after the first few bases, there's an insertion leading to a frameshift. But the question says EMS is used, which is a point mutagen, so insertions/deletions are less likely unless it's a frameshift due to a single base change.\n\nWait, no, EMS typically causes point mutations (single base changes), so insertions/deletions would be rare. So frameshifts would require a single base insertion or deletion, but EMS usually causes transitions. So maybe the answer is a nonsense mutation (premature stop).\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the options have a stop codon, so we look for a frameshift which would lead to a premature stop codon.\n\nMutant4's sequence: \"TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nLooking at the part \"ACTTCTGTGGATGA...\", the codons here would be ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys)... \n\nWait, but if there's a frameshift, maybe the codons are shifted. For example, a deletion of a base at an early position causes the reading frame to shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the mutation leads to a stop codon.\n\nWait, let me look again at mutant4's sequence. The original sequence after the first few codons includes GGTACTTCT... which is GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)... but in mutant4, after the first part, it's ACTTCTGTGGAT... which is ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp)... \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4 because it has a deletion causing a frameshift and a premature stop. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a deletion leading to a frameshift that introduces a stop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first exon's first few codons are crucial. If a mutation leads to a premature stop, that would be best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nThe options are A-D. The question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. To disable the gene, the best is to have a mutation that causes a premature stop codon in the first exon so that the mRNA is non-functional.\n\nLooking again at the sequences, perhaps in mutant4's sequence, there's a point mutation that creates a stop codon early.\n\nWait, let's look at mutant4's sequence again:\n\nMutant4's sequence is: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's first part after ATG:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLooking at the codons:\n\nAfter the start codon:\n\nCodon2: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon3: TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon4: GCT (Ala)\n\nCodon5: ACT (Thr)\n\nCodon6: TCT (Ser)\n\nCodon7: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon8: GAT (Asp)\n\nCodon9: GAA (Glu)\n\nCodon10: CAT (His)\n\nCodon11: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon12: TAT (Tyr)\n\nCodon13: TGT (Cys)\n\n... until TGA.\n\nNo stop codons there. \n\nHmm, this is tough. Maybe I need to look for a frameshift.\n\nWait, the original has at position 13-15: GGT (Gly). In mutant4's sequence, after the first part, the next codons after codon4 (GCT) are ACT (positions13-15). So the original's GGT becomes ACT. That suggests a frameshift. How?\n\nIf there was a deletion of a base between the first exon's bases 12 and 13, then the reading frame would shift. For example, if the original was:\n\nPositions 12 is T (part of codon4: GCT), and position13 is G (start of GGT). If the G at position13 is deleted, then codon5 starts at position14:\n\npositions14-16 would be GT (from GGT's T and next bases). Not sure. Alternatively, the deletion causes the next codon to be TCT (positions13-15?), but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a single base change that creates a stop codon.\n\nWait, looking at the mutant4's sequence:\n\nLooking at codons in mutant4's sequence, maybe somewhere after the first few codons there's a TGA.\n\nWait, the sequence ends with TGA, so the original stop codon is still there. But perhaps an earlier stop?\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant3, because the sequence has a deletion causing a frameshift and a premature stop.\n\nLooking at mutant3's sequence: \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nThe part \"GTGTCACTTCT...\" could have a stop codon. Let's see:\n\nThe codons here would be:\n\nGTC (Val), TCA (Ser), CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), GGG (Gly)... \n\nNo stop there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frameshift leads to a stop codon in the first exon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant2 has a mutation that leads to a premature stop.\n\nMutant2's sequence after the first few codons has codons like TCT (Ser), AAG (Lys), CTC (Leu)... Not a stop.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nThe question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon. To eliminate the compound, the gene must be non-functional. The best way is to have a mutation in the first exon that either:\n\n1. Creates a premature stop codon in the first exon (so the mRNA would be cut short before the first intron, so the protein is not made).\n\n2. A frameshift mutation early in the first exon, leading to a premature stop.\n\nLooking at the options, maybe mutant4's mutation causes a frameshift that introduces a stop codon early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is mutant4 because the sequence shows a deletion (since the mutant4's sequence is shorter in that region?) \n\nLooking at the sequences provided:\n\nOriginal first exon ends with \"...TGA-3\u2019\".\n\nMutant4's sequence is written as \"...TGA-3\u2019\" but the middle part is shorter? Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: \"TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nMutant4's sequence: \"TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\"\n\nThe difference is that the original has \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\" whereas mutant4 has \"ACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...\" \n\nIt looks like there's a deletion of \"GGTACT\" (6 bases?), which would cause a frameshift. If a deletion of 6 bases (even number), the reading frame would return, but a deletion of an odd number would cause a frameshift.\n\nSuppose in mutant4 there's a deletion of 5 bases between positions 10 and 15. That would shift the reading frame. For example, deleting from position10 to position14 (5 bases), then the next codon would start at position16, causing a frameshift. This frameshift would eventually lead to a stop codon before the original TGA.\n\nTherefore, the frameshift would introduce a stop codon earlier, making the protein non-functional.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is mutant4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a deletion causing a frameshift.\n\nThe problem states that the mutations are in the beginning of the first exon. So the earliest possible frameshift or stop would be best.\n\nMutant4's sequence may have a deletion causing a frameshift early on.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the earliest possible stop codon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mutant1 has a mutation in codon3 (CTC\u2192TAC) which is a missense, but mutant3's codon3 is TAC as well. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is mutant4, because the sequence shows a deletion that causes a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, but considering the options, maybe the answer is D (mutant4).\n\n\nTo determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The goal is to either introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift mutation early in the first exon, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n1. **Mutant 1**:\n   - The third codon (CTC \u2192 TAC) changes from Leu to Tyr. This is a missense mutation but does not introduce a stop codon or frameshift. The protein might still be functional.\n\n2. **Mutant 2**:\n   - The second codon (TTT \u2192 TCT) changes from Phe to Ser. This is another missense mutation, altering an amino acid but not disabling the gene.\n\n3. **Mutant 3**:\n   - The third codon (CTC \u2192 TAC) changes from Leu to Tyr. Additionally, the sequence shows potential deletions or insertions leading to a frameshift. For example, the deletion of bases could shift the reading frame, but without an explicit stop codon shown in the given sequence, this is less definitive.\n\n4. **Mutant 4**:\n   - The sequence indicates a deletion in the first exon (e.g., \"CTCGCTGGTACTTCT\" becomes \"ACGCTACTTCT\"). This deletion likely causes a frameshift mutation. A frameshift early in the exon would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon before the original TGA. This would result in a truncated, non-functional protein.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMutant 4's deletion-induced frameshift is the most likely to introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the protein structure sufficiently to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAnswer: D",

The problem is that the original gene produces this compound, so we want to disrupt it. The mutants have changes in the first exon. \n\nFirst, I remember that exons are the coding regions, so mutations there could affect the protein. Since it's a drought-resistant cultivar but the gene causes an anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to stop the gene from functioning. So we need a mutation that either stops transcription early, prevents proper splicing, or causes a non-functional protein. \n\nLooking at the sequences, let's compare each mutant to the original. The original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA. \n\nMutant 1: The original sequence at the start is ATGTTT... but Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTA...

The mutant 1's sequence here is TTTCTA CGCTGG. Wait, perhaps I should check each base step by step.

Wait, maybe the original's 7th base (position 7) is C, then T (position 8?), then C (position9?), etc. Maybe I need to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for where the mutations are introduced. Let's see each mutant's sequence compared to the original.\n\nThe question states that the mutations are \"at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\".\n\nLet's look at each mutant's altered regions:\n\nMutant 1:\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTG...\nMutant1 has CTACGCT... Wait, perhaps at position 7, the original was C, then T, then C, then G? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first difference is at a certain position. Let me compare each mutant's first part.\n\nOriginal first exon starts with:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1's first part:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, so comparing the original and Mutant1:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions 1-6):\n\nOriginal next: CTCGCTG... \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGCT...\n\nWait the difference must be in the next few bases. Let's see:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions 1-6):\n\nThe next 6 bases are CTCGCT (positions 7-12: C T C G C T? Let's count:\n\nOriginal's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nThe next letters are C T C G C T G? Let me see:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter the first 6 (ATGTTT), the next letters are:\n\nC T C G C T G G T A C T... \n\nWait, let's take the next few letters after ATGTTT:\n\nThe original sequence from position 7 onward is:\n\nC T C G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWait, so the next 6 letters after the first 6 (positions 7-12) are C T C G C T. \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is:\n\nC T A C G C T...\n\nWait, so at position 7: C (same as original)\nPosition 8: T (original has T here? Wait original at position 8 is the 8th base. Let's count again:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nPositions 1-6: ATGTTT (so 6 bases)\n\nPosition 7: C (from the next part, the first letter after ATGTTT is C)\nPosition8: T (next)\nPosition9: C\nPosition10: G\nPosition11: C\nPosition12: T\nPosition13: G (so the G in GGTACT...)\n\nNow looking at Mutant1's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nThe next part is CTACGCT... So:\n\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (same)\nPosition9: A (original was C here)\nPosition10: C (original was G here)\nPosition11: G (original had C here)\nPosition12: C (original had T here)\nWait, that's a lot of changes. Wait maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT is \"CTCGCTGG...\" \n\nMutant1's sequence here is \"CTACGCTGG...\"\n\nSo the original sequence from positions 7-12 (after the first 6) is C T C G C T \n\nMutant1 has C T A C G C \n\nSo at position 9 (the third letter after the first 6), original was C, mutant1 has A. Position10: original G vs mutant C? Wait:\n\nWait let's write the exact letters:\n\nOriginal: positions 7-12 (after ATGTTT):\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\nMutant1's sequence here is:\n\npositions7: C (same)\n\n8: T (same)\n\n9: A (mutation here: original C \u2192 A?)\n\n10: C (original was G \u2192 so mutation here is G\u2192C?)\n\n11: G (original was C \u2192 C\u2192G?)\n\n12: C (original was T \u2192 T\u2192C?)\n\nWait this seems like multiple changes. But perhaps the question is that each mutant has a single mutation? Or maybe each has a few. Wait the problem says \"some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\". So each mutant could have multiple changes. \n\nWait, but the options are to choose which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. So the best approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), or a frameshift, or disrupts a critical part of the gene.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutation is in a splice site, but since it's in the first exon, which doesn't have an intron before it (since first exon is before the first intron), so the first exon's introns start after. Wait the gene has five exons and four introns, so the first exon is followed by an intron, then exon2 etc. So the first exon's sequence is part of the coding region, so mutations there can affect the protein.\n\nLooking for a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would be best because it would truncate the protein early, making it non-functional. \n\nLet me check each mutant for such a mutation.\n\nAlternatively, frameshift mutations (insertion/deletion) would also disrupt the reading frame, but EMS typically causes point mutations (single base changes), so frameshifts would be caused by a single base insertion or deletion, but the question says they used EMS which usually causes point mutations (like base substitutions). So the mutations here are substitutions, not indels. \n\nSo looking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nFirst, let's see the original sequence's first part. The first exon starts with the start codon ATG (positions 1-3). Then the rest of the exon's coding sequence follows. \n\nThe key is to see which mutation introduces a stop codon early, or a frameshift (if any), or a missense mutation that's critical.\n\nLooking at each mutant's first exon sequence.\n\nMutant 1:\n\nOriginal first part (up to the changed region):\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1 has at positions 9, 10, etc., as above. Let's see the codons.\n\nWait perhaps it's better to look for the earliest possible stop codon. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider that the gene's coding sequence is the first exon (since it's part of the first exon). The first exon is coding, so mutations in its sequence can lead to early stop codons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutations cause a frameshift. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in Mutant 1, the substitution at position 9 (C\u2192A) would change the codon. Let's see the codons.\n\nLet me try to break the original sequence into codons (triplets) starting from the ATG:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG (start) TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTCT ... \n\nWait let's parse the original's first part into codons:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 4 onwards):\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, maybe better to list all codons step by step:\n\nOriginal first exon's mRNA (since the DNA is written as 5' to 3', the mRNA is the same as DNA here since it's the coding strand? Or maybe complementary. Wait, the DNA is written as 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be transcribed as complementary, but the gene's exons are the coding regions. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to treat the DNA as the coding strand for simplicity here. So the codons are read as triplets from the DNA sequence given.\n\nStarting from the start codon ATG (positions 1-3):\n\nNext codons:\n\npositions 4-6: TTT (third codon)\n\npositions 7-9: CTC (fourth codon)\n\npositions 10-12: GCT (fifth)\n\npositions13-15: GGT (6th)\n\npositions16-18: ACT (7th)\n\npositions19-21: TCT (8th)\n\npositions22-24: GTG (9th)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (10th)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (11th)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (12th)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (13th)\n\npositions37-39: ATT (14th)\n\npositions40-42: GTCT (wait, but that's four bases; perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's count properly.\n\nWait the original sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions 1-3)\n\nThen:\n\nTTT (positions 4-6)\n\nCTC (7-9)\n\nGCT (10-12)\n\nGGT (13-15)\n\nACT (16-18)\n\nTCT (19-21)\n\nGTG (22-24)\n\nGAT (25-27)\n\nGAA (28-30)\n\nCAT (31-33)\n\nATT (34-36)\n\nATT (37-39)\n\nATT (wait, the next part is ATTGTCGT... so maybe after that:\n\npositions 40-42: GTCT (Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last part is ATTGTCT... so perhaps I need to do this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the first few codons where the mutations occur.\n\nMutant1's first exon sequence:\n\nOriginal first part up to where they differ:\n\nOriginal first few codons after ATG:\n\nATG, TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, ATT...\n\nMutant1's sequence has changes starting at position 9 (the fourth codon, CTC becomes CTA? Wait let me see:\n\nIn Mutant1's first part, after ATGTTT (positions 1-6), the next part is CTACGCTGG...\n\nWait the fourth codon (positions 7-9) in the original is CTC (CTC). In Mutant1, the sequence is CTA (positions7-9: C T A). Wait:\n\nOriginal codons 4 (positions7-9) is CTC \u2192 becomes CTA in Mutant1.\n\nSo codon 4 changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu also? Because CTC is Leu (CTX is Leu), CTA is also Leu (since CTN is Leu). So that's a silent mutation? Not a problem.\n\nWait but then the next codon (positions10-12 in the original was GCT (Ala). In Mutant1, after CTA (positions7-9), the next bases are C G C (positions10-12). Wait:\n\nWait the next codon (positions10-12 in mutant1 would be positions 10-12 in the DNA sequence. Wait, the mutant's sequence after the first 9 bases (positions1-9: ATGTTTCTA) would then be CGCTGGT... So positions 10-12 are C G C \u2192 CGC (Arg), whereas original was GCT (Ala). So that's a missense mutation: Ala \u2192 Arg.\n\nHmm, so that's changing an amino acid. Not a stop.\n\nContinuing, the next codon in original was GGT (Gly), but in mutant1, after the CGC, the next codon would be TGG (since the next bases after CGC are TGG). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon (TAG, TAA, TGA) early in the sequence.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nLet's check each mutant's first exon for a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) before the original stop codon (which is at the end, as the original ends with ...TGA-3').\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe mutant's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLooking for TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding region (from ATG onwards). Let's see the first part:\n\nThe sequence up to where it differs is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking for stop codons. Let's parse the codons:\n\nStarting with ATG (start), then:\n\nTTT (codon1)\n\nCTA (codon2, since original's next codon was CTC but mutant1 has CTA at positions7-9)\n\nWait wait, maybe I need to re-express the mutant's sequence as codons.\n\nMutant1's DNA sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nTTT (positions4-6)\n\nCTA (7-9)\n\nCGC (10-12)\n\nTGG (13-15)\n\nTAC (16-18)\n\nTTC (19-21)\n\nTGT (22-24)\n\nGGA (25-27)\n\nTGA (28-30)\n\nWait, hold on. Let's parse step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4-6: T T T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\nPosition7-9: C T A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nPosition10-12: C G C \u2192 CGC (codon3)\n\nPosition13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\nPosition16-18: T A C \u2192 TAC (codon5)\n\nPosition19-21: T T C \u2192 TTC (codon6)\n\nPosition22-24: T G T \u2192 TGT (codon7)\n\nPosition25-27: G G A \u2192 GGA (codon8)\n\nPosition28-30: T G A \u2192 TGA (codon9)\n\nAh! Here's a stop codon at position28-30 (TGA), which is much earlier than the original's stop codon (which is at the end). So in Mutant1, there's a premature stop codon introduced at codon9. That would truncate the protein early, likely making it non-functional. So this mutation could eliminate the compound.\n\nWait but let me check if I parsed correctly. Let me count again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into triplets:\n\nStarting from position4:\n\n1. TTT (4-6)\n\n2. CTA (7-9)\n\n3. CGC (10-12)\n\n4. TGG (13-15)\n\n5. TAC (16-18)\n\n6. TTC (19-21)\n\n7. TGT (22-24)\n\n8. GGA (25-27)\n\n9. TGA (28-30)\n\nYes, so codon9 is TGA, a stop. The original's stop codon is at the end (the last three bases written as ...TGA-3'). So in the mutant1, the stop is introduced early. That would stop translation early, leading to a truncated protein, likely non-functional. So this could be the answer (option C is mutant1).\n\nWait but let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nMutant2:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLet's parse its codons after ATG:\n\nOriginal starts with TTT, then in mutant2:\n\nThe sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\n1. TTT (4-6)\n\n2. CTA (7-9)\n\n3. AGC (10-12)\n\n4. TGG (13-15) [Wait let's see:\n\nWait the next triplet after CTA (positions7-9) is positions10-12:\n\nThe next bases after CTA are A G C \u2192 AGC (codon3)\n\nThen positions13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\nThen TAC (codon5), etc.\n\nLooking for stop codons. Let's continue:\n\nCodons:\n\n1: TTT (Phe)\n\n2: CTA (Leu)\n\n3: AGC (Ser)\n\n4: TGG (Trp)\n\n5: TAC (Tyr)\n\n6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7: TGT (Cys)\n\n8: GGA (Gly)\n\n9: TGA (Stop) \u2014 same as mutant1?\n\nWait no, let me parse again:\n\nWait in mutant2's sequence after the first 9 bases (positions7-9 as CTA), then the next bases are A G C T G G... So after CTA (positions7-9):\n\nPositions10-12: A G C \u2192 AGC (codon3)\n\nThen positions13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: T A C \u2192 TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: T T C \u2192 TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: T G T \u2192 TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: G G A \u2192 GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: T G A \u2192 TGA (codon9)\n\nSame as mutant1: the TGA stop codon appears at the same position (codon9). Wait, but wait, the original sequence's stop codon is at the end, so in both mutant1 and mutant2, there's a premature stop at codon9? That would mean both could be candidates. But perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the original's sequence is written as ending with ...TGA, but in the original's case, that's the end. So in the mutant's sequence, if the TGA comes early, then that's a premature stop. So both mutant1 and mutant2 have a premature stop codon here. Hmm, but the options are A-D, so perhaps I made an error.\n\nWait let me re-examine mutant2's DNA sequence:\n\nMutant2's first part is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next part is:\n\nCTA AGC TGG TAC T... \n\nWait the sequence is:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6):\n\nNext bases: C T A (positions7-9 \u2192 CTA)\n\nThen A G C (positions10-12 \u2192 AGC)\n\nThen T G G (positions13-15 \u2192 TGG)\n\nThen T A C (positions16-18 \u2192 TAC)\n\nSame as before. So the TGA stop is at position28-30 (codon9) in both mutant1 and mutant2. But the options are A (mutant2), B (mutant3), C (mutant1), D (mutant4). So if both mutant1 and mutant2 have this, then perhaps I need to check if I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe the original sequence's stop codon is further along. Let me check the original's codon structure.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTCT...\n\nWait the original's stop codon is written as ending with TGA, so in the original's sequence, the TGA is at the end. The original's sequence before the TGA would have the coding sequence continuing until then. So in the mutants, if their sequence has TGA early, that's a premature stop.\n\nSo both mutant1 and mutant2 have a TGA at codon9 (positions28-30), which would truncate the protein early. However, maybe I need to check if that TGA is actually part of the original's sequence?\n\nWait, the original's sequence is:\n\nOriginal's first part up to that point:\n\nAfter ATG, the sequence is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA\n\nWait let's see the original's codons around that area. Let me parse the original's codons:\n\nOriginal's codons after ATG:\n\n1: TTT (4-6)\n\n2: CTC (7-9)\n\n3: GCT (10-12)\n\n4: GGT (13-15)\n\n5: ACT (16-18)\n\n6: TCT (19-21)\n\n7: GTG (22-24)\n\n8: GAT (25-27)\n\n9: GAA (28-30)\n\nWait, so in the original, codon9 (positions28-30) is GAA (Glu), not TGA. So in the mutants 1 and 2, the 9th codon becomes TGA (stop). That's a premature stop. So both mutants1 and 2 have this. But the options include A (mutant2) and C (mutant1) as possible answers. \n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the mutant sequences.\n\nWait in mutant1's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nAfter codon8 (positions25-27 in mutant1 would be GGA?), then codon9 (positions28-30) is TGA. Let me see the mutant1's sequence again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after the part I considered up to TGA:\n\nThe original's sequence after the first part is continuing, but in mutant1's case, after the TGA at position28-30, does the sequence continue? Or is that the stop?\n\nWait the problem states that the gene's sequence in the mutant is sequenced, so the full gene is there. But in mutant1, the TGA occurs early, so the protein would stop there. So that's a good candidate.\n\nNow, mutant2's sequence also has TGA at the same position. But why are they different options?\n\nWait perhaps I made an error in the parsing. Let me check mutant2 again:\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, the sequence after ATGTTT is CTAA GCTG...\n\nWait the first codons:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nSame as mutant1. So both have the TGA stop. So why are they different options?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutant's sequence. Let me look again at the original and mutant2's sequences.\n\nOriginal first exon starts with:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\n\nMutant2 is:\n\nATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA\n\nWait, after ATGTTT (the first 6 bases), the next part in the original is \"CTCGCTGG...\" \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATGTTT is \"CTAAGCTGG...\" \n\nSo the difference is that the original's 7th base (after ATGTTT) is C (making the first codon after TTT as CTC), but mutant2 has CTA (positions7-9: CTA), then the next is AGC (from A G C in positions10-12), so the TGA comes at the same position as mutant1. \n\nWait but then why are both options A and C present? The question must have a unique answer. Perhaps I made an error in parsing another mutant.\n\nLet me check mutant3 and 4 to see if any of them have a better option.\n\nMutant3:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG... \n\nMutant3's sequence starts as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo the first few bases after ATG are TTTTACGCTGG...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nposition7-9: TAC (original had CTC at positions7-9 (CTC))\n\nWait:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9 (after ATGTTT) are CTC.\n\nMutant3 has positions7-9 as TAC (since after TTT comes TAC).\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9) is TAC (Tyr), whereas original was CTC (Leu).\n\nContinuing:\n\npositions10-12: GCT (same as original's GCT in codon3?)\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after TAC is GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, so codons after that would be:\n\ncodon3: GCT (Ala)\n\ncodon4: GGT (Gly)\n\ncodon5: TGT (Cys)\n\ncodon6: ACA (Thr)\n\n... and so on.\n\nLooking for a stop codon here: The TGA is at the end, so no early stop. The mutations here may cause missense but not a premature stop. So mutant3's protein might still be functional.\n\nMutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant4's sequence starts as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo after ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next bases are TAC GCT ACTTCT...\n\nBreaking down codons:\n\npositions7-9: TAC (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: GAT (codon7)\n\netc.\n\nSo no stop codon early here. The TGA is at the end. So mutant4's gene would produce the full-length protein? Or perhaps a frameshift?\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion or insertion, but since EMS usually causes point mutations, it's a substitution. Let me see if there's any stop codon.\n\nLooking at the first few codons:\n\ncodon2: TAC (Tyr)\n\ncodon3: GCT (Ala)\n\ncodon4: ACT (Thr)\n\ncodon5: TCT (Ser)\n\ncodon6: GTG (Val)\n\ncodon7: GAT (Asp)\n\nNo stop codons early. So mutant4's gene might still be functional.\n\nSo back to mutants1 and 2. Both introduce a premature stop codon at the same position. But why are they separate options?\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement: the original gene's sequence ends with TGA, so in the mutants, if their sequences have TGA earlier, then the protein would stop there. \n\nBut in mutant3 and 4, there is no premature stop, so they might still produce the compound. \n\nThe question is which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". The best would be a nonsense mutation leading to premature stop. So both mutant1 and 2 have this. But the options include both A (mutant2) and C (mutant1). \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the parsing of mutant2's sequence. Let me re-express mutant2's codons again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nYes, so codon9 is TGA. \n\nBut in mutant1, the sequence after that would have the rest of the codons. But the TGA is the stop, so the protein is truncated here. \n\nWait the problem is to choose between mutants1 and 2. The options include both. But perhaps I made a mistake in the original's codon structure.\n\nWait let me check the original's codon9 (positions28-30):\n\nOriginal's sequence after the first part:\n\nThe original's codons after ATG:\n\ncodon1: TTT (4-6)\n\ncodon2: CTC (7-9)\n\ncodon3: GCT (10-12)\n\ncodon4: GGT (13-15)\n\ncodon5: ACT (16-18)\n\ncodon6: TCT (19-21)\n\ncodon7: GTG (22-24)\n\ncodon8: GAT (25-27)\n\ncodon9: GAA (28-30)\n\ncodon10: CAT (31-33)\n\ncodon11: ATT (34-36)\n\ncodon12: ATT (37-39)\n\ncodon13: ATT (38-40? Not sure)\n\nThe original's stop codon is at the end, so codon9 (positions28-30) is GAA (Glu), not a stop. So both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop at codon9 (positions28-30). \n\nTherefore, both would be candidates. But since the options are separate, perhaps there's another factor.\n\nWait looking at the options, maybe one of them actually has a frameshift?\n\nWait, perhaps in mutant2, after the TGA stop, the sequence continues, but since the stop is early, the rest would not be translated. So both are good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the codons for mutant2. Let me check again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait the part after the TGA (positions28-30) is followed by AAC... but since translation stops at TGA, it doesn't matter. \n\nWait perhaps the difference is that in mutant1's sequence after the TGA, there are more bases, but the stop is still effective. So both mutations would work. But the options must have one correct answer. \n\nWait let me look back at the problem's options. The options are A (mutant2), B (mutant3), C (mutant1), D (mutant4). The question is which would most probably eliminate the compound. \n\nAssuming both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop codon, but the question might have a typo or I might have an error. Let me check the mutant sequences again for any other differences.\n\nWait, mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC\u2026TGA, whereas mutant2's ends with ...GTCGC\u2026TGA. The difference between them is in the earlier parts. \n\nWait looking at the first few bases after the stop codon, but since the stop is at codon9, the rest is irrelevant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the mutant's sequence. Let me check the original and mutant2's sequences again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after the first part:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2 is: TTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo between the original and mutant2:\n\nThe original after ATGTTT (positions1-6) is CTCGCTGG... \n\nMutant2 has CTAAGCTGG... \n\nThe difference is that instead of CTCGCT (positions7-12), it's CTAAGC (positions7-12). So the changes are multiple substitutions. \n\nBut the key is the stop codon. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TGA in mutant1 and 2 is actually a mutation in a different position. Wait in mutant1's case, the TGA is at positions28-30, but in the original's codon9 is GAA. \n\nSo both mutations introduce a premature stop, making the protein non-functional. So either mutant1 or 2 could be correct. \n\nBut the options are A (mutant2) and C (mutant1). The question must have one correct answer. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the codon numbering. Let me re-express mutant1's codons again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\n1: TTT (positions4-6)\n\n2: CTA (7-9)\n\n3: CGC (10-12)\n\n4: TGG (13-15)\n\n5: TAC (16-18)\n\n6: TTC (19-21)\n\n7: TGT (22-24)\n\n8: GGA (25-27)\n\n9: TGA (28-30)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nIn mutant2's case:\n\ncodon3 is AGC (positions10-12) instead of CGC, but the stop codon is still at codon9. \n\nSo both are the same in terms of introducing a stop. \n\nWait the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the other options again.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\nThe first few codons after ATG are:\n\ncodon1: TTT (same)\n\ncodon2: TAC (different from original's CTC)\n\ncodon3: GCT (same as original's GCT?)\n\nWait original's codon3 was GCT (positions10-12: GCT). So mutant3's codon3 is same here. But codon2 is TAC instead of CTC (original). So that's a missense, but no stop.\n\nMutant4's first codons:\n\ncodon1: TTT (same)\n\ncodon2: TAC (since mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACT...)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (so codon2 is TAC, different from original's CTC). \n\ncodon3: GCT (same as original's codon3)\n\ncodon4: ACT (since positions13-15 are ACT)\n\nOriginal's codon4 was GGT. So this is a change here (GGT\u2192ACT), which is a frameshift? Wait no, it's a substitution of three bases. \n\nWait positions13-15 in mutant4 are ACT, whereas original was GGT. So that's a change of GGT to ACT. So that would change the codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr), a missense, but no stop.\n\nSo both mutant1 and mutant2 introduce a stop. The question's options include both. \n\nWait the original question lists the options as A-D. The options are:\n\nA) Mutant2\n\nB) Mutant3\n\nC) Mutant1\n\nD) Mutant4\n\nThe question is from the user, so maybe in the problem statement, the mutant sequences have different mutations. Let me check again the exact sequences provided:\n\nThe original gene sequence is given as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait let's look at the exact letters between mutant1 and original:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT is CTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant1's sequence here is CTACGCTG...\n\nSo the first difference is at position7: original is C (position7), mutant1 has T? Wait no, let's see:\n\nWait the original's first part after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (6 bases), the next letters are C T C G C T G G...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGCTGG...\n\nSo:\n\nPosition7 (7th base after start):\n\nOriginal's 7th is C (from the original sequence's 7th base after ATG)\n\nMutant1's 7th is T? Wait no, let me write the letters:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions1-6):\n\nPositions7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nPositions7: C (same as original)\n\n8: T (same)\n\n9: A (mutation here, original was C)\n\n10: C (original was G)\n\n11: G (original was C)\n\n12: C (original was T)\n\nSo at position9, original C becomes A in mutant1. \n\nThus, codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (positions7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant1: CTA (C T A)\n\nSo codon2 changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) \u2192 no change in amino acid. So that's a silent mutation. \n\nWait wait, wait! CTA is still CTX, which is Leu. So codon2 is still Leu. So that doesn't introduce a stop. Wait then where does the stop come from?\n\nWait I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express mutant1's codons properly.\n\nMutant1's codons:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2) \u2192 Leu\n\npositions10-12: CGC (codon3) \u2192 Arg (since CGC is Arg)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4) \u2192 Trp\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5) \u2192 Tyr\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6) \u2192 Phe\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7) \u2192 Cys\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8) \u2192 Gly\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9) \u2192 stop\n\nWait, but where is the TGA coming from? In the original sequence, after codon8 (positions25-27), the next bases would be GATGAACAT... \n\nWait perhaps the TGA is part of the mutant's sequence but not the original. Let me look at the mutant's sequence again:\n\nMutant1's sequence ends with \"...TGA-3\u2019\", so the TGA is the stop codon at the end. But the earlier part's codons:\n\npositions28-30: in mutant1's case, after codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next three bases are TGA (positions28-30). \n\nWait how does that happen?\n\nLet me write the entire first part of mutant1's sequence up to that point:\n\nStarting from ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nBreaking down the first 30 bases after ATG:\n\nThe first 30 bases after ATG are:\n\nPositions4-33 (assuming the TGA is at the end):\n\nWait perhaps I need to count precisely:\n\nThe first part of the mutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nLet's count the first 30 bases after the ATG:\n\nPositions 4-33 (30 bases):\n\n1-3 (after ATG): TTT (positions4-6)\n\n4-6: T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) \u2192 codon2: TAC (positions7-9?)\n\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me write all the first 30 bases:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A\n\n10: C\n\n11: G\n\n12: C\n\n13: T\n\n14: G\n\n15: G\n\n16: T\n\n17: A\n\n18: C\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T\n\n22: C\n\n23: T\n\n24: G\n\n25: T\n\n26: G\n\n27: G\n\n28: A\n\n29: T\n\n30: G\n\nWait this is getting too time-consuming, but perhaps the key is that in mutant1, there's a premature stop codon at position28-30 (TGA), whereas in the original, those positions are GAA (Glu). \n\nTherefore, mutant1 introduces a stop codon early. \n\nBut earlier I thought mutant2 does the same, but let's recheck mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nThe first 30 bases after ATG:\n\npositions4-33:\n\n4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\n7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\n10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\n13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\n16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\n19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\n22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\n25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\n28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nYes, so both mutant1 and 2 have the TGA stop at codon9. \n\nBut the problem lists them as separate options. Since the question is from the user, maybe I made an error in assuming both have it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stop codon in mutant2 is not there. Let me count the positions for mutant2's TGA.\n\nWait in mutant2's sequence, after codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next bases are TGA (positions28-30). So that's a stop. \n\nSo both mutants1 and 2 introduce a premature stop. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the problem's options, perhaps there's a difference in the rest of the sequence. For example, in mutant1, after the stop codon, there's a G instead of a T? \n\nWait the mutant1's sequence ends with \"...TCGC\u2026TGA\", whereas the original ends with \"...TCGT\u2026TGA\". The last letters before the TGA in mutant1 are GTCGC, whereas original has GTCTG. \n\nBut that doesn't affect the stop codon's presence. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first part of mutant2's sequence. \n\nWait looking back, the original's first part is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant2's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThe difference between original and mutant2 is at positions7-9 and 10-12.\n\nOriginal at positions7-9: CTC (codon2)\n\nMutant2 has CTA (positions7-9) \u2192 codon2: CTA (Leu), then positions10-12 are AGC (AGC is Ser).\n\nSo codon3 is AGC (Ser), whereas original's codon3 was GCT (Ala). \n\nBut the stop codon is still introduced at position28-30. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and 2 have the TGA stop. \n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Since the options are given, and the question is from the user, perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C), and I made an error in considering mutant2. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutant2's sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's mutant1 has a frameshift. \n\nWait, in mutant1, after the first few codons, the sequence might have a frameshift? \n\nWait no, all mutations are substitutions, not indels, so the reading frame is maintained. \n\nSo both mutants1 and2 introduce a stop codon early, making the protein non-functional. \n\nIf both are correct, but the options are A and C, the user might have intended one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant2, the TGA is not actually there. \n\nWait let me re-express mutant2's codon9:\n\npositions28-30 in mutant2:\n\npositions28: T\n\n29: G\n\n30: A \u2192 TGA (stop)\n\nYes. \n\nHmm. Since both are valid, but the options include both, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. \n\nWait looking back, the original's first exon has five exons and four introns. The first exon is the first one, so any mutation in the first exon's coding region would affect the protein. \n\nThe question asks which mutation will \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". The best option is the one that introduces a premature stop codon. Both mutants1 and 2 do that. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon count. Let me try to find the difference between mutant1 and 2.\n\nIn mutant1's first part, after the stop codon (positions28-30), the next codon would be... but the translation stops there. \n\nIn mutant2, similarly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TGA in mutant1 is actually part of the original sequence? \n\nNo, the original's sequence ends with TGA, but the stop is at the end. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and2 are candidates. \n\nBut the options are A and C. The problem might have a typo, but I'll have to choose between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is mutant1 (option C), and I made an error in mutant2's analysis. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other options. \n\nMutant3 and4 don't introduce stop. \n\nThe question says \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". Either mutant1 or 2 would do that. \n\nIf I must choose between them, perhaps the first one listed (mutant1) is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon count for mutant1. \n\nWait in mutant1's sequence after the first few codons:\n\ncodon9 is TGA (positions28-30). \n\nBut in the original's sequence, positions28-30 are GAA (Glu). So mutant1 changes GAA to TGA. \n\nHow? Let's see the original's bases at positions28-30:\n\nOriginal sequence's codon8 is positions25-27: GAT (Glu?) Wait no, let me recount:\n\nWait the original's codons:\n\ncodon8: positions25-27: GAT \u2192 Asp (GAT is Asp)\n\ncodon9: positions28-30: GAA \u2192 Glu (GAA)\n\nSo in mutant1's sequence, positions28-30 are TGA (stop). \n\nTo get that, the original's GAA (positions28-30) must have been changed to TGA. \n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence, after the codons up to codon8 (positions25-27: GGA?), then positions28-30 are TGA. \n\nWait in the mutant's sequence, the bases at positions28-30 are TGA. \n\nThe original's bases there were GAA. \n\nSo the mutation here is changing GAA to TGA. \n\nBut how does that happen? \n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence:\n\nAfter codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next three bases are TGA. \n\nTo get TGA instead of GAA, the mutation must be at position28 (from G to T) and position30 (from A to A? No). \n\nWait the original's bases at positions28-30 are G (position28), A (29), A (30) \u2192 GAA. \n\nMutant1 has T (position28), G (29), A (30) \u2192 TGA. \n\nSo the mutations here are:\n\nposition28: G\u2192T \n\nposition29: A\u2192G \n\nposition30 remains A. \n\nSo three bases changed? But EMS is a point mutagen, so it's likely a single base change. \n\nWait but in the mutant sequences provided, the changes are multiple. \n\nThe problem states that the mutants were generated with EMS, which typically causes single base substitutions. However, the question says that in the first exon area, there are \"some changes\" \u2014 perhaps multiple substitutions. \n\nAssuming that the changes in the first exon are due to EMS, which can cause multiple mutations in a region, but the key is whether the mutation results in a stop codon. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and2 introduce a stop codon early, so they are both valid. \n\nBut the options are separate. Perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in considering mutant2's codons. \n\nWait, let me look again at mutant2's codon9:\n\npositions28-30 in mutant2 are TGA (stop), which requires changing the original GAA to TGA. \n\nSo that requires changing the first G to T and the second A to G. \n\nTwo point mutations. \n\nMutant1's TGA would also require two changes. \n\nSo both require two mutations. \n\nThe question says \"some changes\", so both are possible. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the first correct one listed is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem's sequences, maybe I made a mistake in mutant2's sequence. \n\nWait mutant2's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThe part before TGA includes \"GGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait perhaps the TGA is part of the \"GGATGA...\" sequence. \n\nThe codons around there:\n\npositions25-27: GGA (Gly)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (stop)\n\nYes. \n\nThus, both mutants introduce a stop. \n\nThe options must have one correct answer. Given that the first one (mutant1) is an option C, I'll choose that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4, but that doesn't have a stop. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon numbering. \n\nWait, perhaps the premature stop in mutant1 is earlier than in mutant2. \n\nWait, in mutant1's codon9 is TGA (position28-30), which is the same as mutant2. \n\nSo no difference there. \n\nGiven that both are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps the answer is mutant1 (option C), as it's the first one listed. \n\nAlternatively, I might have made a mistake in the analysis of mutant3 or 4. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence has a change in the first exon that could introduce a frameshift. \n\nWait, mutant3's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLooking at the first part after ATG:\n\nTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nThe difference from the original is an extra T after TTT, making the sequence TTTTACGCT... \n\nWait the original after ATG is TTTCTC... so mutant3's first few bases are TTTTAC... which is an insertion? No, it's a substitution. \n\nWait the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant3 has TTTTACGCTGG...\n\nSo the first difference is inserting an extra T? No, it's a substitution. \n\nThe first 6 bases are ATGTTT (same as original), then the next bases:\n\nOriginal: CTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant3: TTACGCTG...\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. \n\nGiven that both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop codon, but the options include them, I'll assume the answer is mutant1 (option C), so the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation).\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n- **Mutant 1**:\n  - The sequence shows a change at positions 7-9 from **CTC** (Leu) to **CTA** (still Leu, silent mutation).\n  - Further downstream, the codon at positions 28-30 changes from **GAA** (Glu) in the original to **TGA** (stop codon). This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein early, likely rendering it non-functional.\n\n- **Mutant 2**:\n  - The sequence shows changes leading to the same premature stop codon **TGA** at positions 28-30, similar to Mutant 1. This also disrupts the protein.\n\n- **Mutant 3** and **Mutant 4**:\n  - Neither introduces a premature stop codon. Their mutations result in missense changes but do not truncate the protein, so they are less likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBoth Mutant 1 and Mutant 2 introduce a premature stop codon.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these mutants would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene in question has five exons and four introns. The problem is that the original gene produces this compound, so we want to disrupt it. The mutants have changes in the first exon. \n\nFirst, I remember that exons are the coding regions, so mutations there could affect the protein. Since it's a drought-resistant cultivar but the gene causes an anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to stop the gene from functioning. So we need a mutation that either stops transcription early, prevents proper splicing, or causes a non-functional protein. \n\nLooking at the sequences, let's compare each mutant to the original.

Let me recount:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 4 to 12):\n\npositions 4: T (4th base)\n5: T (5)\n6: T (6)\n7: C (7)\n8: T (8)\n9: C (9)\n10: G (10)\n11: C (11)\n12: T (12)\nWait, so original at position 9 is C. \n\nNow Mutant 1 at position 9: Let's look:\n\nMutant1's sequence up to that point is:\n\nAfter ATG: T T T C T (positions 4-8: same as original)\nPosition 9 in Mutant1: The next base. Let's see:\n\nOriginal at position 9 is C (from the original sequence's 9th position after ATG). \n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence: The part after the first 6 bases (ATGTTT) is TCTACGCT... Wait maybe I should parse the first part carefully.\n\nWait the original starts as:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down the first part after ATG:\n\nATGTTT (positions 1-6), then the next part is CT C GCT GGTACT... Wait, maybe the original's 7th base (position 7) is C, then T (position 8?), then C (position9?), etc. Maybe I need to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for where the mutations are introduced. Let's see each mutant's sequence compared to the original.\n\nThe question states that the mutations are \"at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\".\n\nLet's look at each mutant's altered regions:\n\nMutant 1:\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTG...\nMutant1 has CTACGCT... Wait, perhaps at position 7, the original was C, then T, then C, then G? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first difference is at a certain position. Let me compare each mutant's first part.\n\nOriginal first exon starts with:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1's first part:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, so comparing the original and Mutant1:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions 1-6):\n\nOriginal next: CTCGCTG... \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGCT...\n\nWait the difference must be in the next few bases. Let's see:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions 1-6):\n\nThe next 6 bases are CTCGCT (positions 7-12: C T C G C T? Let's count:\n\nOriginal's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nThe next letters are C T C G C T G? Let me see:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter the first 6 (ATGTTT), the next letters are:\n\nC T C G C T G G T A C T... \n\nWait, let's take the next few letters after ATGTTT:\n\nThe original sequence from position 7 onward is:\n\nC T C G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWait, so the next 6 letters after the first 6 (positions 7-12) are C T C G C T. \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is:\n\nC T A C G C T...\n\nWait, so at position 7: C (same as original)\nPosition 8: T (original has T here? Wait original at position 8 is the 8th base. Let's count again:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nPositions 1-6: ATGTTT (so 6 bases)\n\nPosition 7: C (from the next part, the first letter after ATGTTT is C)\nPosition8: T (next)\nPosition9: C\nPosition10: G\nPosition11: C\nPosition12: T\nPosition13: G (so the G in GGTACT...)\n\nNow looking at Mutant1's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nThe next part is CTACGCT... So:\n\nPosition7: C (same as original)\nPosition8: T (same)\nPosition9: A (original was C here)\nPosition10: C (original was G here)\nPosition11: G (original had C here)\nPosition12: C (original had T here)\nWait, that's a lot of changes. Wait maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT is \"CTCGCTGG...\" \n\nMutant1's sequence here is \"CTACGCTGG...\"\n\nSo the original sequence from positions 7-12 (after the first 6) is C T C G C T \n\nMutant1 has C T A C G C \n\nSo at position 9 (the third letter after the first 6), original was C, mutant1 has A. Position10: original G vs mutant C? Wait:\n\nWait let's write the exact letters:\n\nOriginal: positions 7-12 (after ATGTTT):\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\nMutant1's sequence here is:\n\npositions7: C (same)\n\n8: T (same)\n\n9: A (mutation here: original C \u2192 A?)\n\n10: C (original was G \u2192 so mutation here is G\u2192C?)\n\n11: G (original was C \u2192 C\u2192G?)\n\n12: C (original was T \u2192 T\u2192C?)\n\nWait this seems like multiple changes. But perhaps the question is that each mutant has a single mutation? Or maybe each has a few. Wait the problem says \"some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\". So each mutant could have multiple changes. \n\nWait, but the options are to choose which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. So the best approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), or a frameshift, or disrupts a critical part of the gene.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutation is in a splice site, but since it's in the first exon, which doesn't have an intron before it (since first exon is before the first intron), so the first exon's introns start after. Wait the gene has five exons and four introns, so the first exon is followed by an intron, then exon2 etc. So the first exon's sequence is part of the coding region, so mutations there can affect the protein.\n\nLooking for a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would be best because it would truncate the protein early, making it non-functional. \n\nLet me check each mutant for such a mutation.\n\nAlternatively, frameshift mutations (insertion/deletion) would also disrupt the reading frame, but EMS typically causes point mutations (single base changes), so frameshifts would be caused by a single base insertion or deletion, but the question says they used EMS which usually causes point mutations (like base substitutions). So the mutations here are substitutions, not indels. \n\nSo looking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nFirst, let's see the original sequence's first part. The first exon starts with the start codon ATG (positions 1-3). Then the rest of the exon's coding sequence follows. \n\nThe key is to see which mutation introduces a stop codon early, or a frameshift (if any), or a missense mutation that's critical.\n\nLooking at each mutant's first exon sequence.\n\nMutant 1:\n\nOriginal first part (up to the changed region):\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1 has at positions 9, 10, etc., as above. Let's see the codons.\n\nWait perhaps it's better to look for the earliest possible stop codon. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider that the gene's coding sequence is the first exon (since it's part of the first exon). The first exon is coding, so mutations in its sequence can lead to early stop codons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutations cause a frameshift. Let's see:\n\nSuppose in Mutant 1, the substitution at position 9 (C\u2192A) would change the codon. Let's see the codons.\n\nLet me try to break the original sequence into codons (triplets) starting from the ATG:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG (start) TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTCT ... \n\nWait let's parse the original's first part into codons:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG (positions 4 onwards):\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, maybe better to list all codons step by step:\n\nOriginal first exon's mRNA (since the DNA is written as 5' to 3', the mRNA is the same as DNA here since it's the coding strand? Or maybe complementary. Wait, the DNA is written as 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be transcribed as complementary, but the gene's exons are the coding regions. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to treat the DNA as the coding strand for simplicity here. So the codons are read as triplets from the DNA sequence given.\n\nStarting from the start codon ATG (positions 1-3):\n\nNext codons:\n\npositions 4-6: TTT (third codon)\n\npositions 7-9: CTC (fourth codon)\n\npositions 10-12: GCT (fifth)\n\npositions13-15: GGT (6th)\n\npositions16-18: ACT (7th)\n\npositions19-21: TCT (8th)\n\npositions22-24: GTG (9th)\n\npositions25-27: GAT (10th)\n\npositions28-30: GAA (11th)\n\npositions31-33: CAT (12th)\n\npositions34-36: ATT (13th)\n\npositions37-39: ATT (14th)\n\npositions40-42: GTCT (wait, but that's four bases; perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's count properly.\n\nWait the original sequence is written as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nStarting with ATG (positions 1-3)\n\nThen:\n\nTTT (positions 4-6)\n\nCTC (7-9)\n\nGCT (10-12)\n\nGGT (13-15)\n\nACT (16-18)\n\nTCT (19-21)\n\nGTG (22-24)\n\nGAT (25-27)\n\nGAA (28-30)\n\nCAT (31-33)\n\nATT (34-36)\n\nATT (37-39)\n\nATT (wait, the next part is ATTGTCGT... so maybe after that:\n\npositions 40-42: GTCT (Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last part is ATTGTCT... so perhaps I need to do this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the first few codons where the mutations occur.\n\nMutant1's first exon sequence:\n\nOriginal first part up to where they differ:\n\nOriginal first few codons after ATG:\n\nATG, TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, ATT...\n\nMutant1's sequence has changes starting at position 9 (the fourth codon, CTC becomes CTA? Wait let me see:\n\nIn Mutant1's first part, after ATGTTT (positions 1-6), the next part is CTACGCTGG...\n\nWait the fourth codon (positions 7-9) in the original is CTC (CTC). In Mutant1, the sequence is CTA (positions7-9: C T A). Wait:\n\nOriginal codons 4 (positions7-9) is CTC \u2192 becomes CTA in Mutant1.\n\nSo codon 4 changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu also? Because CTC is Leu (CTX is Leu), CTA is also Leu (since CTN is Leu). So that's a silent mutation? Not a problem.\n\nWait but then the next codon (positions10-12 in the original was GCT (Ala). In Mutant1, after CTA (positions7-9), the next bases are C G C (positions10-12). Wait:\n\nWait the next codon (positions10-12 in mutant1 would be positions 10-12 in the DNA sequence. Wait, the mutant's sequence after the first 9 bases (positions1-9: ATGTTTCTA) would then be CGCTGGT... So positions 10-12 are C G C \u2192 CGC (Arg), whereas original was GCT (Ala). So that's a missense mutation: Ala \u2192 Arg.\n\nHmm, so that's changing an amino acid. Not a stop.\n\nContinuing, the next codon in original was GGT (Gly), but in mutant1, after the CGC, the next codon would be TGG (since the next bases after CGC are TGG). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon (TAG, TAA, TGA) early in the sequence.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nLet's check each mutant's first exon for a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) before the original stop codon (which is at the end, as the original ends with ...TGA-3').\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe mutant's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLooking for TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding region (from ATG onwards). Let's see the first part:\n\nThe sequence up to where it differs is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking for stop codons. Let's parse the codons:\n\nStarting with ATG (start), then:\n\nTTT (codon1)\n\nCTA (codon2, since original's next codon was CTC but mutant1 has CTA at positions7-9)\n\nWait wait, maybe I need to re-express the mutant's sequence as codons.\n\nMutant1's DNA sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nTTT (positions4-6)\n\nCTA (7-9)\n\nCGC (10-12)\n\nTGG (13-15)\n\nTAC (16-18)\n\nTTC (19-21)\n\nTGT (22-24)\n\nGGA (25-27)\n\nTGA (28-30)\n\nWait, hold on. Let's parse step by step:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\nPosition4-6: T T T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\nPosition7-9: C T A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nPosition10-12: C G C \u2192 CGC (codon3)\n\nPosition13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\nPosition16-18: T A C \u2192 TAC (codon5)\n\nPosition19-21: T T C \u2192 TTC (codon6)\n\nPosition22-24: T G T \u2192 TGT (codon7)\n\nPosition25-27: G G A \u2192 GGA (codon8)\n\nPosition28-30: T G A \u2192 TGA (codon9)\n\nAh! Here's a stop codon at position28-30 (TGA), which is much earlier than the original's stop codon (which is at the end). So in Mutant1, there's a premature stop codon introduced at codon9. That would truncate the protein early, likely making it non-functional. So this mutation could eliminate the compound.\n\nWait but let me check if I parsed correctly. Let me count again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into triplets:\n\nStarting from position4:\n\n1. TTT (4-6)\n\n2. CTA (7-9)\n\n3. CGC (10-12)\n\n4. TGG (13-15)\n\n5. TAC (16-18)\n\n6. TTC (19-21)\n\n7. TGT (22-24)\n\n8. GGA (25-27)\n\n9. TGA (28-30)\n\nYes, so codon9 is TGA, a stop. The original's stop codon is at the end (the last three bases written as ...TGA-3'). So in the mutant1, the stop is introduced early. That would stop translation early, leading to a truncated protein, likely non-functional. So this could be the answer (option C is mutant1).\n\nWait but let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nMutant2:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLet's parse its codons after ATG:\n\nOriginal starts with TTT, then in mutant2:\n\nThe sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\n1. TTT (4-6)\n\n2. CTA (7-9)\n\n3. AGC (10-12)\n\n4. TGG (13-15) [Wait let's see:\n\nWait the next triplet after CTA (positions7-9) is positions10-12:\n\nThe next bases after CTA are A G C \u2192 AGC (codon3)\n\nThen positions13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\nThen TAC (codon5), etc.\n\nLooking for stop codons. Let's continue:\n\nCodons:\n\n1: TTT (Phe)\n\n2: CTA (Leu)\n\n3: AGC (Ser)\n\n4: TGG (Trp)\n\n5: TAC (Tyr)\n\n6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7: TGT (Cys)\n\n8: GGA (Gly)\n\n9: TGA (Stop) \u2014 same as mutant1?\n\nWait no, let me parse again:\n\nWait in mutant2's sequence after the first 9 bases (positions7-9 as CTA), then the next bases are A G C T G G... So after CTA (positions7-9):\n\nPositions10-12: A G C \u2192 AGC (codon3)\n\nThen positions13-15: T G G \u2192 TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: T A C \u2192 TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: T T C \u2192 TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: T G T \u2192 TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: G G A \u2192 GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: T G A \u2192 TGA (codon9)\n\nSame as mutant1: the TGA stop codon appears at the same position (codon9). Wait, but wait, the original sequence's stop codon is at the end, so in both mutant1 and mutant2, there's a premature stop at codon9? That would mean both could be candidates. But perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the original's sequence is written as ending with ...TGA, but in the original's case, that's the end. So in the mutant's sequence, if the TGA comes early, then that's a premature stop. So both mutant1 and mutant2 have a premature stop codon here. Hmm, but the options are A-D, so perhaps I made an error.\n\nWait let me re-examine mutant2's DNA sequence:\n\nMutant2's first part is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next part is:\n\nCTA AGC TGG TAC T... \n\nWait the sequence is:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (positions1-6):\n\nNext bases: C T A (positions7-9 \u2192 CTA)\n\nThen A G C (positions10-12 \u2192 AGC)\n\nThen T G G (positions13-15 \u2192 TGG)\n\nThen T A C (positions16-18 \u2192 TAC)\n\nSame as before. So the TGA stop is at position28-30 (codon9) in both mutant1 and mutant2. But the options are A (mutant2), B (mutant3), C (mutant1), D (mutant4). So if both mutant1 and mutant2 have this, then perhaps I need to check if I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe the original sequence's stop codon is further along. Let me check the original's codon structure.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT GTCT...\n\nWait the original's stop codon is written as ending with TGA, so in the original's sequence, the TGA is at the end. The original's sequence before the TGA would have the coding sequence continuing until then. So in the mutants, if their sequence has TGA early, that's a premature stop.\n\nSo both mutant1 and mutant2 have a TGA at codon9 (positions28-30), which would truncate the protein early. However, maybe I need to check if that TGA is actually part of the original's sequence?\n\nWait, the original's sequence is:\n\nOriginal's first part up to that point:\n\nAfter ATG, the sequence is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA\n\nWait let's see the original's codons around that area. Let me parse the original's codons:\n\nOriginal's codons after ATG:\n\n1: TTT (4-6)\n\n2: CTC (7-9)\n\n3: GCT (10-12)\n\n4: GGT (13-15)\n\n5: ACT (16-18)\n\n6: TCT (19-21)\n\n7: GTG (22-24)\n\n8: GAT (25-27)\n\n9: GAA (28-30)\n\nWait, so in the original, codon9 (positions28-30) is GAA (Glu), not TGA. So in the mutants 1 and 2, the 9th codon becomes TGA (stop). That's a premature stop. So both mutants1 and 2 have this. But the options include A (mutant2) and C (mutant1) as possible answers. \n\nHmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the mutant sequences.\n\nWait in mutant1's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nAfter codon8 (positions25-27 in mutant1 would be GGA?), then codon9 (positions28-30) is TGA. Let me see the mutant1's sequence again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after the part I considered up to TGA:\n\nThe original's sequence after the first part is continuing, but in mutant1's case, after the TGA at position28-30, does the sequence continue? Or is that the stop?\n\nWait the problem states that the gene's sequence in the mutant is sequenced, so the full gene is there. But in mutant1, the TGA occurs early, so the protein would stop there. So that's a good candidate.\n\nNow, mutant2's sequence also has TGA at the same position. But why are they different options?\n\nWait perhaps I made an error in the parsing. Let me check mutant2 again:\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, the sequence after ATGTTT is CTAA GCTG...\n\nWait the first codons:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nSame as mutant1. So both have the TGA stop. So why are they different options?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutant's sequence. Let me look again at the original and mutant2's sequences.\n\nOriginal first exon starts with:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\n\nMutant2 is:\n\nATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA\n\nWait, after ATGTTT (the first 6 bases), the next part in the original is \"CTCGCTGG...\" \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATGTTT is \"CTAAGCTGG...\" \n\nSo the difference is that the original's 7th base (after ATGTTT) is C (making the first codon after TTT as CTC), but mutant2 has CTA (positions7-9: CTA), then the next is AGC (from A G C in positions10-12), so the TGA comes at the same position as mutant1. \n\nWait but then why are both options A and C present? The question must have a unique answer. Perhaps I made an error in parsing another mutant.\n\nLet me check mutant3 and 4 to see if any of them have a better option.\n\nMutant3:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG... \n\nMutant3's sequence starts as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo the first few bases after ATG are TTTTACGCTGG...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nposition7-9: TAC (original had CTC at positions7-9 (CTC))\n\nWait:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9 (after ATGTTT) are CTC.\n\nMutant3 has positions7-9 as TAC (since after TTT comes TAC).\n\nSo codon2 (positions7-9) is TAC (Tyr), whereas original was CTC (Leu).\n\nContinuing:\n\npositions10-12: GCT (same as original's GCT in codon3?)\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after TAC is GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nHmm, so codons after that would be:\n\ncodon3: GCT (Ala)\n\ncodon4: GGT (Gly)\n\ncodon5: TGT (Cys)\n\ncodon6: ACA (Thr)\n\n... and so on.\n\nLooking for a stop codon here: The TGA is at the end, so no early stop. The mutations here may cause missense but not a premature stop. So mutant3's protein might still be functional.\n\nMutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant4's sequence starts as:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo after ATGTTT (positions1-6), the next bases are TAC GCT ACTTCT...\n\nBreaking down codons:\n\npositions7-9: TAC (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: GAT (codon7)\n\netc.\n\nSo no stop codon early here. The TGA is at the end. So mutant4's gene would produce the full-length protein? Or perhaps a frameshift?\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion or insertion, but since EMS usually causes point mutations, it's a substitution. Let me see if there's any stop codon.\n\nLooking at the first few codons:\n\ncodon2: TAC (Tyr)\n\ncodon3: GCT (Ala)\n\ncodon4: ACT (Thr)\n\ncodon5: TCT (Ser)\n\ncodon6: GTG (Val)\n\ncodon7: GAT (Asp)\n\nNo stop codons early. So mutant4's gene might still be functional.\n\nSo back to mutants1 and 2. Both introduce a premature stop codon at the same position. But why are they separate options?\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement: the original gene's sequence ends with TGA, so in the mutants, if their sequences have TGA earlier, then the protein would stop there. \n\nBut in mutant3 and 4, there is no premature stop, so they might still produce the compound. \n\nThe question is which mutation would \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". The best would be a nonsense mutation leading to premature stop. So both mutant1 and 2 have this. But the options include both A (mutant2) and C (mutant1). \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the parsing of mutant2's sequence. Let me re-express mutant2's codons again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\npositions10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nYes, so codon9 is TGA. \n\nBut in mutant1, the sequence after that would have the rest of the codons. But the TGA is the stop, so the protein is truncated here. \n\nWait the problem is to choose between mutants1 and 2. The options include both. But perhaps I made a mistake in the original's codon structure.\n\nWait let me check the original's codon9 (positions28-30):\n\nOriginal's sequence after the first part:\n\nThe original's codons after ATG:\n\ncodon1: TTT (4-6)\n\ncodon2: CTC (7-9)\n\ncodon3: GCT (10-12)\n\ncodon4: GGT (13-15)\n\ncodon5: ACT (16-18)\n\ncodon6: TCT (19-21)\n\ncodon7: GTG (22-24)\n\ncodon8: GAT (25-27)\n\ncodon9: GAA (28-30)\n\ncodon10: CAT (31-33)\n\ncodon11: ATT (34-36)\n\ncodon12: ATT (37-39)\n\ncodon13: ATT (38-40? Not sure)\n\nThe original's stop codon is at the end, so codon9 (positions28-30) is GAA (Glu), not a stop. So both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop at codon9 (positions28-30). \n\nTherefore, both would be candidates. But since the options are separate, perhaps there's another factor.\n\nWait looking at the options, maybe one of them actually has a frameshift?\n\nWait, perhaps in mutant2, after the TGA stop, the sequence continues, but since the stop is early, the rest would not be translated. So both are good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the codons for mutant2. Let me check again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait the part after the TGA (positions28-30) is followed by AAC... but since translation stops at TGA, it doesn't matter. \n\nWait perhaps the difference is that in mutant1's sequence after the TGA, there are more bases, but the stop is still effective. So both mutations would work. But the options must have one correct answer. \n\nWait let me look back at the problem's options. The options are A (mutant2), B (mutant3), C (mutant1), D (mutant4). The question is which would most probably eliminate the compound. \n\nAssuming both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop codon, but the question might have a typo or I might have an error. Let me check the mutant sequences again for any other differences.\n\nWait, mutant1's sequence ends with ...GTCGC\u2026TGA, whereas mutant2's ends with ...GTCGC\u2026TGA. The difference between them is in the earlier parts. \n\nWait looking at the first few bases after the stop codon, but since the stop is at codon9, the rest is irrelevant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the mutant's sequence. Let me check the original and mutant2's sequences again:\n\nMutant2's sequence after the first part:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2 is: TTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo between the original and mutant2:\n\nThe original after ATGTTT (positions1-6) is CTCGCTGG... \n\nMutant2 has CTAAGCTGG... \n\nThe difference is that instead of CTCGCT (positions7-12), it's CTAAGC (positions7-12). So the changes are multiple substitutions. \n\nBut the key is the stop codon. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TGA in mutant1 and 2 is actually a mutation in a different position. Wait in mutant1's case, the TGA is at positions28-30, but in the original's codon9 is GAA. \n\nSo both mutations introduce a premature stop, making the protein non-functional. So either mutant1 or 2 could be correct. \n\nBut the options are A (mutant2) and C (mutant1). The question must have one correct answer. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the codon numbering. Let me re-express mutant1's codons again:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\n1: TTT (positions4-6)\n\n2: CTA (7-9)\n\n3: CGC (10-12)\n\n4: TGG (13-15)\n\n5: TAC (16-18)\n\n6: TTC (19-21)\n\n7: TGT (22-24)\n\n8: GGA (25-27)\n\n9: TGA (28-30)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nIn mutant2's case:\n\ncodon3 is AGC (positions10-12) instead of CGC, but the stop codon is still at codon9. \n\nSo both are the same in terms of introducing a stop. \n\nWait the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the other options again.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\nThe first few codons after ATG are:\n\ncodon1: TTT (same)\n\ncodon2: TAC (different from original's CTC)\n\ncodon3: GCT (same as original's GCT?)\n\nWait original's codon3 was GCT (positions10-12: GCT). So mutant3's codon3 is same here. But codon2 is TAC instead of CTC (original). So that's a missense, but no stop.\n\nMutant4's first codons:\n\ncodon1: TTT (same)\n\ncodon2: TAC (since mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACT...)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (so codon2 is TAC, different from original's CTC). \n\ncodon3: GCT (same as original's codon3)\n\ncodon4: ACT (since positions13-15 are ACT)\n\nOriginal's codon4 was GGT. So this is a change here (GGT\u2192ACT), which is a frameshift? Wait no, it's a substitution of three bases. \n\nWait positions13-15 in mutant4 are ACT, whereas original was GGT. So that's a change of GGT to ACT. So that would change the codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr), a missense, but no stop.\n\nSo both mutant1 and mutant2 introduce a stop. The question's options include both. \n\nWait the original question lists the options as A-D. The options are:\n\nA) Mutant2\n\nB) Mutant3\n\nC) Mutant1\n\nD) Mutant4\n\nThe question is from the user, so maybe in the problem statement, the mutant sequences have different mutations. Let me check again the exact sequences provided:\n\nThe original gene sequence is given as:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait let's look at the exact letters between mutant1 and original:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT is CTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant1's sequence here is CTACGCTG...\n\nSo the first difference is at position7: original is C (position7), mutant1 has T? Wait no, let's see:\n\nWait the original's first part after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter ATGTTT (6 bases), the next letters are C T C G C T G G...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT is CTACGCTGG...\n\nSo:\n\nPosition7 (7th base after start):\n\nOriginal's 7th is C (from the original sequence's 7th base after ATG)\n\nMutant1's 7th is T? Wait no, let me write the letters:\n\nOriginal after ATGTTT (positions1-6):\n\nPositions7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATGTTT:\n\nPositions7: C (same as original)\n\n8: T (same)\n\n9: A (mutation here, original was C)\n\n10: C (original was G)\n\n11: G (original was C)\n\n12: C (original was T)\n\nSo at position9, original C becomes A in mutant1. \n\nThus, codon2 (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal: CTC (positions7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant1: CTA (C T A)\n\nSo codon2 changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) \u2192 no change in amino acid. So that's a silent mutation. \n\nWait wait, wait! CTA is still CTX, which is Leu. So codon2 is still Leu. So that doesn't introduce a stop. Wait then where does the stop come from?\n\nWait I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express mutant1's codons properly.\n\nMutant1's codons:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\npositions4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\npositions7-9: CTA (codon2) \u2192 Leu\n\npositions10-12: CGC (codon3) \u2192 Arg (since CGC is Arg)\n\npositions13-15: TGG (codon4) \u2192 Trp\n\npositions16-18: TAC (codon5) \u2192 Tyr\n\npositions19-21: TTC (codon6) \u2192 Phe\n\npositions22-24: TGT (codon7) \u2192 Cys\n\npositions25-27: GGA (codon8) \u2192 Gly\n\npositions28-30: TGA (codon9) \u2192 stop\n\nWait, but where is the TGA coming from? In the original sequence, after codon8 (positions25-27), the next bases would be GATGAACAT... \n\nWait perhaps the TGA is part of the mutant's sequence but not the original. Let me look at the mutant's sequence again:\n\nMutant1's sequence ends with \"...TGA-3\u2019\", so the TGA is the stop codon at the end. But the earlier part's codons:\n\npositions28-30: in mutant1's case, after codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next three bases are TGA (positions28-30). \n\nWait how does that happen?\n\nLet me write the entire first part of mutant1's sequence up to that point:\n\nStarting from ATG:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nBreaking down the first 30 bases after ATG:\n\nThe first 30 bases after ATG are:\n\nPositions4-33 (assuming the TGA is at the end):\n\nWait perhaps I need to count precisely:\n\nThe first part of the mutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nLet's count the first 30 bases after the ATG:\n\nPositions 4-33 (30 bases):\n\n1-3 (after ATG): TTT (positions4-6)\n\n4-6: T (position7), A (position8), C (position9) \u2192 codon2: TAC (positions7-9?)\n\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me write all the first 30 bases:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3):\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A\n\n10: C\n\n11: G\n\n12: C\n\n13: T\n\n14: G\n\n15: G\n\n16: T\n\n17: A\n\n18: C\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T\n\n22: C\n\n23: T\n\n24: G\n\n25: T\n\n26: G\n\n27: G\n\n28: A\n\n29: T\n\n30: G\n\nWait this is getting too time-consuming, but perhaps the key is that in mutant1, there's a premature stop codon at position28-30 (TGA), whereas in the original, those positions are GAA (Glu). \n\nTherefore, mutant1 introduces a stop codon early. \n\nBut earlier I thought mutant2 does the same, but let's recheck mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA\n\nThe first 30 bases after ATG:\n\npositions4-33:\n\n4-6: TTT (codon1)\n\n7-9: CTA (codon2)\n\n10-12: AGC (codon3)\n\n13-15: TGG (codon4)\n\n16-18: TAC (codon5)\n\n19-21: TTC (codon6)\n\n22-24: TGT (codon7)\n\n25-27: GGA (codon8)\n\n28-30: TGA (codon9)\n\nYes, so both mutant1 and 2 have the TGA stop at codon9. \n\nBut the problem lists them as separate options. Since the question is from the user, maybe I made an error in assuming both have it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stop codon in mutant2 is not there. Let me count the positions for mutant2's TGA.\n\nWait in mutant2's sequence, after codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next bases are TGA (positions28-30). So that's a stop. \n\nSo both mutants1 and 2 introduce a premature stop. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nLooking back at the problem's options, perhaps there's a difference in the rest of the sequence. For example, in mutant1, after the stop codon, there's a G instead of a T? \n\nWait the mutant1's sequence ends with \"...TCGC\u2026TGA\", whereas the original ends with \"...TCGT\u2026TGA\". The last letters before the TGA in mutant1 are GTCGC, whereas original has GTCTG. \n\nBut that doesn't affect the stop codon's presence. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first part of mutant2's sequence. \n\nWait looking back, the original's first part is:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant2's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThe difference between original and mutant2 is at positions7-9 and 10-12.\n\nOriginal at positions7-9: CTC (codon2)\n\nMutant2 has CTA (positions7-9) \u2192 codon2: CTA (Leu), then positions10-12 are AGC (AGC is Ser).\n\nSo codon3 is AGC (Ser), whereas original's codon3 was GCT (Ala). \n\nBut the stop codon is still introduced at position28-30. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and 2 have the TGA stop. \n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Since the options are given, and the question is from the user, perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C), and I made an error in considering mutant2. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutant2's sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's mutant1 has a frameshift. \n\nWait, in mutant1, after the first few codons, the sequence might have a frameshift? \n\nWait no, all mutations are substitutions, not indels, so the reading frame is maintained. \n\nSo both mutants1 and2 introduce a stop codon early, making the protein non-functional. \n\nIf both are correct, but the options are A and C, the user might have intended one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant2, the TGA is not actually there. \n\nWait let me re-express mutant2's codon9:\n\npositions28-30 in mutant2:\n\npositions28: T\n\n29: G\n\n30: A \u2192 TGA (stop)\n\nYes. \n\nHmm. Since both are valid, but the options include both, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. \n\nWait looking back, the original's first exon has five exons and four introns. The first exon is the first one, so any mutation in the first exon's coding region would affect the protein. \n\nThe question asks which mutation will \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". The best option is the one that introduces a premature stop codon. Both mutants1 and 2 do that. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon count. Let me try to find the difference between mutant1 and 2.\n\nIn mutant1's first part, after the stop codon (positions28-30), the next codon would be... but the translation stops there. \n\nIn mutant2, similarly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TGA in mutant1 is actually part of the original sequence? \n\nNo, the original's sequence ends with TGA, but the stop is at the end. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and2 are candidates. \n\nBut the options are A and C. The problem might have a typo, but I'll have to choose between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is mutant1 (option C), and I made an error in mutant2's analysis. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other options. \n\nMutant3 and4 don't introduce stop. \n\nThe question says \"most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound\". Either mutant1 or 2 would do that. \n\nIf I must choose between them, perhaps the first one listed (mutant1) is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon count for mutant1. \n\nWait in mutant1's sequence after the first few codons:\n\ncodon9 is TGA (positions28-30). \n\nBut in the original's sequence, positions28-30 are GAA (Glu). So mutant1 changes GAA to TGA. \n\nHow? Let's see the original's bases at positions28-30:\n\nOriginal sequence's codon8 is positions25-27: GAT (Glu?) Wait no, let me recount:\n\nWait the original's codons:\n\ncodon8: positions25-27: GAT \u2192 Asp (GAT is Asp)\n\ncodon9: positions28-30: GAA \u2192 Glu (GAA)\n\nSo in mutant1's sequence, positions28-30 are TGA (stop). \n\nTo get that, the original's GAA (positions28-30) must have been changed to TGA. \n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence, after the codons up to codon8 (positions25-27: GGA?), then positions28-30 are TGA. \n\nWait in the mutant's sequence, the bases at positions28-30 are TGA. \n\nThe original's bases there were GAA. \n\nSo the mutation here is changing GAA to TGA. \n\nBut how does that happen? \n\nLooking at the mutant1's sequence:\n\nAfter codon8 (positions25-27: GGA), the next three bases are TGA. \n\nTo get TGA instead of GAA, the mutation must be at position28 (from G to T) and position30 (from A to A? No). \n\nWait the original's bases at positions28-30 are G (position28), A (29), A (30) \u2192 GAA. \n\nMutant1 has T (position28), G (29), A (30) \u2192 TGA. \n\nSo the mutations here are:\n\nposition28: G\u2192T \n\nposition29: A\u2192G \n\nposition30 remains A. \n\nSo three bases changed? But EMS is a point mutagen, so it's likely a single base change. \n\nWait but in the mutant sequences provided, the changes are multiple. \n\nThe problem states that the mutants were generated with EMS, which typically causes single base substitutions. However, the question says that in the first exon area, there are \"some changes\" \u2014 perhaps multiple substitutions. \n\nAssuming that the changes in the first exon are due to EMS, which can cause multiple mutations in a region, but the key is whether the mutation results in a stop codon. \n\nThus, both mutants1 and2 introduce a stop codon early, so they are both valid. \n\nBut the options are separate. Perhaps the correct answer is mutant1 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in considering mutant2's codons. \n\nWait, let me look again at mutant2's codon9:\n\npositions28-30 in mutant2 are TGA (stop), which requires changing the original GAA to TGA. \n\nSo that requires changing the first G to T and the second A to G. \n\nTwo point mutations. \n\nMutant1's TGA would also require two changes. \n\nSo both require two mutations. \n\nThe question says \"some changes\", so both are possible. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the first correct one listed is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem's sequences, maybe I made a mistake in mutant2's sequence. \n\nWait mutant2's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThe part before TGA includes \"GGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA\". \n\nWait perhaps the TGA is part of the \"GGATGA...\" sequence. \n\nThe codons around there:\n\npositions25-27: GGA (Gly)\n\npositions28-30: TGA (stop)\n\nYes. \n\nThus, both mutants introduce a stop. \n\nThe options must have one correct answer. Given that the first one (mutant1) is an option C, I'll choose that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is mutant4, but that doesn't have a stop. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon numbering. \n\nWait, perhaps the premature stop in mutant1 is earlier than in mutant2. \n\nWait, in mutant1's codon9 is TGA (position28-30), which is the same as mutant2. \n\nSo no difference there. \n\nGiven that both are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps the answer is mutant1 (option C), as it's the first one listed. \n\nAlternatively, I might have made a mistake in the analysis of mutant3 or 4. \n\nWait mutant3's sequence has a change in the first exon that could introduce a frameshift. \n\nWait, mutant3's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nLooking at the first part after ATG:\n\nTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nThe difference from the original is an extra T after TTT, making the sequence TTTTACGCT... \n\nWait the original after ATG is TTTCTC... so mutant3's first few bases are TTTTAC... which is an insertion? No, it's a substitution. \n\nWait the original's first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant3 has TTTTACGCTGG...\n\nSo the first difference is inserting an extra T? No, it's a substitution. \n\nThe first 6 bases are ATGTTT (same as original), then the next bases:\n\nOriginal: CTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant3: TTACGCTG...\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. \n\nGiven that both mutant1 and 2 introduce a stop codon, but the options include them, I'll assume the answer is mutant1 (option C), so the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation).\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n- **Mutant 1**:\n  - The sequence shows a change at positions 7-9 from **CTC** (Leu) to **CTA** (still Leu, silent mutation).\n  - Further downstream, the codon at positions 28-30 changes from **GAA** (Glu) in the original to **TGA** (stop codon). This introduces a premature stop codon, truncating the protein early, likely rendering it non-functional.\n\n- **Mutant 2**:\n  - The sequence shows changes leading to the same premature stop codon **TGA** at positions 28-30, similar to Mutant 1. This also disrupts the protein.\n\n- **Mutant 3** and **Mutant 4**:\n  - Neither introduces a premature stop codon. Their mutations result in missense changes but do not truncate the protein, so they are less likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBoth Mutant 1 and Mutant 2 introduce a premature stop codon. However, since the question asks for the **most probable** solution and the options are distinct, Mutant 1 is the first listed option with the required mutation. \n\nAnswer: C",

The gene responsible for making that compound has five exons and four introns. The question is about which mutation in the first exon would stop the gene from producing the compound.\n\nFirst, I remember that mutations can affect the gene in different ways. Since the gene is made of exons and introns, and the mutations are in the first exon, the key here is to see which mutation would disrupt the gene's function. The options are four different mutants with changes in the sequence. Let's look at each one.\n\nThe intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, so that's the first exon's beginning). Then the first exon's sequence is given. The mutations are in that area. Let's compare each mutant to the original sequence.\n\nStarting with Mutant 1. Let me look at the sequence:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'\n\nMutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, let's break down the first part. The original after the start codon (ATG) is TTTCTC... So the first few bases after ATG are T-T-T-C-T-C... \n\nLooking at Mutant 1's sequence, after ATG, it's TCTACGC... Hmm, maybe I need to look for where exactly the mutation occurs.

Let me count exactly.\n\nWait, the original sequence after the start codon (ATG) is:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo let's break it down step by step. The first few bases after ATG are:\n\nPosition 4: T (from TTT)\nPosition 5: T\nPosition 6: T\nPosition 7: C\nPosition 8: T\nPosition 9: C\nPosition 10: G\nPosition 11: C\nPosition 12: T\nPosition 13: G\nPosition 14: G\nPosition 15: T\n\nThen comes ACTTCTG... Wait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, the original sequence after ATG is \"TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\"\n\nSo the first part after ATG (positions 4- maybe 15):\n\nLet me list the nucleotides:\n\nOriginal first exon (starting after ATG):\n\nPositions 4- (up to where the mutation is):\n\nOriginal sequence: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: The sequence after ATG is T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutation occurs in the first few bases. Let me compare the first part:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, perhaps the first difference is at position 4?

Wait, here's a change. Original position6 is T, mutant1 has C here?\n\nWait let me re-examine the sequences again carefully.\n\nWait the original is written as:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the letters after ATG:\n\nAfter ATG (the first three letters), the next letters are T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nSo the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1's sequence is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATG, the next letters are T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nComparing each base step by step:\n\nPosition 4 (first after ATG):\n\nOriginal: T (from the TTTCTC...)\n\nMutant1: T (same)\n\nPosition 5: Original T, Mutant1 T (same)\n\nPosition 6: Original T vs Mutant1 C? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait the original after ATG is TTTCTC... so positions 4-6 are T, T, T. Then comes C (position7). \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is T T C T A C... Hmm, so position 6 in mutant1 is C, whereas original is T. So position6: T vs C (mutation here). \n\nSo at position6 (the third T in the original TTT becomes a C in mutant1). So that's a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a deletion? Let me check again. Wait maybe I made a mistake in the sequence alignment.\n\nWait the original is written as \"TTTCTC...\", so positions 4-6 are T T T. Then C at position7. \n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG starts with \"TTCTAC...\" So after the first two Ts (positions4 and 5), the third base is C (position6). So that's a T to C substitution at position6. \n\nSo that's a point mutation. Then the next base is T (position7?), but original had C there. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write the sequences letter by letter.\n\nOriginal: After ATG, the first few letters are T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, let's break down the original sequence after ATG as individual letters:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T\n\n22: G\n\n23: T\n\n24: G\n\n25: G\n\n... and so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nPosition4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: C (mutation here, T to C)\n\n7: T (original had C here?)\n\nWait, let's look at Mutant1's sequence again. The first part after ATG is:\n\n\"TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\"\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nPositions4-10:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: C (mutation from T to C here)\n\n7: T (original had C at position7)\n\nWait, that's a problem. So position7 in Mutant1 is T, but original had C there. Wait, so that's another mutation?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should list each base one by one for the first few positions of each mutant compared to the original.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for a mutation that causes a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift, which would stop the protein from being made.\n\nAlternatively, a mutation that changes an essential part of the gene's function.\n\nThe question is which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So we need the gene to be non-functional. So the best option is a mutation that disrupts the gene's ability to produce the protein. So a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift mutation would be effective.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1: Let's see. Let me check for stop codons early on. Let's look at the first exon's sequence. Since the first exon is part of the coding region (since it starts with ATG, the start codon), any mutation here that causes a premature stop would be good.\n\nAlternatively, a frameshift mutation would also disrupt the gene.\n\nLet me check each mutant for possible stop codons.\n\nFirst, the original gene's first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The rest of the sequence is the coding region. The entire gene ends with TGA (stop codon).\n\nMutant1:\n\nLooking at the first part of the sequence after ATG:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC... (positions 4-6 are TTT, then C at 7, etc.)\n\nMutant1's first few bases after ATG are T T C T A C G C T G G T... \n\nWait, let's look at codons. Since it's mRNA (since it's the gene's sequence, but DNA vs mRNA? Well, in the gene, the sequence is DNA, but when transcribed, it becomes RNA. So the coding sequence is in the DNA, so the mRNA would be complementary. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the reading frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to see where a mutation causes a stop codon early.\n\nLet me try to translate the original sequence into amino acids, then see each mutant's effect.\n\nWait, that might take time. Alternatively, let's see if any of the mutations cause a premature stop codon.\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence:\n\nLooking for a TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding sequence early on.\n\nThe original ends with TGA. Let's see in Mutant1's sequence:\n\nThe mutant's sequence after ATG starts as T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, maybe there's a stop codon introduced early here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a frameshift. Let's see the number of nucleotides changed. A frameshift would occur if there's an insertion or deletion, but these are substitutions. Wait, the mutations here are substitutions (single base changes?), so they are point mutations, not frameshifts unless they change the reading frame in some way. Wait, no, substitutions don't change the reading frame. Only insertions or deletions do. Since the question says they used EMS, which causes point mutations (base substitutions), so all these are substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the possible effects are either missense (changing an amino acid) or nonsense (introducing a stop codon) mutations.\n\nSo we need to look for a nonsense mutation in the first exon that would truncate the protein early.\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence to see if there's a premature stop codon.\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe sequence after ATG is:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, let me write the first part again, but in triplets (codons) to see if a stop codon appears.\n\nStarting with the ATG as the first codon (start). Then the next codons are:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (codon 2: Phe)\n\n7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\n19-21: TCT (Ser)\n\n22-24: GTG (Val)\n\n25-27: GGA (Gly)\n\n... and so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\nAfter ATG (positions 1-3), the next codons:\n\nPositions4-6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n... so no stop codons here. So maybe the first few codons are altered but not introducing a stop.\n\nWait, but let me check further along the sequence for Mutant1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look further. Let me check the mutant sequences again.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Mutant2.\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is:\n\nOriginal first part: T T T C T C G C T G G T...\n\nMutant2's sequence: T T T T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, let me check again. The question says:\n\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, so after ATG, the sequence is T T T T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, let me parse this. Wait, the original starts with TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, perhaps the first part after ATG is T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nHmm, so let me break down the first few codons of Mutant2:\n\nPositions4-6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAA (stop codon)\n\nAh! Here's a stop codon at the third codon. \n\nWait, let me do this step by step. \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG (positions 4 onwards):\n\nLet me write the first 9 nucleotides:\n\nPositions4-9:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts as T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, the first few letters after ATG are T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, breaking into codons:\n\nFirst codon after ATG (positions4-6): T T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\nSecond codon (positions7-9): T A A \u2192 TAA (Stop codon!)\n\nSo that's a premature stop codon right there. So in Mutant2, after the start codon, the second codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after just two amino acids (Met and Phe), so the gene product is non-functional. That would eliminate the compound, which is what we want. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me check the exact sequence of Mutant2 again. The user provided:\n\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nSo positions 4-6: T T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: T A A \u2192 TAA (stop)\n\nSo yes, that's a stop codon introduced early. That would definitely prevent the gene from producing the functional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So Mutant2 would be the answer. \n\nLooking at the options, Mutant2 is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other mutants to be sure.\n\nMutant3:\n\nThe sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nWait, the first part after ATG is T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nHmm, let's see the first few codons:\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (Phe)\n\n7-9: T A C (Tyr)\n\n10-12: G C T (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: GTC (Val)\n\n19-21: ACT (Thr)\n\nHmm, no stop codons here. So this is a missense mutation, perhaps altering some amino acids but not stopping the gene early.\n\nMutant4: \n\nSequence after ATG is T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, the given sequence is Mutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATG: T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\n16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\n19-21: GTG (Val)\n\n... No stop codons here either. So Mutant4 doesn't have a premature stop. \n\nSo the only one with a premature stop is Mutant2, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check Mutant1 again. The first part after ATG in Mutant1 is T T C T A C... So positions4-6: TTC (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), so no stop. So Mutant1 is okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function. The key is to identify a mutation introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift. \n\n**Mutant 2** has a sequence change resulting in **TAA** (a stop codon) at positions 7-9 after the start codon (ATG). This premature stop codon truncates the protein early, rendering the gene non-functional. Other mutants (1, 3, 4) do not introduce a stop codon in the early region and likely result in missense mutations or retain functional protein production. \n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these mutants would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene responsible for making that compound has five exons and four introns. The question is about which mutation in the first exon would stop the gene from producing the compound.\n\nFirst, I remember that mutations can affect the gene in different ways. Since the gene is made of exons and introns, and the mutations are in the first exon, the key here is to see which mutation would disrupt the gene's function. The options are four different mutants with changes in the sequence. Let's look at each one.\n\nThe intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, so that's the first exon's beginning).

So a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift mutation would be effective.\n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant1: Let's see. Let me check for stop codons early on. Let's look at the first exon's sequence. Since the first exon is part of the coding region (since it starts with ATG, the start codon), any mutation here that causes a premature stop would be good.\n\nAlternatively, a frameshift mutation would also disrupt the gene.\n\nLet me check each mutant for possible stop codons.\n\nFirst, the original gene's first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The rest of the sequence is the coding region. The entire gene ends with TGA (stop codon).\n\nMutant1:\n\nLooking at the first part of the sequence after ATG:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC... (positions 4-6 are TTT, then C at 7, etc.)\n\nMutant1's first few bases after ATG are T T C T A C G C T G G T... \n\nWait, let's look at codons. Since it's mRNA (since it's the gene's sequence, but DNA vs mRNA? Well, in the gene, the sequence is DNA, but when transcribed, it becomes RNA. So the coding sequence is in the DNA, so the mRNA would be complementary. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the reading frame.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to see where a mutation causes a stop codon early.\n\nLet me try to translate the original sequence into amino acids, then see each mutant's effect.\n\nWait, that might take time. Alternatively, let's see if any of the mutations cause a premature stop codon.\n\nLooking at Mutant1's sequence:\n\nLooking for a TGA, TAA, or TAG in the coding sequence early on.\n\nThe original ends with TGA. Let's see in Mutant1's sequence:\n\nThe mutant's sequence after ATG starts as T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, maybe there's a stop codon introduced early here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a frameshift. Let's see the number of nucleotides changed. A frameshift would occur if there's an insertion or deletion, but these are substitutions. Wait, the mutations here are substitutions (single base changes?), so they are point mutations, not frameshifts unless they change the reading frame in some way. Wait, no, substitutions don't change the reading frame. Only insertions or deletions do. Since the question says they used EMS, which causes point mutations (base substitutions), so all these are substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the possible effects are either missense (changing an amino acid) or nonsense (introducing a stop codon) mutations.\n\nSo we need to look for a nonsense mutation in the first exon that would truncate the protein early.\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence to see if there's a premature stop codon.\n\nStarting with Mutant1:\n\nThe sequence after ATG is:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, let me write the first part again, but in triplets (codons) to see if a stop codon appears.\n\nStarting with the ATG as the first codon (start). Then the next codons are:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (codon 2: Phe)\n\n7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: ACT (Thr)\n\n19-21: TCT (Ser)\n\n22-24: GTG (Val)\n\n25-27: GGA (Gly)\n\n... and so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence:\n\nAfter ATG (positions 1-3), the next codons:\n\nPositions4-6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n... so no stop codons here. So maybe the first few codons are altered but not introducing a stop.\n\nWait, but let me check further along the sequence for Mutant1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look further. Let me check the mutant sequences again.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Mutant2.\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is:\n\nOriginal first part: T T T C T C G C T G G T...\n\nMutant2's sequence: T T T T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, let me check again. The question says:\n\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, so after ATG, the sequence is T T T T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, let me parse this. Wait, the original starts with TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, perhaps the first part after ATG is T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nHmm, so let me break down the first few codons of Mutant2:\n\nPositions4-6: TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAA (stop codon)\n\nAh! Here's a stop codon at the third codon. \n\nWait, let me do this step by step. \n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG (positions 4 onwards):\n\nLet me write the first 9 nucleotides:\n\nPositions4-9:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG starts as T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, the first few letters after ATG are T T C T A A G C T...\n\nWait, breaking into codons:\n\nFirst codon after ATG (positions4-6): T T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\nSecond codon (positions7-9): T A A \u2192 TAA (Stop codon!)\n\nSo that's a premature stop codon right there. So in Mutant2, after the start codon, the second codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after just two amino acids (Met and Phe), so the gene product is non-functional. That would eliminate the compound, which is what we want. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me check the exact sequence of Mutant2 again. The user provided:\n\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATG (positions 1-3), the next letters are T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nSo positions 4-6: T T C \u2192 TTC (Phe)\n\n7-9: T A A \u2192 TAA (stop)\n\nSo yes, that's a stop codon introduced early. That would definitely prevent the gene from producing the functional protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So Mutant2 would be the answer. \n\nLooking at the options, Mutant2 is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other mutants to be sure.\n\nMutant3:\n\nThe sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nWait, the first part after ATG is T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nHmm, let's see the first few codons:\n\nPositions4-6: T T T (Phe)\n\n7-9: T A C (Tyr)\n\n10-12: G C T (Ala)\n\n13-15: GGT (Gly)\n\n16-18: GTC (Val)\n\n19-21: ACT (Thr)\n\nHmm, no stop codons here. So this is a missense mutation, perhaps altering some amino acids but not stopping the gene early.\n\nMutant4: \n\nSequence after ATG is T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, the given sequence is Mutant4:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo after ATG: T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\n13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\n16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\n19-21: GTG (Val)\n\n... No stop codons here either. So Mutant4 doesn't have a premature stop. \n\nSo the only one with a premature stop is Mutant2, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me double-check Mutant1 again. The first part after ATG in Mutant1 is T T C T A C... So positions4-6: TTC (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), so no stop. So Mutant1 is okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.\n\n\nThe question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function. The key is to identify a mutation introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift. \n\n**Mutant 2** has a sequence change resulting in **TAA** (a stop codon) at positions 7-9 after the start codon (ATG). This premature stop codon truncates the protein early, rendering the gene non-functional. Other mutants (1, 3, 4) do not introduce a stop codon in the early region and likely result in missense mutations or retain functional protein production. \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the problem is about finding which mutation in the gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene has five exons and four introns. Since exons are the coding regions, any mutation in them could affect the protein's function. The question is about using EMS mutagenesis and looking at the first exon mutations.\n\nThe intact gene sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon, so that's the first exon here). The mutants have different changes in this region. The goal is to find a mutation that would stop the production of the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we need to disrupt the gene so that the protein isn't made. How can a mutation in the first exon do that?\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant 1: The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCG... The mutant has ATGTTTCTACGCTGG... Wait, let me compare the sequences more carefully. Wait the original first part is 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019. So the first few bases after ATG are TTTCTC. \n\nMutant 1's sequence starts as ATGTTTCTACGCTGG... Wait, looking at the first part: original is \"TTTCTCGCTG...\" versus mutant 1's \"TTTCTACGCTG...\" So comparing positions after the start codon:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCTGGTACTTCTG... (maybe the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...)\n\nMutant1: After ATG, it's TTTCTACGCTG... So the change is between the 6th and 7th base? Let me check the exact differences.\n\nOriginal: Let's write the first part in the intact gene:\n\nThe first exon starts with ATG (start codon), then the next bases are T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, looking at the exact sequences given:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant1: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, let me parse the sequences more carefully. Let me break down the first part:\n\nOriginal: After ATG (positions 4-?), the next bases are TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nWait, the original sequence's first exon starts with:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...\n\nWait, let me write the first part of each mutant's sequence:\n\nOriginal's first part (after ATG):\n\nLooking at the first 20 bases after ATG (positions 4 to 23 maybe? Let's see):\n\nThe original sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So positions 4-? Let's see the exact letters:\n\nOriginal starts with:\n\nATG (positions 1-3), then next letters:\n\npositions 4-6: T T T (so the first codon after start is TTT, which is a stop codon? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the start is ATG (methionine), then the next three bases are TTT (which is a stop codon if that's the case). Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the first exon starts with ATG, then the next bases. Let me write the first part of the original gene's sequence:\n\nOriginal sequence given is:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nATG (start codon) followed by T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, the first few codons after the start would be:\n\nThe first codon after ATG is TTT (positions 4-6). TTT is a stop codon? No, wait stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA. TTT is phenylalanine (F). Wait, so that's okay. But maybe the mutation causes a premature stop?\n\nLooking at Mutant 1: The sequence is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nSo comparing the original and mutant 1's sequences:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGG...\n\nMutant 1: TTTCTACGCTGG...\n\nSo the difference is between the original's TCG and the mutant's TAC?\n\nWait, let me check the exact positions. Let's write the original and mutant sequences side by side for the first part.\n\nOriginal (after ATG):\n\nPositions 4-21 (assuming each triplet is a codon, but maybe the exact change is at a specific position):\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nMutant1: T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutation is at the 7th nucleotide. Let me see:\n\nOriginal: After ATG (positions 1-3), the next bases are:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (first codon after start)\n\n7-9: CTC (next codon)\n\n10-12: GCT (third codon)\n\nWait, let's count the letters carefully.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG is: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nBreaking into triplets (codons):\n\nCodon 1 (positions 4-6): TTT (F)\n\nCodon 2 (7-9): CTC (Leu)\n\nCodon 3 (10-12): GCT (Ala)\n\nCodon4 (13-15): GGT (Gly)\n\nCodon5 (16-18): ACT (Thr)\n\nCodon6 (19-21): TCT (Ser)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, looking at the first few codons:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\n7-9: CTA (Leu?)\n\nWait, the original at positions 7-9 was C T C (CTC) which is Leu (CTC is Leu). In mutant1, the 7-9 would be C T A (CTA) which is also Leu (since Leu is CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG). So that's a silent mutation?\n\nWait, maybe the difference is at position 8-9? Let me check.\n\nWait the mutant1's sequence is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" So the original's sequence at that spot is \"CTCGCT...\", so the first part after the TTT is CTC, but mutant1 has CTA instead. So the second codon (positions 7-9) changes from CTC to CTA, which is still Leu. So that's a silent mutation here.\n\nWait but maybe the next codon? Let me see. The next codon after that would be positions 10-12: in original it's GCT (Ala), but in mutant1, after the CTA (positions 7-9), the next would be GCT (positions 10-12 still?), so that's same. Wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is at a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation is between the first and second codons. Let's see the exact mutation points.\n\nLooking at the first part of mutant1's sequence: comparing to the original:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...\n\nMutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...\n\nWait, maybe the mutation is a substitution that changes the codon in a way that introduces a stop codon?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at each mutant's change.\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence in detail.\n\nFirst, the original sequence:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the first exon's nucleotides:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nPosition 1-3: ATG (start codon)\n\nThen next nucleotides:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 so codon 1 (positions 4-6): TTT (F)\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C \u2192 codon 2: CTC (Leu)\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T \u2192 codon3: GCT (Ala)\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T \u2192 codon4:GGT (Gly)\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T \u2192 codon5:ACT (Thr)\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T \u2192 codon6:TCT (Ser)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nMutant 1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo the difference is between the original and mutant1's sequences. Let me look at the first part:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTT C T C G C T G G T...\n\nWait, the mutant's sequence after ATG is TTT C T A C G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so let's look at positions 7-9. Original at position 7: C, position8: T, position9: C \u2192 CTC (Leu). In mutant1, position7: C, position8: T, position9: A \u2192 CTA (still Leu). So that codon is still Leu. Then position 10: G (same as original). Wait, but after that, perhaps there's a change. Let me check the next part.\n\nWait maybe the mutation is at position 10? Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after the first part is:\n\nOriginal: after the first few codons, the sequence continues as GCTGGTACT...\n\nMutant1 has after the first part: CTACGCTGGTACT...\n\nWait, maybe the substitution is at position 10. Let me check:\n\nOriginal's positions 7-12:\n\nPositions 7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\nPositions 10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nIn mutant1, positions 7-12 would be:\n\npositions 7-9: CTA (Leu)\n\npositions 10-12: GCT \u2192 same as original? Wait, no, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutant1 has a change in the 10th position. Wait, perhaps I need to compare the sequences letter by letter.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nLetters 4-21 (first 18 nucleotides after ATG):\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 CTC (codon2)\n\n10: G, 11: C, 12: T \u2192 GCT (codon3)\n\n13: G, 14: G, 15: T \u2192 GGT (codon4)\n\n16: A, 17: C, 18: T \u2192 ACT (codon5)\n\n19: T, 20: C, 21: T \u2192 TCT (codon6)\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" Let's parse:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 same as original (TTT)\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nSo position9 changed from C to A. So the second codon becomes CTA (Leu). That's a silent mutation because CTA is still Leu. Then the next codon:\n\npositions10-12: C (from the next letters). Wait, the mutant's sequence after CTA (positions7-9) is then C G C T... Wait, maybe I need to look at the next nucleotide. Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant1's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: CTA (from the TAC part?)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me write the exact letters:\n\nOriginal sequence's first part after ATG:\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nT T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, so between the original and mutant1:\n\nOriginal's 7th nucleotide: C (position7), 8th T (position8), 9th C (position9). So codon2 is CTC.\n\nMutant1's 7th is C, 8th T, 9th A \u2192 CTA (still Leu). Then position10 in mutant1 is C (from the next letter?), so position10 is C?\n\nWait the original's position10 is G. Wait, original's position10 is the first nucleotide of the third codon (positions10-12: GCT). So original's position10 is G. \n\nIn mutant1's sequence, after CTA (positions7-9), the next nucleotide (position10) is C? Because in the mutant's sequence, after \"CTAC\" (positions7-10?), perhaps.\n\nWait maybe I need to parse each position step by step:\n\nOriginal's first 12 nucleotides after ATG (positions4-15?):\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the sequences as strings.\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nAfter ATG, the sequence is:\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nSo let me write each position:\n\nPosition 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C \u2192 CTC (codon2)\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T \u2192 GCT (codon3)\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T \u2192 GGT (codon4)\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T \u2192 ACT (codon5)\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T \u2192 TCT (codon6)\n\n22: G\n\n23: T\n\n24: G \u2192 GTG (codon7)\n\nand so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2, Leu)\n\nPosition10: C (original had G here)\n\nWait, original's position10 is G (part of codon3). In mutant1, position10 is C? Because the sequence after the CTA (positions7-9) would be C G C? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after the first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" So after TTT (positions4-6), the next letters are CTACGCT...\n\nWait, so positions7-10:\n\nPosition7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nPosition10: C (from the next letters)\n\nPosition11: G?\n\nWait maybe I need to write the letters step by step:\n\nOriginal's sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-12:\n\nT T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nT T T C T A C G C T...\n\nSo, at position10, original had G (from the original's CTC GCT...), but in mutant1, position10 is C (since the sequence is C T A C G C T... Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me write each position step by step for mutant1:\n\nMutant1 after ATG:\n\nPositions 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A\n\n10: C\n\n11: G\n\n12: C \u2192 so codon3 (positions10-12) is C G C \u2192 CGC which is Arg (CGC is Arg). \n\nOriginal's codon3 was GCT (Ala). So here, mutant1 has a change in the third codon: GCT (Ala) \u2192 CGC (Arg). That's a missense mutation, changing Ala to Arg. That could affect the protein's function, but might not stop production. Unless this leads to a premature stop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a frameshift. Wait, but the mutation here is a substitution, not an insertion or deletion, so frameshift is out. \n\nSo in mutant1, the third codon is changed from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). The rest of the codons after that would be shifted? Wait no, substitution doesn't shift the reading frame. So the rest of the codons are read normally, but with the third codon changed. \n\nSo mutant1 has a missense mutation. That might affect the protein, but maybe not eliminate the compound. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the compound, so probably a null mutation, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that truncates the protein.\n\nLooking at the other mutants:\n\nMutant2's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nComparing the first parts:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTC...\n\nMutant2 has TTT replaced with TTCTAA? Let me parse:\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG is \"TTCTAAGCTGG...\" \n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nOriginal's first few letters after ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T...\n\nMutant2's after ATG: T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so positions4-6:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nMutant2: T T C \u2192 so codon1 is TTC (Phe), not TTT (also Phe). So that's a silent mutation? Because both TTT and TTC code for Phe.\n\nThen position7: T (original's position7 was C?), no wait let's see:\n\nWait perhaps I need to look at the exact letters. Let me write the first part of mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is: T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so the first 6 nucleotides after ATG are T T C T A A \u2192 so codon1 (positions4-6) is TTC (still Phe), then the next codon (positions7-9): TAA (which is a stop codon!). \n\nAh! So in Mutant2, the second codon (positions7-9) is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product would be non-functional. That would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the protein responsible for its synthesis is not made. \n\nSo that's a nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop. That would be a good candidate. \n\nLet me check other mutants.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal after ATG starts with TTTCTCGCTGGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence has TTTTACGCTG... \n\nWait, the first few letters after ATG: T T T T A C G C T...\n\nWait let's parse the first part:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant3: T T T T A C G C T...\n\nSo positions4-6: TTT (original) vs TTT (mutant3's first three after ATG). Then position7: T (original had C here?), wait.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nOriginal's positions4-9: T T T C T C...\n\nMutant3's positions4-9: T T T T A C...\n\nWait so the first codon (positions4-6) is TTT (same as original). The second codon (positions7-9) is TAC (original's was CTC). TAC is Tyr. So the second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. \n\nThen, further on, the mutant3 has a change in the sequence: the original has GGT (positions13-15) but mutant3 has GTG (positions13-15?), maybe leading to a different amino acid. Not sure, but again a missense. \n\nBut looking further, maybe there's a frameshift? Let me check the length. Wait the original has 5 exons and 4 introns. Since we are looking at the first exon, the mutation here is in the first exon. \n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion? The question says EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes), not indels. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift through a substitution that creates a stop codon early. \n\nWait in mutant3's case, the first difference is at position7: original is C, mutant3 has T. So changing the second codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a substitution. So the reading frame remains, but the amino acid changes. That could affect the protein, but maybe not enough to stop the compound's synthesis. \n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal's first part: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4's: TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nSo the first few bases after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same)\n\nPosition7: T (mutant has T instead of original's C?), let's parse:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C (CTC)\n\nMutant4's positions7-9: T A C (TAC)\n\nSo the second codon (positions7-9) is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then position10: G (original had G?), wait let me see:\n\nOriginal's position10: G (from the original's CTC GCTGG...), so the third codon (positions10-12) was GCT (Ala). \n\nMutant4's third codon (positions10-12) would be C T A (CTA?), wait let me parse:\n\nAfter the second codon (TAC, positions7-9), the next codon starts at position10:\n\nMutant4's positions10-12: C T A \u2192 CTA (Leu). \n\nSo the third codon is Leu (CTA). Then position13: C (original had G?), so maybe the next codon changes. \n\nWait, perhaps mutant4's sequence is missing some nucleotides? Let me check the entire first part:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4 has \"...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion? Because the mutant4's sequence seems shorter. The original has \"CTCGCTGGTACT...\", mutant4 has \"CGCTACTTCT...\".\n\nWait, maybe in the original, after the first few codons, the sequence is GCTGGTACT... but in mutant4 it's CTACTTCT... suggesting that there's a deletion? \n\nWait, the question states that the mutations are discovered by sequencing the gene in all mutant lines. The options are EMS-induced mutations, which are typically point mutations (single nucleotide changes), not deletions. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift through substitution leading to a stop codon. \n\nWait, perhaps in mutant4's case, there's a frameshift due to a deletion. Wait, the question says \"produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen\", which usually causes point mutations. So perhaps the mutant4 has a substitution that leads to a premature stop. \n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence:\n\nThe first part after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (codon1: Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: CTA (Leu)\n\n13-15: CTT (Leu)\n\n16-18: CTG (Leu)\n\nWait, perhaps further along there's a stop codon introduced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift occurs if there's a deletion or insertion, but since EMS is point mutations, maybe a substitution causes a stop.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the entire first exon's sequence in mutant4. \n\nWait the original's first exon starts with ATG followed by the given sequence, and ends before the first intron. The question states the gene has five exons and four introns, so the first exon is the first part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a mutation creating a stop codon early. Let me look at the mutant4's sequence again:\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let's look for a stop codon early. Let's go step by step:\n\nAfter the start codon (positions1-3), the first codons are:\n\nCodon1 (4-6): TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon2 (7-9): TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon3 (10-12): CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4 (13-15): CTG (Leu)\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant4's sequence after the first few codons might have a stop codon. Let me check further:\n\nAfter the first few codons, the sequence continues as ...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps in codon5 or 6, there's a stop. Let me parse further:\n\nCodon4 (13-15): positions13-15: C T A \u2192 CTA (Leu) ?\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in position numbering. Let me re-express the mutant4's sequence:\n\nStarting after ATG:\n\nLetters 4-?: \n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: T \u2192 position7 is T (so codon2 starts at 7: T A C (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nThen codon3 is positions10-12: C (position10?), T (11), A (12) \u2192 CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4: positions13-15: C (13), T (14), T (15) \u2192 CTT (Leu)\n\nCodon5: positions16-18: C (16), G (17), T (18) \u2192 CGT (Arg)\n\nCodon6: positions19-21: G (19), G (20), A (21) \u2192 GGA (Gly)\n\nHmm, not seeing a stop codon here. Unless further along, but the question's options are among these four, so perhaps mutant4 has a frameshift? Wait, no substitutions can cause a frameshift unless there's an insertion/deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant4 has a mutation that changes a splice site, but the question specifies the mutation is in the first exon's beginning, so splice sites between exons might not be affected here. \n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon's area. So a mutation in the first exon's coding region (since exons are coding regions here). \n\nNow, looking back, mutant2 has a premature stop codon in the second codon (positions7-9: TAA). That would definitely truncate the protein early, so the gene product is non-functional. Thus, the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be made. \n\nMutant3 and 1 have missense mutations. Mutant4's sequence might not have an obvious stop, unless I missed it. Let me check again for mutant4:\n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nAfter codon2 (TAC), codon3 is CTA (Leu), codon4 is CTT (Leu), then maybe codon5 is CGT (Arg), etc. \n\nWait, perhaps after a few more codons, there's a stop? Let me see the entire sequence given for mutant4: \n\nMutant4's sequence ends with \"...TGA\" which is the stop codon. But the question is whether there's an earlier stop. \n\nWait, the original's stop codon is at the end (TGA). If in mutant4, there's a stop codon earlier, then the protein would be truncated. \n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence after the start:\n\nThe first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\n\nLooking for TAA, TAG, or TGA early. \n\nLooking at codons:\n\nCodon1: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon2: TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon3: CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4: CTT (Leu)\n\nCodon5: CGT (Arg)\n\nCodon6: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon7: GAT (Asp)\n\nCodon8: GAA (Glu)\n\nCodon9: CAT (His)\n\nCodon10: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon11: TAT (Tyr)\n\nCodon12: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon13: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon14: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon15: TCG (Ser) \u2014 but wait, the stop codon is TGA at the end. \n\nHmm, so no premature stop codon in mutant4's sequence. \n\nMutant2, on the other hand, has a premature stop at codon2 (positions7-9: TAA). So the protein would be very short, non-functional. \n\nSo the answer should be Mutant2, which is option A. \n\nWait, the options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4. \n\nYes, so the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon. The goal is to disrupt the gene's function, likely via a premature stop codon or frameshift. \n\n**Mutant 1** introduces a substitution in the second codon (CTC \u2192 CTA, still Leu) and alters the third codon (GCT \u2192 CGC, Ala \u2192 Arg). This is a missense mutation and may not fully eliminate the protein. \n\n**Mutant 2** changes the second codon (positions 7-9) to TAA, a stop codon. This truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional, which would likely eliminate the compound. \n\n**Mutant 3** has substitutions leading to missense mutations (CTC \u2192 TAC, Leu \u2192 Tyr; others) but no premature stop. \n\n**Mutant 4** also introduces missense mutations (e.g., CTC \u2192 TAC) but does not introduce a premature stop codon early in the sequence. \n\nThe only mutation causing a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, making it the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the problem is about finding which mutation in the gene would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley. The gene has five exons and four introns. Since exons are the coding regions, any mutation in them could affect the protein's function. The question is about using EMS mutagenesis and looking at the first exon mutations.\n\nThe intact gene sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon, so that's the first exon here). The mutants have different changes in this region. The goal is to find a mutation that would stop the production of the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means we need to disrupt the gene so that the protein isn't made. How can a mutation in the first exon do that?\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence:\n\nMutant 1: The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCG... The mutant has ATGTTTCTACGCTGG... Wait, let me compare the sequences more carefully. Wait the original first part is 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019. So the first few bases after ATG are TTTCTC. \n\nMutant 1's sequence starts as ATGTTTCTACGCTGG... Wait, looking at the first part: original is \"TTTCTCGCTG...\" versus mutant 1's \"TTTCTACGCTG...\" So comparing positions after the start codon:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCTGGTACTTCTG... (maybe the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTG...)\n\nMutant1: After ATG, it's TTTCTACGCTG... So the change is between the 6th and 7th base? Let me check the exact differences.\n\nOriginal: Let's write the first part in the intact gene:\n\nThe first exon starts with ATG (start codon), then the next bases are T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nWait, looking at the exact sequences given:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant1: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nWait, let me parse the sequences more carefully.

TTT is a stop codon? No, wait stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA. TTT is phenylalanine (F). Wait, so that's okay.

In mutant1, the 7-9 would be C T A (CTA) which is also Leu (since Leu is CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG). So that's a silent mutation?\n\nWait, maybe the difference is at position 8-9? Let me check.\n\nWait the mutant1's sequence is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" So the original's sequence at that spot is \"CTCGCT...\", so the first part after the TTT is CTC, but mutant1 has CTA instead. So the second codon (positions 7-9) changes from CTC to CTA, which is still Leu. So that's a silent mutation here.\n\nWait but maybe the next codon? Let me see. The next codon after that would be positions 10-12: in original it's GCT (Ala), but in mutant1, after the CTA (positions 7-9), the next would be GCT (positions 10-12 still?), so that's same. Wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is at a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation is between the first and second codons. Let's see the exact mutation points.\n\nLooking at the first part of mutant1's sequence: comparing to the original:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...\n\nMutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...\n\nWait, maybe the mutation is a substitution that changes the codon in a way that introduces a stop codon?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at each mutant's change.\n\nLet me look at each mutant's sequence in detail.\n\nFirst, the original sequence:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the first exon's nucleotides:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nPosition 1-3: ATG (start codon)\n\nThen next nucleotides:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 so codon 1 (positions 4-6): TTT (F)\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C \u2192 codon 2: CTC (Leu)\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T \u2192 codon3: GCT (Ala)\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T \u2192 codon4:GGT (Gly)\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T \u2192 codon5:ACT (Thr)\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T \u2192 codon6:TCT (Ser)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nMutant 1's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nSo the difference is between the original and mutant1's sequences. Let me look at the first part:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTT C T C G C T G G T...\n\nWait, the mutant's sequence after ATG is TTT C T A C G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so let's look at positions 7-9. Original at position 7: C, position8: T, position9: C \u2192 CTC (Leu). In mutant1, position7: C, position8: T, position9: A \u2192 CTA (still Leu). So that codon is still Leu. Then position 10: G (same as original). Wait, but after that, perhaps there's a change. Let me check the next part.\n\nWait maybe the mutation is at position 10? Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after the first part is:\n\nOriginal: after the first few codons, the sequence continues as GCTGGTACT...\n\nMutant1 has after the first part: CTACGCTGGTACT...\n\nWait, maybe the substitution is at position 10. Let me check:\n\nOriginal's positions 7-12:\n\nPositions 7-9: CTC (Leu)\n\nPositions 10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nIn mutant1, positions 7-12 would be:\n\npositions 7-9: CTA (Leu)\n\npositions 10-12: GCT \u2192 same as original? Wait, no, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutant1 has a change in the 10th position. Wait, perhaps I need to compare the sequences letter by letter.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nLetters 4-21 (first 18 nucleotides after ATG):\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C \u2192 CTC (codon2)\n\n10: G, 11: C, 12: T \u2192 GCT (codon3)\n\n13: G, 14: G, 15: T \u2192 GGT (codon4)\n\n16: A, 17: C, 18: T \u2192 ACT (codon5)\n\n19: T, 20: C, 21: T \u2192 TCT (codon6)\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nThe first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" Let's parse:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T \u2192 same as original (TTT)\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nSo position9 changed from C to A. So the second codon becomes CTA (Leu). That's a silent mutation because CTA is still Leu. Then the next codon:\n\npositions10-12: C (from the next letters). Wait, the mutant's sequence after CTA (positions7-9) is then C G C T... Wait, maybe I need to look at the next nucleotide. Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant1's sequence is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: CTA (from the TAC part?)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me write the exact letters:\n\nOriginal sequence's first part after ATG:\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nT T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nWait, so between the original and mutant1:\n\nOriginal's 7th nucleotide: C (position7), 8th T (position8), 9th C (position9). So codon2 is CTC.\n\nMutant1's 7th is C, 8th T, 9th A \u2192 CTA (still Leu). Then position10 in mutant1 is C (from the next letter?), so position10 is C?\n\nWait the original's position10 is G. Wait, original's position10 is the first nucleotide of the third codon (positions10-12: GCT). So original's position10 is G. \n\nIn mutant1's sequence, after CTA (positions7-9), the next nucleotide (position10) is C? Because in the mutant's sequence, after \"CTAC\" (positions7-10?), perhaps.\n\nWait maybe I need to parse each position step by step:\n\nOriginal's first 12 nucleotides after ATG (positions4-15?):\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the sequences as strings.\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nAfter ATG, the sequence is:\n\nT T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nSo let me write each position:\n\nPosition 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C \u2192 CTC (codon2)\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T \u2192 GCT (codon3)\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T \u2192 GGT (codon4)\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T \u2192 ACT (codon5)\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T \u2192 TCT (codon6)\n\n22: G\n\n23: T\n\n24: G \u2192 GTG (codon7)\n\nand so on.\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\nPosition7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2, Leu)\n\nPosition10: C (original had G here)\n\nWait, original's position10 is G (part of codon3). In mutant1, position10 is C? Because the sequence after the CTA (positions7-9) would be C G C? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait the mutant's sequence after the first part is written as \"TTTCTACGCTGG...\" So after TTT (positions4-6), the next letters are CTACGCT...\n\nWait, so positions7-10:\n\nPosition7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A \u2192 CTA (codon2)\n\nPosition10: C (from the next letters)\n\nPosition11: G?\n\nWait maybe I need to write the letters step by step:\n\nOriginal's sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-12:\n\nT T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nT T T C T A C G C T...\n\nSo, at position10, original had G (from the original's CTC GCT...), but in mutant1, position10 is C (since the sequence is C T A C G C T... Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me write each position step by step for mutant1:\n\nMutant1 after ATG:\n\nPositions 4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: A\n\n10: C\n\n11: G\n\n12: C \u2192 so codon3 (positions10-12) is C G C \u2192 CGC which is Arg (CGC is Arg). \n\nOriginal's codon3 was GCT (Ala). So here, mutant1 has a change in the third codon: GCT (Ala) \u2192 CGC (Arg). That's a missense mutation, changing Ala to Arg. That could affect the protein's function, but might not stop production. Unless this leads to a premature stop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a frameshift. Wait, but the mutation here is a substitution, not an insertion or deletion, so frameshift is out. \n\nSo in mutant1, the third codon is changed from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). The rest of the codons after that would be shifted? Wait no, substitution doesn't shift the reading frame. So the rest of the codons are read normally, but with the third codon changed. \n\nSo mutant1 has a missense mutation. That might affect the protein, but maybe not eliminate the compound. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the compound, so probably a null mutation, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that truncates the protein.\n\nLooking at the other mutants:\n\nMutant2's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026\n\nComparing the first parts:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTC...\n\nMutant2 has TTT replaced with TTCTAA? Let me parse:\n\nMutant2's first part after ATG is \"TTCTAAGCTGG...\" \n\nWait, let's break it down.\n\nOriginal's first few letters after ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T...\n\nMutant2's after ATG: T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so positions4-6:\n\nOriginal: TTT (positions4-6)\n\nMutant2: T T C \u2192 so codon1 is TTC (Phe), not TTT (also Phe). So that's a silent mutation? Because both TTT and TTC code for Phe.\n\nThen position7: T (original's position7 was C?), no wait let's see:\n\nWait perhaps I need to look at the exact letters. Let me write the first part of mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG is: T T C T A A G C T G G T...\n\nWait, so the first 6 nucleotides after ATG are T T C T A A \u2192 so codon1 (positions4-6) is TTC (still Phe), then the next codon (positions7-9): TAA (which is a stop codon!). \n\nAh! So in Mutant2, the second codon (positions7-9) is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product would be non-functional. That would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the protein responsible for its synthesis is not made. \n\nSo that's a nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop. That would be a good candidate. \n\nLet me check other mutants.\n\nMutant3's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal after ATG starts with TTTCTCGCTGGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence has TTTTACGCTG... \n\nWait, the first few letters after ATG: T T T T A C G C T...\n\nWait let's parse the first part:\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant3: T T T T A C G C T...\n\nSo positions4-6: TTT (original) vs TTT (mutant3's first three after ATG). Then position7: T (original had C here?), wait.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nOriginal's positions4-9: T T T C T C...\n\nMutant3's positions4-9: T T T T A C...\n\nWait so the first codon (positions4-6) is TTT (same as original). The second codon (positions7-9) is TAC (original's was CTC). TAC is Tyr. So the second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. \n\nThen, further on, the mutant3 has a change in the sequence: the original has GGT (positions13-15) but mutant3 has GTG (positions13-15?), maybe leading to a different amino acid. Not sure, but again a missense. \n\nBut looking further, maybe there's a frameshift? Let me check the length. Wait the original has 5 exons and 4 introns. Since we are looking at the first exon, the mutation here is in the first exon. \n\nWait, the mutant3's sequence is written as \"...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\" \n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion? The question says EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations (single nucleotide changes), not indels. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift through a substitution that creates a stop codon early. \n\nWait in mutant3's case, the first difference is at position7: original is C, mutant3 has T. So changing the second codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a substitution. So the reading frame remains, but the amino acid changes. That could affect the protein, but maybe not enough to stop the compound's synthesis. \n\nMutant4's sequence:\n\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal's first part after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal's first part: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4's: TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nSo the first few bases after ATG:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (same)\n\nPosition7: T (mutant has T instead of original's C?), let's parse:\n\nOriginal's positions7-9: C T C (CTC)\n\nMutant4's positions7-9: T A C (TAC)\n\nSo the second codon (positions7-9) is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then position10: G (original had G?), wait let me see:\n\nOriginal's position10: G (from the original's CTC GCTGG...), so the third codon (positions10-12) was GCT (Ala). \n\nMutant4's third codon (positions10-12) would be C T A (CTA?), wait let me parse:\n\nAfter the second codon (TAC, positions7-9), the next codon starts at position10:\n\nMutant4's positions10-12: C T A \u2192 CTA (Leu). \n\nSo the third codon is Leu (CTA). Then position13: C (original had G?), so maybe the next codon changes. \n\nWait, perhaps mutant4's sequence is missing some nucleotides? Let me check the entire first part:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4 has \"...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion? Because the mutant4's sequence seems shorter. The original has \"CTCGCTGGTACT...\", mutant4 has \"CGCTACTTCT...\".\n\nWait, maybe in the original, after the first few codons, the sequence is GCTGGTACT... but in mutant4 it's CTACTTCT... suggesting that there's a deletion? \n\nWait, the question states that the mutations are discovered by sequencing the gene in all mutant lines. The options are EMS-induced mutations, which are typically point mutations (single nucleotide changes), not deletions. Unless the mutation caused a frameshift through substitution leading to a stop codon. \n\nWait, perhaps in mutant4's case, there's a frameshift due to a deletion. Wait, the question says \"produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen\", which usually causes point mutations. So perhaps the mutant4 has a substitution that leads to a premature stop. \n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence:\n\nThe first part after ATG is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions4-6: TTT (codon1: Phe)\n\n7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\n10-12: CTA (Leu)\n\n13-15: CTT (Leu)\n\n16-18: CTG (Leu)\n\nWait, perhaps further along there's a stop codon introduced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a frameshift occurs if there's a deletion or insertion, but since EMS is point mutations, maybe a substitution causes a stop.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the entire first exon's sequence in mutant4. \n\nWait the original's first exon starts with ATG followed by the given sequence, and ends before the first intron. The question states the gene has five exons and four introns, so the first exon is the first part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant4, there's a mutation creating a stop codon early. Let me look at the mutant4's sequence again:\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG is:\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, let's look for a stop codon early. Let's go step by step:\n\nAfter the start codon (positions1-3), the first codons are:\n\nCodon1 (4-6): TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon2 (7-9): TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon3 (10-12): CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4 (13-15): CTG (Leu)\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see:\n\nWait the mutant4's sequence after the first few codons might have a stop codon. Let me check further:\n\nAfter the first few codons, the sequence continues as ...CTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps in codon5 or 6, there's a stop. Let me parse further:\n\nCodon4 (13-15): positions13-15: C T A \u2192 CTA (Leu) ?\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in position numbering. Let me re-express the mutant4's sequence:\n\nStarting after ATG:\n\nLetters 4-?: \n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T \u2192 TTT (codon1)\n\n7: T \u2192 position7 is T (so codon2 starts at 7: T A C (positions7-9: TAC)\n\nThen codon3 is positions10-12: C (position10?), T (11), A (12) \u2192 CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4: positions13-15: C (13), T (14), T (15) \u2192 CTT (Leu)\n\nCodon5: positions16-18: C (16), G (17), T (18) \u2192 CGT (Arg)\n\nCodon6: positions19-21: G (19), G (20), A (21) \u2192 GGA (Gly)\n\nHmm, not seeing a stop codon here. Unless further along, but the question's options are among these four, so perhaps mutant4 has a frameshift? Wait, no substitutions can cause a frameshift unless there's an insertion/deletion, but EMS usually causes point mutations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant4 has a mutation that changes a splice site, but the question specifies the mutation is in the first exon's beginning, so splice sites between exons might not be affected here. \n\nWait, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutation is in the first exon's area. So a mutation in the first exon's coding region (since exons are coding regions here). \n\nNow, looking back, mutant2 has a premature stop codon in the second codon (positions7-9: TAA). That would definitely truncate the protein early, so the gene product is non-functional. Thus, the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be made. \n\nMutant3 and 1 have missense mutations. Mutant4's sequence might not have an obvious stop, unless I missed it. Let me check again for mutant4:\n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence after the first few codons:\n\nAfter codon2 (TAC), codon3 is CTA (Leu), codon4 is CTT (Leu), then maybe codon5 is CGT (Arg), etc. \n\nWait, perhaps after a few more codons, there's a stop? Let me see the entire sequence given for mutant4: \n\nMutant4's sequence ends with \"...TGA\" which is the stop codon. But the question is whether there's an earlier stop. \n\nWait, the original's stop codon is at the end (TGA). If in mutant4, there's a stop codon earlier, then the protein would be truncated. \n\nLooking at the mutant4's sequence after the start:\n\nThe first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA\n\nLooking for TAA, TAG, or TGA early. \n\nLooking at codons:\n\nCodon1: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon2: TAC (Tyr)\n\nCodon3: CTA (Leu)\n\nCodon4: CTT (Leu)\n\nCodon5: CGT (Arg)\n\nCodon6: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon7: GAT (Asp)\n\nCodon8: GAA (Glu)\n\nCodon9: CAT (His)\n\nCodon10: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon11: TAT (Tyr)\n\nCodon12: TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon13: ATT (Ile)\n\nCodon14: GTG (Val)\n\nCodon15: TCG (Ser) \u2014 but wait, the stop codon is TGA at the end. \n\nHmm, so no premature stop codon in mutant4's sequence. \n\nMutant2, on the other hand, has a premature stop at codon2 (positions7-9: TAA). So the protein would be very short, non-functional. \n\nSo the answer should be Mutant2, which is option A. \n\nWait, the options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4. \n\nYes, so the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon. The goal is to disrupt the gene's function, likely via a premature stop codon or frameshift. \n\n**Mutant 1** introduces a substitution in the second codon (CTC \u2192 CTA, still Leu) and alters the third codon (GCT \u2192 CGC, Ala \u2192 Arg). This is a missense mutation and may not fully eliminate the protein. \n\n**Mutant 2** changes the second codon (positions 7-9) to TAA, a stop codon. This truncates the protein early, rendering it non-functional, which would likely eliminate the compound. \n\n**Mutant 3** has substitutions leading to missense mutations (CTC \u2192 TAC, Leu \u2192 Tyr; others) but no premature stop. \n\n**Mutant 4** also introduces missense mutations (e.g., CTC \u2192 TAC) but does not introduce a premature stop codon early in the sequence. \n\nThe only mutation causing a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, making it the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A",
