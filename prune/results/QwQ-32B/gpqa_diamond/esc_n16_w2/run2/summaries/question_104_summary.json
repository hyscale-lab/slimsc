      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a Neptune-mass planet in a circular orbit. The question is comparing the orbital periods based on the observed wavelength shifts. Hmm, I need to recall how the RV method works here.\n\nThe RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines due to the star's motion caused by the planet's gravity. The shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the star's velocity (v) via the Doppler formula. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the shift in wavelength gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude, right?\n\nThe key here is that the velocity semi-amplitude of the star depends on the planet's orbital parameters. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (v) is given by v = (G/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) * (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3)))) * sin(i), where G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet mass, M_s is the star mass, P is the orbital period, and sin(i) is the inclination factor. But since both planets are in circular orbits and assuming the inclination (sin i) is the same for both (since we don't have info suggesting otherwise), maybe that term cancels out when comparing the two.\n\nWait, but the problem states both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. The star masses are the same too. Therefore, the velocity semi-amplitude should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So v \u221d 1/P^(1/3). \n\nGiven that the shifts (\u0394\u03bb) are proportional to v (since \u0394\u03bb = (v/c)*\u03bb), so the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts. Let me denote the shifts as \u0394\u03bb1 and \u0394\u03bb2 for planets 1 and 2. The question says \u0394\u03bb1 is 5 miliangstrom and \u0394\u03bb2 is 7 miliangstrom. \n\nSo v1/v2 = (5/7). But since v \u221d 1/P^(1/3), then (v1/v2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nSo, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). To find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me check that again. Let me write the equations properly.\n\nLet me denote the velocity semi-amplitudes as v1 and v2 for the two stars. Since the shifts are proportional to the velocities, v1/v2 = \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2 = 5/7. \n\nThe formula for v is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P))^(1/3), but since M_p and M_s are the same for both, the proportionality simplifies to v \u221d 1/P^(1/3). Therefore, v1/v2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nWait, let me see: if v \u221d 1/P^(1/3), then v1 = k / P1^(1/3) and v2 = k / P2^(1/3). So v1/v2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). To solve for P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1). \n\nWait, that would mean P2/P1 is (5/7)^3? Wait, but that would give a value less than 1, meaning P2 is smaller than P1. But the options have some numbers like ~1.96 or ~0.36. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the ratio. Let me re-express. Let me write the equation again:\n\nv1 / v2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). \n\nBecause v is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so v1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), v2 to 1/P2^(1/3). So v1/v2 = (P2^(1/3))/(P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n\nSo, given that v1/v2 = 5/7, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7 \u2192 P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (125)/(343) \u2248 0.364. So that would mean P2 is 0.364 times P1, so the orbital period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. But the question asks \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So that would be P2/P1. Wait, but 0.36 is option A, but the question says \"longer than\", so if P2 is shorter, the answer would be 0.36, so option A. But wait, maybe I inverted the ratio?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me see: if the velocity is higher (like v2 is larger than v1), then the period would be smaller. Because velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So higher velocity means shorter period. Since planet 2's star has a bigger shift (7 vs 5), so v2 is larger. Therefore, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. So the question asks how many times longer is planet 2's period compared to planet1? If planet2's period is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer would be 0.36, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.4, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85. So that would make sense. Wait, but let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me recall Kepler's third law for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nv = ( (G * (M_p + M_s) / (M_s)^2 )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0 / P) )^(2/3) ) ... Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard formula is v = K = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^2 (1 + M_p/M_s)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) ) ) * some constants. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified version when M_p << M_s. Since the planet's mass is Neptune-like, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like). So M_p is negligible compared to M_s, so the formula simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_s^2 P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0)^{2/3} )? Wait, perhaps the exact formula is:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (G / (2\u03c0))^{1/3} * ( (M_p / sin i) )^{1/3} / ( (M_s)^{2/3} P^{1/3} ) )\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the terms. Let me check the standard formula.\n\nThe formula is K = ( (G / (R^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (2\u03c0)^{1/3} (M_s + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) )\n\nBut again, when M_p << M_s, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_s^{2} P ) )^{1/3} * (1/(2\u03c0)^{1/3} )^{-1} ? Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of the relation between K and P. Since K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P ))^(1/3), assuming M_p and M_s are the same for both planets, then K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nSince K \u221d (M_p / (M_s^2 P ))^(1/3 ), then for two planets with same M_p and M_s:\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p/(M_s^2 P1) ) / ( M_p/(M_s^2 P2) ) )^{1/3} = ( P2 / P1 )^{1/3 }\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3 }, so (P2/P1) = ( K1/K2 )^3 \n\nWait, that's the same as before. \n\nWait, K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude of star 1, K2 of star 2. Given that the wavelength shifts are proportional to K, since \u0394\u03bb = (v/c)*\u03bb, so the ratio K1/K2 is the same as \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2. \n\nSo K1/K2 = 5/7. \n\nThen (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo that would be approximately 0.36, which is option A. \n\nBut the question is asking \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So P2 is 0.36 times P1. That would mean planet 2's period is 0.36 times that of planet 1, so it's shorter. Therefore, the answer is A. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't invert anything. Let me check again. \n\nSuppose K1 is smaller than K2 (since 5 vs 7 miliangstrom). So planet 2's star has a bigger K, which means the star is moving faster (since K is the velocity semi-amplitude). Since the star's velocity is higher, that implies that the planet is closer, so shorter orbital period. Therefore, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet1, so P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer is 0.36, option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula's direction. Let me think of an example: if the period is longer, then K should be smaller. Because if P increases, then K decreases (since K is inversely proportional to cube root of P). So higher K means shorter period. \n\nSo if K2 is larger (7 vs 5), then P2 is smaller. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ~ 0.36. Therefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but why is option B there? Let me check if I did the math right. (5/7)^3. Let's compute 5 cubed is 125, 7 cubed is 343. 125 divided by 343 is approximately 0.364. So yeah, that's ~0.36. So A is correct. \n\nWait, but the options also include 1.96 which is about (7/5)^2. Maybe someone might invert the ratio? Let me see. If someone thought that since the shift is bigger, the period is longer, which would be wrong. Then they might do (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ~2.74, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the period is proportional to the square of the semi-major axis, but in RV method, the formula is different. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the amplitude of the shift being proportional to velocity, which is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So the velocity ratio is 5/7, so the period ratio is (7/5)^3. Wait, no, because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So solving for P2/P1 gives (K1/K2)^3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period through K = sqrt(G(M_p) a) / (M_s * P), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's use Kepler's third law. The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. But the star's motion is also governed by Kepler's law. The star and planet orbit the common center of mass. The star's orbital speed is v_s = ( (G(M_p + M_s) a_s ) )^(1/2) / P, where a_s is the star's semi-major axis. The planet's semi-major axis a_p is related to the star's a_s via a_s/a_p = M_p/M_s. Since M_p << M_s, a_s is much smaller than a_p, so a_p \u2248 a. \n\nThe radial velocity K (semi-amplitude) is the star's velocity v_s. \n\nSo, v_s = sqrt( G (M_p + M_s) a_s ) / P. \n\nBut since M_p << M_s, M_p + M_s \u2248 M_s. Also, a_s = (M_p / (M_s + M_p )) * a \u2248 (M_p / M_s) a. \n\nSo substituting a_s \u2248 (M_p / M_s) a into v_s:\n\nv_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_s * (M_p / M_s a) ) / P \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, the star's semi-major axis a_s = ( M_p / (M_s + M_p )) * a. Since M_p is negligible, a_s \u2248 (M_p/M_s)*a. \n\nThen, plugging into v_s:\n\nv_s = sqrt( G (M_s) * a_s ) / P \n\nWait, no, the formula is sqrt( G (M_p + M_s) a_s ). Since M_p is negligible, it's sqrt(G M_s a_s)/P.\n\nBut substituting a_s \u2248 (M_p/M_s)*a:\n\nv_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_s * ( M_p / M_s a )) / P \n\nWait, simplifying inside the square root: G*M_s*(M_p/(M_s a )) = G M_p / a \n\nSo v_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_p / a ) / P ?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, let's consider the formula for K (the star's velocity semi-amplitude) in terms of the planet's orbital parameters. \n\nThe formula is K = (v_s) = ( (G (M_p) )^(1/3) / ( (M_s)^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_s)^{2/3} )) ) * (1/(P)^{1/3}) ) * ( 1/(2\u03c0)^{2/3} )^{-1} ? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P))^{1/3}, so K \u221d 1/P^{1/3}. \n\nThus, if K1/K2 = 5/7, then (P2/P1)^{1/3} = 5/7, so P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.36. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A. Let me check the options again. Option A is ~0.36. So I think that's right.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift caused by a star's motion due to an orbiting planet.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method.

Hmm, I need to recall how the RV method works here.\n\nThe RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines due to the star's motion caused by the planet's gravity. The shift in wavelength (\u0394\u03bb) is related to the star's velocity (v) via the Doppler formula. The formula is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the shift in wavelength gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude, right?\n\nThe key here is that the velocity semi-amplitude of the star depends on the planet's orbital parameters. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (v) is given by v = (G/(2\u03c0))^(2/3) * (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3)))) * sin(i), where G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet mass, M_s is the star mass, P is the orbital period, and sin(i) is the inclination factor. But since both planets are in circular orbits and assuming the inclination (sin i) is the same for both (since we don't have info suggesting otherwise), maybe that term cancels out when comparing the two.\n\nWait, but the problem states both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. The star masses are the same too. Therefore, the velocity semi-amplitude should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So v \u221d 1/P^(1/3). \n\nGiven that the shifts (\u0394\u03bb) are proportional to v (since \u0394\u03bb = (v/c)*\u03bb), so the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts. Let me denote the shifts as \u0394\u03bb1 and \u0394\u03bb2 for planets 1 and 2. The question says \u0394\u03bb1 is 5 miliangstrom and \u0394\u03bb2 is 7 miliangstrom. \n\nSo v1/v2 = (5/7). But since v \u221d 1/P^(1/3), then (v1/v2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nSo, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). To find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me check that again. Let me write the equations properly.\n\nLet me denote the velocity semi-amplitudes as v1 and v2 for the two stars. Since the shifts are proportional to the velocities, v1/v2 = \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2 = 5/7. \n\nThe formula for v is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P))^(1/3), but since M_p and M_s are the same for both, the proportionality simplifies to v \u221d 1/P^(1/3). Therefore, v1/v2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nWait, let me see: if v \u221d 1/P^(1/3), then v1 = k / P1^(1/3) and v2 = k / P2^(1/3). So v1/v2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). To solve for P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = (P2/P1). \n\nWait, that would mean P2/P1 is (5/7)^3? Wait, but that would give a value less than 1, meaning P2 is smaller than P1. But the options have some numbers like ~1.96 or ~0.36. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the ratio. Let me re-express. Let me write the equation again:\n\nv1 / v2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). \n\nBecause v is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so v1 is proportional to 1/P1^(1/3), v2 to 1/P2^(1/3). So v1/v2 = (P2^(1/3))/(P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n\nSo, given that v1/v2 = 5/7, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7 \u2192 P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (125)/(343) \u2248 0.364. So that would mean P2 is 0.364 times P1, so the orbital period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. But the question asks \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So that would be P2/P1. Wait, but 0.36 is option A, but the question says \"longer than\", so if P2 is shorter, the answer would be 0.36, so option A. But wait, maybe I inverted the ratio?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me see: if the velocity is higher (like v2 is larger than v1), then the period would be smaller. Because velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So higher velocity means shorter period. Since planet 2's star has a bigger shift (7 vs 5), so v2 is larger. Therefore, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. So the question asks how many times longer is planet 2's period compared to planet1? If planet2's period is shorter, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nv = ( (G * (M_p + M_s) / (M_s)^2 )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2\u03c0))^(2/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0 / P) )^(2/3) ) ... Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, the standard formula is v = K = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_s)^2 (1 + M_p/M_s)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) ) ) * some constants. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the simplified version when M_p << M_s. Since the planet's mass is Neptune-like, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like). So M_p is negligible compared to M_s, so the formula simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p ) / ( M_s^2 P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2\u03c0)^{2/3} )? Wait, perhaps the exact formula is:\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (G / (2\u03c0))^{1/3} * ( (M_p / sin i) )^{1/3} / ( (M_s)^{2/3} P^{1/3} ) )\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the terms. Let me check the standard formula.\n\nThe formula is K = ( (G / (R^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (2\u03c0)^{1/3} (M_s + M_p)^{2/3} ) ) )\n\nBut again, when M_p << M_s, this simplifies to K \u2248 ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_s^{2} P ) )^{1/3} * (1/(2\u03c0)^{1/3} )^{-1} ? Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of the relation between K and P. Since K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P ))^(1/3), assuming M_p and M_s are the same for both planets, then K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nSince K \u221d (M_p / (M_s^2 P ))^(1/3 ), then for two planets with same M_p and M_s:\n\nK1/K2 = ( (M_p/(M_s^2 P1) ) / ( M_p/(M_s^2 P2) ) )^{1/3} = ( P2 / P1 )^{1/3 }\n\nSo K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3 }, so (P2/P1) = ( K1/K2 )^3 \n\nWait, that's the same as before. \n\nWait, K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude of star 1, K2 of star 2. Given that the wavelength shifts are proportional to K, since \u0394\u03bb = (v/c)*\u03bb, so the ratio K1/K2 is the same as \u0394\u03bb1/\u0394\u03bb2. \n\nSo K1/K2 = 5/7. \n\nThen (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357. \n\nSo that would be approximately 0.36, which is option A. \n\nBut the question is asking \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" So P2 is 0.36 times P1. That would mean planet 2's period is 0.36 times that of planet 1, so it's shorter. Therefore, the answer is A. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't invert anything. Let me check again. \n\nSuppose K1 is smaller than K2 (since 5 vs 7 miliangstrom). So planet 2's star has a bigger K, which means the star is moving faster (since K is the velocity semi-amplitude). Since the star's velocity is higher, that implies that the planet is closer, so shorter orbital period. Therefore, the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet1, so P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer is 0.36, option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula's direction. Let me think of an example: if the period is longer, then K should be smaller. Because if P increases, then K decreases (since K is inversely proportional to cube root of P). So higher K means shorter period. \n\nSo if K2 is larger (7 vs 5), then P2 is smaller. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ~ 0.36. Therefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but why is option B there? Let me check if I did the math right. (5/7)^3. Let's compute 5 cubed is 125, 7 cubed is 343. 125 divided by 343 is approximately 0.364. So yeah, that's ~0.36. So A is correct. \n\nWait, but the options also include 1.96 which is about (7/5)^2. Maybe someone might invert the ratio? Let me see. If someone thought that since the shift is bigger, the period is longer, which would be wrong. Then they might do (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ~2.74, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe someone thought that the period is proportional to the square of the semi-major axis, but in RV method, the formula is different. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the amplitude of the shift being proportional to velocity, which is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So the velocity ratio is 5/7, so the period ratio is (7/5)^3. Wait, no, because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So solving for P2/P1 gives (K1/K2)^3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period through K = sqrt(G(M_p) a) / (M_s * P), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's use Kepler's third law. The orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. But the star's motion is also governed by Kepler's law. The star and planet orbit the common center of mass. The star's orbital speed is v_s = ( (G(M_p + M_s) a_s ) )^(1/2) / P, where a_s is the star's semi-major axis. The planet's semi-major axis a_p is related to the star's a_s via a_s/a_p = M_p/M_s. Since M_p << M_s, a_s is much smaller than a_p, so a_p \u2248 a. \n\nThe radial velocity K (semi-amplitude) is the star's velocity v_s. \n\nSo, v_s = sqrt( G (M_p + M_s) a_s ) / P. \n\nBut since M_p << M_s, M_p + M_s \u2248 M_s. Also, a_s = (M_p / (M_s + M_p )) * a \u2248 (M_p / M_s) a. \n\nSo substituting a_s \u2248 (M_p / M_s) a into v_s:\n\nv_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_s * (M_p / M_s a) ) / P \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, the star's semi-major axis a_s = ( M_p / (M_s + M_p )) * a. Since M_p is negligible, a_s \u2248 (M_p/M_s)*a. \n\nThen, plugging into v_s:\n\nv_s = sqrt( G (M_s) * a_s ) / P \n\nWait, no, the formula is sqrt( G (M_p + M_s) a_s ). Since M_p is negligible, it's sqrt(G M_s a_s)/P.\n\nBut substituting a_s \u2248 (M_p/M_s)*a:\n\nv_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_s * ( M_p / M_s a )) / P \n\nWait, simplifying inside the square root: G*M_s*(M_p/(M_s a )) = G M_p / a \n\nSo v_s \u2248 sqrt( G M_p / a ) / P ?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, let's consider the formula for K (the star's velocity semi-amplitude) in terms of the planet's orbital parameters. \n\nThe formula is K = (v_s) = ( (G (M_p) )^(1/3) / ( (M_s)^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_s)^{2/3} )) ) * (1/(P)^{1/3}) ) * ( 1/(2\u03c0)^{2/3} )^{-1} ? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key point is that K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s^2 P))^{1/3}, so K \u221d 1/P^{1/3}. \n\nThus, if K1/K2 = 5/7, then (P2/P1)^{1/3} = 5/7, so P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 0.36. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A. Let me check the options again. Option A is ~0.36. So I think that's right.\n\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift caused by a star's motion due to an orbiting planet. The shift in wavelength (\u2206\u03bb) is proportional to the star's velocity semi-amplitude (v). For both planets, the star masses and planet masses are the same, so the velocity semi-amplitude (v) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P). \n\nGiven \u2206\u03bb\u2081 = 5 miliangstrom and \u2206\u03bb\u2082 = 7 miliangstrom, the ratio of velocities is \\( \\frac{v\u2081}{v\u2082} = \\frac{5}{7} \\). Since \\( v \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{v\u2081}{v\u2082} = \\left( \\frac{P\u2082}{P\u2081} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( \\frac{5}{7} = \\left( \\frac{P\u2082}{P\u2081} \\right)^{1/3} \\), cubing both sides gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{P\u2082}{P\u2081} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 \\approx 0.36\n\\]\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, so the answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

The planet's semi-major axis is a_p, and the total separation is a = a_s + a_p. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's (since the planet is Neptune mass and the star is sun-like), we can approximate a_s \u2248 (M_p / M_s) * a_p. But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, a_s is negligible compared to a_p, so the star's velocity is approximately v \u2248 (2\u03c0 a_s)/P. But a_s = (M_p/(M_s + M_p)) * a.

Let's see:\n\nThe P in the denominator and the P^(2/3) from the square term inside the cube root. Let me write exponents:\n\nThe term inside the cube root has P squared, so when taking the 1/3, that's P^(2/3). So overall, the P terms are (1/P) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3). \n\nSo overall, v \u221d (M_p / M_s) * (1/P)^(1/3) * [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_s) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut since we're comparing two cases where M_p and M_s are the same (since the problem states both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and stars same as each other and sun-like), the constants and masses would be the same. Therefore, the ratio of velocities between the two planets would depend on (1/P)^(1/3). \n\nWait, the problem states that the spectral line shifts (which corresponds to the velocity semi-amplitude K) are 5 and 7 miliangstroms. Since the velocity is proportional to the shift (since the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity), the ratio of their velocities (v2 / v1) is 7/5. \n\nBut since v is proportional to (M_p/M_s)^(1) * (1/P)^(1/3), and since M_p and M_s are same for both, then the ratio v2/v1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) \n\nWait, more precisely, since v \u221d (1/P^(1/3)), then v2 / v1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote v \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). So v2 / v1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (v2/v1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nWe can rearrange this to find P2/P1. \n\nLet me plug in v2/v1 = 7/5. \n\nSo (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nLet me cube both sides:\n\n(7/5)^3 = (P1/P2)\n\nSo P1/P2 = 343 / 125 \u2248 2.744\n\nTherefore, P2/P1 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364. Wait, but that would mean that the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1? But the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than #1's. If P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter. But the options don't have 0.36 as the answer for longer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again. The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 vs 5), then the velocity is higher for planet 2. Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), higher K means lower P. So planet #2 has a shorter period. But the question is asking how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. If P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1, so the answer would be like 0.36, which is option A. But let me confirm again.\n\nWait, let's go through the equations again. Let me define variables clearly.\n\nLet me denote for planet 1: K1 = 5 mA (miliangstroms). For planet 2: K2 =7 mA. \n\nThe formula derived earlier: K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). Since all other factors (M_p, M_s) are the same, the ratio K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (7/5) = (P1/P2)^{1/3} \u2192 (P1/P2) = (7/5)^3 \u2192 P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than #1's. Since 0.36 is less than 1, that would mean it's shorter. So the answer is A) ~0.36. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.36 as option A, so that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me check again. \n\nSuppose K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_s)^{2/3} * (1/P)^{1/3}. So if K increases, then P must decrease. So a higher K means shorter period. Since K2 is larger (7 vs 5), then P2 is smaller. So the period of 2 is shorter than 1, so the ratio (P2/P1) is ~0.36, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n",

So overall, the P terms are (1/P) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3). \n\nSo overall, v \u221d (M_p / M_s) * (1/P)^(1/3) * [ (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_s) ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nBut since we're comparing two cases where M_p and M_s are the same (since the problem states both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and stars same as each other and sun-like), the constants and masses would be the same. Therefore, the ratio of velocities between the two planets would depend on (1/P)^(1/3). \n\nWait, the problem states that the spectral line shifts (which corresponds to the velocity semi-amplitude K) are 5 and 7 miliangstroms. Since the velocity is proportional to the shift (since the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity), the ratio of their velocities (v2 / v1) is 7/5. \n\nBut since v is proportional to (M_p/M_s)^(1) * (1/P)^(1/3), and since M_p and M_s are same for both, then the ratio v2/v1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) \n\nWait, more precisely, since v \u221d (1/P^(1/3)), then v2 / v1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me denote v \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). So v2 / v1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1 / P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (v2/v1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nWe can rearrange this to find P2/P1. \n\nLet me plug in v2/v1 = 7/5. \n\nSo (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nLet me cube both sides:\n\n(7/5)^3 = (P1/P2)\n\nSo P1/P2 = 343 / 125 \u2248 2.744\n\nTherefore, P2/P1 = 125/343 \u2248 0.364. Wait, but that would mean that the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1? But the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than #1's. If P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter. But the options don't have 0.36 as the answer for longer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again. The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 vs 5), then the velocity is higher for planet 2. Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), higher K means lower P. So planet #2 has a shorter period. But the question is asking how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's. If P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1, so the answer would be like 0.36, which is option A. But let me confirm again.\n\nWait, let's go through the equations again. Let me define variables clearly.\n\nLet me denote for planet 1: K1 = 5 mA (miliangstroms). For planet 2: K2 =7 mA. \n\nThe formula derived earlier: K \u221d 1 / P^(1/3). Since all other factors (M_p, M_s) are the same, the ratio K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, (7/5) = (P1/P2)^{1/3} \u2192 (P1/P2) = (7/5)^3 \u2192 P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 \u2248 (0.714)^3 \u2248 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than #1's. Since 0.36 is less than 1, that would mean it's shorter. So the answer is A) ~0.36. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.36 as option A, so that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me check again. \n\nSuppose K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_s)^{2/3} * (1/P)^{1/3}. So if K increases, then P must decrease. So a higher K means shorter period. Since K2 is larger (7 vs 5), then P2 is smaller. So the period of 2 is shorter than 1, so the ratio (P2/P1) is ~0.36, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). The velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to \\( (1/P^{1/3}) \\), assuming the masses of the planets and stars are the same. \n\nGiven \\( K_2/K_1 = 7/5 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( P_2/P_1 \\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{7}{5} \\implies \\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 \\implies \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\approx 0.357\n\\]\nThis ratio \\( \\approx 0.36 \\) indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1, the answer is \\( \\approx 0.36 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",
