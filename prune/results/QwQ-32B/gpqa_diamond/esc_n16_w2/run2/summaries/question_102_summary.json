      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about a genetic construct in mice and why there's no green signal after crossing with SOX10-Cre mice. Let me parse the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: The construct is bicistronic, meaning it can produce two proteins from one mRNA. The ligand is at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end fused to eGFP. The ligand's expression is under the CBA promoter, which I remember is a strong, constitutive promoter. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. Wait, IRES usually allows for internal ribosomal entry, so maybe the receptor is translated from the same mRNA but starting at the IRES. But the problem mentions a stop codon between the ligand and mCherry in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh right, Cre recombinase can remove the stop codons if it's the right site. Since they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells (since SOX10 is a marker for them), the Cre should excise the lox sites. \n\nWait, the ligand's stop is in loxP-stop-loxP. So Cre would remove that, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together? Because if the stop is removed, the ligand ORF is followed by mCherry. Similarly, the receptor's stop between it and eGFP is in lox2272 sites. Cre can recognize lox2272, right? Because different lox variants might have different specificities, but I think Cre can recombine loxP and lox2272. Wait, maybe not? Wait, I remember that loxP and lox2272 are mutant sites that can only recombine when paired with the same. So maybe Cre can recombine lox2272 but not with loxP. Wait, no, Cre can recombine any lox sites as long as they are in the right orientation. Wait, perhaps the key here is that the stop between ligand and mCherry is flanked by loxP sites, so Cre would excise that, allowing ligand-mCherry to be in frame. The receptor-eGFP's stop is between them in lox2272 sites, so if Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed in frame. \n\nBut the problem states that after crossing with SOX10-Cre (which is active in neural crest cells, where the original ligand-receptor pair is expressed), the offspring don't show green (eGFP) signal. The mCherry is the ligand's tag, but the question is about the absence of green (receptor-eGFP). \n\nPossible reasons: Let me look at the options. \n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop codon wasn't removed, then the receptor would be translated but the eGFP wouldn't, unless the stop is removed. Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop is present, the receptor is translated up to the stop, and the eGFP isn't. If the Cre removes the stop, then the receptor and eGFP would be in frame. \n\nBut the problem says the stop is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So if the Cre is present, it should excise the stop, allowing in-frame fusion. However, maybe the problem is that the Cre didn't excise properly? Or maybe the IRES is involved here. Wait, the receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the construct is bicistronic. The ligand is first, then the stop (for ligand?), but wait the description says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position fused to mCherry. Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the construct details again.\n\nOriginal question's construct description: \n\nThe bicistronic lox-Cre vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP. Between receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. \n\nWait, so the ligand's coding sequence is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop between them? Wait, maybe the ligand is first, then the stop, then mCherry? Or is the ligand's ORF followed by a stop, and then mCherry? Hmm, perhaps the ligand ORF is before the stop, and the mCherry is after. So the construct is like: ligand ORF - stop (in loxP cassette) - mCherry. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be fused to mCherry. If the stop is there, then the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't because the stop would terminate translation. Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the mRNA would have ligand, then a stop (if not removed) so only ligand is made. If the stop is removed, ligand and mCherry are in frame, so ligand-mCherry is expressed. \n\nThe receptor part: The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. But between them is a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So if the stop is present, the receptor is translated, then a stop, and the eGFP isn't. If Cre removes the stop, then receptor-eGFP is made. \n\nBut the receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the question says \"upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element\". So the structure is: CBA promoter drives ligand (with possible mCherry after if the stop is removed), then IRES, then receptor (with possible eGFP after if the stop is removed). \n\nWait, so the bicistronic vector would have the first gene (ligand) under the CBA promoter, and then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA. But in this case, the receptor's own ORF is followed by a stop and eGFP. Wait, perhaps the receptor is in frame with eGFP only if the stop is removed. \n\nSo when Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), the stop between ligand and mCherry is removed (since it's flanked by loxP), so ligand-mCherry is expressed. The stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272. Cre can recognize lox2272? Wait, Cre can recombine any lox sites regardless of type? Or are there different Cre variants? Wait, no, the lox2272 is a mutant site that can only recombine with another lox2272, but not with loxP. Wait, actually, I think that Cre can recombine any lox sites, but the direction matters. Wait, maybe the problem is that the stop between the receptor and eGFP is in a lox2272 cassette. So if the Cre is present, it can recombine the lox2272 sites, removing the stop. But maybe the problem is that the IRES is not allowing the receptor to be translated? Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the receptor should be translated via IRES. \n\nWait the question says that when they tested the construct in a Western blot after transfection into primary astrocytes, they saw signals proportional to actin. But that might not be relevant here. The key is that in the mouse model bred with SOX10-Cre, the eGFP (from the receptor) isn't seen. \n\nSo why no green? The eGFP is part of the receptor-eGFP fusion, which requires that the stop between them is removed by Cre. If the stop wasn't removed, the receptor would be translated but not the eGFP. Alternatively, maybe the Cre didn't excise the stop properly. \n\nWait, the stop between receptor and eGFP is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. If the Cre can't recombine lox2272 sites, then the stop remains. Wait, but Cre can recombine lox2272? Let me recall: loxP is the standard site. There are mutant sites like lox511, lox2272, which are designed to be non-functional unless paired with another of the same. Wait, no, actually, Cre can recombine any lox sites, but when they are in the same orientation, it can cause inversion or excision. Wait, but the lox2272 is a variant that has a different sequence, so Cre can still recognize it, but maybe the recombination efficiency is different? Or perhaps the lox2272 can't recombine with loxP, but in this case, the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by two lox2272 sites. So if Cre is present, it should be able to remove the stop, assuming the sites are in the correct orientation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame even after the stop is removed. For example, maybe the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, but the coding sequences aren't in frame. So even if the stop is removed, the receptor's C-terminus and eGFP's start aren't in frame, so the fusion protein isn't made. That would be option D. \n\nAlternatively, the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing (option C), but the CBA promoter is already there. The CBA is a strong promoter, so maybe that's not the issue. \n\nOption B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being visible, but the question is about no signal at all, not just mislocalization. \n\nOption A suggests a paracrine relationship, but that's about ligand-receptor interaction not being autocrine, so maybe they don't activate each other, but the question is about the expression of the receptor-eGFP, not the function. \n\nSo between D and maybe the lox2272 issue. Wait, the problem states that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after IRES. So the ligand is translated via the promoter, and the receptor via IRES. But the eGFP part requires the stop between receptor and eGFP to be removed. \n\nIf the stop wasn't removed, then the receptor would be expressed but not fused to eGFP. So the eGFP wouldn't be present. However, the question says that the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor, so if the stop is there, the eGFP isn't translated. So the problem is why the stop wasn't removed. \n\nWait, perhaps the Cre didn't excise the lox2272 sites. Because maybe the lox2272 can only be recombined by a Cre variant, but the SOX10-Cre line uses standard Cre? Wait, the question doesn't mention any special Cre. If the lox2272 sites can't be recombined by standard Cre, then the stop remains. But I think that Cre can recombine any lox sites, regardless of the variant. Wait, actually, lox2272 is a mutant that is a weaker site, but still functional. Wait, maybe the problem is that the two lox sites (loxP and lox2272) are different, but in this case, for the receptor's stop, it's between two lox2272 sites. So Cre should recombine them, removing the stop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the orientation of the lox sites is wrong. The question doesn't specify, but perhaps the stop between ligand and mCherry is in loxP, so Cre can remove it, but the stop between receptor and eGFP is in lox2272. If the lox2272 sites are in the opposite orientation, then Cre might not excise. But without that info, perhaps the intended answer is that the stop wasn't removed, leading to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame. \n\nAlternatively, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Even if the stop is removed, if the reading frames don't align, the fusion wouldn't work. For example, maybe the stop was between them, so removing it would put the receptor's stop codon (if any?) or just the coding sequences. Wait, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, so the receptor's C-terminus is followed by a stop, then the eGFP starts. Removing the stop would mean the receptor's last codon is followed by eGFP's start. If the stop was in between, then after removing it, the receptor's end and eGFP's start must be in frame. If they aren't, then the eGFP wouldn't be translated properly. So maybe the fusion is out of frame, so even without the stop, the eGFP isn't made. That would be D. \n\nAlternatively, the problem could be that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't translated. But the IRES is supposed to allow translation of the second cistron. If the receptor isn't translated at all, then eGFP wouldn't be there either. But the question states that they used the construct in a Western blot after transfection, so maybe they saw the receptor-eGFP when expressed in astrocytes, but in the mouse model, maybe the IRES isn't active in neural crest cells? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the CBA promoter might not be active in neural crest cells, but CBA is a constitutive promoter, so that's unlikely. \n\nHmm. The options given are A-D. The question says that the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, but between them is a stop in the lox2272 cassette. If the Cre successfully removes the stop, then the fusion is in frame. If not, then no eGFP. \n\nWait, the problem states that when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes and did a Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, maybe in that experiment, they saw the receptor-eGFP? But if the construct requires Cre to remove the stop, then in the astrocyte culture (which may not have Cre), the stop would be present. Unless in that experiment they used a Cre-expressing plasmid as well? The question doesn't say. The wording is: \"after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture.\" So maybe they transfected the plasmid alone, so the stop remains, so the receptor isn't fused to eGFP. But the question says \"the ligand and the receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells,\" but the test was in astrocytes. \n\nWait, perhaps the Western blot showed that the ligand and receptor were expressed, but maybe the eGFP wasn't? Or maybe they used Cre in the transfection? The question isn't entirely clear. The user might have made the construct with the stops, so without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since it's under CBA), but mCherry isn't (because the stop is there). The receptor would be expressed via IRES, but without the stop removal, the eGFP isn't. But when they did the Western, maybe they used a Cre-expressing plasmid to test, so they could see the eGFP. But the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct. Maybe they saw both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, implying that the fusion works when the stops are removed. \n\nTherefore, in the mouse model, the problem must be that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Since the mice are bred with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells where the receptor is supposed to be expressed. The Cre should remove both stops. The ligand's stop is in loxP, so Cre would remove that. The receptor's stop is in lox2272. If the Cre can remove that, then the eGFP should be present. \n\nIf the eGFP isn't there, maybe the fusion is out of frame (D). Alternatively, perhaps the receptor is stuck in the Golgi (B). But why would that be? The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it's processed in the Golgi, but being stuck there wouldn't prevent its presence, just its localization. Unless it's retained and not transported to the cell surface, but the question says no green signal at all. \n\nAnother possibility: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing (C). But the CBA promoter is already there. The question says \"the ligand and the receptor are initially expressed in the neural crest cells\", so maybe the CBA promoter is not active in those cells. Wait, CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So even if the stop is removed, the coding sequences are not in frame. So the eGFP isn't translated. That would explain no green signal. So D is a possibility. \n\nThe question's options include D, which states that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that even after removing the stop, the fusion is not possible. So the most likely answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bicistronic construct's IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed, but the question mentions the receptor is fused to eGFP via the stop's removal. \n\nHmm. Given the options, D seems plausible. The problem could be that the fusion wasn't in frame. So the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe construct's bicistronic vector includes a stop codon between the receptor and eGFP, flanked by lox2272 sites. When crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, Cre recombinase should excise the stop, allowing in-frame fusion of the receptor and eGFP. However, the absence of green fluorescence suggests this fusion failed. Option D posits that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Even if the stop is removed, a frameshift would prevent proper eGFP translation. Other options are less likely: the ligand-receptor paracrine relationship (A) doesn't explain lack of expression, Golgi retention (B) wouldn't eliminate all signal, and the CBA promoter (for ligand) and IRES (for receptor) should drive expression without needing enhancers (C). Thus, the most plausible explanation is a frameshift between the receptor and eGFP.\n\nAnswer: D",

Or maybe they used Cre in the transfection? The question isn't entirely clear. The user might have made the construct with the stops, so without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since it's under CBA), but mCherry isn't (because the stop is there). The receptor would be expressed via IRES, but without the stop removal, the eGFP isn't. But when they did the Western, maybe they used a Cre-expressing plasmid to test, so they could see the eGFP. But the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct. Maybe they saw both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, implying that the fusion works when the stops are removed. \n\nTherefore, in the mouse model, the problem must be that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Since the mice are bred with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells where the receptor is supposed to be expressed. The Cre should remove both stops. The ligand's stop is in loxP, so Cre would remove that. The receptor's stop is in lox2272. If the Cre can remove that, then the eGFP should be present. \n\nIf the eGFP isn't there, maybe the fusion is out of frame (D). Alternatively, perhaps the receptor is stuck in the Golgi (B). But why would that be? The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it's processed in the Golgi, but being stuck there wouldn't prevent its presence, just its localization. Unless it's retained and not transported to the cell surface, but the question says no green signal at all. \n\nAnother possibility: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing (C). But the CBA promoter is already there. The question says \"the ligand and the receptor are initially expressed in the neural crest cells\", so maybe the CBA promoter is not active in those cells. Wait, CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So even if the stop is removed, the coding sequences are not in frame. So the eGFP isn't translated. That would explain no green signal. So D is a possibility. \n\nThe question's options include D, which states that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that even after removing the stop, the fusion is not possible. So the most likely answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bicistronic construct's IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed, but the question mentions the receptor is fused to eGFP via the stop's removal. \n\nHmm. Given the options, D seems plausible. The problem could be that the fusion wasn't in frame. So the answer is D.\n\n\nThe construct's bicistronic vector includes a stop codon between the receptor and eGFP, flanked by lox2272 sites. When crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, Cre recombinase should excise the stop, allowing in-frame fusion of the receptor and eGFP. However, the absence of green fluorescence suggests this fusion failed. Option D posits that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Even if the stop is removed, a frameshift would prevent proper eGFP translation. Other options are less likely: the ligand-receptor paracrine relationship (A) doesn't explain lack of expression, Golgi retention (B) wouldn't eliminate all signal, and the CBA promoter (for ligand) and IRES (for receptor) should drive expression without needing enhancers (C). Thus, the most plausible explanation is a frameshift between the receptor and eGFP.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about a genetic construct in mice and why there's no green signal after using SOX10-Cre. Hmm. Let me try to parse all the details here.\n\nFirst, the setup: they created a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre. The ligand is at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Wait, but there are stop codons in loxP cassettes. Oh right, the ligand's stop is in a loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor's stop is in lox2272-stop-lox2272. \n\nWhen using Cre, the idea is that Cre would remove the stop codons, allowing translation of the fusion proteins. But since they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells (since the ligand and receptor were initially expressed there), maybe the Cre is cutting the lox sites. Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different. Oh, right, lox2272 is a mutant version that Cre can also recognize but might have different orientation or something. Wait, I think the key here is the type of lox sites. \n\nThe ligand's stop is flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor's by lox2272. Since Cre can recombine both, but maybe the orientation matters. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the two different lox sites (loxP vs lox2272) can't recombine with each other. So if the Cre is present, it can remove the stop in the ligand (loxP), but the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which maybe requires a different configuration? Or maybe the stops are in the same orientation. Let me think again.\n\nThe bicistronic construct would normally have the ligand and receptor under separate controls. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, so that's its own promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so normally IRES allows for internal ribosomal entry, so even if the first gene is translated, the second can be translated as a bicistronic message. But here, maybe the stops are in the way. Wait, the ligand has a stop between its ORF and mCherry, which is flanked by loxP. So if Cre is present, it would remove the stop, allowing the ligand to be fused to mCherry. Similarly, the receptor's stop between its ORF and eGFP is flanked by lox2272. So Cre would remove that stop, allowing the receptor to be fused to eGFP.\n\nBut the problem is that in the offspring, when they use SOX10-Cre (which is active in neural crest cells), they don't see the green (eGFP) signal. So maybe the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't happening properly. \n\nLooking at the options, D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean even if the stop is removed, the reading frame is messed up, so the GFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, option B says it's stuck in the Golgi. But why would that stop the signal? If the receptor is stuck in Golgi, maybe it's not transported to the membrane, but the GFP might still be visible in the cell, unless it's not properly expressed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Cre didn't remove the stop for the receptor. Because the stop is flanked by lox2272 sites. Since Cre can recombine loxP and lox2272, but perhaps the direction matters. Wait, the question states that between ligand and mCherry is loxP-stop-loxP, and between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is present, it can recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop for ligand-mCherry. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would allow Cre to recombine and remove the stop between receptor and eGFP. But wait, the problem might be that the two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) can't be recombined together. Wait no, each stop is in their own cassette. The Cre would act on each independently. So if the Cre is present, both stops should be removed. \n\nWait, but the construct is in a mouse that's homozygous for the construct. Then crossed with SOX10-Cre. The offspring would have the Cre active in neural crest cells, so in those cells, the stops would be removed. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed. But the problem is the green (eGFP) isn't seen. \n\nSo why no GFP? Maybe the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF is connected to eGFP's, but if the stop was in the middle, maybe the reading frame is off. For example, if the stop was between the receptor and eGFP, then when the stop is removed, the receptor's C-terminus is fused to eGFP's N-terminus. If the stop was in frame, then the fusion would be in frame. But if the stop was out of frame, removing it would put them out of frame. Wait, but the stop codon is between them. So the stop is part of the gene, so when the stop is removed, the two ORFs are connected. For example, the receptor's last codon would be followed by the first codon of eGFP. But that requires that the last amino acid of the receptor is followed by the start of eGFP in the same reading frame. Otherwise, the fusion would create a frameshift. \n\nSo if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame (option D), then the GFP wouldn't be produced properly. That would explain no green signal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ligand and receptor are paracrine (option A), but that would affect their interaction but not the expression of the GFP. The question is about not seeing the green, which is the eGFP tag on the receptor. \n\nAnother option is C: the enhancer missing. If the enhancer for ligand/receptor is missing, then maybe the construct isn't expressed. But the CBA promoter is a strong one, so maybe that's not it. Also, the problem is specifically the green signal, not both. \n\nOption B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, maybe it's retained in the Golgi, so GFP isn't visible. But then, maybe it would still be present in the cell, just not at the membrane. But the question says they don't observe a green signal at all. So maybe it's not expressed. \n\nSo the most likely is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because even if the stop is removed, if the frameshift occurs, the GFP wouldn't be made. The other options don't directly address the failure of GFP expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working? But the ligand is under CBA promoter, so maybe the receptor's expression is via IRES. Wait, the bicistronic construct: the ligand is under CBA, then the receptor is after an IRES. Wait, the setup is a bicistronic vector with ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor at 3' fused to eGFP. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is IRES. So the ligand is translated via the CBA promoter, then the IRES allows for translation of the receptor. But the receptor's ORF is after the IRES. Wait, but the receptor has its own stop flanked by lox2272. Hmm, maybe the IRES is part of the construct so that the receptor is translated from the same mRNA as the ligand, but that might be a separate pathway. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the receptor's stop is in the lox2272 cassette. If the Cre didn't remove the stop, then the receptor wouldn't be fused to eGFP. But why wouldn't Cre remove it? Because maybe the Cre is only acting on loxP sites, not lox2272? Wait no, Cre can recombine both, but the direction might matter. Wait, the loxP and lox2272 have different orientation? The problem might be that the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP? Wait, perhaps the two different lox sites (loxP and lox2272) would not allow recombination when using Cre. Wait, no, the Cre can recognize both, but the direction of the sites is important. For example, if the stop is between loxP and loxP, then Cre would remove it. Similarly, between lox2272 and lox2272, Cre can remove it. But if the two different sites were adjacent, that's a problem. But in this case, each stop is between their own types. So the ligand's stop is between loxP, so Cre can remove it. The receptor's stop is between lox2272, so Cre can remove that too. \n\nHmm. Then why no GFP? Then the most likely is frame shift. So D is the answer. \n\nAnother angle: the construct is bicistronic, but maybe the receptor's ORF and eGFP are not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, the fusion protein isn't made properly. That's D. \n\nAlternatively, the antibodies were used, but the question says after transfection in astrocytes they did a Western, so maybe the construct works there, but in the mouse model, something else. Wait, but the question states that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins (the ligand and receptor?), so maybe in the Western they confirmed that the fusion proteins are expressed. But in the mouse model, when using Cre, maybe the problem is that the receptor-eGFP is not in frame. So the Western would show that the construct works (if the stop was removed in the experiment), but in the mouse model, maybe the Cre wasn't active? But they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest cells where the ligand/receptor are expressed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ligand's mCherry is expressed (since the stop is in loxP, which Cre can remove), but the receptor's eGFP is not because the lox2272 sites were not recombined. Wait, but why? The Cre should be able to remove both stops. Unless the direction of the lox sites matters. For example, if the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP, but that might not matter. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is a mutant that inverts the sequence, so when recombined, the stop is removed but the frameshift occurs. Wait, no, the key is that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. Removing the stop would connect them, but if the reading frames are not aligned, then the eGFP would not be in frame. \n\nSo the most plausible answer is D. The other options don't directly explain the lack of GFP. The paracrine (A) is about their interaction's effect, but the question is about the expression of the tag. So D is the best answer.\n",
