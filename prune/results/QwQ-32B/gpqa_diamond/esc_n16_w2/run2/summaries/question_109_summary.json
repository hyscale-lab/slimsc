      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. We need to figure out which of the given options is not allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws like angular momentum and parity. \n\nFirst, let me recall the given condition: the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the problem states that T(NN) is 0, substituting that gives 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So rearranged, S + L must be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means S + L is odd. \n\nNow, each of the options gives a transition from the initial 1S0 state. The initial state is 1S0, which means S (total spin) is 0 because the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Here, the first number is 1, so 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L part is S, which corresponds to L=0. The total angular momentum J is 0 as well, since the last number is 0. \n\nThe particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of a particle is (-1)^{L_X}, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Since its parity is -1, that means (-1)^{L_X} = -1 \u2192 L_X must be odd. So the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (denoted by the lowercase letter in the options) must be odd. Let me check each option's particle:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. The lowercase letter is 'p', which is the spectroscopic notation for l=1 (since s=0, p=1, d=2, etc.). So L_X is 1, which is odd. That's okay.\n\nB) 3S1 + p: The particle here is p (l=1 again), so L_X is 1. Also okay.\n\nC) 3D3 + f: The lowercase f corresponds to l=3 (since f is the 3rd letter after s). So L_X is 3, which is odd. That's okay.\n\nD) 3P0 + s: The particle is s, so l=0. Then L_X is 0, which is even. But the particle's parity would be (-1)^0 = 1, but the problem states X has parity -1. Therefore, this would violate parity conservation. Wait, but hold on\u2014the question says \"emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". So the parity of X must be -1. So if the emitted particle has l=0, its parity is +1, which contradicts. So option D's particle is s, which would have parity +1, so that can't be allowed. But let me check the rest first.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider more factors. The problem also mentions conservation of angular momentum and the Pauli condition. Let's go through each option step by step, considering both angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli condition.\n\nStarting with the initial state: 1S0. So S_initial =0, L_initial =0, J_initial=0.\n\nThe emitted particle X has angular momentum l_X (given by the lowercase letter). The final NN state has some S_final, L_final, and the particle's angular momentum l_X must combine with the NN's L_final such that total angular momentum is conserved. Since the initial total angular momentum J_initial is 0, the total angular momentum of the final state (NN plus X) must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L_NN) and the X's angular momentum (l_X) must give 0. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum conservation requires that the total J of the initial (0) equals the vector sum of the final NN's J_NN and the X's J_X. However, since the problem gives the NN's final state term symbol (like 7D1 which would have J=1), and the emitted particle X's angular momentum l_X (from its letter). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the final NN state has some angular momentum L_NN and spin S_NN, so their total angular momentum J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (but actually, the actual combination is more involved, but maybe the term symbol gives J directly). Let me parse each option's NN final state.\n\nFor example, option A: 7D1. The term symbol 7D1: the first number (7) is 2S+1, so 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. The L is D, which is L=2. The J is 1. So J_NN is 1. The emitted particle X's angular momentum l_X is p (l=1). The total angular momentum of the final state should be J_NN + J_X? Wait, no, actually, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total J was 0, so the final total J (NN + X) must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and X's J_X (which is l_X, assuming the particle has spin 0? Or maybe not? Wait, the problem says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is given by the lowercase letter, so perhaps the particle X has orbital angular momentum l_X, and its spin is not considered here. Hmm, the problem statement says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is denoted by the lowercase letter. So maybe the particle's angular momentum is purely l_X, so its total angular momentum is l_X (assuming spin 0?), but the question might be considering the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle as its angular momentum. But maybe for the purpose of angular momentum conservation, we need to have the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the X's angular momentum (l_X) to give zero. Since the initial J was 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the emission process requires that the total angular momentum is conserved. So the initial J (0) must equal the final J of NN plus the J of X. But the problem might be assuming that the particle X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l_X, so its angular momentum is l_X. The NN's angular momentum is L_NN (orbital) plus their spin S_NN. Wait, but the term symbol for the NN final state includes L and S. The total angular momentum of the NN is J_NN = sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + 2 L_NN S_NN cos(theta)), but since term symbols give J as the total angular momentum. For example, in 7D1, D is L=2, so L_NN is 2, S is 3 (since 2S+1=7), and J is 1. So J_NN is 1. The emitted particle X has angular momentum l_X (like p is l=1). So the total angular momentum of the system must be the vector sum of J_NN and l_X. Since the initial was 0, their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN and l_X must be such that their sum can be zero. Which requires that J_NN = l_X, and their vectors are opposite. So possible only if J_NN equals l_X. Wait, but the magnitude of their vector sum must be zero, so the magnitudes must be equal, and directions opposite. So the magnitude of J_NN must equal l_X. But the magnitude of J_NN is J_NN's value (since it's a vector magnitude). For example, in option A, J_NN is 1 (from 7D1's J=1), and l_X is 1 (since p is l=1). Then 1 + 1 can give 0 only if their vectors are opposite. The possible total angular momentum when adding 1 and 1 can be 0, 1, or 2. So 0 is allowed. So that's okay. So angular momentum is conserved here.\n\nNow, let's check parity. The parity of the initial state (1S0) is (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1. The parity of the final state (NN) plus the parity of the emitted particle X must equal the initial parity. Wait, the parity conservation: the product of the parities of the final states (NN and X) must equal the initial parity. Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X\n\nSo, Parity_NN_final = (Parity_initial) / (Parity_X)\n\nThe initial parity is +1. The parity of X is given as -1. So Parity_NN_final must be +1 / (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, but the parity of the NN final state is determined by its orbital angular momentum L_NN. Because the parity of a state is (-1)^{L}, assuming that the intrinsic parities of the nucleons are +1 (since nucleons are fermions, but their parity is usually considered as +1 unless in some excited state). Wait, the problem might be considering only the orbital part for the NN's parity. So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^{l_X} (since its angular momentum is l_X, and assuming it has spin 0 or that its spin doesn't contribute to parity? Hmm, but the problem states the particle's intrinsic parity is -1. Wait, the question says \"particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". Intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, so the parity of X is given as -1, regardless of its angular momentum? Wait, that might complicate things. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify:\n\nThe parity of the entire system must be conserved. The initial parity is (+1) because the initial state is 1S0 (L=0). The final state's parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity. The NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN and their spins have intrinsic parity, but assuming nucleons have parity +1, so total parity from orbital L_NN). The X's parity is given as intrinsic -1. So overall:\n\nInitial Parity = Final Parity (NN * X)\n\nSo:\n\n+1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ -1 ]\n\nTherefore, rearranged: (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 / +1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u2192 L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo the NN's L_NN must be odd.\n\nNow, let's look at each option's NN final state:\n\nA) 7D1: D is L=2 (even). Wait, but that would mean L_NN=2 (even), so (-1)^2 = +1. Then the NN parity would be +1. But according to the parity conservation equation above, the NN's parity must be -1 (because the equation requires [NN parity] * (-1) = +1 \u21d2 NN parity must be -1). So this is a problem here. Wait, hold on. Let me redo this:\n\nThe equation is:\n\nInitial parity (+1) = (Parity_NN) * (Parity_X)\n\nParity_X is given as -1 (intrinsic), so Parity_NN must be +1 (since +1 = (+1)*(-1) would be -1, which doesn't work. Wait, sorry, let me re-arrange:\n\nParity_NN * Parity_X = Parity_initial \u2192 Parity_NN = Parity_initial / Parity_X \u2192 +1 / (-1) = -1.\n\nThus, Parity_NN must be -1. Therefore, the NN's parity must be -1, so (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u21d2 L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo in option A: 7D1 has L_NN = D (2). That's even, so L_NN is even \u2192 (-1)^2 = +1. So the NN's parity is +1, which doesn't satisfy the requirement of -1. Therefore, this would violate parity conservation. Wait, that would mean option A is invalid? But I need to check all possibilities. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question says the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So Parity_X is -1, regardless of its angular momentum. So the parity of the NN must be +1, because (NN parity)*(-1) = +1 \u2192 NN parity must be -1? Wait, no:\n\nWait, sorry, math: Let me write it again:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X \u2192 \n\nSo +1 = Parity_NN * (-1). Therefore, Parity_NN must be -1. \n\nSo the NN's parity must be -1, which requires L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo in option A, the NN is in a D state (L=2), which is even, so that's a problem. So option A would have parity of NN as +1, which violates the required -1. So that would be forbidden. But the question asks which is not permitted. Hmm, but let me check all options first.\n\nOption B: 3S1. The term is 3S1. The L here is S (L=0). So L_NN=0 (even). Then (-1)^0 = 1 \u2192 parity of NN is +1, which again would require Parity_NN * (-1) = -1, which doesn't equal +1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the problem says that the NN final state has T(NN)=0. So the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, then S + L +1 must be even? Wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 = (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 S + L +1 \u2261 0 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nSo for each option, we need to check if the NN's S and L satisfy S + L is odd. Also, the parity condition requires that the NN's L must be odd (so that (-1)^L = -1). \n\nLet me process each option step by step:\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p (particle X is p, l=1)\nThe NN's final state is 7D1:\n- Term symbol 7D1: \n  - 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3\n  - L = D \u2192 L=2\n  - J=1 (but we don't need J for the condition)\nCheck S + L: 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1 \u2192 which satisfies the condition (needs to be odd). So that's okay.\n\nNow, parity: L_NN is 2 (even), so NN's parity is +1. But we needed the NN's parity to be -1. So this violates the parity conservation. So this transition is forbidden because the parity doesn't add up. So Option A would be invalid. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p (particle is p, l=1)\nThe NN final state is 3S1:\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n- L=S \u2192 L=0 (since S in the term symbol is L=0)\n- J=1 (again, not needed here)\nCheck S + L: 1 + 0 =1 \u2192 mod2 is 1 \u2192 okay, satisfies the condition.\n\nParity of NN: L=0 \u2192 (-1)^0 = +1. So NN parity is +1. Then the equation: NN parity * X parity = (+1)*(-1) = -1, but initial parity was +1. So this is invalid. Wait, that's a problem. So Option B would also fail parity? Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the X's parity is given as intrinsic -1, regardless of its angular momentum? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Does that mean that the parity of X is -1, independent of its angular momentum? Because if that's the case, then the angular momentum's contribution to the parity of X is separate?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again:\n\n\"the particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\"\n\nThe key here is that the particle's intrinsic parity is -1. Intrinsic parity is a property independent of its angular momentum. So the parity of the particle X is -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. So the total parity conservation requires that the initial parity equals the product of the NN's parity and X's parity (since the particle's parity is its intrinsic parity). So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X\n\nThus, since Parity_X is -1 (given), then Parity_NN must be -1 / (Parity_X's sign). Wait, no, the equation is:\n\nParity_NN * (-1) = +1 \u2192 Parity_NN must be -1. \n\nTherefore, the NN's parity must be -1, so their L must be odd. \n\nSo back to option B:\n\nThe NN's L is 0 (even), so their parity is +1. Then +1 * (-1) = -1 \u2260 +1 (initial). So this violates parity. Therefore option B is also invalid? But that can't be, because the question says only one option is invalid. Hmm, this suggests I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angular momentum of the emitted particle's contribution to parity. Wait, maybe the particle's parity is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} ?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's wording is that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1, but its total parity (intrinsic times orbital) would be (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic. Wait, maybe the total parity of the emitted particle is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} (orbital contribution). The problem says \"intrinsic parity -1\", so maybe the intrinsic is separate from the orbital. So the total parity of X would be (intrinsic parity) * (-1)^{l_X}.\n\nIn that case, the parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ?\n\nWait, the problem states \"particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". The total parity of a particle is usually considered as its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me re-express:\n\nThe total parity of the emitted particle X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by the parity from its orbital angular momentum. So:\n\nParity_X_total = (intrinsic parity of X) * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nGiven that the intrinsic parity of X is -1, so:\n\nParity_X_total = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X +1}\n\nTherefore, the total parity of the system (initial) must equal the product of the NN's parity and X's total parity.\n\nSo:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X_total\n\nParity_NN is (-1)^{L_NN} (since the NN's parity comes from their orbital angular momentum L_NN, assuming their intrinsic parities multiply to +1 as nucleons are spin-1/2 particles with parity +1 each, so product +1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n+1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ]\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} \n\nSet equal to +1:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = +1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo,\n\nL_NN + l_X +1 must be even \u2192 L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nThus, L_NN + l_X is odd.\n\nSo that's a key equation here. \n\nSo combining this with the earlier conditions:\n\nThe first condition from the Pauli statistics (T=0):\n\nS_NN + L_NN must be odd (since S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2).\n\nSecond condition from parity conservation: L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, we need to check both conditions (Pauli condition and parity condition) as well as angular momentum conservation.\n\nAdditionally, we must also check angular momentum conservation between initial and final states.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state's total angular momentum (J_total) must be 0. The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and the X's angular momentum (l_X, assuming X has spin 0? Or maybe we have to consider that the NN's J is from their L and S, and X's l is its orbital angular momentum, so the total angular momentum must be J_NN + l_X (vector addition) resulting in 0. \n\nSo for the angular momentum conservation: the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be 0. Since the NN have J_NN and the X has angular momentum l_X (orbital), their vector sum must be 0. This requires that J_NN = l_X and that they are antiparallel. So J_NN must be equal to l_X. Because the minimum possible total when adding J_NN and l_X is |J_NN - l_X| and maximum is J_NN + l_X. To get 0, the only way is if J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. So J_NN must equal l_X. \n\nSo another condition: J_NN (from NN's term symbol) must equal l_X (the angular momentum of X, given by the letter).\n\nNow let's process each option with all conditions.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p (X is p, so l_X=1)\n\nFirst, the NN's final state is 7D1:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n- S_NN: 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3\n\n- L_NN: D \u2192 L=2\n\n- J_NN =1 (from the term symbol's last digit)\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L = 3 +2=5 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nCheck parity condition: L_NN + l_X = 2 +1=3, which is odd. So that's okay.\n\nCheck angular momentum: J_NN must equal l_X. Here J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. So 1=1 \u2192 okay. So angular momentum is conserved. \n\nThus, option A is allowed. Wait, but earlier I thought parity might be an issue. Wait, but with the revised parity calculation, the parity condition is satisfied here. Because L_NN + l_X is 3 (odd), so the exponent in the parity equation is even, so the parity is okay. \n\nHmm, so my earlier mistake was not considering that the X's parity includes its orbital angular momentum. So now, with this correction, option A is okay.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p (X is p, l=1)\n\nNN's final state: 3S1:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: S \u2192 L=0\n\n- J_NN =1 \n\nCheck Pauli: S + L =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l_X (1) \u2192 0+1=1 (odd). Okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN (1) must equal l_X (1). Yes. So okay.\n\nSo this is allowed. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f (X is f, l=3)\n\nNN final state: 3D3:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: D \u2192 L=2\n\n- J_NN=3 (since term ends with 3)\n\nCheck Pauli: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nParity: L_NN (2) + l_X (3) \u2192 2+3=5, which is odd. So okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3, l_X is 3 \u2192 so they can add to zero? Wait, J_NN is 3, l_X is 3. The vector sum must give 0, which requires that they are opposite. The total angular momentum possible when adding 3 and 3 can be 0 (if they are antiparallel?), but actually, the minimum is |3-3|=0, maximum 6. So yes, 0 is possible. So angular momentum is conserved. So C is okay.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s (X is s, l=0)\n\nNN final state: 3P0:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: P \u2192 L=1\n\n- J_NN=0 (from the term symbol's last digit)\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1 +1 =2 \u2192 even. Which violates the condition (needs to be odd). So this is already invalid. \n\nWait, so this violates the Pauli condition (T=0 requires S + L must be odd). So this is not allowed. So D is invalid. But let's check other conditions to be thorough.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l_X (0) \u21921 +0 =1 (odd). So that's okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN must equal l_X. Here, J_NN is 0, l_X is 0 (since s is l=0). So 0=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nBut the problem is that the Pauli condition is violated here. The Pauli condition requires that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, that requires 0 \u2261 (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 S + L must be odd. Here, S=1, L=1 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 even, so condition not met. So option D is invalid due to violating the Pauli condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. But wait, let me check again all steps. \n\nYes, for option D, the NN's S and L are 1 each, so their sum is even, which violates the condition. So D is not permitted. The other options satisfy all conditions. So the answer must be D. \n\nWait, but in option D, the NN's T is given as 0. The question states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the T is given, but the condition T= S + L +1 mod2 must hold. So T=0 must equal (S + L +1) mod2. \n\nSo for D's NN state: S=1, L=1 \u2192 S+L+1=3 mod2 is 1. So T should be 1 mod2, but the problem says T(NN)=0. Thus, this is impossible. Hence, this state is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A to D, and the question says which is not permitted. So D is the one that violates the Pauli condition. \n\nYes, so the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. We need to figure out which of the given options is not allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws like angular momentum and parity. \n\nFirst, let me recall the given condition: the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the problem states that T(NN) is 0, substituting that gives 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So rearranged, S + L must be congruent to 1 mod 2. That means S + L is odd. \n\nNow, each of the options gives a transition from the initial 1S0 state. The initial state is 1S0, which means S (total spin) is 0 because the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Here, the first number is 1, so 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L part is S, which corresponds to L=0. The total angular momentum J is 0 as well, since the last number is 0. \n\nThe particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of a particle is (-1)^{L_X}, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Since its parity is -1, that means (-1)^{L_X} = -1 \u2192 L_X must be odd. So the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (denoted by the lowercase letter in the options) must be odd. Let me check each option's particle:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p. The lowercase letter is 'p', which is the spectroscopic notation for l=1 (since s=0, p=1, d=2, etc.). So L_X is 1, which is odd. That's okay.\n\nB) 3S1 + p: The particle here is p (l=1 again), so L_X is 1. Also okay.\n\nC) 3D3 + f: The lowercase f corresponds to l=3 (since f is the 3rd letter after s). So L_X is 3, which is odd. That's okay.\n\nD) 3P0 + s: The particle is s, so l=0. Then L_X is 0, which is even. But the particle's parity would be (-1)^0 = 1, but the problem states X has parity -1. Therefore, this would violate parity conservation. Wait, but hold on\u2014the question says \"emit a particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". So the parity of X must be -1. So if the emitted particle has l=0, its parity is +1, which contradicts. So option D's particle is s, which would have parity +1, so that can't be allowed. But let me check the rest first.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider more factors. The problem also mentions conservation of angular momentum and the Pauli condition. Let's go through each option step by step, considering both angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli condition.\n\nStarting with the initial state: 1S0. So S_initial =0, L_initial =0, J_initial=0.\n\nThe emitted particle X has angular momentum l_X (given by the lowercase letter). The final NN state has some S_final, L_final, and the particle's angular momentum l_X must combine with the NN's L_final such that total angular momentum is conserved. Since the initial total angular momentum J_initial is 0, the total angular momentum of the final state (NN plus X) must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum (L_NN) and the X's angular momentum (l_X) must give 0. Wait, actually, the total angular momentum conservation requires that the total J of the initial (0) equals the vector sum of the final NN's J_NN and the X's J_X. However, since the problem gives the NN's final state term symbol (like 7D1 which would have J=1), and the emitted particle X's angular momentum l_X (from its letter). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the final NN state has some angular momentum L_NN and spin S_NN, so their total angular momentum J_NN = L_NN + S_NN (but actually, the actual combination is more involved, but maybe the term symbol gives J directly). Let me parse each option's NN final state.\n\nFor example, option A: 7D1. The term symbol 7D1: the first number (7) is 2S+1, so 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. The L is D, which is L=2. The J is 1. So J_NN is 1. The emitted particle X's angular momentum l_X is p (l=1). The total angular momentum of the final state should be J_NN + J_X? Wait, no, actually, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total J was 0, so the final total J (NN + X) must also be 0. So the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and X's J_X (which is l_X, assuming the particle has spin 0? Or maybe not? Wait, the problem says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is given by the lowercase letter, so perhaps the particle X has orbital angular momentum l_X, and its spin is not considered here. Hmm, the problem statement says \"the angular momentum state of X\" is denoted by the lowercase letter. So maybe the particle's angular momentum is purely l_X, so its total angular momentum is l_X (assuming spin 0?), but the question might be considering the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle as its angular momentum. But maybe for the purpose of angular momentum conservation, we need to have the vector sum of the NN's total angular momentum (J_NN) and the X's angular momentum (l_X) to give zero. Since the initial J was 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the emission process requires that the total angular momentum is conserved. So the initial J (0) must equal the final J of NN plus the J of X. But the problem might be assuming that the particle X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l_X, so its angular momentum is l_X. The NN's angular momentum is L_NN (orbital) plus their spin S_NN. Wait, but the term symbol for the NN final state includes L and S. The total angular momentum of the NN is J_NN = sqrt(L_NN^2 + S_NN^2 + 2 L_NN S_NN cos(theta)), but since term symbols give J as the total angular momentum. For example, in 7D1, D is L=2, so L_NN is 2, S is 3 (since 2S+1=7), and J is 1. So J_NN is 1. The emitted particle X has angular momentum l_X (like p is l=1). So the total angular momentum of the system must be the vector sum of J_NN and l_X. Since the initial was 0, their vector sum must be zero. So J_NN and l_X must be such that their sum can be zero. Which requires that J_NN = l_X, and their vectors are opposite. So possible only if J_NN equals l_X. Wait, but the magnitude of their vector sum must be zero, so the magnitudes must be equal, and directions opposite. So the magnitude of J_NN must equal l_X. But the magnitude of J_NN is J_NN's value (since it's a vector magnitude). For example, in option A, J_NN is 1 (from 7D1's J=1), and l_X is 1 (since p is l=1). Then 1 + 1 can give 0 only if their vectors are opposite. The possible total angular momentum when adding 1 and 1 can be 0, 1, or 2. So 0 is allowed. So that's okay. So angular momentum is conserved here.\n\nNow, let's check parity. The parity of the initial state (1S0) is (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1. The parity of the final state (NN) plus the parity of the emitted particle X must equal the initial parity. Wait, the parity conservation: the product of the parities of the final states (NN and X) must equal the initial parity. Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN_final * Parity_X\n\nSo, Parity_NN_final = (Parity_initial) / (Parity_X)\n\nThe initial parity is +1. The parity of X is given as -1. So Parity_NN_final must be +1 / (-1) = -1.\n\nWait, but the parity of the NN final state is determined by its orbital angular momentum L_NN. Because the parity of a state is (-1)^{L}, assuming that the intrinsic parities of the nucleons are +1 (since nucleons are fermions, but their parity is usually considered as +1 unless in some excited state). Wait, the problem might be considering only the orbital part for the NN's parity. So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}. The parity of the emitted particle X is (-1)^{l_X} (since its angular momentum is l_X, and assuming it has spin 0 or that its spin doesn't contribute to parity? Hmm, but the problem states the particle's intrinsic parity is -1. Wait, the question says \"particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". Intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, so the parity of X is given as -1, regardless of its angular momentum? Wait, that might complicate things. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify:\n\nThe parity of the entire system must be conserved. The initial parity is (+1) because the initial state is 1S0 (L=0). The final state's parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity. The NN's parity is (-1)^{L_NN} (since their orbital angular momentum is L_NN and their spins have intrinsic parity, but assuming nucleons have parity +1, so total parity from orbital L_NN). The X's parity is given as intrinsic -1. So overall:\n\nInitial Parity = Final Parity (NN * X)\n\nSo:\n\n+1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ -1 ]\n\nTherefore, rearranged: (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 / +1 \u2192 (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u2192 L_NN must be odd.\n\nSo the NN's L_NN must be odd.\n\nNow, let's look at each option's NN final state:\n\nA) 7D1: D is L=2 (even). Wait, but that would mean L_NN=2 (even), so (-1)^2 = +1. Then the NN parity would be +1. But according to the parity conservation equation above, the NN's parity must be -1 (because the equation requires [NN parity] * (-1) = +1 \u21d2 NN parity must be -1). So this is a problem here. Wait, hold on. Let me redo this:\n\nThe equation is:\n\nInitial parity (+1) = (Parity_NN) * (Parity_X)\n\nParity_X is given as -1 (intrinsic), so Parity_NN must be +1 (since +1 = (+1)*(-1) would be -1, which doesn't work. Wait, sorry, let me re-arrange:\n\nParity_NN * Parity_X = Parity_initial \u2192 Parity_NN = Parity_initial / Parity_X \u2192 +1 / (-1) = -1.\n\nThus, Parity_NN must be -1. Therefore, the NN's parity must be -1, so (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 \u21d2 L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo in option A: 7D1 has L_NN = D (2). That's even, so L_NN is even \u2192 (-1)^2 = +1. So the NN's parity is +1, which doesn't satisfy the requirement of -1. Therefore, this would violate parity conservation. Wait, that would mean option A is invalid? But I need to check all possibilities. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question says the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So Parity_X is -1, regardless of its angular momentum. So the parity of the NN must be +1, because (NN parity)*(-1) = +1 \u2192 NN parity must be -1? Wait, no:\n\nWait, sorry, math: Let me write it again:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X \u2192 \n\nSo +1 = Parity_NN * (-1). Therefore, Parity_NN must be -1. \n\nSo the NN's parity must be -1, which requires L_NN must be odd. \n\nSo in option A, the NN is in a D state (L=2), which is even, so that's a problem. So option A would have parity of NN as +1, which violates the required -1. So that would be forbidden. But the question asks which is not permitted. Hmm, but let me check all options first.\n\nOption B: 3S1. The term is 3S1. The L here is S (L=0). So L_NN=0 (even). Then (-1)^0 = 1 \u2192 parity of NN is +1, which again would require Parity_NN * (-1) = -1, which doesn't equal +1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the problem says that the NN final state has T(NN)=0. So the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T(NN)=0, then S + L +1 must be even? Wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 = (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 S + L +1 \u2261 0 mod2 \u2192 S + L \u2261 1 mod2. So S + L must be odd. \n\nSo for each option, we need to check if the NN's S and L satisfy S + L is odd. Also, the parity condition requires that the NN's L must be odd (so that (-1)^L = -1). \n\nLet me process each option step by step:\n\nOption A: 7D1 + p (particle X is p, l=1)\nThe NN's final state is 7D1:\n- Term symbol 7D1: \n  - 2S+1 =7 \u2192 S=3\n  - L = D \u2192 L=2\n  - J=1 (but we don't need J for the condition)\nCheck S + L: 3 + 2 =5 \u2192 5 mod2 is 1 \u2192 which satisfies the condition (needs to be odd). So that's okay.\n\nNow, parity: L_NN is 2 (even), so NN's parity is +1. But we needed the NN's parity to be -1. So this violates the parity conservation. So this transition is forbidden because the parity doesn't add up. So Option A would be invalid. But let me check the other options.\n\nOption B: 3S1 + p (particle is p, l=1)\nThe NN final state is 3S1:\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n- L=S \u2192 L=0 (since S in the term symbol is L=0)\n- J=1 (again, not needed here)\nCheck S + L: 1 + 0 =1 \u2192 mod2 is 1 \u2192 okay, satisfies the condition.\n\nParity of NN: L=0 \u2192 (-1)^0 = +1. So NN parity is +1. Then the equation: NN parity * X parity = (+1)*(-1) = -1, but initial parity was +1. So this is invalid. Wait, that's a problem. So Option B would also fail parity? Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the X's parity is given as intrinsic -1, regardless of its angular momentum? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Does that mean that the parity of X is -1, independent of its angular momentum? Because if that's the case, then the angular momentum's contribution to the parity of X is separate?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again:\n\n\"the particle X of intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.\"\n\nThe key here is that the particle's intrinsic parity is -1. Intrinsic parity is a property independent of its angular momentum. So the parity of the particle X is -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. So the total parity conservation requires that the initial parity equals the product of the NN's parity and X's parity (since the particle's parity is its intrinsic parity). So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X\n\nThus, since Parity_X is -1 (given), then Parity_NN must be -1 / (Parity_X's sign). Wait, no, the equation is:\n\nParity_NN * (-1) = +1 \u2192 Parity_NN must be -1. \n\nTherefore, the NN's parity must be -1, so their L must be odd. \n\nSo back to option B:\n\nThe NN's L is 0 (even), so their parity is +1. Then +1 * (-1) = -1 \u2260 +1 (initial). So this violates parity. Therefore option B is also invalid? But that can't be, because the question says only one option is invalid. Hmm, this suggests I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angular momentum of the emitted particle's contribution to parity. Wait, maybe the particle's parity is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} ?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's wording is that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1, but its total parity (intrinsic times orbital) would be (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic. Wait, maybe the total parity of the emitted particle is its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^{l_X} (orbital contribution). The problem says \"intrinsic parity -1\", so maybe the intrinsic is separate from the orbital. So the total parity of X would be (intrinsic parity) * (-1)^{l_X}.\n\nIn that case, the parity of X is (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} ?\n\nWait, the problem states \"particle X of intrinsic parity -1\". The total parity of a particle is usually considered as its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. Wait, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me re-express:\n\nThe total parity of the emitted particle X is its intrinsic parity multiplied by the parity from its orbital angular momentum. So:\n\nParity_X_total = (intrinsic parity of X) * (-1)^{l_X}\n\nGiven that the intrinsic parity of X is -1, so:\n\nParity_X_total = (-1) * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{l_X +1}\n\nTherefore, the total parity of the system (initial) must equal the product of the NN's parity and X's total parity.\n\nSo:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_NN * Parity_X_total\n\nParity_NN is (-1)^{L_NN} (since the NN's parity comes from their orbital angular momentum L_NN, assuming their intrinsic parities multiply to +1 as nucleons are spin-1/2 particles with parity +1 each, so product +1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n+1 = [ (-1)^{L_NN} ] * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ]\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} \n\nSet equal to +1:\n\n(-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = +1 \u2192 exponent must be even.\n\nSo,\n\nL_NN + l_X +1 must be even \u2192 L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nThus, L_NN + l_X is odd.\n\nSo that's a key equation here. \n\nSo combining this with the earlier conditions:\n\nThe first condition from the Pauli statistics (T=0):\n\nS_NN + L_NN must be odd (since S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2).\n\nSecond condition from parity conservation: L_NN + l_X must be odd.\n\nSo for each option, we need to check both conditions (Pauli condition and parity condition) as well as angular momentum conservation.\n\nAdditionally, we must also check angular momentum conservation between initial and final states.\n\nThe initial state has J=0. The final state's total angular momentum (J_total) must be 0. The total angular momentum is the vector sum of the NN's J_NN and the X's angular momentum (l_X, assuming X has spin 0? Or maybe we have to consider that the NN's J is from their L and S, and X's l is its orbital angular momentum, so the total angular momentum must be J_NN + l_X (vector addition) resulting in 0. \n\nSo for the angular momentum conservation: the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be 0. Since the NN have J_NN and the X has angular momentum l_X (orbital), their vector sum must be 0. This requires that J_NN = l_X and that they are antiparallel. So J_NN must be equal to l_X. Because the minimum possible total when adding J_NN and l_X is |J_NN - l_X| and maximum is J_NN + l_X. To get 0, the only way is if J_NN = l_X and they are opposite. So J_NN must equal l_X. \n\nSo another condition: J_NN (from NN's term symbol) must equal l_X (the angular momentum of X, given by the letter).\n\nNow let's process each option with all conditions.\n\nOption A: 1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p (X is p, so l_X=1)\n\nFirst, the NN's final state is 7D1:\n\nTerm symbol 7D1:\n\n- S_NN: 2S+1=7 \u2192 S=3\n\n- L_NN: D \u2192 L=2\n\n- J_NN =1 (from the term symbol's last digit)\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L = 3 +2=5 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nCheck parity condition: L_NN + l_X = 2 +1=3, which is odd. So that's okay.\n\nCheck angular momentum: J_NN must equal l_X. Here J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. So 1=1 \u2192 okay. So angular momentum is conserved. \n\nThus, option A is allowed. Wait, but earlier I thought parity might be an issue. Wait, but with the revised parity calculation, the parity condition is satisfied here. Because L_NN + l_X is 3 (odd), so the exponent in the parity equation is even, so the parity is okay. \n\nHmm, so my earlier mistake was not considering that the X's parity includes its orbital angular momentum. So now, with this correction, option A is okay.\n\nOption B: 1S0 \u21923S1 + p (X is p, l=1)\n\nNN's final state: 3S1:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: S \u2192 L=0\n\n- J_NN =1 \n\nCheck Pauli: S + L =1+0=1 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (0) + l_X (1) \u2192 0+1=1 (odd). Okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN (1) must equal l_X (1). Yes. So okay.\n\nSo this is allowed. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: 3D3 + f (X is f, l=3)\n\nNN final state: 3D3:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: D \u2192 L=2\n\n- J_NN=3 (since term ends with 3)\n\nCheck Pauli: S + L =1+2=3 \u2192 odd. Good.\n\nParity: L_NN (2) + l_X (3) \u2192 2+3=5, which is odd. So okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN is 3, l_X is 3 \u2192 so they can add to zero? Wait, J_NN is 3, l_X is 3. The vector sum must give 0, which requires that they are opposite. The total angular momentum possible when adding 3 and 3 can be 0 (if they are antiparallel?), but actually, the minimum is |3-3|=0, maximum 6. So yes, 0 is possible. So angular momentum is conserved. So C is okay.\n\nOption D: 1S0 \u21923P0 + s (X is s, l=0)\n\nNN final state: 3P0:\n\n- 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1\n\n- L_NN: P \u2192 L=1\n\n- J_NN=0 (from the term symbol's last digit)\n\nCheck Pauli condition: S + L =1 +1 =2 \u2192 even. Which violates the condition (needs to be odd). So this is already invalid. \n\nWait, so this violates the Pauli condition (T=0 requires S + L must be odd). So this is not allowed. So D is invalid. But let's check other conditions to be thorough.\n\nParity condition: L_NN (1) + l_X (0) \u21921 +0 =1 (odd). So that's okay.\n\nAngular momentum: J_NN must equal l_X. Here, J_NN is 0, l_X is 0 (since s is l=0). So 0=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nBut the problem is that the Pauli condition is violated here. The Pauli condition requires that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, that requires 0 \u2261 (S + L +1) mod2 \u2192 S + L must be odd. Here, S=1, L=1 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 even, so condition not met. So option D is invalid due to violating the Pauli condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. But wait, let me check again all steps. \n\nYes, for option D, the NN's S and L are 1 each, so their sum is even, which violates the condition. So D is not permitted. The other options satisfy all conditions. So the answer must be D. \n\nWait, but in option D, the NN's T is given as 0. The question states \"the final NN state has T(NN)=0\". So the T is given, but the condition T= S + L +1 mod2 must hold. So T=0 must equal (S + L +1) mod2. \n\nSo for D's NN state: S=1, L=1 \u2192 S+L+1=3 mod2 is 1. So T should be 1 mod2, but the problem says T(NN)=0. Thus, this is impossible. Hence, this state is forbidden. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A to D, and the question says which is not permitted. So D is the one that violates the Pauli condition. \n\nYes, so the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions and conservation laws:\n\n1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state with \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), \\( S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\), implying \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) must be odd.\n2. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity of the system must be conserved.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The question is about figuring out which of the given partial waves isn't allowed. The key here is to use the Pauli statistics condition given, along with conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nFirst, let me recall the given condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final state has T(NN) = 0. So substituting that, 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Which implies S(NN) + L(NN) must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So their sum has to be odd. So S + L (for NN final state) must be odd.\n\nNow, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. The initial state's S is 0 (since it's 1S0, so S is 0). The orbital angular momentum L here is S (spectroscopic notation), which is 0. So initial total angular momentum J is 0. \n\nThe particle X is emitted. So we need to consider the decay process: NN (initial state) \u2192 NN (final state) + X. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. Also, parity must be conserved. \n\nFirst, let's think about parity. The parity of the initial state is determined by the orbital angular momentum part. Since the initial is S (L=0), the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. \n\nThe final state's parity must also consider the emitted particle X's parity. The total parity must be conserved. The parity of the final system (NN plus X) should equal the initial parity. \n\nThe parity of the final NN system will be determined by their orbital angular momentum L(NN). The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L(NN)}. The parity of particle X is given as -1. The total parity should be the product of the NN's parity and X's parity. \n\nWait, the total parity of the final state (NN and X) must equal the initial parity (which is +1). So:\n\nParity_initial = Parity_final(NN) * Parity_X * (-1)^L_X ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think more carefully. The parity of the system must be conserved. The initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} where L_initial is the initial orbital angular momentum (which is 0, so P_initial is +1). \n\nThe final state's total parity must also be +1. The final system's parity is the product of the parity of the NN final state, the parity of the emitted particle X, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X? Wait, no. Wait, when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum conservation involves the orbital angular momentum between the two particles (the NN and X). But the parity here would also involve that. Let me clarify:\n\nThe parity of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial parity. The parity of the final state is given by the product of the parities of the NN, the particle X, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. Wait, actually, when two particles are emitted, their relative orbital angular momentum contributes a factor of (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. But in this case, the NN is a bound state, and X is emitted. So the final state is NN (with their own orbital angular momentum L(NN)) plus X, which has some orbital angular momentum L_X with respect to the NN system. \n\nHmm, maybe the parity consideration is as follows: The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of all particles and the spatial parity from their orbital angular momenta. \n\nSo for the initial state: Parity_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} (since the NN's spins contribute to parity? Wait, actually, the parity of a nucleon is +1, so the parity of the NN system is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Since they are fermions, but parity is a separate quantum number. The total parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L(NN)} (orbital angular momentum between them). The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial = 0, so parity is +1. \n\nThe final state has NN (with some L(NN)), and X (with parity -1). But also, the NN and X must have some relative orbital angular momentum, say L_X. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the problem statement again. \n\nThe question says the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A, it's 7D1 + p. The \"p\" is the lowercase letter, which is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, perhaps the notation here is that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l (the lowercase letter corresponds to the spectroscopic notation, like s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.). So the total parity of the final state must be the product of the NN's parity, X's parity, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum of X (since the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X contributes (-1)^l). \n\nWait, actually, the parity of the final system (NN + X) must equal the initial parity. So:\n\nP_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X (the lowercase letter in the options). \n\nSo let's write that equation:\n\n(-1)^{L_initial} = [(-1)^{L(NN)}] * [P_X] * (-1)^l \n\nBecause:\n\n- The NN's parity is (-1)^{L(NN)} (since their orbital angular momentum is L(NN))\n- X's parity is given as -1 (intrinsic)\n- The orbital angular momentum between NN and X (denoted by l in the options) contributes (-1)^l to the parity. \n\nSo substituting:\n\nInitial parity is (-1)^0 = 1. \n\nSo equation: \n\n1 = [ (-1)^{L(NN)} ] * (-1) * (-1)^l \n\nSimplify the RHS: (-1)^{L(NN)} * (-1)^{1 + l} \n\nThus:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L(NN) + l + 1} \n\nTherefore, L(NN) + l +1 must be even, so L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nSo that's one condition: L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, from the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then 0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod2. So S(NN) and L(NN) must add to an odd number. \n\nNow, also, we must conserve angular momentum. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0 (from 1S0: J = 0). The final total angular momentum must also be 0. \n\nThe total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must be the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum, X's angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum between them (l). Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the NN in the final state has their own angular momentum (their orbital L(NN) and spin S(NN)), and the emitted particle X has some angular momentum. The total angular momentum must add up to the initial 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that the NN system transitions from the initial state (with J=0) to the final NN state plus the emitted particle X. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial J=0. \n\nSo the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be zero. To compute this, we have to consider the angular momenta of the NN (J_NN = sqrt(L(NN)^2 + S(NN)^2 + ...)), the angular momentum of X (which is its spin, but particles like pions have spin 0, but maybe here the particle X could have spin?), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the emitted particle's spin is negligible or given in the term symbol? Wait, the term symbols for the NN states are given in the options. For example, option A is 7D1 + p. The first part (7D1) is the NN final state's term symbol. Let's parse that.\n\nThe term symbol for the final NN state is given as (2S+1)L_J. For example, option B is 3S1. That would mean 2S+1 =3 \u2192 S=1, L=S (since it's S in spectroscopic notation, so L=0?), wait no, the L is the letter. So 3S1 would be S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L is S (L=0?), but then J would be sqrt(S^2 + L^2 + ...). Wait, J is the total angular momentum. Wait, in the term symbol, J is the total angular momentum. For example, 3S1: L=0 (S), S=1, so J = L + S (since they are aligned?), but actually, J can be L + S, L + S -1,... down to |L - S|. So for L=0 and S=1, J can only be 1. So that's consistent with the 3S1 (J=1). \n\nSo each option's first part is the NN final state's term symbol. The second part is the emitted particle's angular momentum (the lowercase letter: p is l=1, f is l=3, etc.). \n\nSo the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must add up to zero. To compute that, we need to consider the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) plus the angular momentum of the particle X (which includes its spin and its orbital angular momentum l with respect to the NN). Wait, perhaps the particle X has an orbital angular momentum l (the lowercase letter) with respect to the NN system. \n\nWait, maybe the total angular momentum conservation is as follows: The initial J (0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's J (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the emitted particle (which includes its spin s and the orbital angular momentum l between it and the NN). So total angular momentum of X is sqrt(l^2 + s^2 + ...). But unless told otherwise, maybe the particle X is a pion (which has spin 0), so its spin is 0, so its angular momentum is just l. \n\nAssuming that X's spin is zero (like a pion), then the angular momentum of X is l. Then the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be the vector sum of J_NN and l. The total must equal the initial J of 0. \n\nTherefore, J_NN + l must be 0. But since angular momentum can only add up in certain ways. For example, if J_NN is 1 and l is 1, then possible total J is 0,1, or 2. So to get total J=0, they must be able to combine. \n\nWait, more precisely, the total angular momentum J_total must satisfy |J_NN - l| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J_NN + l. So to have J_total =0, we need that 0 is in that interval. So |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. Which implies that J_NN = l and the two are opposite. \n\nThus, J_NN must equal l. Because only then can their vector sum give 0. \n\nWait, let me see. For example, if J_NN = l, then the minimum possible J_total is |J_NN - l| =0, so possible. So J_NN must equal l, and the projection must be opposite. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that J_NN = l. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total angular momentum of the NN and X must combine to zero. So the total J from NN and X (each with their own J and l?) Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the possible combinations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the initial J is zero, the final total angular momentum must also be zero. The NN has some J_NN, and the emitted particle has angular momentum l (its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN). The sum of these must be zero. \n\nSo J_NN and l must combine to give zero. So the only way this can happen is if J_NN = l and the vectors are opposite. So J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we must check if J_NN (from the NN's term symbol) equals the l (from the lowercase letter). \n\nWait, let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The NN final state is 7D1. The term symbol 7D1: D means L=2 (since D is the 4th letter after S, P, D is third? Wait S is 0, P is 1, D is 2. Wait D is spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3. So D is L=2. The term symbol is 7D1. The 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. The J is 1. Wait, how does that work? S=3, L=2. Then J can be L+S, L+S-1,... |L-S|. So 3+2=5, down to 1 (since 3-2=1). So J can be 1,2,3,4,5. Here J is given as 1, so that's possible. \n\nSo J_NN here is 1. The lowercase letter is p, which is l=1. So J_NN = l (1=1). So that's okay. So angular momentum conservation is satisfied here. \n\nNext, the parity condition. Let's check for option A. \n\nParity equation: L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nHere L(NN) is L from the NN's term symbol, which is D (L=2). The lowercase letter p is l=1. So L(NN) + l = 2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nNow check the Pauli condition: S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. \n\nHere S=3 (from 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3), L=2. 3+2=5, which is odd. So that's okay. \n\nSo option A is allowed. \n\nMoving on to option B: 3S1 + p. \n\nThe final NN term symbol is 3S1. Let's parse this. \n\n3S1: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is S (spectroscopic notation, so L=0). J=1. \n\nSo J_NN is 1. The lowercase letter is p (l=1). So J_NN = l (1=1), so angular momentum condition is okay. \n\nParity condition: L(NN) + l =0 +1=1, which is odd. Good. \n\nPauli condition: S(NN) + L(NN) =1 +0=1, which is odd. So that's okay. \n\nSo B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 3D3 + f. \n\nThe NN term is 3D3. \n\n3D3: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is D (L=2). J=3. \n\nSo J_NN is 3. The lowercase letter is f, which is l=3. \n\nThus, J_NN (3) equals l (3). So angular momentum condition holds. \n\nParity: L(NN) + l = 2 +3 =5 (odd). Good. \n\nPauli: S + L =1+2=3 (odd). Good. \n\nSo C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 3P0 + s. \n\nThe NN term is 3P0. \n\n3P0: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is P (L=1). J=0. \n\nSo J_NN is 0. The lowercase letter is s (l=0). \n\nThus, J_NN (0) equals l (0). So angular momentum condition is okay. \n\nParity: L(NN) + l =1 +0=1 (odd). So that's okay. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. Wait, but the Pauli condition requires that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Because T(NN)=0, so S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2. \n\nHere S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even. Which is 0 mod2, so that violates the condition. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. \n\nSo for option D, the Pauli statistics condition isn't satisfied. \n\nWait, let me check again. \n\nThe Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Given that T(NN)=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Which is not equal to 1 mod2. \n\nTherefore, this violates the condition. So the Pauli condition isn't met here, so this transition is forbidden. \n\nThus, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let's check other aspects as well. \n\nParity for D: L(NN)=1 (since P is L=1), l=0 (s). So L + l =1+0=1 (odd). So parity condition is okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN =0, l=0. So their sum can be 0. That's okay. \n\nTherefore, the only problem is the Pauli condition. So option D is not permitted. \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nWait, let me confirm all steps again. \n\nYes, in D, the S and L of the final NN are each 1, so their sum is even. The Pauli condition requires an odd sum, so that's a violation. Hence D is the forbidden one. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n",

The parity of the final state is given by the product of the parities of the NN, the particle X, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. Wait, actually, when two particles are emitted, their relative orbital angular momentum contributes a factor of (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. But in this case, the NN is a bound state, and X is emitted. So the final state is NN (with their own orbital angular momentum L(NN)) plus X, which has some orbital angular momentum L_X with respect to the NN system. \n\nHmm, maybe the parity consideration is as follows: The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of all particles and the spatial parity from their orbital angular momenta. \n\nSo for the initial state: Parity_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} (since the NN's spins contribute to parity? Wait, actually, the parity of a nucleon is +1, so the parity of the NN system is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Since they are fermions, but parity is a separate quantum number. The total parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L(NN)} (orbital angular momentum between them). The initial state is 1S0, so L_initial = 0, so parity is +1. \n\nThe final state has NN (with some L(NN)), and X (with parity -1). But also, the NN and X must have some relative orbital angular momentum, say L_X. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the problem statement again. \n\nThe question says the lowercase letter in the options denotes the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A, it's 7D1 + p. The \"p\" is the lowercase letter, which is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, perhaps the notation here is that the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l (the lowercase letter corresponds to the spectroscopic notation, like s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.). So the total parity of the final state must be the product of the NN's parity, X's parity, and the parity from the orbital angular momentum of X (since the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X contributes (-1)^l). \n\nWait, actually, the parity of the final system (NN + X) must equal the initial parity. So:\n\nP_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X (the lowercase letter in the options). \n\nSo let's write that equation:\n\n(-1)^{L_initial} = [(-1)^{L(NN)}] * [P_X] * (-1)^l \n\nBecause:\n\n- The NN's parity is (-1)^{L(NN)} (since their orbital angular momentum is L(NN))\n- X's parity is given as -1 (intrinsic)\n- The orbital angular momentum between NN and X (denoted by l in the options) contributes (-1)^l to the parity. \n\nSo substituting:\n\nInitial parity is (-1)^0 = 1. \n\nSo equation: \n\n1 = [ (-1)^{L(NN)} ] * (-1) * (-1)^l \n\nSimplify the RHS: (-1)^{L(NN)} * (-1)^{1 + l} \n\nThus:\n\n1 = (-1)^{L(NN) + l + 1} \n\nTherefore, L(NN) + l +1 must be even, so L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nSo that's one condition: L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nAdditionally, from the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T(NN)=0, then 0 \u2261 S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2 \u2192 S(NN) + L(NN) \u2261 1 mod2. So S(NN) and L(NN) must add to an odd number. \n\nNow, also, we must conserve angular momentum. The total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0 (from 1S0: J = 0). The final total angular momentum must also be 0. \n\nThe total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must be the vector sum of the NN's angular momentum, X's angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum between them (l). Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the NN in the final state has their own angular momentum (their orbital L(NN) and spin S(NN)), and the emitted particle X has some angular momentum. The total angular momentum must add up to the initial 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that the NN system transitions from the initial state (with J=0) to the final NN state plus the emitted particle X. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must equal the initial J=0. \n\nSo the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be zero. To compute this, we have to consider the angular momenta of the NN (J_NN = sqrt(L(NN)^2 + S(NN)^2 + ...)), the angular momentum of X (which is its spin, but particles like pions have spin 0, but maybe here the particle X could have spin?), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the emitted particle's spin is negligible or given in the term symbol? Wait, the term symbols for the NN states are given in the options. For example, option A is 7D1 + p. The first part (7D1) is the NN final state's term symbol. Let's parse that.\n\nThe term symbol for the final NN state is given as (2S+1)L_J. For example, option B is 3S1. That would mean 2S+1 =3 \u2192 S=1, L=S (since it's S in spectroscopic notation, so L=0?), wait no, the L is the letter. So 3S1 would be S=1 (since 2S+1=3 \u2192 S=1), L is S (L=0?), but then J would be sqrt(S^2 + L^2 + ...). Wait, J is the total angular momentum. Wait, in the term symbol, J is the total angular momentum. For example, 3S1: L=0 (S), S=1, so J = L + S (since they are aligned?), but actually, J can be L + S, L + S -1,... down to |L - S|. So for L=0 and S=1, J can only be 1. So that's consistent with the 3S1 (J=1). \n\nSo each option's first part is the NN final state's term symbol. The second part is the emitted particle's angular momentum (the lowercase letter: p is l=1, f is l=3, etc.). \n\nSo the total angular momentum of the final state (NN + X) must add up to zero. To compute that, we need to consider the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) plus the angular momentum of the particle X (which includes its spin and its orbital angular momentum l with respect to the NN). Wait, perhaps the particle X has an orbital angular momentum l (the lowercase letter) with respect to the NN system. \n\nWait, maybe the total angular momentum conservation is as follows: The initial J (0) must equal the vector sum of the NN's J (J_NN) and the angular momentum of the emitted particle (which includes its spin s and the orbital angular momentum l between it and the NN). So total angular momentum of X is sqrt(l^2 + s^2 + ...). But unless told otherwise, maybe the particle X is a pion (which has spin 0), so its spin is 0, so its angular momentum is just l. \n\nAssuming that X's spin is zero (like a pion), then the angular momentum of X is l. Then the total angular momentum of the final system (NN + X) must be the vector sum of J_NN and l. The total must equal the initial J of 0. \n\nTherefore, J_NN + l must be 0. But since angular momentum can only add up in certain ways. For example, if J_NN is 1 and l is 1, then possible total J is 0,1, or 2. So to get total J=0, they must be able to combine. \n\nWait, more precisely, the total angular momentum J_total must satisfy |J_NN - l| \u2264 J_total \u2264 J_NN + l. So to have J_total =0, we need that 0 is in that interval. So |J_NN - l| \u2264 0 \u2264 J_NN + l. Which implies that J_NN = l and the two are opposite. \n\nThus, J_NN must equal l. Because only then can their vector sum give 0. \n\nWait, let me see. For example, if J_NN = l, then the minimum possible J_total is |J_NN - l| =0, so possible. So J_NN must equal l, and the projection must be opposite. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that J_NN = l. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total angular momentum of the NN and X must combine to zero. So the total J from NN and X (each with their own J and l?) Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of the possible combinations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the initial J is zero, the final total angular momentum must also be zero. The NN has some J_NN, and the emitted particle has angular momentum l (its orbital angular momentum with respect to the NN). The sum of these must be zero. \n\nSo J_NN and l must combine to give zero. So the only way this can happen is if J_NN = l and the vectors are opposite. So J_NN must equal l. \n\nTherefore, for each option, we must check if J_NN (from the NN's term symbol) equals the l (from the lowercase letter). \n\nWait, let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. The NN final state is 7D1. The term symbol 7D1: D means L=2 (since D is the 4th letter after S, P, D is third? Wait S is 0, P is 1, D is 2. Wait D is spectroscopic notation: S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3. So D is L=2. The term symbol is 7D1. The 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3. The J is 1. Wait, how does that work? S=3, L=2. Then J can be L+S, L+S-1,... |L-S|. So 3+2=5, down to 1 (since 3-2=1). So J can be 1,2,3,4,5. Here J is given as 1, so that's possible. \n\nSo J_NN here is 1. The lowercase letter is p, which is l=1. So J_NN = l (1=1). So that's okay. So angular momentum conservation is satisfied here. \n\nNext, the parity condition. Let's check for option A. \n\nParity equation: L(NN) + l must be odd. \n\nHere L(NN) is L from the NN's term symbol, which is D (L=2). The lowercase letter p is l=1. So L(NN) + l = 2 +1 =3 \u2192 odd. So that's okay. \n\nNow check the Pauli condition: S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. \n\nHere S=3 (from 2S+1=7 \u21d2 S=3), L=2. 3+2=5, which is odd. So that's okay. \n\nSo option A is allowed. \n\nMoving on to option B: 3S1 + p. \n\nThe final NN term symbol is 3S1. Let's parse this. \n\n3S1: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is S (spectroscopic notation, so L=0). J=1. \n\nSo J_NN is 1. The lowercase letter is p (l=1). So J_NN = l (1=1), so angular momentum condition is okay. \n\nParity condition: L(NN) + l =0 +1=1, which is odd. Good. \n\nPauli condition: S(NN) + L(NN) =1 +0=1, which is odd. So that's okay. \n\nSo B is allowed. \n\nOption C: 3D3 + f. \n\nThe NN term is 3D3. \n\n3D3: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is D (L=2). J=3. \n\nSo J_NN is 3. The lowercase letter is f, which is l=3. \n\nThus, J_NN (3) equals l (3). So angular momentum condition holds. \n\nParity: L(NN) + l = 2 +3 =5 (odd). Good. \n\nPauli: S + L =1+2=3 (odd). Good. \n\nSo C is allowed. \n\nOption D: 3P0 + s. \n\nThe NN term is 3P0. \n\n3P0: 2S+1=3 \u21d2 S=1. L is P (L=1). J=0. \n\nSo J_NN is 0. The lowercase letter is s (l=0). \n\nThus, J_NN (0) equals l (0). So angular momentum condition is okay. \n\nParity: L(NN) + l =1 +0=1 (odd). So that's okay. \n\nPauli condition: S + L =1 +1=2 \u2192 even. Wait, but the Pauli condition requires that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd. Because T(NN)=0, so S + L +1 \u22610 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2. \n\nHere S=1, L=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even. Which is 0 mod2, so that violates the condition. \n\nAh! Here's the problem. \n\nSo for option D, the Pauli statistics condition isn't satisfied. \n\nWait, let me check again. \n\nThe Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Given that T(NN)=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2 \u2192 S+L \u22611 mod2. \n\nIn option D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 \u2192 mod2 is 0. Which is not equal to 1 mod2. \n\nTherefore, this violates the condition. So the Pauli condition isn't met here, so this transition is forbidden. \n\nThus, the answer is D. \n\nWait, but let's check other aspects as well. \n\nParity for D: L(NN)=1 (since P is L=1), l=0 (s). So L + l =1+0=1 (odd). So parity condition is okay. \n\nAngular momentum: J_NN =0, l=0. So their sum can be 0. That's okay. \n\nTherefore, the only problem is the Pauli condition. So option D is not permitted. \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nWait, let me confirm all steps again. \n\nYes, in D, the S and L of the final NN are each 1, so their sum is even. The Pauli condition requires an odd sum, so that's a violation. Hence D is the forbidden one. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: \\( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \\mod 2 \\). Since \\( T(NN) = 0 \\), this simplifies to \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\). Thus, \\( S(NN) + L(NN) \\) must be odd.\n\n2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity is \\( (-1)^{L_{\\text{initial}}} = (-1)^0 = +1 \\). The final parity must equal this. The final parity is given by:\n   \\[\n   (-1)^{L_{\\text{NN}} + l + 1} = 1 \\implies L_{\\text{NN}} + l + 1 \\text{ is even} \\implies L_{\\text{NN}} + l \\text{ is odd}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum must remain \\( J = 0 \\). This requires the final \\( J_{\\text{NN}} \\) (from the NN term symbol) to equal the orbital angular momentum \\( l \\) of the emitted particle (denoted by the lowercase letter).\n\n**Analysis of Each Option**:\n\n- **Option A (1S0 \u2192 7D1 + p)**:\n  - Final NN term: \\( 7D1 \\).
