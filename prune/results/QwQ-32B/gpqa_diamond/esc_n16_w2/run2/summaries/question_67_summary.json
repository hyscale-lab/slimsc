      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about the probability of measuring specific values for the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics. The state |l1, l2, l, m> represents a state where each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l1 and l2 (here both 1, since they're p orbitals), and the total angular momentum of the system is l=2 with z-component m=-1. \n\nThe question asks for the joint probability that measuring L1z and L2z would both give -\u0127. Since Lz for each electron can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, for l=1, each electron's Lz can be -\u0127, 0, or +\u0127. But the total Lz of the system is given as m = -1. \n\nWait, but the total m is the sum of the individual m's (m1 + m2). So if the total m is -1, then the possible combinations of m1 and m2 (each can be -1, 0, or +1) must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1) would sum to -2, which is too low. Wait, no: let me check. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\nPossible m1 and m2 values (each from -1, 0, +1):\n\n(-1, 0): sum -1\n\n(0, -1): sum -1\n\n(-1, -1): sum -2 (so not part of this total)\n\n(0,0): sum 0; (1, -2?) No, but m can't be beyond -1 to +1. So only the first two pairs sum to -1. Wait, no, wait: the possible pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The pair (-1, -1) would give -2, so that's not part of the total m=-1. \n\nSo the possible individual m values for the two electrons that add up to -1 are those two combinations. \n\nNow, the given state is the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>. To find the probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127, we need to see if this combination is part of the expansion of the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. The coefficients in this expansion will give the probabilities when squared. \n\nThe general formula for the coupling of two angular momenta is given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1,l2,l,m> is a linear combination of |m1,m2> states where m1 + m2 = m. \n\nSo for our case, l1 = l2 =1, l=2, m=-1. The possible m1 and m2 pairs that add to m=-1 are indeed (m1,m2) = (-1,0) and (0,-1). Wait, but wait, maybe there's another possibility? Let me check again. \n\nWait, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 and m2 similarly. So the sum m1 + m2 must be -1. \n\nPossible pairs:\n\nm1 = -1, m2 =0 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm1=0, m2 =-1 \u2192 sum -1.\n\nm1 = -2? No, since l=1, so m can't be -2. So those are the only two. \n\nWait, but the total l=2. The maximum possible m for l=2 is +2, so the minimum is -2, but here m=-1. \n\nSo the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the two states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, but perhaps with coefficients determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, but maybe I should recall how the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work here. Let me think. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get l and m. The coefficients <l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m> are the coefficients in the expansion. \n\nSo the state |l1,l2,l,m> is the sum over all m1, m2 with m1 + m2 = m of CG coefficients times |m1,m2>. \n\nIn our case, l1=l2=1, l=2, m=-1. \n\nThe possible m1 and m2 pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1,0) and (0,-1). \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these terms. Let me see if I can remember the values or derive them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard way to construct these. For example, the state |l1,l2,l,m> can be built up from the highest m state and then lowering operators. \n\nThe highest m state for l=2 would have m=2. That would be |1,1,2,2> which is just the product state |1,1> since m1 + m2 = 2 (each m is maximum). \n\nThen, applying the lowering operator L- to this state would give the next state with m=1, and so on. \n\nBut perhaps I need to look at the specific case for m=-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up or recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this particular case. \n\nWait, let me recall that for two electrons with l1=l2=1, the possible total l values are 0,1,2. \n\nThe state with l=2 and m=-1 is part of the l=2 manifold. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |1,1,2,-1> can be determined. Let me see. \n\nThe standard notation is that the CG coefficient <l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m> gives the amplitude for |m1,m2> in the expansion of |l1,l2,l,m>. \n\nSo to find the coefficients for m=-1, we need the coefficients for the m1 and m2 pairs that add to -1. \n\nLet me check the possible CG coefficients. \n\nI remember that for the case l1 = l2 =1, l=2, m=-1, the expansion would be a combination of the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m = -1. \n\nThe possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1,0) and (0,-1). \n\nThe CG coefficients for these terms can be found as follows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for the state |l1,l2,l,m>, the coefficients can be determined by recursion relations or by using known values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the state as built from the uncoupled basis. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the general approach. \n\nThe total angular momentum state |2, -1> is a linear combination of the product states |m1,m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nSo the expansion is:\n\n|2,-1> = C1 | -1, 0 > + C2 | 0, -1 > \n\nWe need to find the coefficients C1 and C2 such that this is an eigenstate of L^2 and Lz with eigenvalues corresponding to l=2. \n\nTo find the coefficients, we can use orthogonality conditions or the properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the coefficients are symmetric or follow certain rules. \n\nWait, let me recall that for the case of adding two angular momenta l1 and l2, the CG coefficients for the state |l1 l2 l m> are symmetric in some way when l1 = l2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that for the case of l1 = l2 =1 and l=2, m=-1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case can be found in standard tables. Let me try to remember or derive them. \n\nStarting with the highest m state, which is |2,2> = |1,1>. Then, applying L- to get lower m states. \n\nLet me think of the lowering operator. The lowering operator for the total angular momentum L- is L1- + L2-. \n\nThe state |2,1> would be obtained by applying L- to |2,2>, but normalized. \n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the expansion for |2, -1>. \n\nThe possible terms are | -1,0 > and |0, -1>. \n\nThe coefficients must satisfy the condition that the total state is an eigenstate of L^2 with eigenvalue l(l+1)\u0127\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the orthonormality of the states. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the general expression for the CG coefficients for l= l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. \n\nIn this case, since l1 = l2 =1, the possible l's are 0,1,2. \n\nFor l=2, the maximum m is 2, then 1, etc. \n\nThe CG coefficients for l=2, m=-1 can be found as follows. \n\nThe standard notation is that the CG coefficient < l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m > is non-zero only if m1 + m2 = m, and l is between |l1 - l2| and l1 + l2. \n\nFor our case, m=-1, so m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nThe coefficients for the two terms (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). \n\nThe coefficients for these two terms in the |2, -1> state should be equal in magnitude because of the symmetry between the two particles (since l1 = l2). Wait, but electrons are identical fermions, but here we are considering orbital angular momentum, not spin, so the orbital part can be symmetric or antisymmetric. But the question says to ignore spin, so perhaps the orbital part can be symmetric. Wait, but the problem states \"coupled angular momentum state\" so maybe the coefficients are determined purely by angular momentum coupling without considering exchange. \n\nWait, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum, so perhaps the particles are distinguishable here? Because spin is ignored. So in that case, the coefficients might not be symmetric. Hmm, but I think in standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the order of the particles matters. \n\nWait, the CG coefficients are for the state |l1 m1; l2 m2>, so the first particle's angular momentum is l1, etc. \n\nThus, the coefficients for |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> may not necessarily be equal unless there's some symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the CG coefficients. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficients can be found in terms of some recursion relations. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the state |2, -1> as part of the ladder. Let me start from the highest state and work down. \n\nThe highest m for l=2 is m=2. That is:\n\n|2,2> = |1,1>\n\nBecause only the combination of m1=1 and m2=1 gives m=2. \n\nThen, applying the lowering operator L- to this state:\n\nL- |2,2> = sqrt(2(2+1) - 2^2) \u0127 |2,1> \n\nWait, the lowering operator reduces m by 1. The action of L- on |l, m> is proportional to sqrt(l(l+1) - m(m-1)) |l, m-1>. \n\nSo for |2,2>, applying L- gives sqrt(2*3 - 2^2) \u0127 |2,1> \n\nWait, sqrt(6 -4) = sqrt(2) so:\n\nL- |2,2> = sqrt(2)\u0127 |2,1>\n\nTherefore, |2,1> is proportional to L+ |2,0> but maybe I need to go step by step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps building |2,1> requires considering the expansion in terms of |m1,m2> states. \n\nWait, let's try to construct |2,1>. The m=1 state would have m1 + m2 =1. The possible pairs here are (1,0), (0,1), and ( -1, 2?), but no, since m can't exceed l. So (1,0), (0,1). Also (1,0) and (0,1). \n\nWait, m1 can be 1,0,-1 and m2 similarly. The pairs adding to 1 are (1,0), (0,1). \n\nSo the expansion would be:\n\n|2,1> = A |1,0> + B |0,1>\n\nTo find A and B such that this is an eigenstate of L^2 with l=2 and normalized. \n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look up the CG coefficients for this case. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that for the case of two angular momenta each of l=1, the CG coefficients for the state |2, m> can be written as follows: \n\nThe state |2, -1> would be a combination of the | -1,0 > and |0, -1> states. \n\nThe coefficients for these terms can be found using the formula. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficient when l = l1 + l2 (the maximum possible l), then the coefficients for the state |l, m> are sqrt( ( (l1 - m1)! (l2 - m2)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 - m)! (l1 + l2 + m)! )) ) multiplied by some factor, but I might be mixing up the exact expressions. \n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1:\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). \n\nThe CG coefficients for these two terms can be found using the following method. \n\nThe state |2, -1> is the same as the state obtained by applying the lowering operator L- to |2,0> once. But maybe that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the coefficients for the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state |2, -1> is given by:\n\n|2, -1> = ( | -1,0 > + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2) \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. \n\nWait, if the coefficients are equal, then when you square them, their contributions would each be 1/2. But the question is asking for the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127, which would correspond to the state |-1, -1>, but that's not part of the expansion for |2, -1> because m1 + m2 would be -2 there, which is the total m for l=2, m=-2. \n\nAh, right! So the pair (-1, -1) would contribute to the m=-2 state. Therefore, in the state |2, -1>, the pair (-1, -1) is not present. So the only possible terms are the two I mentioned before. \n\nTherefore, the expansion of |2, -1> must be a combination of | -1,0 > and |0, -1>. \n\nAssuming that the coefficients are equal in magnitude (due to symmetry between the two particles?), then each term would have a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the probability of finding either of these states would each be (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2. But the question is about the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -\u0127. That would correspond to the state |-1, -1>, which is not part of this expansion. Therefore, the probability would be zero. \n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z both as -\u0127. So the eigenstate would be |m1 = -1, m2 = -1>. But in the expansion of the given state |2, -1>, this term is not present because the total m would be -2, which is a different state. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both electrons with Lz = -\u0127 is zero. Because the given state is |2, -1>, which doesn't have any component in the |-1, -1> state. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D) 0. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. \n\nSuppose the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. The possible m1 and m2 pairs must add to -1. The pair (-1, -1) sums to -2, which is not -1, so it's not part of the expansion. Hence, the state can't have that term. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both electrons at -\u0127 is zero. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe given state is $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, which corresponds to a total angular momentum of $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The possible pairs of individual $m$ values $(m_1, m_2)$ that sum to $m=-1$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. The state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which is incompatible with the total $m=-1$.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about the probability of measuring specific values for the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state.

The state |l1, l2, l, m> represents a state where each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l1 and l2 (here both 1, since they're p orbitals), and the total angular momentum of the system is l=2 with z-component m=-1. \n\nThe question asks for the joint probability that measuring L1z and L2z would both give -\u0127. Since Lz for each electron can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, for l=1, each electron's Lz can be -\u0127, 0, or +\u0127. But the total Lz of the system is given as m = -1. \n\nWait, but the total m is the sum of the individual m's (m1 + m2). So if the total m is -1, then the possible combinations of m1 and m2 (each can be -1, 0, or +1) must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1) would sum to -2, which is too low. Wait, no: let me check. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\nPossible m1 and m2 values (each from -1, 0, +1):\n\n(-1, 0): sum -1\n\n(0, -1): sum -1\n\n(-1, -1): sum -2 (so not part of this total)\n\n(0,0): sum 0; (1, -2?)

The pair (-1, -1) would give -2, so that's not part of the total m=-1. \n\nSo the possible individual m values for the two electrons that add up to -1 are those two combinations. \n\nNow, the given state is the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>. To find the probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127, we need to see if this combination is part of the expansion of the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>.

No, since l=1, so m can't be -2. So those are the only two. \n\nWait, but the total l=2. The maximum possible m for l=2 is +2, so the minimum is -2, but here m=-1. \n\nSo the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the two states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, but perhaps with coefficients determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, but maybe I should recall how the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work here.

Let me try to remember or derive them. \n\nStarting with the highest m state, which is |2,2> = |1,1>. Then, applying L- to get lower m states. \n\nLet me think of the lowering operator. The lowering operator for the total angular momentum L- is L1- + L2-. \n\nThe state |2,1> would be obtained by applying L- to |2,2>, but normalized. \n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the expansion for |2, -1>. \n\nThe possible terms are | -1,0 > and |0, -1>. \n\nThe coefficients must satisfy the condition that the total state is an eigenstate of L^2 with eigenvalue l(l+1)\u0127\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the orthonormality of the states. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the general expression for the CG coefficients for l= l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. \n\nIn this case, since l1 = l2 =1, the possible l's are 0,1,2. \n\nFor l=2, the maximum m is 2, then 1, etc. \n\nThe CG coefficients for l=2, m=-1 can be found as follows. \n\nThe standard notation is that the CG coefficient < l1 m1; l2 m2 | l m > is non-zero only if m1 + m2 = m, and l is between |l1 - l2| and l1 + l2. \n\nFor our case, m=-1, so m1 + m2 = -1. \n\nThe coefficients for the two terms (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). \n\nThe coefficients for these two terms in the |2, -1> state should be equal in magnitude because of the symmetry between the two particles (since l1 = l2). Wait, but electrons are identical fermions, but here we are considering orbital angular momentum, not spin, so the orbital part can be symmetric or antisymmetric. But the question says to ignore spin, so perhaps the orbital part can be symmetric. Wait, but the problem states \"coupled angular momentum state\" so maybe the coefficients are determined purely by angular momentum coupling without considering exchange. \n\nWait, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum, so perhaps the particles are distinguishable here? Because spin is ignored. So in that case, the coefficients might not be symmetric. Hmm, but I think in standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the order of the particles matters. \n\nWait, the CG coefficients are for the state |l1 m1; l2 m2>, so the first particle's angular momentum is l1, etc. \n\nThus, the coefficients for |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> may not necessarily be equal unless there's some symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the CG coefficients. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficients can be found in terms of some recursion relations. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the state |2, -1> as part of the ladder. Let me start from the highest state and work down. \n\nThe highest m for l=2 is m=2. That is:\n\n|2,2> = |1,1>\n\nBecause only the combination of m1=1 and m2=1 gives m=2. \n\nThen, applying the lowering operator L- to this state:\n\nL- |2,2> = sqrt(2(2+1) - 2^2) \u0127 |2,1> \n\nWait, the lowering operator reduces m by 1. The action of L- on |l, m> is proportional to sqrt(l(l+1) - m(m-1)) |l, m-1>. \n\nSo for |2,2>, applying L- gives sqrt(2*3 - 2^2) \u0127 |2,1> \n\nWait, sqrt(6 -4) = sqrt(2) so:\n\nL- |2,2> = sqrt(2)\u0127 |2,1>\n\nTherefore, |2,1> is proportional to L+ |2,0> but maybe I need to go step by step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps building |2,1> requires considering the expansion in terms of |m1,m2> states. \n\nWait, let's try to construct |2,1>. The m=1 state would have m1 + m2 =1. The possible pairs here are (1,0), (0,1), and ( -1, 2?), but no, since m can't exceed l. So (1,0), (0,1). Also (1,0) and (0,1). \n\nWait, m1 can be 1,0,-1 and m2 similarly. The pairs adding to 1 are (1,0), (0,1). \n\nSo the expansion would be:\n\n|2,1> = A |1,0> + B |0,1>\n\nTo find A and B such that this is an eigenstate of L^2 with l=2 and normalized. \n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look up the CG coefficients for this case. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that for the case of two angular momenta each of l=1, the CG coefficients for the state |2, m> can be written as follows: \n\nThe state |2, -1> would be a combination of the | -1,0 > and |0, -1> states. \n\nThe coefficients for these terms can be found using the formula. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficient when l = l1 + l2 (the maximum possible l), then the coefficients for the state |l, m> are sqrt( ( (l1 - m1)! (l2 - m2)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 - m)! (l1 + l2 + m)! )) ) multiplied by some factor, but I might be mixing up the exact expressions. \n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1:\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). \n\nThe CG coefficients for these two terms can be found using the following method. \n\nThe state |2, -1> is the same as the state obtained by applying the lowering operator L- to |2,0> once. But maybe that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the coefficients for the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state |2, -1> is given by:\n\n|2, -1> = ( | -1,0 > + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2) \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. \n\nWait, if the coefficients are equal, then when you square them, their contributions would each be 1/2. But the question is asking for the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127, which would correspond to the state |-1, -1>, but that's not part of the expansion for |2, -1> because m1 + m2 would be -2 there, which is the total m for l=2, m=-2. \n\nAh, right! So the pair (-1, -1) would contribute to the m=-2 state. Therefore, in the state |2, -1>, the pair (-1, -1) is not present. So the only possible terms are the two I mentioned before. \n\nTherefore, the expansion of |2, -1> must be a combination of | -1,0 > and |0, -1>. \n\nAssuming that the coefficients are equal in magnitude (due to symmetry between the two particles?), then each term would have a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the probability of finding either of these states would each be (1/sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 1/2. But the question is about the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -\u0127. That would correspond to the state |-1, -1>, which is not part of this expansion. Therefore, the probability would be zero. \n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z both as -\u0127. So the eigenstate would be |m1 = -1, m2 = -1>. But in the expansion of the given state |2, -1>, this term is not present because the total m would be -2, which is a different state. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both electrons with Lz = -\u0127 is zero. Because the given state is |2, -1>, which doesn't have any component in the |-1, -1> state. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D) 0. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. \n\nSuppose the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. The possible m1 and m2 pairs must add to -1. The pair (-1, -1) sums to -2, which is not -1, so it's not part of the expansion. Hence, the state can't have that term. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both electrons at -\u0127 is zero. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nThe given state is $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, which corresponds to a total angular momentum of $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The possible pairs of individual $m$ values $(m_1, m_2)$ that sum to $m=-1$ are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. The state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which is incompatible with the total $m=-1$. Since the given state does not include the term $|-1, -1\\rangle$, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ is zero.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The problem is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\u0127 when the system is in the state |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, right, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the states are represented using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, each electron has orbital angular momentum l1 = 1 and l2 =1. The coupled state has total angular momentum l =2 and m = -1. The question is about the probability of measuring both electrons having Lz = -\u0127. Since the individual z-components can be -\u0127, 0, or +\u0127 for each electron, the possible combinations for their sum would lead to different m values. \n\nThe state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I believe is a coupled state (the total angular momentum state). To find the probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127, I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states (product states of individual electron angular momenta). The probability will be the square of the coefficient of the term where both L_{1z} and L_{2z} are -\u0127.\n\nSo first, I need to recall how to write the coupled state |l1,l2,l,m> in terms of the uncoupled states |l1,m1> |l2,m2>. The coefficients here are the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients. Specifically, the expansion would be:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = sum_{m1,m2} CG(1,m1;1,m2|2,-1) * |1,m1> |1,m2>\n\nI need to find the coefficient for the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Wait, but m1 + m2 must equal the total m, which is -1 here. So m1 + m2 = -1. If m1 is -1, then m2 must be 0, since -1 +0 = -1? Wait no, because -1 + (-1) would be -2, but the total m is -1. Wait, so m1 + m2 has to equal the total m, which here is -1. So possible pairs (m1, m2) that add to -1 are:\n\n(-1,0), (0,-1), (-2,1) but since each l is 1, the m's can be -1,0,+1. So possible pairs are:\n\nm1=-1 and m2=0 \u2192 sum is -1,\n\nm1=0 and m2=-1 \u2192 sum is -1,\n\nand m1=-1 and m2=-1 \u2192 sum is -2, which doesn't contribute here. So those are the two possible pairs.\n\nTherefore, the CG coefficients for m1 and m2 such that their sum is -1 will contribute. The question is, what is the coefficient for each of these terms in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>?\n\nWait, but the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me recall how the CG coefficients work here. The coupled state |l1,l2,l,m> is constructed from the uncoupled states. The CG coefficients can be found using tables or by calculating them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall some standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two l=1 particles to total l=2. Let me think of the standard basis.\n\nThe total angular momentum states for two l=1 particles (each with l1=1, l2=1) can have total l=0,1,2. Since here l is 2, that's the maximum possible. \n\nThe highest m for l=2 would be m=2. The state |1,1,2,2> would be just |1,1>|1,1> because that's the only way to get m1 + m2 =2. \n\nSimilarly, the state with m=1 for l=2 would be a combination of |1,1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,1>. But when m is lower, like -1 here, perhaps the coefficients can be found by symmetry or recursion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me try to recall the expansion for |1,1,2,-1>.\n\nThe m here is -1, so the total z-component is -1. To get this, the individual m1 and m2 must add to -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1,0), (0,-1). \n\nThe coefficients for these terms in the expansion can be found using the CG coefficients. Let me see if I can remember the formula or maybe use some recursion relations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the standard expansion for the |l1,l2,l,m> states. Let's think of the state |1,1,2,-1>.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l1=1 and l2=1 to l=2, m=-1 can be found as follows.\n\nThe general formula for CG coefficients can be complex, but maybe for specific cases, there's a pattern. Let me consider the states for l=2 and m=-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the lowering operator approach. Let me consider starting from the maximum m state and apply the lowering operator L- to get to the desired state.\n\nThe maximum m for l=2 is 2. The state |1,1,2,2> is just |1,1>|1,1>.\n\nTo get to m=1, apply L- once. But perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, I can look for the coefficients for the state |2, -1> in terms of the uncoupled basis.\n\nAlternatively, I can refer to the standard CG coefficients table for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1.\n\nLet me recall that for l1 and l2 both 1, the CG coefficients for the state |l1,l2,l,m> can be written as follows:\n\nFor example, the state |2, -1> would be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible terms are:\n\n- |m1=-1>|m2=0>,\n\n- |m1=0>|m2=-1>,\n\nand also perhaps other terms? Wait, but m1 and m2 can only be -1,0,1. So only those two terms.\n\nThe coefficients for these terms can be calculated. Let me recall that the CG coefficients for the state |l1,l2,l,m> are given by certain formulas. For l1 = l2 =1, l=2, m=-1:\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the formula for CG coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the coefficients are symmetric for the two terms. Let me think of the normalization.\n\nSuppose the state is a combination:\n\n|2,-1> = a |1,-1>|1,0> + b |1,0>|1,-1>\n\nWe need to find a and b such that this is normalized, and also that it is orthogonal to other states.\n\nAdditionally, the total angular momentum squared operator L^2 should give the correct eigenvalue. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients are equal. Let me think of the symmetry here. Since the system is symmetric under exchange of the two particles (since they are identical fermions, but here we are considering orbital angular momentum, so maybe the orbital part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but in the coupled states, the coefficients can have certain symmetries).\n\nWait, but the coupled states for l=2 would be symmetric under exchange of the two particles. Because the total angular momentum is a symmetric combination. So the coefficients should be symmetric in m1 and m2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients a and b should be equal. So let's suppose a = b. Let me check the normalization.\n\nThe normalization condition requires that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, since there are two terms. Since a = b, then 2|a|^2 =1 \u2192 |a|=1/\u221a2. But wait, maybe there's a sqrt(2) factor somewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an additional factor. Let me think of the general formula for the CG coefficients when the two particles are identical. Wait, but maybe I should just use the standard formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients can be found by considering the action of the lowering operator on the maximum m state.\n\nLet me try that approach. Starting from the state |2,2>, which is |1,1>|1,1>.\n\nApplying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to this state:\n\nL- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-) |1,1>|1,1>\n\n= L1- |1,1> |1,1> + |1,1> L2- |1,1>\n\n= sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,0>|1,1> + sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,1>|1,0>\n\nSo this gives sqrt(2)\u0127 ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> ), which would be proportional to the state |2,1>.\n\nTherefore, the state |2,1> is proportional to ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> ), with a coefficient involving sqrt(2). The normalization would be such that the squared amplitude is 1. Let's see: the coefficient before the terms is sqrt(2) from the lowering operator, so when we divide by the eigenvalue (which would be sqrt( (2)(2+1) - (2-1)^2 ) )? Maybe this is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state |2,1> is ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> ) multiplied by a normalization factor. Since each term has coefficient sqrt(2) from the lowering operator's action, but the normalization would require that the total squared is 1.\n\nWait, actually, the lowering operator applied to |2,2> gives sqrt(2(2+1) - (2-1)^2 )? No, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the state |2,1> is constructed as:\n\nsqrt( ( (l1 - m1)(l1 + m1 +1) ) ) |m1-1, m2> + sqrt( ( (l2 - m2)(l2 + m2 +1) )) |m1, m2-1> ?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1 = l2 = 1, l =2, m=-1.\n\nLooking up in my mind, the standard CG coefficients for two l=1 particles:\n\nThe state |2, -1> can be written as:\n\n( |1, -1>|1, 0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nBecause the coefficients must be symmetric and normalized. Since there are two terms, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2). \n\nWait, but why divided by sqrt(2)? Because the sum of their squares must be 1. So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, so each term is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the expansion is:\n\n|2,-1> = ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the coefficients for each term are 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> (assuming the first two numbers are l1 and l2) would be this expression.\n\nTherefore, when looking for the term where both L_{1z} and L_{2z} are -\u0127 (i.e., m1 = -1 and m2 = -1), but in the expansion above, the terms present are |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>. Neither of these terms has both m1 and m2 equal to -1. The first term has m1=-1 and m2=0, the second has m1=0 and m2=-1. The combination where both are -1 (which would have m_total = -2) is part of the l=2, m=-2 state, but that's a different state.\n\nTherefore, in the given state |1,1,2,-1>, there is no component where both electrons have m = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\u0127 would be zero?\n\nWait, but the question says \"the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by |1,1,2,-1>.\" So that's the state we're in. The expansion shows that in this state, there's no term with both m1 and m2 being -1. Because the only terms are (m1=-1,m2=0) and (m0, m-1). So the product state |1,-1>|1,-1> isn't part of this expansion. Therefore, the probability is zero?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The total m is -1, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. The only way to get that with two electrons each contributing m values of -1,0, or +1 is the pairs (-1,0) and (0,-1). So indeed, the combination (-1, -1) would give a total m of -2, which is a different state (l=2, m=-2). Therefore, in the state given (m=-1), those terms aren't present. Therefore the probability is zero. So the answer would be D) 0?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is about the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127. That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, but since the total m is -1, that's impossible. Because their sum would be -2, not -1. So that's impossible. Therefore, the probability must be zero. So D is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me see. The question states to ignore the spin angular momentum, so we don't have to worry about Pauli exclusion here, but the orbital angular momentum states. Since the state is in a coupled state where the total m is -1, there's no way to have both electrons in m=-1. Hence the probability is zero. So the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ in the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, we need to express this coupled state in terms of uncoupled product states.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the state |2,1> is ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> ) multiplied by a normalization factor. Since each term has coefficient sqrt(2) from the lowering operator's action, but the normalization would require that the total squared is 1.\n\nWait, actually, the lowering operator applied to |2,2> gives sqrt(2(2+1) - (2-1)^2 )? No, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the state |2,1> is constructed as:\n\nsqrt( ( (l1 - m1)(l1 + m1 +1) ) ) |m1-1, m2> + sqrt( ( (l2 - m2)(l2 + m2 +1) )) |m1, m2-1> ?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1 = l2 = 1, l =2, m=-1.\n\nLooking up in my mind, the standard CG coefficients for two l=1 particles:\n\nThe state |2, -1> can be written as:\n\n( |1, -1>|1, 0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nBecause the coefficients must be symmetric and normalized. Since there are two terms, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2). \n\nWait, but why divided by sqrt(2)? Because the sum of their squares must be 1. So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, so each term is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the expansion is:\n\n|2,-1> = ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo the coefficients for each term are 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> (assuming the first two numbers are l1 and l2) would be this expression.\n\nTherefore, when looking for the term where both L_{1z} and L_{2z} are -\u0127 (i.e., m1 = -1 and m2 = -1), but in the expansion above, the terms present are |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>. Neither of these terms has both m1 and m2 equal to -1. The first term has m1=-1 and m2=0, the second has m1=0 and m2=-1. The combination where both are -1 (which would have m_total = -2) is part of the l=2, m=-2 state, but that's a different state.\n\nTherefore, in the given state |1,1,2,-1>, there is no component where both electrons have m = -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L_{1z} and L_{2z} as -\u0127 would be zero?\n\nWait, but the question says \"the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by |1,1,2,-1>.\" So that's the state we're in. The expansion shows that in this state, there's no term with both m1 and m2 being -1. Because the only terms are (m1=-1,m2=0) and (m0, m-1). So the product state |1,-1>|1,-1> isn't part of this expansion. Therefore, the probability is zero?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The total m is -1, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. The only way to get that with two electrons each contributing m values of -1,0, or +1 is the pairs (-1,0) and (0,-1). So indeed, the combination (-1, -1) would give a total m of -2, which is a different state (l=2, m=-2). Therefore, in the state given (m=-1), those terms aren't present. Therefore the probability is zero. So the answer would be D) 0?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is about the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -\u0127. That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, but since the total m is -1, that's impossible. Because their sum would be -2, not -1. So that's impossible. Therefore, the probability must be zero. So D is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me see. The question states to ignore the spin angular momentum, so we don't have to worry about Pauli exclusion here, but the orbital angular momentum states. Since the state is in a coupled state where the total m is -1, there's no way to have both electrons in m=-1. Hence the probability is zero. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ in the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, we need to express this coupled state in terms of uncoupled product states. The total $m$-value of the system is $-1$, meaning the sum of the individual $m$-values ($m_1 + m_2$) must equal $-1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. The state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ expands as:\n\n$$\n|1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |1,-1\\rangle|1,0\\rangle + |1,0\\rangle|1,-1\\rangle \\right).\n$$\n\nThis expansion explicitly shows that there is no contribution from the term $|1,-1\\rangle|1,-1\\rangle$ (which would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$). Since the joint eigenvalues $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ correspond to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which cannot coexist in this state, the probability is zero.\n\nAnswer: D",
