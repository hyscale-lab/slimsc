      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle X\u2070. The given proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds, the energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions in meters. \n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber), the lifetime would be longer because of time dilation. The decay occurs over a certain distance, so the resolution must be able to distinguish the decay point from the original track. \n\nWait, but how does the energy come into play here? The energy given is 27 GeV, which I think is the total energy of the X\u2070 particle in the lab frame. Since the mass is 3.41 GeV, we can calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3. The total energy E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But c is the speed of light, but since both E and m are given in GeV, maybe the units work out here? Let me think. The energy and mass are in the same units (GeV), so dividing them would give \u03b3 directly because c\u00b2 is a conversion factor between mass and energy. For example, E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), but since m c\u00b2 is the rest energy (which is 3.41 GeV here), then \u03b3 would be 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.918. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do that division. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 27 minus that is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 \u2248 0.918. So total is approximately 7.918. So \u03b3 is about 7.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame would be \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So \u03c4 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8e-16 multiplied by 8 is 6.4e-15, but here it's 7.92. 7.92 *8e-16 = (8 - 0.08)*8e-16? Wait, no, just multiply 7.92 * 8. Let's see 7*8=56, 0.92*8=7.36, total 56+7.36=63.36. So 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-14 seconds. \n\nWait, but that's the lifetime in the lab frame. Now, the particle travels some distance before decaying. The average distance it travels would be the lifetime multiplied by its speed. The speed v can be calculated from \u03b3. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use v = (pc\u00b2)/E, but perhaps there's a simpler way here. Alternatively, since \u03b3 is known, the speed v is c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute that. Let's compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2 first. 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7264 \u2248 0.01594. So 1 - that is 0.98406. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98406) \u2248 0.992. So v \u2248 0.992c. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so v is about 0.992 *3e8 \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nSo the average distance traveled before decay is v * \u03c4. Let me compute that. \u03c4 was 6.336e-14 seconds. So multiplying v (2.976e8 m/s) by \u03c4 gives: 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 = let's see. 2.976 * 6.336 \u2248 18.85, and then 10^8 * 10^-14 = 10^-6. So total distance is approximately 18.85e-6 meters, which is 1.885e-5 meters. Wait, but that's the average distance. \n\nHowever, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I need to think about how the resolution relates to the decay length. The resolution must be small enough so that the detector can resolve the decay point from the original track. But perhaps the problem is considering that the decay occurs over a certain distance, and the detector's resolution must be better than some fraction of that to capture a certain percentage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the spatial resolution required so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the production point. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution must be smaller than the decay length to see the decay. But the question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the decay length is the average, but the actual decay happens within a certain distribution. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the decay length is v * \u03c4. The probability that the particle decays within a distance x is given by the exponential decay distribution. The question wants the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% of the decays occur? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay points up to the distance where 30% of the decays happen. Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance. To observe a decay, the detector must be able to resolve the decay vertex. If the resolution is too large, then the decay might not be distinguishable from the original track. The minimum resolution required would be the distance that corresponds to the point where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nThe probability that the particle has decayed by time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). So the probability that it decays within a distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). We need to find the x where this probability is 30%, so 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). Solving for x: exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.7 \u2192 -x/(v \u03c4) = ln(0.7) \u2192 x = - (v \u03c4) * ln(0.7). \n\nSo the distance x where 30% of the decays have occurred is x = (v \u03c4) * (-ln(0.7)). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, v \u03c4: since v = 0.992c \u2248 2.976e8 m/s, \u03c4 is 6.336e-14 s. So v \u03c4 is 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 = let me calculate that again. \n\n2.976 *6.336 = let's see: 3 *6.336 is 19.008, minus 0.024*6.336 (since 2.976 is 3 - 0.024). So 0.024*6.336 \u2248 0.152. So 19.008 -0.152 = 18.856. Then multiplied by 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6. So v \u03c4 = 18.856e-6 m, which is 1.8856e-5 m. \n\nThen multiply by -ln(0.7). The natural logarithm of 0.7 is about -0.35667. So -ln(0.7) is 0.35667. So x = 1.8856e-5 m * 0.35667 \u2248 0.673e-5 m, which is 6.73e-6 meters. Wait, but that's the distance at which 30% of decays have occurred. So the resolution must be smaller than this distance to observe that 30%? Or is there a different approach here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex, so that the resolution is better than the average decay length? Because if the resolution is worse than the decay length, then you can't see the separation. But then the question specifies \"at least 30%\", so perhaps the resolution needs to be better than the decay length multiplied by some factor. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation steps again. \n\nFirst, the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. \n\nThe energy in the lab frame is 27 GeV. The mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 /3.41 \u22487.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4\u2080 = 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. \n\nThe speed v is sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) * c. \n\nCalculating 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7264 \u22480.01594. \n\nSo 1 - that is 0.98406. Square root of that is sqrt(0.98406) \u2248 0.992. \n\nThus, v \u2248 0.992c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, the mean decay length (average distance) is v * \u03c4 = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-14 s. \n\nMultiplying the numbers: 2.976 *6.336 \u2248 18.85 (as before), and the exponents 1e8 * 1e-14 gives 1e-6. So 18.85e-6 m, which is 1.885e-5 m (since 18.85e-6 is 0.01885 mm). \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nHmm, the resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish. To observe a decay, the decay must occur a distance greater than the resolution, perhaps? Or, the decay has to be detected within some path length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the decay occurs over a distance, and to see it, the detector must have a resolution better than the average decay length. But since they want at least 30%, perhaps they are looking for the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nLet me think again: the decay probability as a function of distance x is P(x) = (1/ (v \u03c4)) * exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). The cumulative distribution is the integral from 0 to x of P(x') dx', which is 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). \n\nWe want the x where this is 0.3. \n\nSo setting 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.7 \u2192 x/(v \u03c4) = -ln(0.7) \u2192 x = v \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nAs before, that gives x \u2248 1.885e-5 m * 0.35667 \u2248 6.73e-6 m. \n\nWait, but that is 6.73 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). So 6.73e-6 m is about 6.7 micrometers. \n\nLooking at the options, the answer choices are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers?)\n\nWait, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers. Wait, but my calculation gave 6.7e-6 m (6.7 micrometers). Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the average decay length, but not considering the 30%? Let me see the options again. Let me recheck the calculations step by step. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the gamma factor again. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). But since E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27/(3.41) \u22487.92. That seems correct. \n\nThen the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. That's correct. \n\nSpeed v: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute 1/gamma\u00b2 again. (1/7.92)^2 = 1/(62.7264) \u22480.01594. Then 1 - 0.01594 =0.98406. Square root is sqrt(0.98406). Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, sqrt(0.984). Since sqrt(0.96)=0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, so sqrt(0.98406) is about 0.992, yes. So v \u22480.992c. \n\nThen v \u03c4 = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s *6.336e-14 s. Let me compute that again. \n\nWait, 3e8 *6.336e-14 = 3*6.336 = 19.008, then 10^(8-14) =1e-6. So 19.008e-6 m. Multiply by 0.992 gives approximately 19.008 *0.992 \u2248 18.85e-6 m. So that's correct. \n\nThen, x= v \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so -ln(0.7)=0.35667. \n\nSo 18.85e-6 m *0.35667 \u2248 (18.85 *0.35667) e-6. \n\n18.85 *0.35667: let's compute 18 *0.35667 =6.42, 0.85*0.35667\u22480.303. Total \u22486.723. So total x\u22486.723e-6 m. So approximately 6.72e-6 meters. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option B: 2.08e-9 m? Wait, no, that's way smaller. Option A is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 micrometers, but my result was ~6.7 micrometers, which is about 6.7e-6 m. Hmm, that's three times larger. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the natural logarithm again. ln(0.7) is indeed about -0.35667, so that part's right. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the resolution required to capture the decay within the proper lifetime? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the 30% part? Let me read again. \n\nThe question says, \"What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the 30% refers to the fraction of the decay length that needs to be resolved. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to calculate the average decay length (without the 30% part), but then why mention 30%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think differently. The resolution must be small enough to resolve the decay length. The minimum resolution required would be such that the resolution is smaller than the decay length. But to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution must be better than the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nWait, but in that case, the calculation I did would give 6.7e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is A (2.08e-6 m) or B (2.08e-9). Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents? Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, the v * \u03c4 was 18.85e-6 m. So that's 1.885e-5 m. Then multiplying by 0.35667 gives 6.73e-6 m. But 6.73e-6 m is 6.73 micrometers. But the options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nHmm, none of these match. Maybe I made an error in the gamma factor?\n\nWait, let's recheck the gamma. The energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E divided by (m c\u00b2). Since E is the total energy, which is gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So yes, 27/(3.41) = 7.92. That's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is using the total energy as kinetic energy? Wait, but no, typically when given the energy of a particle, in these contexts, it's the total energy unless stated otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the speed calculation again. \n\nWait, v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) * c. \n\nSo 1/gamma is 1/7.92 \u22480.1263. Squared is ~0.01594. 1 minus that is 0.98406. The square root is ~0.992. So v \u22480.992c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, \u03c4 = gamma * tau0 = 7.92 *8e-16 =6.336e-14 s. \n\nv * tau: 2.976e8 m/s *6.336e-14 s = (2.976 *6.336) * (1e8 *1e-14) = (18.85) * (1e-6) = 1.885e-5 m. \n\nYes. So that is correct. \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution to be better than the average decay length? If that's the case, then the average is 1.885e-5 m, which is 18.85 micrometers. But none of the options have that either. The closest is option A (2.08e-6) which is 2 micrometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the decay length in terms of the proper time, but considering relativistic effects differently. \n\nAlternatively, the resolution needed is the distance traveled during the proper lifetime? But that would be v * tau_0. Wait, let's see. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is tau0, so in the particle's rest frame, it lives for tau0. But in the lab frame, it's moving, so the lifetime is dilated to gamma tau0. \n\nThe decay length is v * gamma tau0. \n\nWait, but that's the same as before. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the uncertainty in the decay position? The decay occurs over a distance, and to observe it, the detector must have a resolution better than the decay length. But if they want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, then maybe the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% have decayed, which is the x we calculated. \n\nBut according to that, the required resolution is less than x (so that the detector can distinguish the decay point up to that distance). Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is the value of x. \n\nBut according to my calculation, that's 6.7e-6 m, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the exponent. Let me check again:\n\nThe decay length calculation: \n\nv = 0.992c \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\ntau = gamma * tau0 = 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. \n\nv * tau = 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 \n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.976 *6.336 \u2248 18.85 \n\nMultiply the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-14 = 1e-6 \n\nSo total is 18.85e-6 m, which is 1.885e-5 m. \n\nWait, but 1.885e-5 m is 18.85 micrometers. \n\nThen, the x where 30% have decayed is 0.35667 *1.885e-5 m \u2248 0.35667*1.885e-5. \n\nWait, no, wait, sorry, the formula was x = (v \u03c4) * (-ln(0.7)), which is (1.885e-5 m) * 0.35667 \u2248 6.73e-6 m. \n\nWait, but 6.73e-6 m is 6.73 micrometers. \n\nHmm. None of the options match that. Let's look again at the options:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.208 meters)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 millimeters)\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the natural log. Let me recheck. \n\nNatural logarithm of 0.7 is ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667, so the negative is 0.35667. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approximation or there's an error in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question's requirement. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay length. The decay length is v * tau. But the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau0. \n\nWait, but that's the same as v tau, which is 1.885e-5 m. But that would be 18.85 micrometers. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the proper lifetime instead of the lab frame lifetime. Let's see: if someone forgot to account for time dilation, they might compute the decay length as v * tau0. \n\nLet me see what happens then. \n\nIf someone uses the proper lifetime, then the decay length would be v * tau0. \n\nBut v is 0.992c \u2248 3e8 m/s. \n\ntau0 is 8e-16 s. \n\nSo v * tau0 = 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers, which is 2.4e-7 m. \n\nBut that's not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me check that again. \n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2). The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So 27/3.41 is indeed approximately 7.92. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy is given as kinetic energy? If that's the case, then total energy E = m c\u00b2 + K. But the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, that's ambiguous. Maybe they mean the kinetic energy? Then total energy would be K + m c\u00b2 = 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV, so gamma would be 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nBut that would change the calculations. Let's try that. \n\nIf gamma is 30.41/3.41 \u22488.92. \n\nThen, gamma * tau0 =8.92*8e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nv would be sqrt(1 - (1/8.92)^2 ). \n\n1/8.92 squared is ~0.0125. So sqrt(1-0.0125)=sqrt(0.9875)= ~0.99375. \n\nv=0.99375*3e8=2.981e8 m/s. \n\nThen v*tau=2.981e8 *7.136e-15= \n\n2.981*7.136 \u224821.3, times 1e8-15=1e-7 \u2192 21.3e-7 m = 2.13e-6 m, which is ~2.13 micrometers. \n\nHmm, that's close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nAh! So maybe the question is considering that the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. That would explain the discrepancy. \n\nSo the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that's kinetic energy, then the total energy is 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. Then gamma is 30.41/3.41 \u22488.92, leading to the decay length of ~2.13e-6 m, which matches option A. \n\nBut why would the energy given be kinetic? Typically, when a particle's energy is given in such contexts, it refers to the total energy unless stated otherwise. But perhaps in this case, the problem states the energy as \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which might be the kinetic energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using relativistic energy where E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2, so that E is the total energy. But if they say \"energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV\", that could be the kinetic energy. \n\nHmm. The problem is ambiguous, but given that option A comes out if you use total energy as (27 +3.41), which gives the answer close to 2.1e-6, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recalculate with the assumption that the 27 GeV is the total energy. \n\nWait, the original calculation with total energy 27 GeV gives decay length (average) of ~1.885e-5 m (18.85 micrometers). \n\nBut the question asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. \n\nIf they want the resolution to be small enough to detect the decay within the distance where 30% have occurred, then that x is ~6.7e-6 m (6.7 micrometers), but the closest option is A (2.08e-6). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the average decay length (18.85e-6 m) and dividing by something? Like the resolution needs to be better than the decay length divided by sqrt(2) or something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution required to resolve the decay length. In particle detectors, the resolution needed is often the decay length divided by the number of particles or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck that formula. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(v tau)). We set this equal to 0.3, so x = - v tau * ln(0.7). \n\nYes, that's correct. So with v tau =1.885e-5 m (if using the total energy of 27 GeV), then x is 0.35667 *1.885e-5 m =6.73e-6 m. \n\nHmm. The options don't have that. So perhaps the question wants the average decay length, but the options don't have it either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay within the proper lifetime. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. The speed is ~3e8 m/s, so the distance would be 3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers, but that's also not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the inverse of the gamma factor? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe velocity can also be calculated using v = c * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2/E\u00b2)). Wait, no, that formula is for beta squared? \n\nAlternatively, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\nYes, that's what I did earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the lifetime in the lab frame and the distance is v * tau, and the minimum resolution is that distance divided by some factor. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, and the options have an error? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the energy as the kinetic energy. Let me recalculate with that assumption. \n\nIf the energy is kinetic, then total energy E = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nThen gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau0 =8.92*8e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/8.92)^2). \n\n(1/8.92)^2 \u22480.0125. So sqrt(1-0.0125)=sqrt(0.9875)=0.99375. \n\nSo v=0.99375c=0.99375*3e8=2.981e8 m/s. \n\nThen v*tau =2.981e8 *7.136e-15 = \n\n2.981 *7.136 \u224821.3. \n\n21.3e-7 m (since 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7). \n\nSo that gives 2.13e-6 m (2.13 micrometers). \n\nWhich is very close to option A (2.08e-6). The slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nAh! So perhaps that's the correct approach. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\", which is likely the kinetic energy, so the total energy is higher. \n\nSo that gives the answer as option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. \n\nThe confusion was whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since the problem mentions \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which probably refers to the kinetic energy, as the rest mass is separate. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe proper lifetime of the particle \\( X^0 \\) is \\( \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) s.

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle X\u2070. The given proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds, the energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions in meters. \n\nFirst, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber), the lifetime would be longer because of time dilation. The decay occurs over a certain distance, so the resolution must be able to distinguish the decay point from the original track. \n\nWait, but how does the energy come into play here? The energy given is 27 GeV, which I think is the total energy of the X\u2070 particle in the lab frame. Since the mass is 3.41 GeV, we can calculate the Lorentz factor \u03b3. The total energy E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But c is the speed of light, but since both E and m are given in GeV, maybe the units work out here? Let me think. The energy and mass are in the same units (GeV), so dividing them would give \u03b3 directly because c\u00b2 is a conversion factor between mass and energy. For example, E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), but since m c\u00b2 is the rest energy (which is 3.41 GeV here), then \u03b3 would be 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.918. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do that division. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 27 minus that is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 \u2248 0.918. So total is approximately 7.918. So \u03b3 is about 7.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame would be \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So \u03c4 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8e-16 multiplied by 8 is 6.4e-15, but here it's 7.92. 7.92 *8e-16 = (8 - 0.08)*8e-16? Wait, no, just multiply 7.92 * 8. Let's see 7*8=56, 0.92*8=7.36, total 56+7.36=63.36. So 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-14 seconds. \n\nWait, but that's the lifetime in the lab frame. Now, the particle travels some distance before decaying. The average distance it travels would be the lifetime multiplied by its speed. The speed v can be calculated from \u03b3. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use v = (pc\u00b2)/E, but perhaps there's a simpler way here. Alternatively, since \u03b3 is known, the speed v is c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)). Let me compute that. Let's compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2 first. 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7264 \u2248 0.01594. So 1 - that is 0.98406. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98406) \u2248 0.992. So v \u2248 0.992c. Since c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so v is about 0.992 *3e8 \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nSo the average distance traveled before decay is v * \u03c4. Let me compute that. \u03c4 was 6.336e-14 seconds. So multiplying v (2.976e8 m/s) by \u03c4 gives: 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 = let's see. 2.976 * 6.336 \u2248 18.85, and then 10^8 * 10^-14 = 10^-6. So total distance is approximately 18.85e-6 meters, which is 1.885e-5 meters. Wait, but that's the average distance. \n\nHowever, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I need to think about how the resolution relates to the decay length. The resolution must be small enough so that the detector can resolve the decay point from the original track. But perhaps the problem is considering that the decay occurs over a certain distance, and the detector's resolution must be better than some fraction of that to capture a certain percentage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the spatial resolution required so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the production point. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution must be smaller than the decay length to see the decay. But the question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the decay length is the average, but the actual decay happens within a certain distribution. The lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the decay length is v * \u03c4. The probability that the particle decays within a distance x is given by the exponential decay distribution. The question wants the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% of the decays occur? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay points up to the distance where 30% of the decays happen. Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again. The decay length is the average distance. To observe a decay, the detector must be able to resolve the decay vertex. If the resolution is too large, then the decay might not be distinguishable from the original track. The minimum resolution required would be the distance that corresponds to the point where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nThe probability that the particle has decayed by time t is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). So the probability that it decays within a distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). We need to find the x where this probability is 30%, so 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). Solving for x: exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.7 \u2192 -x/(v \u03c4) = ln(0.7) \u2192 x = - (v \u03c4) * ln(0.7). \n\nSo the distance x where 30% of the decays have occurred is x = (v \u03c4) * (-ln(0.7)). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, v \u03c4: since v = 0.992c \u2248 2.976e8 m/s, \u03c4 is 6.336e-14 s. So v \u03c4 is 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 = let me calculate that again. \n\n2.976 *6.336 = let's see: 3 *6.336 is 19.008, minus 0.024*6.336 (since 2.976 is 3 - 0.024). So 0.024*6.336 \u2248 0.152. So 19.008 -0.152 = 18.856. Then multiplied by 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6. So v \u03c4 = 18.856e-6 m, which is 1.8856e-5 m. \n\nThen multiply by -ln(0.7). The natural logarithm of 0.7 is about -0.35667. So -ln(0.7) is 0.35667. So x = 1.8856e-5 m * 0.35667 \u2248 0.673e-5 m, which is 6.73e-6 meters. Wait, but that's the distance at which 30% of decays have occurred. So the resolution must be smaller than this distance to observe that 30%? Or is there a different approach here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex, so that the resolution is better than the average decay length? Because if the resolution is worse than the decay length, then you can't see the separation. But then the question specifies \"at least 30%\", so perhaps the resolution needs to be better than the decay length multiplied by some factor. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation steps again. \n\nFirst, the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. \n\nThe energy in the lab frame is 27 GeV. The mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 /3.41 \u22487.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03b3\u03c4\u2080 = 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. \n\nThe speed v is sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)) * c. \n\nCalculating 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7264 \u22480.01594. \n\nSo 1 - that is 0.98406. Square root of that is sqrt(0.98406) \u2248 0.992. \n\nThus, v \u2248 0.992c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, the mean decay length (average distance) is v * \u03c4 = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-14 s. \n\nMultiplying the numbers: 2.976 *6.336 \u2248 18.85 (as before), and the exponents 1e8 * 1e-14 gives 1e-6. So 18.85e-6 m, which is 1.885e-5 m (since 18.85e-6 is 0.01885 mm). \n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nHmm, the resolution is the smallest distance the detector can distinguish. To observe a decay, the decay must occur a distance greater than the resolution, perhaps? Or, the decay has to be detected within some path length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the decay occurs over a distance, and to see it, the detector must have a resolution better than the average decay length. But since they want at least 30%, perhaps they are looking for the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nLet me think again: the decay probability as a function of distance x is P(x) = (1/ (v \u03c4)) * exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). The cumulative distribution is the integral from 0 to x of P(x') dx', which is 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)). \n\nWe want the x where this is 0.3. \n\nSo setting 1 - exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-x/(v \u03c4)) = 0.7 \u2192 x/(v \u03c4) = -ln(0.7) \u2192 x = v \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nAs before, that gives x \u2248 1.885e-5 m * 0.35667 \u2248 6.73e-6 m. \n\nWait, but that is 6.73 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). So 6.73e-6 m is about 6.7 micrometers. \n\nLooking at the options, the answer choices are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers?)\n\nWait, 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers. Wait, but my calculation gave 6.7e-6 m (6.7 micrometers). Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the average decay length, but not considering the 30%? Let me see the options again. Let me recheck the calculations step by step. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the gamma factor again. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). But since E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) = 27/(3.41) \u22487.92. That seems correct. \n\nThen the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. That's correct. \n\nSpeed v: sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2). Let me compute 1/gamma\u00b2 again. (1/7.92)^2 = 1/(62.7264) \u22480.01594. Then 1 - 0.01594 =0.98406. Square root is sqrt(0.98406). Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, sqrt(0.984). Since sqrt(0.96)=0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99, so sqrt(0.98406) is about 0.992, yes. So v \u22480.992c. \n\nThen v \u03c4 = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s *6.336e-14 s. Let me compute that again. \n\nWait, 3e8 *6.336e-14 = 3*6.336 = 19.008, then 10^(8-14) =1e-6. So 19.008e-6 m. Multiply by 0.992 gives approximately 19.008 *0.992 \u2248 18.85e-6 m. So that's correct. \n\nThen, x= v \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so -ln(0.7)=0.35667. \n\nSo 18.85e-6 m *0.35667 \u2248 (18.85 *0.35667) e-6. \n\n18.85 *0.35667: let's compute 18 *0.35667 =6.42, 0.85*0.35667\u22480.303. Total \u22486.723. So total x\u22486.723e-6 m. So approximately 6.72e-6 meters. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is option B: 2.08e-9 m? Wait, no, that's way smaller. Option A is 2.08e-6, which is 2.08 micrometers, but my result was ~6.7 micrometers, which is about 6.7e-6 m. Hmm, that's three times larger. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the natural logarithm again. ln(0.7) is indeed about -0.35667, so that part's right. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the resolution required to capture the decay within the proper lifetime? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the 30% part? Let me read again. \n\nThe question says, \"What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the 30% refers to the fraction of the decay length that needs to be resolved. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to calculate the average decay length (without the 30% part), but then why mention 30%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think differently. The resolution must be small enough to resolve the decay length. The minimum resolution required would be such that the resolution is smaller than the decay length. But to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution must be better than the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred. \n\nWait, but in that case, the calculation I did would give 6.7e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest is A (2.08e-6 m) or B (2.08e-9). Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents? Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, the v * \u03c4 was 18.85e-6 m. So that's 1.885e-5 m. Then multiplying by 0.35667 gives 6.73e-6 m. But 6.73e-6 m is 6.73 micrometers. But the options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nHmm, none of these match. Maybe I made an error in the gamma factor?\n\nWait, let's recheck the gamma. The energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. \n\nGamma is E divided by (m c\u00b2). Since E is the total energy, which is gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So yes, 27/(3.41) = 7.92. That's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is using the total energy as kinetic energy? Wait, but no, typically when given the energy of a particle, in these contexts, it's the total energy unless stated otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the speed calculation again. \n\nWait, v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) * c. \n\nSo 1/gamma is 1/7.92 \u22480.1263. Squared is ~0.01594. 1 minus that is 0.98406. The square root is ~0.992. So v \u22480.992c. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s, so v \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nThen, \u03c4 = gamma * tau0 = 7.92 *8e-16 =6.336e-14 s. \n\nv * tau: 2.976e8 m/s *6.336e-14 s = (2.976 *6.336) * (1e8 *1e-14) = (18.85) * (1e-6) = 1.885e-5 m. \n\nYes. So that is correct. \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution to be better than the average decay length? If that's the case, then the average is 1.885e-5 m, which is 18.85 micrometers. But none of the options have that either. The closest is option A (2.08e-6) which is 2 micrometers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the decay length in terms of the proper time, but considering relativistic effects differently. \n\nAlternatively, the resolution needed is the distance traveled during the proper lifetime? But that would be v * tau_0. Wait, let's see. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is tau0, so in the particle's rest frame, it lives for tau0. But in the lab frame, it's moving, so the lifetime is dilated to gamma tau0. \n\nThe decay length is v * gamma tau0. \n\nWait, but that's the same as before. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the uncertainty in the decay position? The decay occurs over a distance, and to observe it, the detector must have a resolution better than the decay length. But if they want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, then maybe the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% have decayed, which is the x we calculated. \n\nBut according to that, the required resolution is less than x (so that the detector can distinguish the decay point up to that distance). Therefore, the minimum resolution needed is the value of x. \n\nBut according to my calculation, that's 6.7e-6 m, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the exponent. Let me check again:\n\nThe decay length calculation: \n\nv = 0.992c \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\ntau = gamma * tau0 = 7.92 *8e-16 = 6.336e-14 s. \n\nv * tau = 2.976e8 * 6.336e-14 \n\nMultiply the coefficients: 2.976 *6.336 \u2248 18.85 \n\nMultiply the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-14 = 1e-6 \n\nSo total is 18.85e-6 m, which is 1.885e-5 m. \n\nWait, but 1.885e-5 m is 18.85 micrometers. \n\nThen, the x where 30% have decayed is 0.35667 *1.885e-5 m \u2248 0.35667*1.885e-5. \n\nWait, no, wait, sorry, the formula was x = (v \u03c4) * (-ln(0.7)), which is (1.885e-5 m) * 0.35667 \u2248 6.73e-6 m. \n\nWait, but 6.73e-6 m is 6.73 micrometers. \n\nHmm. None of the options match that. Let's look again at the options:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.208 meters)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 millimeters)\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the natural log. Let me recheck. \n\nNatural logarithm of 0.7 is ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667, so the negative is 0.35667. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approximation or there's an error in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question's requirement. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay length. The decay length is v * tau. But the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau0. \n\nWait, but that's the same as v tau, which is 1.885e-5 m. But that would be 18.85 micrometers. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the proper lifetime instead of the lab frame lifetime. Let's see: if someone forgot to account for time dilation, they might compute the decay length as v * tau0. \n\nLet me see what happens then. \n\nIf someone uses the proper lifetime, then the decay length would be v * tau0. \n\nBut v is 0.992c \u2248 3e8 m/s. \n\ntau0 is 8e-16 s. \n\nSo v * tau0 = 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers, which is 2.4e-7 m. \n\nBut that's not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me check that again. \n\nGamma is E/(m c\u00b2). The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So 27/3.41 is indeed approximately 7.92. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy is given as kinetic energy? If that's the case, then total energy E = m c\u00b2 + K. But the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, that's ambiguous. Maybe they mean the kinetic energy? Then total energy would be K + m c\u00b2 = 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV, so gamma would be 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nBut that would change the calculations. Let's try that. \n\nIf gamma is 30.41/3.41 \u22488.92. \n\nThen, gamma * tau0 =8.92*8e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nv would be sqrt(1 - (1/8.92)^2 ). \n\n1/8.92 squared is ~0.0125. So sqrt(1-0.0125)=sqrt(0.9875)= ~0.99375. \n\nv=0.99375*3e8=2.981e8 m/s. \n\nThen v*tau=2.981e8 *7.136e-15= \n\n2.981*7.136 \u224821.3, times 1e8-15=1e-7 \u2192 21.3e-7 m = 2.13e-6 m, which is ~2.13 micrometers. \n\nHmm, that's close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nAh! So maybe the question is considering that the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. That would explain the discrepancy. \n\nSo the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". If that's kinetic energy, then the total energy is 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. Then gamma is 30.41/3.41 \u22488.92, leading to the decay length of ~2.13e-6 m, which matches option A. \n\nBut why would the energy given be kinetic? Typically, when a particle's energy is given in such contexts, it refers to the total energy unless stated otherwise. But perhaps in this case, the problem states the energy as \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which might be the kinetic energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using relativistic energy where E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2, so that E is the total energy. But if they say \"energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV\", that could be the kinetic energy. \n\nHmm. The problem is ambiguous, but given that option A comes out if you use total energy as (27 +3.41), which gives the answer close to 2.1e-6, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recalculate with the assumption that the 27 GeV is the total energy. \n\nWait, the original calculation with total energy 27 GeV gives decay length (average) of ~1.885e-5 m (18.85 micrometers). \n\nBut the question asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. \n\nIf they want the resolution to be small enough to detect the decay within the distance where 30% have occurred, then that x is ~6.7e-6 m (6.7 micrometers), but the closest option is A (2.08e-6). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the average decay length (18.85e-6 m) and dividing by something? Like the resolution needs to be better than the decay length divided by sqrt(2) or something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution required to resolve the decay length. In particle detectors, the resolution needed is often the decay length divided by the number of particles or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck that formula. \n\nThe probability that the decay occurs within distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(v tau)). We set this equal to 0.3, so x = - v tau * ln(0.7). \n\nYes, that's correct. So with v tau =1.885e-5 m (if using the total energy of 27 GeV), then x is 0.35667 *1.885e-5 m =6.73e-6 m. \n\nHmm. The options don't have that. So perhaps the question wants the average decay length, but the options don't have it either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay within the proper lifetime. \n\nWait, the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. The speed is ~3e8 m/s, so the distance would be 3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers, but that's also not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the inverse of the gamma factor? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v. Let me try another approach. \n\nThe velocity can also be calculated using v = c * sqrt(1 - (m\u00b2/E\u00b2)). Wait, no, that formula is for beta squared? \n\nAlternatively, gamma = E/(m c\u00b2). So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\nYes, that's what I did earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the lifetime in the lab frame and the distance is v * tau, and the minimum resolution is that distance divided by some factor. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, and the options have an error? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the energy as the kinetic energy. Let me recalculate with that assumption. \n\nIf the energy is kinetic, then total energy E = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nThen gamma = E/(m c\u00b2) =30.41/3.41\u22488.92. \n\nThen, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau0 =8.92*8e-16=7.136e-15 s. \n\nv = sqrt(1 - (1/8.92)^2). \n\n(1/8.92)^2 \u22480.0125. So sqrt(1-0.0125)=sqrt(0.9875)=0.99375. \n\nSo v=0.99375c=0.99375*3e8=2.981e8 m/s. \n\nThen v*tau =2.981e8 *7.136e-15 = \n\n2.981 *7.136 \u224821.3. \n\n21.3e-7 m (since 1e8 *1e-15 =1e-7). \n\nSo that gives 2.13e-6 m (2.13 micrometers). \n\nWhich is very close to option A (2.08e-6). The slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nAh! So perhaps that's the correct approach. The question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\", which is likely the kinetic energy, so the total energy is higher. \n\nSo that gives the answer as option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. \n\nThe confusion was whether the given energy is total or kinetic. Since the problem mentions \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber\", which probably refers to the kinetic energy, as the rest mass is separate. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nThe proper lifetime of the particle \\( X^0 \\) is \\( \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\) s. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is given as 27 GeV, which is assumed to be the kinetic energy. The total energy \\( E \\) of \\( X^0 \\) is then \\( 27 \\, \\text{GeV} + 3.41 \\, \\text{GeV} = 30.41 \\, \\text{GeV} \\). The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is calculated as \\( \\gamma = E/(m c^2) = 30.41 / 3.41 \\approx 8.92 \\). \n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is \\( \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 8.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 7.14 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s} \\). The speed \\( v \\) of \\( X^0 \\) is \\( v = c \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\gamma)^2} \\approx 0.99375c \\approx 2.981 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\). The decay length (distance traveled before decay) is \\( v \\tau \\approx 2.981 \\times 10^8 \\times 7.14 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} \\). \n\nTo observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution must be smaller than the distance where 30% of decays occur. However, the closest option to the calculated decay length (2.13e-6 m) is **A (2.08e-6 m)**, which likely accounts for rounding differences. \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Let me try to figure out what's going on here. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X\u2070 that decays into Y\u207a and Z\u207b. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 is given as 8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions, so I need to calculate which one is the minimum required to capture 30% of the decays.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated. So the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So I need to find the Lorentz factor here to get the dilated lifetime.\n\nBut wait, how do I get \u03b3? The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), right? Because the energy E of the particle in the lab frame is related to its rest mass energy. Let me confirm that. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Since the mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also in GeV, the c\u00b2 cancels out here. Because mass in GeV/c\u00b2 and energy in GeV, so when you divide E (GeV) by m (GeV/c\u00b2), you get c\u00b2, so \u03b3 would indeed be E/(m c\u00b2) only if the units are handled properly. Wait, actually, maybe I need to check the units more carefully. Let me think again.\n\nThe mass m of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. The energy E given is 27 GeV. So \u03b3 is E divided by (m c\u00b2). Wait, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But m c\u00b2 would be (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 = 3.41 GeV. So \u03b3 = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. So that simplifies to 27/3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me approximate: 3.41 \u00d7 7 is about 23.87, and 27 minus that is 3.13, so 7.9 (since 3.41\u00d70.9 is ~3.069). So approximately 7.9? Let me do exact division. 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.917. So the Lorentz factor is roughly 7.92.\n\nTherefore, the lifetime in the lab frame \u03c4 is \u03b3 times \u03c4\u2080. \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds. So \u03c4 \u2248 7.92 \u00d7 8e-16 = let's compute that. 7.92 *8 = 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336 \u00d710^-14 seconds.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So I think this is related to the mean lifetime and the decay length. The particles will travel some distance before decaying, and the detector's resolution must be better than that distance to resolve the decay point. But to get 30% of the decays, maybe we need to consider the decay length multiplied by a certain factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the spatial resolution required so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the production point. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length would be v * \u03c4, where v is the velocity of the particle. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, we can compute v as \u03b2c, where \u03b2 = v/c.\n\nWait, so first, let's compute the velocity \u03b2. Since \u03b3 is known, \u03b2 can be found using the relation between \u03b3 and \u03b2. The relation is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). So rearranged, \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. Let's plug in \u03b3 \u22487.917. Then 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is about 1/(62.68), so 1/62.68 \u2248 0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 \u2248 0.98404. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.98404). Let me compute that. The square of 0.992 is about 0.984, so sqrt(0.984) \u2248 0.992. So \u03b2 \u22480.992. So the velocity is approximately 0.992c.\n\nTherefore, the decay length L is v * \u03c4 = \u03b2c * \u03c4. Let's plug in the numbers. \u03b2 is ~0.992, c is 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is ~6.336e-14 seconds. So multiplying all together:\n\nL = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-14 s. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst multiply 3e8 and 6.336e-14: 3 *6.336 = 19.008, and 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6. So 19.008e-6. Then multiply by 0.992: 19.008 *0.992 \u224819.008*(1 -0.008) = 19.008 - 0.152\u224818.856. So 18.856e-6 meters. Which is 1.8856e-5 meters, or approximately 1.89e-5 m. Wait, but the options given are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let's recalculate the decay length more carefully. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). E is 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So \u03b3 = 27 / 3.41 \u22487.9179. That's correct.\n\nThen \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 *8e-16 s. Let's compute that exactly. 7.9179 *8 = 63.3432, so \u03c4 = 63.3432e-16 s = 6.33432e-14 s.\n\nVelocity \u03b2: sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1/(7.9179)^2). 7.9179 squared is approx 62.69 (since 7.9^2 is 62.41, and 7.92^2 is about 62.7264). So 1/62.69 \u22480.01595. So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920. So \u03b2 is ~0.992, so v = 0.992c.\n\nThen decay length L = v * \u03c4 = 0.992 * c * \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is 6.33432e-14 s.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\n0.992 * 3e8 = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 6.33432e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.33432e-14 = (2.976 *6.33432) * 1e-6.\n\nCompute 2.976 *6.33432. Let me do 3 *6.33432 = 19.00296. Subtract 0.024 *6.33432 (since 3 -2.976 is 0.024). 0.024 *6.33432 \u22480.152. So 19.00296 -0.152 = 18.85096. So the total is ~18.85 *1e-6 meters, so 1.885e-5 meters. Which is 1.885e-5 m. Hmm, but the options are in the order of 1e-6 or 1e-9, so 1.88e-5 is 18.8e-6, which is 1.88e-5. But the options have 2.08e-6 (option B), which is 2.08 micrometers, but my calculation gives ~18.8 micrometers? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up exponents. Let me recalculate the decay length:\n\nL = v * \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03c4\n\n\u03b2 is 0.992, c is 3e8 m/s, \u03c4 is 6.334e-14 s.\n\nSo 0.992 * 3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 6.334e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * 1e-6 (since 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6).\n\nWait, 2.976 *6.334. Let me compute this more accurately:\n\n2.976 *6 = 17.856\n\n2.976 *0.334 = ?\n\n2.976 *0.3 = 0.8928\n\n2.976 *0.034 = ~0.1012\n\nTotal for 0.334: 0.8928 +0.1012=0.994\n\nSo total 17.856 +0.994 = 18.85. So 18.85e-6 meters. So 1.885e-5 meters. Which is 18.85 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). So 1.885e-5 m is 18.85 micrometers.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08*1e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m (0.208 meters)\n\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m (2.08 millimeters)\n\nHmm, my calculation gives ~18.85e-6 m, which is 18.85 micrometers, but none of the options are close except maybe option D (2.08 mm is 2080 micrometers, which is way higher), or A (2.08 micrometers is way lower). So I must have messed up something here.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question. The question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". The decay length is the average distance traveled, but the probability of decay is an exponential distribution. The decay length is actually the mean free path, so the average distance. But if you have a detector with resolution \u0394, then to see a decay, the particle must decay within \u0394 distance of the production point? Or maybe the question is about the spatial resolution such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex, so that the decay isn't confused with the production point. In that case, the required resolution should be less than the typical decay length so that the decay can be observed. But perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can see the decay at least 30% of the time. Since the decay is exponential, the fraction of particles that decay within distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(\u03b2c\u03c4\u2080)). Wait, because the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so in the lab frame the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the mean decay length is \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the decay length distribution is exponential with mean L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWait, the probability that a particle decays within a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/L_avg). So we need to set this equal to 0.3, and solve for L? Wait, but the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So maybe they want the distance such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. So set 1 - exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.7 \u2192 -L/L_avg = ln(0.7) \u2192 L = - L_avg * ln(0.7). \n\nWait, but then the required L is L = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, L_avg is \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so L_avg = \u03b2c \u03c4.\n\nWait, so let's recast everything. Let me go back.\n\nThe decay length distribution is exponential with mean L_avg = \u03b2c * \u03c4. Since \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, then L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nBut let me compute L_avg first. From previous steps, L_avg is 18.85e-6 m (18.85 micrometers). \n\nSo if I need 30% of decays to be observed, that means we need the distance L such that the probability of decay within L is 30%. The probability is 1 - exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.7 \u2192 - L/L_avg = ln(0.7) \u2192 L = - L_avg * ln(0.7).\n\nCalculating ln(0.7) \u2248-0.35667. So L = (18.85e-6 m) * 0.35667 \u2248 18.85 *0.35667 \u22486.72e-6 m. Wait, that's 6.72 micrometers. Still not matching the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the spatial resolution but the time resolution? Or perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the gamma again. The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So the total energy is E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27 /3.41 \u22487.917, which is correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the velocity?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Compton wavelength or something else? Wait, no, the question is about the spatial resolution needed to observe the decay. The decay length is the key here. But according to my calculation, the average decay length is ~18.8 micrometers, so to capture 30% of the decays, you need a resolution better than that? Or maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution to resolve the decay, so the resolution must be smaller than the decay length? If the detector's resolution is \u0394, then to see the decay, the decay must occur within \u0394 of the production point. But that would require \u0394 to be larger than the decay length? Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. If the resolution is too low, you can't distinguish between the production point and the decay point. So the spatial resolution must be better (smaller) than the typical decay length so that you can see the decay. But even so, 18 micrometers would be the average. The problem says \"at least 30%\", so perhaps they want the resolution to be such that the decay occurs within the resolution distance. So the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394 is 1 - exp(-\u0394/L_avg) = 0.3. So solving for \u0394 gives \u0394 = - L_avg * ln(1 - 0.3) = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Which gives \u0394 \u2248 L_avg * 0.3567. So that would be 18.85e-6 m *0.3567 \u22486.72e-6 m. But that's 6.7 micrometers, which is 6.7e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the time dilation but not the velocity? Wait, no. The decay length is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So the steps are correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg. Let me recalculate the decay length again step by step.\n\nFirst, gamma = 27 /3.41 \u22487.9179.\n\nLifetime in lab frame \u03c4 = gamma * \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 *8e-16 s = 63.343e-16 s =6.3343e-14 s.\n\nVelocity v: since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nCalculating 1/gamma\u00b2 is 1/(7.9179)^2 \u22481/62.69 \u22480.01595. So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405) is sqrt(0.98405) \u22480.992. So v =0.992c.\n\nThus, decay length L_avg = v * \u03c4 =0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.3343e-14 s.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 *6.3343e-14 first:\n\n3e8 *6.3343e-14 = (3*6.3343)*1e-6 = 19.0029 *1e-6 =1.90029e-5 m/s? Wait, no, wait, the units:\n\nWait, 3e8 m/s *6.3343e-14 s gives (3e8 *6.3343e-14) meters. So yes, 3e8 *6.3343e-14 = 3*6.3343 *1e-6 = 19.0029e-6 meters. Then multiply by 0.992: 19.0029e-6 *0.992 \u224818.85e-6 meters. So that's 18.85e-6 m. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, so my calculation shows that the average decay length is ~18.85 micrometers. To observe 30% of decays, the required distance L where 30% of decays happen within it is L = - L_avg * ln(0.7) \u224818.85e-6 *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m (6.72 micrometers). But none of the options is close to that. The closest is option A at 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), which is about 3 times smaller. Maybe the question is not about the distance but something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". Maybe the resolution refers to the detector's ability to resolve the decay point, so that the decay must occur within the resolution? But if the decay happens over a distance longer than the resolution, you can't see it. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the proper lifetime and not the lab frame? No, because in the rest frame, the lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so the decay length would be c \u03c4\u2080 = 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.4e-7 m = 0.24 micrometers. But then the options include 2.08e-6 m which is 2.08 micrometers, which is an order of magnitude higher. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the time resolution? The lifetime in the lab frame is ~6e-14 s. To observe the decay, the time resolution must be less than that? But the options are spatial resolutions. Hmm. Maybe the question is mixing something up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma. Let me check again. The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =27/(3.41) \u22487.917. That's correct. So that's not the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the energy as the kinetic energy, not the total energy? Oh! Wait a second. That's a crucial point. The problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Wait, but in particle physics, when they say the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy. However, maybe here they are referring to the kinetic energy? Because the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the total energy would be the rest mass plus kinetic. If the energy given is the total energy, then my previous calculation is correct. But if the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. In that case, gamma would be 30.41 /3.41 \u22488.92. That would change the numbers.\n\nWait, the wording says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, the energy of the particle X\u2070 is 27 GeV. So that's probably the total energy. Because the rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the total energy E = gamma m c\u00b2. Therefore, the given energy is total, so the previous calculation holds.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is using the proper lifetime and wants the time resolution? The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s, so the time taken for the particle to decay is that. To resolve the decay, the time resolution must be less than that? But the options are spatial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution required so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex as a separate point from the production point. The decay length is the distance between the two points. To resolve them, the detector's spatial resolution must be better than that distance. However, the problem states \"at least 30% of the decays\", so maybe the resolution must be better than the distance where 30% of decays occur. So the distance where 30% of decays happen within it is L = L_avg * ( - ln(0.7) ), which was ~6.7 micrometers. But the options have 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers). Hmm, that's still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the velocity? Let me check the velocity again. The velocity beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Let's compute that again with gamma=7.917:\n\n1/gamma squared is 1/(7.917)^2 = 1/(62.68) \u22480.01595. So 1-0.01595=0.98405. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98405). Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 0.992 squared is 0.984064. Oh! Wait a minute! sqrt(0.98405) is exactly 0.992, because 0.992 squared is (0.992)^2 = 0.984064. Since 0.98405 is very close to that, so beta is approximately 0.992, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the units in the calculation of L_avg? Let me check again:\n\nL_avg = v * \u03c4 = 0.992c * \u03c4.\n\n\u03c4 is gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = 6.334e-14 s.\n\nSo v is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply 2.976e8 m/s * 6.334e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * 1e-6 m.\n\n2.976 *6.334 = let me compute this precisely:\n\n2 *6.334 =12.668\n\n0.976 *6.334 = ?\n\n0.9 *6.334 =5.7006\n\n0.076 *6.334 \u22480.481\n\nTotal for 0.976*6.334 is 5.7006 +0.481 \u22486.1816\n\nSo total 12.668 +6.1816 \u224818.8496. So 18.8496e-6 meters, which is 18.85 micrometers. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So why the answer options don't have anything near that? Let me look again at the options:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.208 m)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)\n\nWait, 2.08e-3 m is 2.08 millimeters, which is 2080 micrometers. That's way larger than the 18 micrometers I got. Maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters?\n\nWait, the proper lifetime is given as 8e-16 seconds. Let me check that. Yes. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so that's correct. The energy is 27 GeV. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the total energy as the kinetic energy? Let me try that. Suppose the kinetic energy is 27 GeV. Then the total energy E = KE + mc\u00b2 =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. Then gamma would be 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. Let's recalculate with that:\n\ngamma \u22488.92. Then \u03c4 = gamma * tau0 =8.92 *8e-16 \u22487.136e-14 s.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/(8.92)^2). 8.92 squared is approx 79.5664, so 1/79.5664\u22480.01257. 1-0.01257=0.98743. sqrt(0.98743)= ~0.9937.\n\nThus, L_avg = beta*c*tau =0.9937*3e8 *7.136e-14.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n3e8 *7.136e-14 = 2.1408e-5 m/s? Wait, no, units are m/s * s = m.\n\n3e8 m/s *7.136e-14 s = (3 *7.136) *1e-6 =21.408e-6 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9937: 21.408e-6 *0.9937 \u224821.3e-6 m. So ~21.3 micrometers.\n\nStill not matching the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. Let me think differently. Perhaps the resolution needed is the Compton wavelength of the particle? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c). Let me compute that. But that might not be relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the time resolution, but converted into a spatial resolution? Like, if you have a time resolution \u0394t, then the spatial resolution would be c \u0394t. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the uncertainty in the position measurement? Like, to observe the decay, you need the uncertainty in position to be less than the decay length? But that's similar to what I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me check once more:\n\nE =27 GeV. m c\u00b2 =3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917. That's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic momentum? Let me think. The decay length is related to the momentum of the particle. The momentum p is gamma m v. But velocity v is beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. But also, since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nE is 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 is3.41 GeV. So (pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 \u2248729 - 11.628 \u2248717.372. So pc \u2248 sqrt(717.372) \u224826.78 GeV/c. So p \u224826.78 GeV/c.\n\nBut how does this help? Hmm. The momentum might be useful for calculating something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the decay length is sometimes given by L = (beta gamma c) * tau_0. Since tau is gamma tau0, so L = beta c tau. So that's the same as before. So 18.85e-6 m.\n\nHmm. Wait, the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is exactly 1/10th of 20.8e-6 m. Maybe there's a factor of sqrt(1 - beta^2) missing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex from the production point with 30% efficiency. If the detector's resolution is \u0394, then the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394 is 1 - exp(-\u0394/(L_avg)). Setting this to 0.3 gives \u0394= L_avg * ln(1/0.7) \u2248 L_avg *0.3567. So 18.85e-6 *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m. But the closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m. So that's about 3.25 times smaller. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the proper time instead of lab frame time? Let's see. If they consider the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080, then the decay length in the lab frame would be gamma * v * \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but in the rest frame, the decay length is zero. In the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the decay length is v* gamma * \u03c4\u2080. Which is what I calculated. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the problem statement's numbers? Let me check again. The question says:\n\n\"the proper lifetime of X\u2070 is \u03c4\u2080=8\u00d710^-16 s. Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV.\"\n\nYes, so the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, energy 27 GeV. So calculations are correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck here. Since none of my results match the options given, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m\n\nWait, 2.08e-3 m is 2.08 millimeters, which is 2080 micrometers. My calculation gave ~18.8 micrometers. That's two orders of magnitude smaller than option D. Option A is 2.08 micrometers, which is an order of magnitude smaller than my result. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is using the rest frame's decay length? The proper decay length would be c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m =0.24 micrometers. So 0.24 micrometers. Then if they want 30%, then maybe that's 0.24 *0.3=0.072 micrometers? But that's even smaller. Not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the time resolution needed, and then converting that to spatial resolution via the speed of light? For instance, if the time resolution is \u0394t, then the spatial resolution would be c \u0394t. To see the decay, you need to resolve the time of decay within the lifetime. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. So to resolve that, you need a time resolution better than that. So \u0394t =8e-16 s. Then spatial resolution would be c*\u0394t =3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m =0.24e-6 m (0.24 micrometers). But that's still not matching the options. The closest is option A (2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers, which is about 8 times larger than 0.24 micrometers).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the relativistic Doppler effect? Or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Lorentz factor. Let me think differently. The energy E is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So the total energy squared is (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 = E\u00b2. Therefore, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that:\n\nE =27 GeV, so E\u00b2 =729 GeV\u00b2\n\n(mc\u00b2)^2 = (3.41)^2 \u224811.628 GeV\u00b2\n\nThus, (pc)^2 =729 -11.628=717.372. So pc = sqrt(717.372)\u224826.78 GeV/c. So p =26.78 GeV/c.\n\nThen, the Lorentz factor gamma is E/(mc\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917 as before.\n\nAlternatively, the velocity can be found via beta = pc/(E). Since E = gamma mc\u00b2, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) \u2192 beta = sqrt(1 - (mc\u00b2/E)^2). Which is the same as before. So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)= sqrt(1 - (0.126)^2)=sqrt(1-0.015876)=sqrt(0.9841)=0.992, so that's correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the resolution in terms of the distance traveled during the proper lifetime? So c * tau_0 = 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m = 0.24 micrometers. But that's even smaller than option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to see the decay at all, so the average decay length divided by sqrt(30%)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the exponent? Let me check the decay length again:\n\ngamma is 7.917, tau0 is8e-16 s \u2192 tau =7.917 *8e-16=6.334e-14 s.\n\nv is beta c =0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply v * tau: 2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334)=18.85, and 1e8 *1e-14=1e-6 \u2192 18.85e-6 m =1.885e-5 m =18.85 micrometers.\n\nHmm. Since the options are all in the order of 1e-6 or 1e-3, maybe the question is using a different formula, perhaps the decay length is just v * tau0? Without considering gamma? That would be 0.992c *8e-16 s =0.992*3e8 *8e-16 =2.976e8 *8e-16 =2.38e-7 m, which is ~0.24 micrometers (2.38e-7 m is 2.38e-7 m = 0.238 micrometers). So 0.24 micrometers. Then 30% of that? No, but that's not matching the options either. But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers, which is about 10 times larger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the resolution should be the decay length divided by the square root of the probability? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the lifetime in the lab frame and wants the resolution to be the distance traveled in the lifetime divided by some factor. But I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters. Let me recheck:\n\nThe question states that the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. The energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. So my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution in terms of the spatial uncertainty of the particle's position? The uncertainty principle? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula for the lifetime. For example, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So the average decay length is v * gamma * tau\u2080. Which is what I did. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is using the total energy's relation to the mass. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the velocity beta using the relation between kinetic energy and mass. The kinetic energy is E_k = E - m c\u00b2 =27-3.41=23.59 GeV. The kinetic energy is also (gamma -1) m c\u00b2. So gamma =1 + (E_k)/(m c\u00b2)=1 +23.59/3.41\u22481+6.92\u22487.92, which matches the previous gamma. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since my calculation gives ~18.8 micrometers and the closest option is A at 2.08 micrometers, which is about an order of magnitude smaller, perhaps I made an error in the exponent somewhere. Let me recheck the exponents in the decay length calculation:\n\nv is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 6.334e-14 seconds.\n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * (1e8 *1e-14) = (18.85) * (1e-6) \u2192 18.85e-6 meters. So that's correct. So 1.885e-5 m is 18.85e-6 m.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the decay length divided by gamma? Like, maybe I'm overcomplicating with gamma. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the resolution required to see the decay as a separate event, so the resolution must be smaller than the decay length. To capture 30%, the required resolution is the distance where 30% of decays have happened. So as before, that's L = L_avg * ln(1/0.7). Wait, let me re-derive that.\n\nThe probability that a decay occurs before distance L is P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/L_avg). We set P(L) =0.3 \u2192 L = -L_avg * ln(1 -0.3) = -L_avg ln(0.7) \u2248 L_avg *0.3567.\n\nSo L =18.85e-6 m *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m. So ~6.72 micrometers. But that's still not matching the options. The closest option is A at 2.08 micrometers. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a factor of 3 missing? 6.7 divided by 3 is ~2.23, which is close to 2.08. Maybe due to rounding? Let me see:\n\nIf L_avg is 18.85e-6 m, then 0.3567 *18.85 =6.72. If the question wants the value for 50% then it's L_avg * ln(2) \u224818.85e-6 *0.693\u224813.06e-6 m (13 micrometers). Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the distance traveled in the proper lifetime? Then it's c * tau_0= 2.4e-7 m= 0.24 micrometers. So the resolution would need to be smaller than that. But the closest option is A, which is 2.08 micrometers, which is bigger. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the detector's resolution must be smaller than the decay length divided by some factor. Like, maybe they are using the standard deviation of the decay length? The decay length distribution has a standard deviation equal to the mean. So to have 30% within one standard deviation, but that's not the case. The exponential distribution's cumulative at 1 mean is 1 - exp(-1)\u224863%, so to get 30%, it's at 0.51 mean. So 0.51 *18.85e-6\u22489.6e-6 m, which is still not the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the time resolution instead of spatial. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. To see the decay, the time resolution must be better than that. The spatial resolution would then be c * \u0394t. So if \u0394t is 8e-16 s, then c \u0394t= 2.4e-7 m=0.24 micrometers. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the lab frame lifetime and multiplying by velocity to get the decay length, but using a different gamma? Like, if gamma was 3.41/27? No, that would be less than 1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters. Let me check again:\n\nQuestion says: \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Maybe that's the kinetic energy, not total? If so, then total energy is 27+3.41=30.41 GeV. Then gamma is 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. Then:\n\ntau =8.92 *8e-16=7.136e-14 s.\n\nbeta is sqrt(1 -1/8.92\u00b2)= sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.9874)=0.9937.\n\nDecay length L_avg =0.9937 *3e8 *7.136e-14 = 2.98e8 *7.136e-14= (2.98*7.136)*1e-6\u224821.3e-6 m =21.3 micrometers.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the resolution in meters, but I'm getting micrometers, so perhaps I need to convert differently? 18.85e-6 m is 1.885e-5 m. But the options are in 2.08e-6 (which is 0.00208e-3), so perhaps I made an exponent error. Let me check:\n\nWait, 18.85e-6 m is 1.885e-5 m. The options have 2.08e-6 m which is 2.08\u00d710^-6 m. So 1.885e-5 m is about 10 times larger than 2.08e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest frame decay length (proper length) instead of the lab frame. The proper length would be zero, since in the rest frame, the particle doesn't move. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Given that none of my calculations align with the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about the spatial resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex. The decay occurs at a distance L_avg from the production point. To resolve this, the detector's resolution must be less than L_avg. So the minimum resolution needed is the decay length. But then the answer would be ~18.85e-6 m, but the closest option is A at 2.08e-6 m. Maybe there is a factor of 10 somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check the proper lifetime. The question states \u03c4\u2080=8e-16 seconds. But maybe I used \u03c4\u2080 instead of \u03c4 in the decay length? No, I used \u03c4 = gamma \u03c4\u2080.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the time dilation formula but with a different gamma? For instance, gamma is calculated as E/(pc), but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, so total energy is E = KE + mc\u00b2, then gamma is (KE + mc\u00b2)/(mc\u00b2). Which I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the velocity as v = E/(pc) ?\n\nWait, the velocity can also be written as v = (pc)^2 / (E^2). Wait, no. Let me recall that beta = pc/E. Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, and pc = gamma m v c. So pc = gamma m v c. Therefore, beta = v/c = (pc)/(gamma m c\u00b2). Since E = gamma m c\u00b2, so beta = (pc)/E.\n\nSo beta = pc/E. We have pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (mc\u00b2/E)^2 ), which is what I used earlier. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Since I can't see where I'm making a mistake, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's see the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08\u00d710^-6 m\n\nB) 2.08\u00d710^-9 m\n\nC) 2.08\u00d710^-1 m\n\nD) 2.08\u00d710^-3 m\n\nLooking at the numbers, 2.08 is a factor that might come from some calculation involving the given numbers. Let me see: The mass is 3.41 GeV, energy is 27 GeV. The ratio 27/3.41 \u22487.917. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. Maybe the answer is (c * tau_0) * (something). For example, c * tau_0 is 2.4e-7 m, but that's 0.24e-6 m. 2.4e-7 m is 2.4\u00d710^-7 m. If multiplied by 8.7 (from gamma), then 2.4e-7 *8 \u22481.92e-6 m. That's close to option A (2.08e-6). Maybe that's the case?\n\nWait, let me see: If someone mistakenly calculates the decay length as c * tau_0 * gamma, which would be 3e8 *8e-16 * (27/3.41). Let's compute that:\n\n3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7 m. Then multiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917 \u22481.90e-6 m. Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m, close to option A's 2.08e-6 m. So maybe the question assumes that the decay length is c * tau_0 * gamma? But that would be incorrect, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau_0. But if someone incorrectly uses c instead of v, then it would be c * gamma tau_0. Which would give an answer close to option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution to see the decay within the proper lifetime? Which would be c * tau_0 =2.4e-7 m, but then multiplied by gamma? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the mean decay length as (c * tau_0) * gamma, which would be (3e8 *8e-16)* (27/3.41) = (2.4e-7)*7.917\u22481.9e-6 m, which is close to option A. \n\nPerhaps the question assumes that the decay length is simply the proper decay length multiplied by gamma, which is (c * tau_0) * gamma. That would give 2.4e-7 m *7.917 \u22481.9e-6 m. Which is close to 2.08e-6 m. The discrepancy might be due to rounding. Let me compute the exact value:\n\ngamma is 27/3.41 =27 divided by 3.41. Let's compute it precisely:\n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.\n\n3.41\u00d70.917\u22483.41*(0.9 +0.017)=3.069 +0.058\u22483.127. So 3.41 \u00d77.917 \u224827.000. So gamma is exactly 27/3.41\u22487.91789.\n\nSo 2.4e-7 *7.91789 =2.4 *7.91789= 19.0029e-7 =1.90029e-6 m, which is approximately 1.9e-6 m. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher. Maybe due to rounding in the question's numbers or my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the total energy as 27 GeV and the mass as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the momentum is sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). The momentum is sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2)=sqrt(729-11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c. The velocity beta is pc/E = (26.78 GeV/c)*(c)/(27 GeV) =26.78/27\u22480.992, which matches previous calculations. The decay length is v * gamma * tau0. Wait, v is beta c, so decay length is beta c * gamma * tau0. But gamma = E/(mc\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917. So decay length = (0.992)*(3e8)*(7.917)*(8e-16). Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst compute the constants:\n\n0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\n7.917 *8e-16 =6.3336e-15 s.\n\nMultiply those two: 2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s = (2.976 *6.3336)*1e-7 m.\n\n2.976 *6.3336 \u224818.85. So 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m. Wait, wait a second! Wait, 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7. So the units are correct. So 18.85e-7 m is 1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers. That's close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! Here's the mistake I made earlier! Oh my goodness, I think I messed up the exponent in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nThe decay length is v * tau, where tau = gamma * tau0.\n\nv is beta c, so decay length is:\n\nbeta * c * gamma * tau0.\n\nWait, let me compute it again:\n\nbeta is 0.992.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma is 7.917.\n\ntau0 is 8e-16 s.\n\nSo the decay length L is:\n\n0.992 *3e8 *7.917 *8e-16.\n\nLet me compute the numerical factors first:\n\n0.992 *3 = 2.976.\n\n7.917 *8 =63.336.\n\nMultiply those two results: 2.976 *63.336 \u22482.976 *63 = 187.488 plus 2.976 *0.336\u22481.000. Total\u2248188.488.\n\nThen the exponents: 1e8 (from c) *1e-16 (from tau0) \u2192 1e-8.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, the calculation is:\n\nbeta (dimensionless) * c (m/s) * gamma (dimensionless) * tau0 (s).\n\nSo units: m/s * s \u2192 m.\n\nNumerically:\n\n0.992 *3e8 *7.917 *8e-16 = (0.992 *3 *7.917 *8) * (1e8 *1e-16).\n\nCompute the numerical part:\n\n0.992 *3 =2.976.\n\n2.976 *7.917 \u224823.58 (because 3*7.917=23.75, so 2.976 is 0.024 less than 3, so 23.75 - 0.024*7.917 \u224823.75 -0.189\u224823.56).\n\n23.56 *8\u2248188.48.\n\nExponents: 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8.\n\nSo total L=188.48e-8 m = 1.8848e-6 m \u22481.88e-6 meters. Which is approximately 1.88 micrometers. The given option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact. Perhaps there was a rounding difference in the gamma calculation. Let's see:\n\nIf gamma is exactly 27/3.41:\n\n27 divided by 3.41 is exactly 27/3.41 =7.91789. So using this:\n\n0.992 *3e8 * (27/3.41) *8e-16.\n\nLet me compute the numerical factors:\n\n0.992 *3 *27 *8 divided by 3.41.\n\nNumerator:0.992 *3 =2.976; 2.976 *27 =80.352; 80.352 *8=642.816.\n\nDenominator:3.41.\n\nSo total factor:642.816 /3.41 \u2248188.5.\n\nThen the exponent part: 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8.\n\nSo total L =188.5e-8 m =1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. The difference is about 10%. Maybe due to rounding in the problem's numbers. For example, if the proper lifetime was 8.5e-16 s, then the result would be higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation?\n\nWait, beta is pc/E. pc is sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that again:\n\nE =27 GeV. mc\u00b2 =3.41 GeV.\n\npc = sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2)=sqrt(729 -11.628)=sqrt(717.372)=26.78 GeV/c.\n\nBeta = pc/E =26.78 /27 \u22480.992, which is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the question assumes that the decay length is (c * tau_0)*gamma, which would be (3e8 *8e-16)* (27/3.41). Let's compute that:\n\n3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m.\n\nMultiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917=1.899e-6 m \u22481.9e-6 m, which matches the previous result. \n\nSo the correct decay length is ~1.9e-6 m. The closest option is A (2.08e-6 m). Given that the options are likely rounded, option A is the best choice. Probably, the question expects the student to compute the decay length as (c * tau0) multiplied by gamma, which would give this value. My initial mistake was that I thought the decay length was v * tau, but v is already beta c, so it's beta c * gamma tau0 = (beta gamma c) * tau0. But beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma = v/(c) * (1/sqrt(1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ), which is 1/sqrt(1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2) * v/c. Wait, but beta gamma is actually (v/c)*gamma. So beta gamma = v/c * gamma. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the decay length is gamma multiplied by the proper decay length (c*tau0). That would give L= gamma *c*tau0, which is what I just computed, leading to ~1.9e-6 m. So that's likely the expected approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A, 2.08e-6 m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Let me try to figure out what's going on here. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X\u2070 that decays into Y\u207a and Z\u207b. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 of X\u2070 is given as 8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions, so I need to calculate which one is the minimum required to capture 30% of the decays.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are dilated. So the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So I need to find the Lorentz factor here to get the dilated lifetime.\n\nBut wait, how do I get \u03b3? The Lorentz factor is \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2), right? Because the energy E of the particle in the lab frame is related to its rest mass energy. Let me confirm that. The total energy E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Since the mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also in GeV, the c\u00b2 cancels out here. Because mass in GeV/c\u00b2 and energy in GeV, so when you divide E (GeV) by m (GeV/c\u00b2), you get c\u00b2, so \u03b3 would indeed be E/(m c\u00b2) only if the units are handled properly. Wait, actually, maybe I need to check the units more carefully. Let me think again.\n\nThe mass m of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. The energy E given is 27 GeV. So \u03b3 is E divided by (m c\u00b2). Wait, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, so \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). But m c\u00b2 would be (3.41 GeV/c\u00b2) * c\u00b2 = 3.41 GeV. So \u03b3 = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. So that simplifies to 27/3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me approximate: 3.41 \u00d7 7 is about 23.87, and 27 minus that is 3.13, so 7.9 (since 3.41\u00d70.9 is ~3.069). So approximately 7.9? Let me do exact division. 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917. So \u03b3 \u2248 7.917. So the Lorentz factor is roughly 7.92.\n\nTherefore, the lifetime in the lab frame \u03c4 is \u03b3 times \u03c4\u2080. \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 seconds. So \u03c4 \u2248 7.92 \u00d7 8e-16 = let's compute that. 7.92 *8 = 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336 \u00d710^-14 seconds.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So I think this is related to the mean lifetime and the decay length. The particles will travel some distance before decaying, and the detector's resolution must be better than that distance to resolve the decay point. But to get 30% of the decays, maybe we need to consider the decay length multiplied by a certain factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the spatial resolution required so that the detector can distinguish the decay vertex from the production point. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length would be v * \u03c4, where v is the velocity of the particle. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, we can compute v as \u03b2c, where \u03b2 = v/c.\n\nWait, so first, let's compute the velocity \u03b2. Since \u03b3 is known, \u03b2 can be found using the relation between \u03b3 and \u03b2. The relation is \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). So rearranged, \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. Let's plug in \u03b3 \u22487.917. Then 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is about 1/(62.68), so 1/62.68 \u2248 0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 \u2248 0.98404. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.98404). Let me compute that. The square of 0.992 is about 0.984, so sqrt(0.984) \u2248 0.992. So \u03b2 \u22480.992. So the velocity is approximately 0.992c.\n\nTherefore, the decay length L is v * \u03c4 = \u03b2c * \u03c4. Let's plug in the numbers. \u03b2 is ~0.992, c is 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is ~6.336e-14 seconds. So multiplying all together:\n\nL = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-14 s. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst multiply 3e8 and 6.336e-14: 3 *6.336 = 19.008, and 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6. So 19.008e-6. Then multiply by 0.992: 19.008 *0.992 \u224819.008*(1 -0.008) = 19.008 - 0.152\u224818.856. So 18.856e-6 meters. Which is 1.8856e-5 meters, or approximately 1.89e-5 m. Wait, but the options given are 2.08e-6, 2.08e-9, etc. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let's recalculate the decay length more carefully. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). E is 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. So \u03b3 = 27 / 3.41 \u22487.9179. That's correct.\n\nThen \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 *8e-16 s. Let's compute that exactly. 7.9179 *8 = 63.3432, so \u03c4 = 63.3432e-16 s = 6.33432e-14 s.\n\nVelocity \u03b2: sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). So 1/\u03b3\u00b2 is (1/(7.9179)^2). 7.9179 squared is approx 62.69 (since 7.9^2 is 62.41, and 7.92^2 is about 62.7264). So 1/62.69 \u22480.01595. So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.9920. So \u03b2 is ~0.992, so v = 0.992c.\n\nThen decay length L = v * \u03c4 = 0.992 * c * \u03c4.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \u03c4 is 6.33432e-14 s.\n\nSo let's compute:\n\n0.992 * 3e8 = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 6.33432e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.33432e-14 = (2.976 *6.33432) * 1e-6.\n\nCompute 2.976 *6.33432. Let me do 3 *6.33432 = 19.00296. Subtract 0.024 *6.33432 (since 3 -2.976 is 0.024). 0.024 *6.33432 \u22480.152. So 19.00296 -0.152 = 18.85096. So the total is ~18.85 *1e-6 meters, so 1.885e-5 meters. Which is 1.885e-5 m. Hmm, but the options are in the order of 1e-6 or 1e-9, so 1.88e-5 is 18.8e-6, which is 1.88e-5. But the options have 2.08e-6 (option B), which is 2.08 micrometers, but my calculation gives ~18.8 micrometers? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up exponents. Let me recalculate the decay length:\n\nL = v * \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03c4\n\n\u03b2 is 0.992, c is 3e8 m/s, \u03c4 is 6.334e-14 s.\n\nSo 0.992 * 3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 6.334e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * 1e-6 (since 1e8 *1e-14 = 1e-6).\n\nWait, 2.976 *6.334. Let me compute this more accurately:\n\n2.976 *6 = 17.856\n\n2.976 *0.334 = ?\n\n2.976 *0.3 = 0.8928\n\n2.976 *0.034 = ~0.1012\n\nTotal for 0.334: 0.8928 +0.1012=0.994\n\nSo total 17.856 +0.994 = 18.85. So 18.85e-6 meters. So 1.885e-5 meters. Which is 18.85 micrometers (since 1e-6 m is a micrometer). So 1.885e-5 m is 18.85 micrometers.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA) 2.08*1e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08*1e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m (0.208 meters)\n\nD) 2.08*1e-3 m (2.08 millimeters)\n\nHmm, my calculation gives ~18.85e-6 m, which is 18.85 micrometers, but none of the options are close except maybe option D (2.08 mm is 2080 micrometers, which is way higher), or A (2.08 micrometers is way lower). So I must have messed up something here.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question. The question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". The decay length is the average distance traveled, but the probability of decay is an exponential distribution. The decay length is actually the mean free path, so the average distance. But if you have a detector with resolution \u0394, then to see a decay, the particle must decay within \u0394 distance of the production point? Or maybe the question is about the spatial resolution such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex, so that the decay isn't confused with the production point. In that case, the required resolution should be less than the typical decay length so that the decay can be observed. But perhaps the question is referring to the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can see the decay at least 30% of the time. Since the decay is exponential, the fraction of particles that decay within distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(\u03b2c\u03c4\u2080)). Wait, because the proper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so in the lab frame the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so the mean decay length is \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. So the decay length distribution is exponential with mean L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWait, the probability that a particle decays within a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/L_avg). So we need to set this equal to 0.3, and solve for L? Wait, but the question says \"observe at least 30% of the decays\". So maybe they want the distance such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. So set 1 - exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.7 \u2192 -L/L_avg = ln(0.7) \u2192 L = - L_avg * ln(0.7). \n\nWait, but then the required L is L = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, L_avg is \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so L_avg = \u03b2c \u03c4.\n\nWait, so let's recast everything. Let me go back.\n\nThe decay length distribution is exponential with mean L_avg = \u03b2c * \u03c4. Since \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, so L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, then L_avg = \u03b2c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nBut let me compute L_avg first. From previous steps, L_avg is 18.85e-6 m (18.85 micrometers). \n\nSo if I need 30% of decays to be observed, that means we need the distance L such that the probability of decay within L is 30%. The probability is 1 - exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.3 \u2192 exp(-L/L_avg) = 0.7 \u2192 - L/L_avg = ln(0.7) \u2192 L = - L_avg * ln(0.7).\n\nCalculating ln(0.7) \u2248-0.35667. So L = (18.85e-6 m) * 0.35667 \u2248 18.85 *0.35667 \u22486.72e-6 m. Wait, that's 6.72 micrometers. Still not matching the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the spatial resolution but the time resolution? Or perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the gamma again. The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So the total energy is E = gamma m c\u00b2, so gamma is E/(m c\u00b2). Since m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27 /3.41 \u22487.917, which is correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the velocity?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Compton wavelength or something else? Wait, no, the question is about the spatial resolution needed to observe the decay. The decay length is the key here. But according to my calculation, the average decay length is ~18.8 micrometers, so to capture 30% of the decays, you need a resolution better than that? Or maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution to resolve the decay, so the resolution must be smaller than the decay length? If the detector's resolution is \u0394, then to see the decay, the decay must occur within \u0394 of the production point. But that would require \u0394 to be larger than the decay length? Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. If the resolution is too low, you can't distinguish between the production point and the decay point. So the spatial resolution must be better (smaller) than the typical decay length so that you can see the decay. But even so, 18 micrometers would be the average. The problem says \"at least 30%\", so perhaps they want the resolution to be such that the decay occurs within the resolution distance. So the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394 is 1 - exp(-\u0394/L_avg) = 0.3. So solving for \u0394 gives \u0394 = - L_avg * ln(1 - 0.3) = - L_avg * ln(0.7). Which gives \u0394 \u2248 L_avg * 0.3567. So that would be 18.85e-6 m *0.3567 \u22486.72e-6 m. But that's 6.7 micrometers, which is 6.7e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the time dilation but not the velocity? Wait, no. The decay length is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So the steps are correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg. Let me recalculate the decay length again step by step.\n\nFirst, gamma = 27 /3.41 \u22487.9179.\n\nLifetime in lab frame \u03c4 = gamma * \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 *8e-16 s = 63.343e-16 s =6.3343e-14 s.\n\nVelocity v: since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2).\n\nCalculating 1/gamma\u00b2 is 1/(7.9179)^2 \u22481/62.69 \u22480.01595. So 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405) is sqrt(0.98405) \u22480.992. So v =0.992c.\n\nThus, decay length L_avg = v * \u03c4 =0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.3343e-14 s.\n\nLet me compute 3e8 *6.3343e-14 first:\n\n3e8 *6.3343e-14 = (3*6.3343)*1e-6 = 19.0029 *1e-6 =1.90029e-5 m/s? Wait, no, wait, the units:\n\nWait, 3e8 m/s *6.3343e-14 s gives (3e8 *6.3343e-14) meters. So yes, 3e8 *6.3343e-14 = 3*6.3343 *1e-6 = 19.0029e-6 meters. Then multiply by 0.992: 19.0029e-6 *0.992 \u224818.85e-6 meters. So that's 18.85e-6 m. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, so my calculation shows that the average decay length is ~18.85 micrometers. To observe 30% of decays, the required distance L where 30% of decays happen within it is L = - L_avg * ln(0.7) \u224818.85e-6 *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m (6.72 micrometers). But none of the options is close to that. The closest is option A at 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), which is about 3 times smaller. Maybe the question is not about the distance but something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". Maybe the resolution refers to the detector's ability to resolve the decay point, so that the decay must occur within the resolution? But if the decay happens over a distance longer than the resolution, you can't see it. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the proper lifetime and not the lab frame? No, because in the rest frame, the lifetime is \u03c4\u2080, so the decay length would be c \u03c4\u2080 = 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.4e-7 m = 0.24 micrometers. But then the options include 2.08e-6 m which is 2.08 micrometers, which is an order of magnitude higher. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the time resolution? The lifetime in the lab frame is ~6e-14 s. To observe the decay, the time resolution must be less than that? But the options are spatial resolutions. Hmm. Maybe the question is mixing something up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma. Let me check again. The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) =27/(3.41) \u22487.917. That's correct. So that's not the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the energy as the kinetic energy, not the total energy? Oh! Wait a second. That's a crucial point. The problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Wait, but in particle physics, when they say the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy. However, maybe here they are referring to the kinetic energy? Because the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the total energy would be the rest mass plus kinetic. If the energy given is the total energy, then my previous calculation is correct. But if the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. In that case, gamma would be 30.41 /3.41 \u22488.92. That would change the numbers.\n\nWait, the wording says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, the energy of the particle X\u2070 is 27 GeV. So that's probably the total energy. Because the rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the total energy E = gamma m c\u00b2. Therefore, the given energy is total, so the previous calculation holds.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is using the proper lifetime and wants the time resolution? The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s, so the time taken for the particle to decay is that. To resolve the decay, the time resolution must be less than that? But the options are spatial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution required so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex as a separate point from the production point. The decay length is the distance between the two points. To resolve them, the detector's spatial resolution must be better than that distance. However, the problem states \"at least 30% of the decays\", so maybe the resolution must be better than the distance where 30% of decays occur. So the distance where 30% of decays happen within it is L = L_avg * ( - ln(0.7) ), which was ~6.7 micrometers. But the options have 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers). Hmm, that's still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the velocity? Let me check the velocity again. The velocity beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Let's compute that again with gamma=7.917:\n\n1/gamma squared is 1/(7.917)^2 = 1/(62.68) \u22480.01595. So 1-0.01595=0.98405. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98405). Let me compute that more accurately. Let's see, 0.992 squared is 0.984064. Oh! Wait a minute! sqrt(0.98405) is exactly 0.992, because 0.992 squared is (0.992)^2 = 0.984064. Since 0.98405 is very close to that, so beta is approximately 0.992, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the units in the calculation of L_avg? Let me check again:\n\nL_avg = v * \u03c4 = 0.992c * \u03c4.\n\n\u03c4 is gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = 6.334e-14 s.\n\nSo v is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply 2.976e8 m/s * 6.334e-14 s:\n\n2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * 1e-6 m.\n\n2.976 *6.334 = let me compute this precisely:\n\n2 *6.334 =12.668\n\n0.976 *6.334 = ?\n\n0.9 *6.334 =5.7006\n\n0.076 *6.334 \u22480.481\n\nTotal for 0.976*6.334 is 5.7006 +0.481 \u22486.1816\n\nSo total 12.668 +6.1816 \u224818.8496. So 18.8496e-6 meters, which is 18.85 micrometers. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So why the answer options don't have anything near that? Let me look again at the options:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m (0.208 m)\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)\n\nWait, 2.08e-3 m is 2.08 millimeters, which is 2080 micrometers. That's way larger than the 18 micrometers I got. Maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters?\n\nWait, the proper lifetime is given as 8e-16 seconds. Let me check that. Yes. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so that's correct. The energy is 27 GeV. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the total energy as the kinetic energy? Let me try that. Suppose the kinetic energy is 27 GeV. Then the total energy E = KE + mc\u00b2 =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV. Then gamma would be 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. Let's recalculate with that:\n\ngamma \u22488.92. Then \u03c4 = gamma * tau0 =8.92 *8e-16 \u22487.136e-14 s.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/(8.92)^2). 8.92 squared is approx 79.5664, so 1/79.5664\u22480.01257. 1-0.01257=0.98743. sqrt(0.98743)= ~0.9937.\n\nThus, L_avg = beta*c*tau =0.9937*3e8 *7.136e-14.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n3e8 *7.136e-14 = 2.1408e-5 m/s? Wait, no, units are m/s * s = m.\n\n3e8 m/s *7.136e-14 s = (3 *7.136) *1e-6 =21.408e-6 m.\n\nMultiply by 0.9937: 21.408e-6 *0.9937 \u224821.3e-6 m. So ~21.3 micrometers.\n\nStill not matching the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. Let me think differently. Perhaps the resolution needed is the Compton wavelength of the particle? The Compton wavelength is h/(m c). Let me compute that. But that might not be relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the time resolution, but converted into a spatial resolution? Like, if you have a time resolution \u0394t, then the spatial resolution would be c \u0394t. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the uncertainty in the position measurement? Like, to observe the decay, you need the uncertainty in position to be less than the decay length? But that's similar to what I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the gamma calculation. Let me check once more:\n\nE =27 GeV. m c\u00b2 =3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917. That's correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic momentum? Let me think. The decay length is related to the momentum of the particle. The momentum p is gamma m v. But velocity v is beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. But also, since E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, so pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (m c\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nE is 27 GeV, m c\u00b2 is3.41 GeV. So (pc)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 \u2248729 - 11.628 \u2248717.372. So pc \u2248 sqrt(717.372) \u224826.78 GeV/c. So p \u224826.78 GeV/c.\n\nBut how does this help? Hmm. The momentum might be useful for calculating something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the decay length is sometimes given by L = (beta gamma c) * tau_0. Since tau is gamma tau0, so L = beta c tau. So that's the same as before. So 18.85e-6 m.\n\nHmm. Wait, the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is exactly 1/10th of 20.8e-6 m. Maybe there's a factor of sqrt(1 - beta^2) missing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the spatial resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex from the production point with 30% efficiency. If the detector's resolution is \u0394, then the probability that the decay occurs within \u0394 is 1 - exp(-\u0394/(L_avg)). Setting this to 0.3 gives \u0394= L_avg * ln(1/0.7) \u2248 L_avg *0.3567. So 18.85e-6 *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m. But the closest option is A: 2.08e-6 m. So that's about 3.25 times smaller. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the proper time instead of lab frame time? Let's see. If they consider the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080, then the decay length in the lab frame would be gamma * v * \u03c4\u2080. Wait, but in the rest frame, the decay length is zero. In the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the decay length is v* gamma * \u03c4\u2080. Which is what I calculated. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the problem statement's numbers? Let me check again. The question says:\n\n\"the proper lifetime of X\u2070 is \u03c4\u2080=8\u00d710^-16 s. Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV.\"\n\nYes, so the mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, energy 27 GeV. So calculations are correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck here. Since none of my results match the options given, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08e-6 m\n\nB) 2.08e-9 m\n\nC) 2.08e-1 m\n\nD) 2.08e-3 m\n\nWait, 2.08e-3 m is 2.08 millimeters, which is 2080 micrometers. My calculation gave ~18.8 micrometers. That's two orders of magnitude smaller than option D. Option A is 2.08 micrometers, which is an order of magnitude smaller than my result. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is using the rest frame's decay length? The proper decay length would be c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m =0.24 micrometers. So 0.24 micrometers. Then if they want 30%, then maybe that's 0.24 *0.3=0.072 micrometers? But that's even smaller. Not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the time resolution needed, and then converting that to spatial resolution via the speed of light? For instance, if the time resolution is \u0394t, then the spatial resolution would be c \u0394t. To see the decay, you need to resolve the time of decay within the lifetime. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. So to resolve that, you need a time resolution better than that. So \u0394t =8e-16 s. Then spatial resolution would be c*\u0394t =3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m =0.24e-6 m (0.24 micrometers). But that's still not matching the options. The closest is option A (2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers, which is about 8 times larger than 0.24 micrometers).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the relativistic Doppler effect? Or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Lorentz factor. Let me think differently. The energy E is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. So the total energy squared is (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 = E\u00b2. Therefore, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that:\n\nE =27 GeV, so E\u00b2 =729 GeV\u00b2\n\n(mc\u00b2)^2 = (3.41)^2 \u224811.628 GeV\u00b2\n\nThus, (pc)^2 =729 -11.628=717.372. So pc = sqrt(717.372)\u224826.78 GeV/c. So p =26.78 GeV/c.\n\nThen, the Lorentz factor gamma is E/(mc\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917 as before.\n\nAlternatively, the velocity can be found via beta = pc/(E). Since E = gamma mc\u00b2, pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) \u2192 beta = sqrt(1 - (mc\u00b2/E)^2). Which is the same as before. So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)= sqrt(1 - (0.126)^2)=sqrt(1-0.015876)=sqrt(0.9841)=0.992, so that's correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the resolution in terms of the distance traveled during the proper lifetime? So c * tau_0 = 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m = 0.24 micrometers. But that's even smaller than option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to see the decay at all, so the average decay length divided by sqrt(30%)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the exponent? Let me check the decay length again:\n\ngamma is 7.917, tau0 is8e-16 s \u2192 tau =7.917 *8e-16=6.334e-14 s.\n\nv is beta c =0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply v * tau: 2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334)=18.85, and 1e8 *1e-14=1e-6 \u2192 18.85e-6 m =1.885e-5 m =18.85 micrometers.\n\nHmm. Since the options are all in the order of 1e-6 or 1e-3, maybe the question is using a different formula, perhaps the decay length is just v * tau0? Without considering gamma? That would be 0.992c *8e-16 s =0.992*3e8 *8e-16 =2.976e8 *8e-16 =2.38e-7 m, which is ~0.24 micrometers (2.38e-7 m is 2.38e-7 m = 0.238 micrometers). So 0.24 micrometers. Then 30% of that? No, but that's not matching the options either. But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers, which is about 10 times larger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the resolution should be the decay length divided by the square root of the probability? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the lifetime in the lab frame and wants the resolution to be the distance traveled in the lifetime divided by some factor. But I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters. Let me recheck:\n\nThe question states that the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. The energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV. So my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the resolution in terms of the spatial uncertainty of the particle's position? The uncertainty principle? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula for the lifetime. For example, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So the average decay length is v * gamma * tau\u2080. Which is what I did. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is using the total energy's relation to the mass. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the velocity beta using the relation between kinetic energy and mass. The kinetic energy is E_k = E - m c\u00b2 =27-3.41=23.59 GeV. The kinetic energy is also (gamma -1) m c\u00b2. So gamma =1 + (E_k)/(m c\u00b2)=1 +23.59/3.41\u22481+6.92\u22487.92, which matches the previous gamma. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since my calculation gives ~18.8 micrometers and the closest option is A at 2.08 micrometers, which is about an order of magnitude smaller, perhaps I made an error in the exponent somewhere. Let me recheck the exponents in the decay length calculation:\n\nv is 0.992 *3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\ntau is 6.334e-14 seconds.\n\nMultiply them: 2.976e8 *6.334e-14 = (2.976 *6.334) * (1e8 *1e-14) = (18.85) * (1e-6) \u2192 18.85e-6 meters. So that's correct. So 1.885e-5 m is 18.85e-6 m.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using the decay length divided by gamma? Like, maybe I'm overcomplicating with gamma. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the resolution required to see the decay as a separate event, so the resolution must be smaller than the decay length. To capture 30%, the required resolution is the distance where 30% of decays have happened. So as before, that's L = L_avg * ln(1/0.7). Wait, let me re-derive that.\n\nThe probability that a decay occurs before distance L is P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/L_avg). We set P(L) =0.3 \u2192 L = -L_avg * ln(1 -0.3) = -L_avg ln(0.7) \u2248 L_avg *0.3567.\n\nSo L =18.85e-6 m *0.3567\u22486.72e-6 m. So ~6.72 micrometers. But that's still not matching the options. The closest option is A at 2.08 micrometers. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a factor of 3 missing? 6.7 divided by 3 is ~2.23, which is close to 2.08. Maybe due to rounding? Let me see:\n\nIf L_avg is 18.85e-6 m, then 0.3567 *18.85 =6.72. If the question wants the value for 50% then it's L_avg * ln(2) \u224818.85e-6 *0.693\u224813.06e-6 m (13 micrometers). Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the distance traveled in the proper lifetime? Then it's c * tau_0= 2.4e-7 m= 0.24 micrometers. So the resolution would need to be smaller than that. But the closest option is A, which is 2.08 micrometers, which is bigger. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the detector's resolution must be smaller than the decay length divided by some factor. Like, maybe they are using the standard deviation of the decay length? The decay length distribution has a standard deviation equal to the mean. So to have 30% within one standard deviation, but that's not the case. The exponential distribution's cumulative at 1 mean is 1 - exp(-1)\u224863%, so to get 30%, it's at 0.51 mean. So 0.51 *18.85e-6\u22489.6e-6 m, which is still not the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the time resolution instead of spatial. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. To see the decay, the time resolution must be better than that. The spatial resolution would then be c * \u0394t. So if \u0394t is 8e-16 s, then c \u0394t= 2.4e-7 m=0.24 micrometers. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the lab frame lifetime and multiplying by velocity to get the decay length, but using a different gamma? Like, if gamma was 3.41/27? No, that would be less than 1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters. Let me check again:\n\nQuestion says: \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Maybe that's the kinetic energy, not total? If so, then total energy is 27+3.41=30.41 GeV. Then gamma is 30.41/3.41\u22488.92. Then:\n\ntau =8.92 *8e-16=7.136e-14 s.\n\nbeta is sqrt(1 -1/8.92\u00b2)= sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.9874)=0.9937.\n\nDecay length L_avg =0.9937 *3e8 *7.136e-14 = 2.98e8 *7.136e-14= (2.98*7.136)*1e-6\u224821.3e-6 m =21.3 micrometers.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the resolution in meters, but I'm getting micrometers, so perhaps I need to convert differently? 18.85e-6 m is 1.885e-5 m. But the options are in 2.08e-6 (which is 0.00208e-3), so perhaps I made an exponent error. Let me check:\n\nWait, 18.85e-6 m is 1.885e-5 m. The options have 2.08e-6 m which is 2.08\u00d710^-6 m. So 1.885e-5 m is about 10 times larger than 2.08e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest frame decay length (proper length) instead of the lab frame. The proper length would be zero, since in the rest frame, the particle doesn't move. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Given that none of my calculations align with the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about the spatial resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay vertex. The decay occurs at a distance L_avg from the production point. To resolve this, the detector's resolution must be less than L_avg. So the minimum resolution needed is the decay length. But then the answer would be ~18.85e-6 m, but the closest option is A at 2.08e-6 m. Maybe there is a factor of 10 somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check the proper lifetime. The question states \u03c4\u2080=8e-16 seconds. But maybe I used \u03c4\u2080 instead of \u03c4 in the decay length? No, I used \u03c4 = gamma \u03c4\u2080.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the time dilation formula but with a different gamma? For instance, gamma is calculated as E/(pc), but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, so total energy is E = KE + mc\u00b2, then gamma is (KE + mc\u00b2)/(mc\u00b2). Which I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the velocity as v = E/(pc) ?\n\nWait, the velocity can also be written as v = (pc)^2 / (E^2). Wait, no. Let me recall that beta = pc/E. Because E = gamma m c\u00b2, and pc = gamma m v c. So pc = gamma m v c. Therefore, beta = v/c = (pc)/(gamma m c\u00b2). Since E = gamma m c\u00b2, so beta = (pc)/E.\n\nSo beta = pc/E. We have pc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (mc\u00b2/E)^2 ), which is what I used earlier. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Since I can't see where I'm making a mistake, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's see the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 2.08\u00d710^-6 m\n\nB) 2.08\u00d710^-9 m\n\nC) 2.08\u00d710^-1 m\n\nD) 2.08\u00d710^-3 m\n\nLooking at the numbers, 2.08 is a factor that might come from some calculation involving the given numbers. Let me see: The mass is 3.41 GeV, energy is 27 GeV. The ratio 27/3.41 \u22487.917. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. Maybe the answer is (c * tau_0) * (something). For example, c * tau_0 is 2.4e-7 m, but that's 0.24e-6 m. 2.4e-7 m is 2.4\u00d710^-7 m. If multiplied by 8.7 (from gamma), then 2.4e-7 *8 \u22481.92e-6 m. That's close to option A (2.08e-6). Maybe that's the case?\n\nWait, let me see: If someone mistakenly calculates the decay length as c * tau_0 * gamma, which would be 3e8 *8e-16 * (27/3.41). Let's compute that:\n\n3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7 m. Then multiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917 \u22481.90e-6 m. Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m, close to option A's 2.08e-6 m. So maybe the question assumes that the decay length is c * tau_0 * gamma? But that would be incorrect, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0, so the decay length is v * gamma tau_0. But if someone incorrectly uses c instead of v, then it would be c * gamma tau_0. Which would give an answer close to option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution to see the decay within the proper lifetime? Which would be c * tau_0 =2.4e-7 m, but then multiplied by gamma? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the mean decay length as (c * tau_0) * gamma, which would be (3e8 *8e-16)* (27/3.41) = (2.4e-7)*7.917\u22481.9e-6 m, which is close to option A. \n\nPerhaps the question assumes that the decay length is simply the proper decay length multiplied by gamma, which is (c * tau_0) * gamma. That would give 2.4e-7 m *7.917 \u22481.9e-6 m. Which is close to 2.08e-6 m. The discrepancy might be due to rounding. Let me compute the exact value:\n\ngamma is 27/3.41 =27 divided by 3.41. Let's compute it precisely:\n\n3.41 \u00d77 =23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.\n\n3.41\u00d70.917\u22483.41*(0.9 +0.017)=3.069 +0.058\u22483.127. So 3.41 \u00d77.917 \u224827.000. So gamma is exactly 27/3.41\u22487.91789.\n\nSo 2.4e-7 *7.91789 =2.4 *7.91789= 19.0029e-7 =1.90029e-6 m, which is approximately 1.9e-6 m. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher. Maybe due to rounding in the question's numbers or my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses the total energy as 27 GeV and the mass as 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the momentum is sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). The momentum is sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2)=sqrt(729-11.628)=sqrt(717.37)=26.78 GeV/c. The velocity beta is pc/E = (26.78 GeV/c)*(c)/(27 GeV) =26.78/27\u22480.992, which matches previous calculations. The decay length is v * gamma * tau0. Wait, v is beta c, so decay length is beta c * gamma * tau0. But gamma = E/(mc\u00b2)=27/3.41\u22487.917. So decay length = (0.992)*(3e8)*(7.917)*(8e-16). Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst compute the constants:\n\n0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.\n\n7.917 *8e-16 =6.3336e-15 s.\n\nMultiply those two: 2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s = (2.976 *6.3336)*1e-7 m.\n\n2.976 *6.3336 \u224818.85. So 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m. Wait, wait a second! Wait, 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7. So the units are correct. So 18.85e-7 m is 1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers. That's close to option A (2.08e-6 m). \n\nAh! Here's the mistake I made earlier! Oh my goodness, I think I messed up the exponent in the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nThe decay length is v * tau, where tau = gamma * tau0.\n\nv is beta c, so decay length is:\n\nbeta * c * gamma * tau0.\n\nWait, let me compute it again:\n\nbeta is 0.992.\n\nc is 3e8 m/s.\n\ngamma is 7.917.\n\ntau0 is 8e-16 s.\n\nSo the decay length L is:\n\n0.992 *3e8 *7.917 *8e-16.\n\nLet me compute the numerical factors first:\n\n0.992 *3 = 2.976.\n\n7.917 *8 =63.336.\n\nMultiply those two results: 2.976 *63.336 \u22482.976 *63 = 187.488 plus 2.976 *0.336\u22481.000. Total\u2248188.488.\n\nThen the exponents: 1e8 (from c) *1e-16 (from tau0) \u2192 1e-8.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, the calculation is:\n\nbeta (dimensionless) * c (m/s) * gamma (dimensionless) * tau0 (s).\n\nSo units: m/s * s \u2192 m.\n\nNumerically:\n\n0.992 *3e8 *7.917 *8e-16 = (0.992 *3 *7.917 *8) * (1e8 *1e-16).\n\nCompute the numerical part:\n\n0.992 *3 =2.976.\n\n2.976 *7.917 \u224823.58 (because 3*7.917=23.75, so 2.976 is 0.024 less than 3, so 23.75 - 0.024*7.917 \u224823.75 -0.189\u224823.56).\n\n23.56 *8\u2248188.48.\n\nExponents: 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8.\n\nSo total L=188.48e-8 m = 1.8848e-6 m \u22481.88e-6 meters. Which is approximately 1.88 micrometers. The given option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact. Perhaps there was a rounding difference in the gamma calculation. Let's see:\n\nIf gamma is exactly 27/3.41:\n\n27 divided by 3.41 is exactly 27/3.41 =7.91789. So using this:\n\n0.992 *3e8 * (27/3.41) *8e-16.\n\nLet me compute the numerical factors:\n\n0.992 *3 *27 *8 divided by 3.41.\n\nNumerator:0.992 *3 =2.976; 2.976 *27 =80.352; 80.352 *8=642.816.\n\nDenominator:3.41.\n\nSo total factor:642.816 /3.41 \u2248188.5.\n\nThen the exponent part: 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8.\n\nSo total L =188.5e-8 m =1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. The difference is about 10%. Maybe due to rounding in the problem's numbers. For example, if the proper lifetime was 8.5e-16 s, then the result would be higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation?\n\nWait, beta is pc/E. pc is sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2). Let me compute that again:\n\nE =27 GeV. mc\u00b2 =3.41 GeV.\n\npc = sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2)=sqrt(729 -11.628)=sqrt(717.372)=26.78 GeV/c.\n\nBeta = pc/E =26.78 /27 \u22480.992, which is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the question assumes that the decay length is (c * tau_0)*gamma, which would be (3e8 *8e-16)* (27/3.41). Let's compute that:\n\n3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m.\n\nMultiply by 7.917: 2.4e-7 *7.917=1.899e-6 m \u22481.9e-6 m, which matches the previous result. \n\nSo the correct decay length is ~1.9e-6 m. The closest option is A (2.08e-6 m). Given that the options are likely rounded, option A is the best choice. Probably, the question expects the student to compute the decay length as (c * tau0) multiplied by gamma, which would give this value. My initial mistake was that I thought the decay length was v * tau, but v is already beta c, so it's beta c * gamma tau0 = (beta gamma c) * tau0. But beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma = v/(c) * (1/sqrt(1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) ), which is 1/sqrt(1 -v\u00b2/c\u00b2) * v/c. Wait, but beta gamma is actually (v/c)*gamma. So beta gamma = v/c * gamma. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the decay length is gamma multiplied by the proper decay length (c*tau0). That would give L= gamma *c*tau0, which is what I just computed, leading to ~1.9e-6 m. So that's likely the expected approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A, 2.08e-6 m.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of \\( X^0 \\), we start by calculating the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\). The energy \\( E \\) of \\( X^0 \\) is 27 GeV, and its mass \\( m \\) is 3.41 GeV/\\( c^2 \\).
