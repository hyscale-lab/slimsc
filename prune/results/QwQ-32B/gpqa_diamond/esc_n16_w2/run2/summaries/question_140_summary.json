      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, first, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The question gives several clues. Let's break down each part of the problem.\n\nThe first part says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So maybe it's a compound that has an isotope like deuterium (D, which is hydrogen-2) instead of regular hydrogen? Or maybe another element's isotope?\n\nNext, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. The molecule must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally, so that's out. Maybe H2? Wait, but H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No. Maybe something like He? Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4), so that's 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule would be He? But He is a noble gas, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe H2O? No, that's a molecule with more atoms. Wait, the gas W's molecule must have the same number of neutrons and protons in total. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons must be equal. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal.\n\nIf it's He, which is a monoatomic gas. Each He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So total protons (2) and neutrons (2). So that works. So gas W could be helium. But how does that fit into the reaction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's see another possibility. Let's think of a molecule. For example, hydrogen gas (H2) doesn't work. What about neon? But that's also monoatomic. Maybe a diatomic molecule like nitrogen (N2)? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's N-14). So total protons 14, neutrons 14. That would work. So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's possible. So the gas could be nitrogen gas. But how does that come from the reaction?\n\nWait, the problem also mentions a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's close to the freezing point of water, but maybe it's a solid at room temperature? Wait, 273 K is freezing point, so 277 is slightly above, but maybe the substance B melts just above that. Hmm, perhaps B is something like sodium chloride? But NaCl's melting point is around 801 K. No. Maybe a lower melting point. Wait, maybe B is ice? But that's H2O, but ice's melting point is 273.15 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe it's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance. Let's think of other substances. For example, maybe ammonium chloride? Its melting point is 338 K. Not close. Hmm. Maybe the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So B is a product of heating G. Let me think of reactions where heating a precipitate releases a substance with a low melting point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like calcium carbonate, which when heated decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The B here might be CO2, but then the melting point of CO2 is around 217 K (dry ice). Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the B is water? But that's a liquid, but when heated, it would be released as vapor. Wait, maybe the precipitate is something like Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. But the melting point of H2O is 273 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe that's close enough? The problem states \"the melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" So perhaps B is water, and the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2. But I need to see how this ties into the other parts.\n\nNow, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Let's think of possible reactions. The substance X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Hmm, common reagents in organic chemistry include things like Grignard reagents (RMgX), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), or maybe sodium hydride (NaH). Wait, Grignard reagents are often used, and their analogs like organolithium compounds. Let's see. \n\nSuppose X is a Grignard reagent, like RMgBr. If it reacts with water (liquid Y?), then the reaction would produce Mg(OH)2 as a precipitate and release H2? Wait, no, Grignard reagents reacting with water would produce the alcohol, Mg(OH)2, and maybe H2? Wait, actually, the reaction of RMgX with water would give R-OH, Mg(OH)X, but maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2? Let me check: RMgX + 2H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)2\u2193 + HX. So the gas here would be HX? But HX would depend on the halide. If X is, say, bromine, then HBr gas. But HBr's molecules: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons, Br has 35 protons and 45 neutrons (since Br-79 is common, which is 35 protons and 44 neutrons?), wait, Br has atomic number 35. The isotope Br-79 has 35 protons and 44 neutrons (since 79-35=44). So HBr's molecule would have total protons: 1 +35=36, neutrons:0+44=44. Not equal. So that doesn't fit the condition of gas W's molecule having equal protons and neutrons.\n\nHmm, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal hydride and water? Like sodium hydride (NaH) reacting with water. The reaction would be NaH + H2O \u2192 NaOH + H2. The gas here is H2. The molecule H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal like sodium and water? 2Na + 2H2O \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191. Again, H2 is the gas. Not matching the neutron/proton condition.\n\nWait, let's think of another possibility. The gas W must have equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Let me list possible molecules:\n\n- He: monoatomic, 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4). So total protons 2, neutrons 2. So that's equal. So He gas.\n\n- N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N-14, which is common). So total protons 14, neutrons 14. That works. So N2 would satisfy the condition.\n\n- O2: 8 protons each, so total 16. Neutrons would be (oxygen-16 has 8 neutrons each, so total 16 neutrons). So O2 would also have equal protons and neutrons. Wait O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That also works. So gas W could be O2 or N2 or He.\n\nHmm. Let's see which makes sense in the reaction. Let's think of reactions that produce such gases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid? For example, Mg and HCl produces H2. But again, H2 doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a sodium amide (NaNH2) and water? NaNH2 + 2H2O \u2192 NaOH + NH3 + H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces ammonia (NH3). But NH3 has protons: 7 (N) +3 (H) =10. Neutrons would be (7 for N from 14 N: 14-7=7 neutrons, plus 0 for H) total 7. So total protons 10, neutrons 7. Not equal.\n\nHmm. Let me consider another angle. The problem mentions that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid has a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). For example, acetone is a ketone but not an acid. A keto acid like acetoacetic acid has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group and the ketone. Wait, acetoacetic acid has the structure CH3COCH2COOH. The product with X (maybe a Grignard reagent) would form a tetrahedral intermediate, then maybe a carboxylic acid? Let me think. If the keto acid reacts with Grignard reagent, the product might be an alcohol or something else. Wait, when a Grignard reagent reacts with a carbonyl compound (like a keto group), it would form a tertiary alcohol. But if the carbonyl is part of a keto acid, perhaps the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. The question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms: two in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). If reacting with Grignard reagent, the product would be a tertiary alcohol, which would have no oxygen atoms except maybe from the carboxylic group? Wait, maybe the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, leading to an alcohol, and then the carboxylic group remains? Hmm, perhaps the product would have two oxygen atoms. For example, the reaction of a Grignard with a keto acid might form an alcohol (one OH group) and the carboxylic acid group (another O). So two oxygen atoms total. That could fit. So that suggests that X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX). \n\nSo if X is a Grignard reagent, then its formula is RMgX, where R is an organic group and X is a halogen. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The Grignard reagent has Mg, R (which is carbon, hydrogen, maybe others), and a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). The heavier isotope would be in one of these. Since magnesium is a metal, maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79? Or perhaps the carbon in R is a heavier isotope, but the question says \"a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Wait, the elements present in Grignard reagent are Mg, C (in R), H (in R?), and the halogen. The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D) in the R group. Wait, Grignard reagents can sometimes have deuterium, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps the halogen is a heavier isotope, like iodine instead of bromine? But that's not an isotope, but a different element. Hmm, isotopes are same element but different neutrons. So the halogen could be, say, Br-81 instead of Br-79. But the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so the element is part of the substance, and it's using a heavier isotope. So, for example, if the halogen is Br, then using a heavier isotope like Br-81 instead of the more common Br-79. But how would that affect the calculation? The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering all isotopes. Wait, no, the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me read that again.\n\n\"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest element (the lightest element in X) and the heaviest element in X. But if there are multiple atoms of the same element, do we sum their masses? For example, if X is RMgBr, then the elements are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. So sum their atomic masses. But the problem says \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" So maybe if there are multiple isotopes present, we have to sum their masses? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". So the lightest element in X (like H) and the heaviest element in X (like Br), so their atomic masses added together. But the question mentions isotopes. The substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is a heavier isotope, then when calculating the atomic mass of Br, we need to take the isotope's mass. But the problem says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Hmm, maybe I need to consider all instances of each element in the compound. For example, if X is RMgBr, the elements are Mg, Br, and the R group (which is made of C, H, maybe others). The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. So sum H's atomic mass and Br's atomic mass. But if Br is using a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79, then the Br's mass would be 81 instead of 79? But the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so maybe the substance uses a specific isotope, so we have to take that isotope's mass. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the sum of the lightest element's atomic mass (regardless of isotopes) plus the heaviest's, but considering the isotopes given in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about isotopic masses but the elements' standard atomic weights. Let me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, identify Substance X. The clues:\n\n- Reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons) and precipitate G. Heating G releases B (melting point ~277 K).\n\n- The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also used (so maybe Grignard and organolithium?).\n\nAssuming X is a Grignard reagent (RMgX), let's see:\n\nReaction with water (Y is H2O?) gives Mg(OH)2 precipitate and HX gas. But HX's molecule would have protons (H + X). Let's say X is Br. Then HBr has protons 1+35=36, neutrons 0 + (Br-79 has 44 neutrons). So 44. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the gas isn't HBr. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think of another reaction.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction of Grignard reagent with something else. Wait, the problem says \"reacts violently with liquid Y\". Maybe Y isn't water but another liquid. Let me think of other possibilities. For example, if Y is carbon dioxide, but that's a gas. Maybe sulfuric acid? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH). Reaction with water produces NaOH, H2 gas. But H2 doesn't satisfy the gas condition. Alternatively, sodium hydride with something else?\n\nWait, another possibility: the gas W could be ammonia (NH3). Let's see: protons: 7 (N) +3 (H) =10. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14, which has 7 neutrons) plus 0 for H. Total neutrons 7. Not equal. So no.\n\nHmm, maybe the gas is nitrogen gas (N2). To get N2, maybe the reaction involves a nitride? For example, sodium azide (NaN3) reacts with something? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a nitrate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be oxygen (O2). O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (if O-16). So that works. So if the reaction produces O2, that would fit. Let's think of a reaction that releases O2. Maybe a peroxide reacting? For example, sodium peroxide with water? 2Na2O2 + 2H2O \u2192 4NaOH + O2\u2191. The gas here is O2. The precipitate G might not form here. Alternatively, maybe another reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. Reacting with water produces NaBO2 (precipitate?), and H2 gas. But H2 again doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal amide and water? Like NaNH2 + H2O \u2192 NaOH + NH3\u2191. But NH3 doesn't fit the gas condition.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let's look at the other clues again.\n\nThe product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think of Grignard reagent again. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When reacted with Grignard, the Grignard adds to the ketone carbonyl, forming an alcohol. The product would be something like CH2(OH)CH2COOH (but that has three oxygen atoms: two from the carboxylic acid and one from the alcohol). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think of the reaction step. The Grignard (RMgX) adds to the carbonyl group (the ketone part of the keto acid). The product would be an alcohol (from the Grignard addition) and the carboxylic acid remains. So the product would have the carboxylic acid group (two oxygen atoms: one in the COOH) and the alcohol group (one O). Wait, COOH has two oxygen atoms? Yes: COOH is -C(=O)OH, so two oxygens. The alcohol has one. So total three oxygen atoms. But the problem says the product has two. Hmm. Maybe the reaction goes further? Or perhaps the keto acid is different. Maybe the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (propanoylacetone?), which has two oxygen atoms in the ketone and carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe the Grignard addition leads to a loss of oxygen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester or something else with fewer oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is a diketone, but that might not reduce the oxygen count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reagent X is an organolithium, like butyllithium. The reaction with a keto acid might form a different product. Not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. The problem says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione), which has two ketone groups and no carboxylic acid. Wait, no, acetylacetone is a diketone. Its structure is CH3COCH2COCH3. If that reacts with Grignard, perhaps the product would have an alcohol group. Let's see: adding Grignard to the ketone would give an alcohol, but since there are two ketones, maybe two additions? But that would form a diol. The product would have two OH groups, so two oxygens. But the original diketone has two oxygen atoms (each ketone has one O). So the product would have two from the alcohols plus the original? Wait, maybe the Grignard adds to one of the ketones, leading to an alcohol, and the other ketone remains. So total oxygen atoms would be two from the original ketones plus one from the alcohol? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a product with fewer oxygens. Maybe the product is a tertiary alcohol with only one oxygen (the hydroxyl group). But then the original keto acid had two oxygens (if it's a diketone?), so the product would have one. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate? Not sure. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nLet me try to retrace. The key points:\n\n1. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. So possible candidates are He, N2, O2.\n\n2. Precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (about 4\u00b0C). That's just above freezing point of water, so maybe B is water? But ice melts at 273 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate or another substance. Wait, if G is something like MgCO3, which when heated decomposes to MgO and CO2. The B would be CO2, but its melting point is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate is CaCO3, heating gives CaO and CO2. CO2's melting point is 216 K. Not close. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like NH4Cl, which when heated decomposes into NH3 and HCl? Not a solid. Alternatively, maybe G is Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. The melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K? The problem says \"very close\", so maybe that's acceptable. So if the reaction between X and Y produces Mg(OH)2 and H2O? Wait, but the product of the reaction would be the precipitate and the gas. Wait, the problem states that the reaction produces the gas W and precipitate G. So in this case, the gas would be H2O? No, because H2O is liquid. Wait, but if the reaction is exothermic, maybe the H2O is released as gas? Or maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between magnesium metal and water. Mg + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + H2\u2191. The gas here is H2, which doesn't satisfy the proton-neutron condition. But the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O, which has a melting point near 273 K. The problem states the melting point is very close to 277 K, so maybe that's close enough. But then the gas W is H2, which doesn't fit the condition. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: the substance X and its analog are used as reagents. Grignard and organolithium are common. Their analogs could be each other. So perhaps X is a Grignard reagent. Let's suppose that.\n\nIf the reaction between X (RMgBr) and liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Suppose Y is water. Then the reaction is RMgBr + 2H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)2\u2193 + HBr\u2191. The gas here is HBr. But earlier that doesn't fit the proton-neutron condition. Unless the gas is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let me think of another liquid Y.\n\nWait, maybe Y is an acid? Let's say nitric acid (HNO3). Then reacting with a Grignard might produce a nitro compound and release gas. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is a halogenated compound. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X (a Grignard reagent) and something like carbon dioxide (CO2). Then the reaction might form a carboxylic acid and MgCO3 precipitate. The gas could be something else? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the gas being O2. How to get O2? Maybe from a peroxide. Suppose Y is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). If X reacts with H2O2, maybe producing O2 gas. For example, if X is a metal hydride like sodium hydride, reacting with H2O2 might produce NaOH, H2O, and O2. Let's see:\n\n2NaH + H2O2 \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191. No, that gives H2. Alternatively, another reaction?\n\nHmm, maybe the reaction of a borohydride with H2O2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a sodium amide (NaNH2). Reaction with H2O2 could produce ammonia and sodium peroxide?\n\nNaNH2 + H2O2 \u2192 NaO2H (sodium peroxide?) + NH3\u2191. Not sure. The gas here is NH3, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Let's think of the elements in X. The question wants the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is a Grignard reagent like RMgBr, then the elements are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest is H (atomic mass ~1), heaviest is Br (35). So sum would be 1+35=36, but that's not an option here. The options are 35,25,31,29. Hmm. Wait, maybe the lightest is hydrogen (1), and the heaviest is Mg (24)? No, because Br is heavier. Wait, Br has atomic number 35, so its atomic mass is about 80. But the options don't have 81 (1+80=81). So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a different compound. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone (acetone, (CH3)2CO), which has one oxygen (the ketone). When reacting with Grignard, it forms a tertiary alcohol. The product would be (CH2CH2CH3) (but structure?), but the oxygen count would be one (the hydroxyl group). Wait, that's one oxygen. But the question says two. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). Let's see. Reacting with water produces LiOH, Al(OH)3 (precipitate?), and H2 gas. Gas H2 again doesn't fit. The product of a keto acid with LiAlH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, so the oxygen count would be one (from the alcohol), but maybe the original keto acid had another oxygen. Wait, if the keto acid has a carboxylic group, then maybe it's like acetoacetic acid (two oxygen in the carboxylic acid and one in the ketone). The product after reduction would have the alcohol group and the carboxylic acid? No, LiAlH4 would reduce the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol as well. So the product would have two alcohol groups? So two oxygen atoms. That might fit. \n\nSo if X is LiAlH4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (13 or 27 atomic mass). Wait, Al's atomic mass is about 27. So sum 1+27=28, which is not an option. Hmm. The options are 35,25,31,29. \n\nWait, another thought. The problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" If the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH3, a diketone with two oxygen atoms?), no, each ketone has one O, so two O's. Then reacting with LiAlH4 would reduce both ketones to alcohols, resulting in two OH groups, so two oxygen atoms. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlH4, the elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (27), and H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27), so 1+27=28. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is sodium hydride (NaH). The elements are Na (23), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the substance is calcium hydride (CaH2). Elements: Ca (40), H (1). Sum 41. Not in options.\n\nAlternatively, the substance is potassium hydride (KH). K is 39, H 1: sum 40. Not in options.\n\nHmm. Let's consider another possibility. The problem mentions that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Suppose the element is hydrogen, and the isotope is deuterium (D, mass 2). So in X, there's deuterium instead of H. So the lightest element in X would still be H (or D, which is still hydrogen, but with higher mass). Wait, but the question says \"lightest element\"\u2014the element with the lowest atomic number. So if X contains deuterium, it's still hydrogen, so the lightest element is still H (or D, but element-wise, it's hydrogen). So the lightest element's mass would be the deuterium's mass if all H in X are deuterium. Wait, but the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so only one element is using a heavier isotope, others are normal. For example, if X is RMgD (deuteride?), then the H is replaced by D. So the lightest element is D (still hydrogen), so its mass would be 2. The heaviest element would be Mg (24) or the halogen. Wait, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is something like NaD (sodium deuteride). Then the elements are Na (23), D (2). Lightest is D (2), heaviest Na (23). Sum 25, which is option B. Hmm, that's possible. Let's see if that fits all clues.\n\nIf X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then:\n\nReaction with liquid Y (maybe water) would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nThe gas here is deuterium gas (D2). Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Total protons:2, neutrons:2. That fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons.\n\nThe reaction produces NaOH (aq) and D2 gas, and a precipitate? Wait, NaOH is soluble, so maybe no precipitate. Hmm, that contradicts the precipitate G part. So maybe the reaction is different. \n\nAlternatively, if Y is something else. Suppose Y is a metal oxide? Like MgO? Then NaD + MgO \u2192 ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another substance that forms a precipitate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if X is sodium deuteride, and the reaction is with water:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The products are NaOH (aqueous) and D2 gas. No precipitate here. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid. Suppose Y is H3PO4 (phosphoric acid). Then the reaction would produce Na3PO4, D2O, and H2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate forms in another reaction. Let's think of another approach.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. If B is H2O (melting point 273 K), then the precipitate could be Mg(OH)2, which when heated forms MgO and H2O. \n\nSo if the reaction between X and Y produces Mg(OH)2 and gas W (maybe D2?), then what is X and Y?\n\nIf Mg(OH)2 is the precipitate, then the reaction might be between magnesium metal and deuterium oxide (D2O):\n\nMg + D2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + D2\u2191. \n\nThen the gas W is D2, which meets the proton-neutron condition. The precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, which when heated gives MgO and H2O (B). \n\nSo substance X would be magnesium metal? But the problem says X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Magnesium metal is used in Grignard reagent preparation but isn't itself a reagent in the same way. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a Grignard reagent made with deuterium, like RMgD, reacting with something else. \n\nWait, the Grignard reagent RMgD reacting with water would give ROD, Mg(OH)D? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is RMgD + H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)D. The precipitate might be Mg(OH)D, which when heated releases D2O (B)? But the melting point of D2O is similar to H2O, around 273 K, so close to 277. \n\nIn this case, substance X is RMgD. The elements present are R (C, H, D), Mg, and D (or H?). The lightest element would be deuterium (still hydrogen, but mass 2), but maybe the lightest is hydrogen if there are regular H atoms. Wait, the problem states X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if the hydrogen in the organic group R is replaced by deuterium, but the Mg and the halogen are normal. Or maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope. \n\nWait, the question says \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So one element in X is present as a heavier isotope. For example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is a heavier isotope like Br-81, but the problem says the product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, then the elements are C, H, D (in R?), Mg, and the halogen (say Cl or Br). The lightest element is H (if there's regular H in R) or D. Wait, but the question says it uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Suppose the hydrogen in the organic group R is replaced by deuterium. So the lightest element is still H (if there are any H left), but the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so maybe all H in X are replaced by D. Then the lightest element is D (hydrogen isotope), mass 2. The heaviest element would be the halogen, say Br (atomic mass ~80). So sum would be 2 + 80 = 82. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the heavier isotope is in Mg? Mg has isotopes like Mg-25 (mass 24.98585) and Mg-26. But the problem states \"heavier isotope\"\u2014so maybe Mg-25 is considered the common one, and a heavier isotope like Mg-26? But that's a small difference and probably negligible for the problem's purposes. Not likely.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Let me think of the answer options. The options are 35,25,31,29. \n\nIf the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), sum is ~36.5, which rounds to 35? (Option A). Or maybe the halogen is Cl, so 35.5 (rounded to 35) plus 1 gives 36. Not exactly, but maybe the question uses whole numbers. Cl's atomic mass is about 35.5, so maybe they consider it as 35. So 1+35=36, but not an option. \n\nWait, maybe the heaviest element is Mg (24). Then if the lightest is H (1), sum is 25 (option B). So that's possible. \n\nIf the substance X is something like NaH (sodium hydride), then the elements are Na (23) and H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23), sum 24. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, if X is LiAlH4, the elements are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Al (27), sum 28. Not option. \n\nWait, maybe the substance is calcium hydride (CaH2). Elements Ca (40), H (1). Sum 41. Not in options. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider the product of the keto acid and X having 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), but that's a carboxylic acid, not a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. For example, pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH). If reacted with a reducing agent like LiAlH4, it would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols. So the product would have two OH groups, so two oxygen atoms. That fits. So LiAlH4 is the reagent. Then the elements in LiAlH4 are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28. Not an option. \n\nWait another possibility: the substance X is a Grignard reagent where the halogen is a heavier isotope. Suppose the halogen is iodine (I, atomic mass ~127). Then the lightest element is H (1), heaviest I (127). Sum is 128. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is potassium hydride (KH). Elements K (39), H (1). Sum 40. Not in options. \n\nWait, maybe the substance is a borohydride like NaBH4. Elements Na (23), B (11), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not in options. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-express the clues:\n\n- The gas has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. Possible candidates: He (2 p, 2 n), N2 (14 p,14 n), O2 (16 p,16 n), etc.\n\n- The reaction produces precipitate G, which when heated releases B with melting point ~277 K (near water's melting point, so B might be H2O).\n\n- The reagent X and its analog are used in organic chemistry. Common ones are Grignard (RMgX) and organolithium (RLi).\n\nLet's assume the gas is He. How would that form? Maybe from a reaction involving a metal hydride and something that releases He? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, if the gas is N2, perhaps from a reaction involving azide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas is O2. Let's think of a reaction that produces O2. For example, potassium superoxide (KO2) reacting with water produces KOH, H2O2, and O2. But KO2 isn't a common reagent in organic chemistry. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a compound that releases O2 when reacting with Y. Suppose X is PbO2 and Y is something else? Not organic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid producing O2. For example, some metals with concentrated acids? Not common.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the product of the keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms again. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (a diketone with two O atoms). Reacting with Grignard (RMgX), which adds to both ketone groups, forming a dialcohol. The product would have two OH groups (two O atoms). So that fits. \n\nSo X is a Grignard reagent. The elements in RMgBr are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Br (35.5). Sum is ~36.5. The options have 35 (A) which is close. But the problem says \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". If they are using whole numbers, Br's atomic mass is about 80 (since Br-79 is the main isotope), so 80 + 1 =81. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the halogen is Cl (35.5). So Cl is 35.5, plus H (1) is 36.5. The closest option is 35 (A). Maybe they consider the atomic number instead of mass? H is 1, Cl is 17. 1+17=18. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the heavier isotope is in magnesium. For example, if the Grignard uses Mg-25 (which is the most common isotope of Mg has a mass of about 24.3). So the heaviest element would be Br (80), but maybe the question is considering the elements' atomic numbers. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Br (35). Their atomic numbers sum to 36, but again not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the substance is an organolithium, like phenyllithium (C6H5Li). The elements are C, H, Li. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not in options.\n\nHmm, this is really tough. Let me look at the options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. The closest I can get is 35 (A) if considering Br (35) and H (1). But the atomic mass of Br is around 80, so that's not adding up. Wait, perhaps the substance X is not a Grignard but something else. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe problem mentions the \"product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Suppose the product is a compound with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanal (which is an aldehyde, not a keto acid), but that's not. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but that has one oxygen. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, but that has two oxygens (in the COOH group). Wait, if the keto acid is a diketone (two ketone groups) and the reaction with X adds two groups, maybe the product loses an oxygen? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with X produces an alcohol with one oxygen and the carboxylic acid group (two oxygens?), totaling three. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is an ester with two oxygens. For example, if the keto acid reacts to form an ester, but I'm not sure how.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the answer options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. The sum of H (1) and Cl (35.5) is ~36.5, so 35 might be the rounded value. That would correspond to if the halogen is Cl. So if X is RMgCl, then the heaviest element is Cl (35.5), lightest H (1). Sum ~36.5 \u2192 35 (option A). \n\nAlternatively, if the heaviest element is Mg (24) and lightest H (1), sum 25 (option B). That would be if the heaviest element is Mg, which would be the case if the halogen is not present. But Grignard reagents have a halogen. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is not a Grignard reagent but something else where the heaviest element is carbon? No, that would be too light.\n\nWait another possibility: the substance X is a lithium amide (Li2NH). The elements are Li (7), N (14), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum 15. Not option. \n\nHmm. Let me try to think of the gas again. If the gas is N2, then how is it produced? Maybe from a reaction involving azide? For example, NaN3 + something produces N2. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction of a nitride with water: for example, Li3N + 3H2O \u2192 3LiOH + NH3\u2191. The gas here is NH3. Not good. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction of calcium cyanamide with water? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the melting point of B being close to 277 K. That's about 4\u00b0C. The melting point of water is 273.15 K, so 277 is 4 degrees higher. Maybe B is a hydrate? Or maybe a different compound like ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is higher. \n\nAlternatively, B could be a substance that's a solid at room temperature but melts near that. Maybe it's dry ice (CO2), but that sublimes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the B is MgO? Its melting point is around 2852\u00b0C, which is way off. \n\nHmm. Maybe the precipitate G is something like MgCO3, which when heated forms MgO and CO2. Then B would be CO2, but melting point is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is BaSO4, but heating doesn't release a substance with that melting point. \n\nWait, perhaps the precipitate is something like CaCO3 (calcium carbonate), which when heated gives CaO and CO2. CO2's melting point is 216 K. Not close. \n\nHmm. Maybe the reaction produces a precipitate like Ca(OH)2. When heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B is H2O. The melting point is close enough. \n\nSo if the reaction between X and Y produces Ca(OH)2 and gas W (which must be something with equal protons and neutrons). Let's see, what would X and Y be?\n\nIf Y is water, then X must be something that reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and gas. For example, calcium metal reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and H2 gas. The gas H2 has protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if X is calcium carbide (CaC2), reacting with water produces Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (acetylene). The gas here is C2H2, which has 2*(6) + 1*2 =14 protons, and neutrons: 2*(6 neutrons in C-12) + 0 for H \u2192 12 neutrons. Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces N2 gas. For example, if X is a nitride like Ca3N2. Reacting with water:\n\nCa3N2 + 6H2O \u2192 3Ca(OH)2 + 2NH3\u2191. Gas is NH3, which doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to look back at the question's first part: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n\nThe key is gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's consider possible gases again. \n\n- He: 2p 2n \u2192 total 2 each. \n\n- N2: 14p, 14n (if N-14).\n\n- O2: 16p, 16n (if O-16).\n\n- Maybe C? (monatomic gas? Unlikely.)\n\nSo possible gases are He, N2, O2. \n\nSuppose the gas is N2. How to get that?\n\nA reaction that releases N2 could involve a nitride reacting with something. For example, sodium azide (NaN3) reacting with an acid?\n\n2NaN3 + 2H2SO4 \u2192 2Na2SO4 + 3N2\u2191 + 2H2O. Here, the gas is N2. The precipitate would be none unless something else forms. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is between a metal and a nitrate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, consider the reaction of magnesium with a nitrate? Unlikely. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction between a metal and a nitride. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the product when a keto acid reacts with X to have 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is an alcohol with one oxygen and the original keto acid had one oxygen (like a ketone), so total two? \n\nWait, if the keto acid has one oxygen (a ketone group), then reacting with a reducing agent like NaBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol (one oxygen), so total one? Not two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if the keto acid is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, forming an ester with two oxygen atoms (one in the ester group, one in the original carboxylic acid?). Wait, a keto acid might have a carboxylic group and a ketone. \n\nAlternatively, the product could be an ether, but that has one oxygen. \n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to think of the elements in X again. If the answer is 25 (option B), that would be 1 (H) +24 (Mg) =25. So the heaviest element is Mg. That would be the case if the halogen is not present. But Grignard reagents do have a halogen. \n\nWait, maybe the substance X is a magnesium hydride (MgH2). The elements are Mg and H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Mg (24). Sum 25 (option B). \n\nThen the reaction with liquid Y (maybe water):\n\nMgH2 + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2H2\u2191. \n\nThe gas here is H2, which doesn't fit the proton-neutron condition. But if the hydride is deuterated (MgD2):\n\nMgD2 + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each D has 1 p and 1 n). So that fits. \n\nThe precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated releases B (H2O), melting point 273 K (close to 277). \n\nThe product of a keto acid with X (MgD2?) would be? Hmm, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, magnesium hydride is not typically used as a reagent in organic chemistry like Grignard or organolithium. But the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". Magnesium hydride's analog could be Grignard. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If X is MgH2, how does it react with a keto acid? Maybe the MgH2 acts as a reducing agent? For example, reducing the keto group to an alcohol. \n\nSuppose the keto acid is something like propanone (CH3COCH3). Reacting with MgH2 might form an alcohol. The product would have one oxygen atom (from the alcohol), so not two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the keto acid has a carboxylic group, like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). Reacting with MgH2, maybe the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the ketone to a secondary alcohol, resulting in two oxygen atoms (each OH group has one O). So total two oxygens. That fits. \n\nSo the product would have two oxygen atoms from the two alcohol groups. \n\nSo this could work. \n\nTherefore, substance X is MgH2 (or MgD2, incorporating a heavier isotope like deuterium). The elements are Mg and H (or D). The lightest is H (or D, but still considered hydrogen's element), and the heaviest is Mg. Summing their atomic masses: H (1) + Mg (24) = 25 (option B). \n\nThis fits the options. \n\nSo the answer would be B) 25.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question requires identifying Substance X based on several clues and calculating the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. \n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include He (2p/2n), N\u2082 (14p/14n), or O\u2082 (16p/16n). \n2. **Precipitate G and B**: The precipitate, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (\u2248273 K, water's melting point). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), implying G is Mg(OH)\u2082 (decomposes to MgO and H\u2082O when heated).\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a reducing agent like magnesium hydride (MgH\u2082), reacting with a keto acid (e.g., acetoacetic acid) would reduce the ketone and carboxylic groups to alcohols, yielding two oxygen atoms.\n4. **Isotope Consideration**: X incorporates a heavier isotope. Magnesium hydride (MgH\u2082) can be deuterated (MgD\u2082), using deuterium (D, 2 mass units) as the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n5. **Elements in X**: Mg (24) and H (or D, still hydrogen). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Mg (24). Their atomic masses sum to **25**.\n\nAnswer: B) 25.\n\n**Answer: B**",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, first, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The question gives several clues. Let's break down each part of the problem.\n\nThe first part says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So maybe it's a compound that has an isotope like deuterium (D, which is hydrogen-2) instead of regular hydrogen? Or maybe another element's isotope?\n\nNext, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. The molecule must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally, so that's out. Maybe H2? Wait, but H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No. Maybe something like He? Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4), so that's 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule would be He? But He is a noble gas, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe H2O? No, that's a molecule with more atoms. Wait, the gas W's molecule must have the same number of neutrons and protons in total. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons must be equal. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal.\n\nIf it's He, which is a monoatomic gas. Each He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So total protons (2) and neutrons (2). So that works. So gas W could be helium. But how does that fit into the reaction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's see another possibility. Let's think of a molecule. For example, hydrogen gas (H2) doesn't work. What about neon? But that's also monoatomic. Maybe a diatomic molecule like nitrogen (N2)? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's N-14). So total protons 14, neutrons 14. That would work. So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that's possible. So the gas could be nitrogen gas. But how does that come from the reaction?\n\nWait, the problem also mentions a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's close to the freezing point of water, but maybe it's a solid at room temperature? Wait, 273 K is freezing point, so 277 is slightly above, but maybe the substance B melts just above that. Hmm, perhaps B is something like sodium chloride? But NaCl's melting point is around 801 K. No. Maybe a lower melting point. Wait, maybe B is ice? But that's H2O, but ice's melting point is 273.15 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe it's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance. Let's think of other substances. For example, maybe ammonium chloride? Its melting point is 338 K. Not close. Hmm. Maybe the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So B is a product of heating G. Let me think of reactions where heating a precipitate releases a substance with a low melting point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like calcium carbonate, which when heated decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The B here might be CO2, but then the melting point of CO2 is around 217 K (dry ice). Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the B is water? But that's a liquid, but when heated, it would be released as vapor. Wait, maybe the precipitate is something like Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. But the melting point of H2O is 273 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe that's close enough? The problem states \"the melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" So perhaps B is water, and the precipitate G is Mg(OH)2. But I need to see how this ties into the other parts.\n\nNow, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Let's think of possible reactions. The substance X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Hmm, common reagents in organic chemistry include things like Grignard reagents (RMgX), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), or maybe sodium hydride (NaH). Wait, Grignard reagents are often used, and their analogs like organolithium compounds. Let's see. \n\nSuppose X is a Grignard reagent, like RMgBr. If it reacts with water (liquid Y?), then the reaction would produce Mg(OH)2 as a precipitate and release H2? Wait, no, Grignard reagents reacting with water would produce the alcohol, Mg(OH)2, and maybe H2? Wait, actually, the reaction of RMgX with water would give R-OH, Mg(OH)X, but maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2? Let me check: RMgX + 2H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)2\u2193 + HX. So the gas here would be HX? But HX would depend on the halide. If X is, say, bromine, then HBr gas. But HBr's molecules: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons, Br has 35 protons and 45 neutrons (since Br-79 is common, which is 35 protons and 44 neutrons?), wait, Br has atomic number 35. The isotope Br-79 has 35 protons and 44 neutrons (since 79-35=44). So HBr's molecule would have total protons: 1 +35=36, neutrons:0+44=44. Not equal. So that doesn't fit the condition of gas W's molecule having equal protons and neutrons.\n\nHmm, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal hydride and water? Like sodium hydride (NaH) reacting with water. The reaction would be NaH + H2O \u2192 NaOH + H2. The gas here is H2. The molecule H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal like sodium and water? 2Na + 2H2O \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191. Again, H2 is the gas. Not matching the neutron/proton condition.\n\nWait, let's think of another possibility. The gas W must have equal number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. Let me list possible molecules:\n\n- He: monoatomic, 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4). So total protons 2, neutrons 2. So that's equal. So He gas.\n\n- N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N-14, which is common). So total protons 14, neutrons 14. That works. So N2 would satisfy the condition.\n\n- O2: 8 protons each, so total 16. Neutrons would be (oxygen-16 has 8 neutrons each, so total 16 neutrons). So O2 would also have equal protons and neutrons. Wait O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That also works. So gas W could be O2 or N2 or He.\n\nHmm. Let's see which makes sense in the reaction. Let's think of reactions that produce such gases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid? For example, Mg and HCl produces H2. But again, H2 doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a sodium amide (NaNH2) and water? NaNH2 + 2H2O \u2192 NaOH + NH3 + H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces ammonia (NH3). But NH3 has protons: 7 (N) +3 (H) =10. Neutrons would be (7 for N from 14 N: 14-7=7 neutrons, plus 0 for H) total 7. So total protons 10, neutrons 7. Not equal.\n\nHmm. Let me consider another angle. The problem mentions that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid has a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). For example, acetone is a ketone but not an acid. A keto acid like acetoacetic acid has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group and the ketone. Wait, acetoacetic acid has the structure CH3COCH2COOH. The product with X (maybe a Grignard reagent) would form a tetrahedral intermediate, then maybe a carboxylic acid? Let me think. If the keto acid reacts with Grignard reagent, the product might be an alcohol or something else. Wait, when a Grignard reagent reacts with a carbonyl compound (like a keto group), it would form a tertiary alcohol. But if the carbonyl is part of a keto acid, perhaps the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. The question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms: two in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). If reacting with Grignard reagent, the product would be a tertiary alcohol, which would have no oxygen atoms except maybe from the carboxylic group? Wait, maybe the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, leading to an alcohol, and then the carboxylic group remains? Hmm, perhaps the product would have two oxygen atoms. For example, the reaction of a Grignard with a keto acid might form an alcohol (one OH group) and the carboxylic acid group (another O). So two oxygen atoms total. That could fit. So that suggests that X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX). \n\nSo if X is a Grignard reagent, then its formula is RMgX, where R is an organic group and X is a halogen. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The Grignard reagent has Mg, R (which is carbon, hydrogen, maybe others), and a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). The heavier isotope would be in one of these. Since magnesium is a metal, maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79? Or perhaps the carbon in R is a heavier isotope, but the question says \"a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Wait, the elements present in Grignard reagent are Mg, C (in R), H (in R?), and the halogen. The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D) in the R group. Wait, Grignard reagents can sometimes have deuterium, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps the halogen is a heavier isotope, like iodine instead of bromine? But that's not an isotope, but a different element. Hmm, isotopes are same element but different neutrons. So the halogen could be, say, Br-81 instead of Br-79. But the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so the element is part of the substance, and it's using a heavier isotope. So, for example, if the halogen is Br, then using a heavier isotope like Br-81 instead of the more common Br-79. But how would that affect the calculation? The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering all isotopes. Wait, no, the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me read that again.\n\n\"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest element (the lightest element in X) and the heaviest element in X. But if there are multiple atoms of the same element, do we sum their masses? For example, if X is RMgBr, then the elements are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. So sum their atomic masses. But the problem says \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" So maybe if there are multiple isotopes present, we have to sum their masses? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". So the lightest element in X (like H) and the heaviest element in X (like Br), so their atomic masses added together. But the question mentions isotopes. The substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is a heavier isotope, then when calculating the atomic mass of Br, we need to take the isotope's mass. But the problem says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Hmm, maybe I need to consider all instances of each element in the compound. For example, if X is RMgBr, the elements are Mg, Br, and the R group (which is made of C, H, maybe others). The lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Br. So sum H's atomic mass and Br's atomic mass. But if Br is using a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79, then the Br's mass would be 81 instead of 79? But the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so maybe the substance uses a specific isotope, so we have to take that isotope's mass. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the sum of the lightest element's atomic mass (regardless of isotopes) plus the heaviest's, but considering the isotopes given in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about isotopic masses but the elements' standard atomic weights. Let me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, identify Substance X. The clues:\n\n- Reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons) and precipitate G. Heating G releases B (melting point ~277 K).\n\n- The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also used (so maybe Grignard and organolithium?).\n\nAssuming X is a Grignard reagent (RMgX), let's see:\n\nReaction with water (Y is H2O?) gives Mg(OH)2 precipitate and HX gas. But HX's molecule would have protons (H + X). Let's say X is Br. Then HBr has protons 1+35=36, neutrons 0 + (Br-79 has 44 neutrons). So 44. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the gas isn't HBr. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think of another reaction.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction of Grignard reagent with something else. Wait, the problem says \"reacts violently with liquid Y\". Maybe Y isn't water but another liquid. Let me think of other possibilities. For example, if Y is carbon dioxide, but that's a gas. Maybe sulfuric acid? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH). Reaction with water produces NaOH, H2 gas. But H2 doesn't satisfy the gas condition. Alternatively, sodium hydride with something else?\n\nWait, another possibility: the gas W could be ammonia (NH3). Let's see: protons: 7 (N) +3 (H) =10. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14, which has 7 neutrons) plus 0 for H. Total neutrons 7. Not equal. So no.\n\nHmm, maybe the gas is nitrogen gas (N2). To get N2, maybe the reaction involves a nitride? For example, sodium azide (NaN3) reacts with something? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a nitrate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be oxygen (O2). O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (if O-16). So that works. So if the reaction produces O2, that would fit. Let's think of a reaction that releases O2. Maybe a peroxide reacting? For example, sodium peroxide with water? 2Na2O2 + 2H2O \u2192 4NaOH + O2\u2191. The gas here is O2. The precipitate G might not form here. Alternatively, maybe another reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. Reacting with water produces NaBO2 (precipitate?), and H2 gas. But H2 again doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal amide and water? Like NaNH2 + H2O \u2192 NaOH + NH3\u2191. But NH3 doesn't fit the gas condition.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let's look at the other clues again.\n\nThe product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think of Grignard reagent again. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When reacted with Grignard, the Grignard adds to the ketone carbonyl, forming an alcohol. The product would be something like CH2(OH)CH2COOH (but that has three oxygen atoms: two from the carboxylic acid and one from the alcohol). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think of the reaction step. The Grignard (RMgX) adds to the carbonyl group (the ketone part of the keto acid). The product would be an alcohol (from the Grignard addition) and the carboxylic acid remains. So the product would have the carboxylic acid group (two oxygen atoms: one in the COOH) and the alcohol group (one O). Wait, COOH has two oxygen atoms? Yes: COOH is -C(=O)OH, so two oxygens. The alcohol has one. So total three oxygen atoms. But the problem says the product has two. Hmm. Maybe the reaction goes further? Or perhaps the keto acid is different. Maybe the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (propanoylacetone?), which has two oxygen atoms in the ketone and carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe the Grignard addition leads to a loss of oxygen? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester or something else with fewer oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is a diketone, but that might not reduce the oxygen count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reagent X is an organolithium, like butyllithium. The reaction with a keto acid might form a different product. Not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. The problem says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione), which has two ketone groups and no carboxylic acid. Wait, no, acetylacetone is a diketone. Its structure is CH3COCH2COCH3. If that reacts with Grignard, perhaps the product would have an alcohol group. Let's see: adding Grignard to the ketone would give an alcohol, but since there are two ketones, maybe two additions? But that would form a diol. The product would have two OH groups, so two oxygens. But the original diketone has two oxygen atoms (each ketone has one O). So the product would have two from the alcohols plus the original? Wait, maybe the Grignard adds to one of the ketones, leading to an alcohol, and the other ketone remains. So total oxygen atoms would be two from the original ketones plus one from the alcohol? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a product with fewer oxygens. Maybe the product is a tertiary alcohol with only one oxygen (the hydroxyl group). But then the original keto acid had two oxygens (if it's a diketone?), so the product would have one. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate? Not sure. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nLet me try to retrace. The key points:\n\n1. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. So possible candidates are He, N2, O2.\n\n2. Precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (about 4\u00b0C). That's just above freezing point of water, so maybe B is water? But ice melts at 273 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate or another substance. Wait, if G is something like MgCO3, which when heated decomposes to MgO and CO2. The B would be CO2, but its melting point is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate is CaCO3, heating gives CaO and CO2. CO2's melting point is 216 K. Not close. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like NH4Cl, which when heated decomposes into NH3 and HCl? Not a solid. Alternatively, maybe G is Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. The melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K? The problem says \"very close\", so maybe that's acceptable. So if the reaction between X and Y produces Mg(OH)2 and H2O? Wait, but the product of the reaction would be the precipitate and the gas. Wait, the problem states that the reaction produces the gas W and precipitate G. So in this case, the gas would be H2O? No, because H2O is liquid. Wait, but if the reaction is exothermic, maybe the H2O is released as gas? Or maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between magnesium metal and water. Mg + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + H2\u2191. The gas here is H2, which doesn't satisfy the proton-neutron condition. But the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated becomes MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O, which has a melting point near 273 K. The problem states the melting point is very close to 277 K, so maybe that's close enough. But then the gas W is H2, which doesn't fit the condition. Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: the substance X and its analog are used as reagents. Grignard and organolithium are common. Their analogs could be each other. So perhaps X is a Grignard reagent. Let's suppose that.\n\nIf the reaction between X (RMgBr) and liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Suppose Y is water. Then the reaction is RMgBr + 2H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)2\u2193 + HBr\u2191. The gas here is HBr. But earlier that doesn't fit the proton-neutron condition. Unless the gas is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let me think of another liquid Y.\n\nWait, maybe Y is an acid? Let's say nitric acid (HNO3). Then reacting with a Grignard might produce a nitro compound and release gas. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is a halogenated compound. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X (a Grignard reagent) and something like carbon dioxide (CO2). Then the reaction might form a carboxylic acid and MgCO3 precipitate. The gas could be something else? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the gas being O2. How to get O2? Maybe from a peroxide. Suppose Y is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). If X reacts with H2O2, maybe producing O2 gas. For example, if X is a metal hydride like sodium hydride, reacting with H2O2 might produce NaOH, H2O, and O2. Let's see:\n\n2NaH + H2O2 \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191. No, that gives H2. Alternatively, another reaction?\n\nHmm, maybe the reaction of a borohydride with H2O2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a sodium amide (NaNH2). Reaction with H2O2 could produce ammonia and sodium peroxide?\n\nNaNH2 + H2O2 \u2192 NaO2H (sodium peroxide?) + NH3\u2191. Not sure. The gas here is NH3, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Let's think of the elements in X. The question wants the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is a Grignard reagent like RMgBr, then the elements are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest is H (atomic mass ~1), heaviest is Br (35). So sum would be 1+35=36, but that's not an option here. The options are 35,25,31,29. Hmm. Wait, maybe the lightest is hydrogen (1), and the heaviest is Mg (24)? No, because Br is heavier. Wait, Br has atomic number 35, so its atomic mass is about 80. But the options don't have 81 (1+80=81). So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a different compound. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone (acetone, (CH3)2CO), which has one oxygen (the ketone). When reacting with Grignard, it forms a tertiary alcohol. The product would be (CH2CH2CH3) (but structure?), but the oxygen count would be one (the hydroxyl group). Wait, that's one oxygen. But the question says two. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). Let's see. Reacting with water produces LiOH, Al(OH)3 (precipitate?), and H2 gas. Gas H2 again doesn't fit. The product of a keto acid with LiAlH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, so the oxygen count would be one (from the alcohol), but maybe the original keto acid had another oxygen. Wait, if the keto acid has a carboxylic group, then maybe it's like acetoacetic acid (two oxygen in the carboxylic acid and one in the ketone). The product after reduction would have the alcohol group and the carboxylic acid? No, LiAlH4 would reduce the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol as well. So the product would have two alcohol groups? So two oxygen atoms. That might fit. \n\nSo if X is LiAlH4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (13 or 27 atomic mass). Wait, Al's atomic mass is about 27. So sum 1+27=28, which is not an option. Hmm. The options are 35,25,31,29. \n\nWait, another thought. The problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" If the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH3, a diketone with two oxygen atoms?), no, each ketone has one O, so two O's. Then reacting with LiAlH4 would reduce both ketones to alcohols, resulting in two OH groups, so two oxygen atoms. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlH4, the elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (27), and H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27), so 1+27=28. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is sodium hydride (NaH). The elements are Na (23), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the substance is calcium hydride (CaH2). Elements: Ca (40), H (1). Sum 41. Not in options.\n\nAlternatively, the substance is potassium hydride (KH). K is 39, H 1: sum 40. Not in options.\n\nHmm. Let's consider another possibility. The problem mentions that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Suppose the element is hydrogen, and the isotope is deuterium (D, mass 2). So in X, there's deuterium instead of H. So the lightest element in X would still be H (or D, which is still hydrogen, but with higher mass). Wait, but the question says \"lightest element\"\u2014the element with the lowest atomic number. So if X contains deuterium, it's still hydrogen, so the lightest element is still H (or D, but element-wise, it's hydrogen). So the lightest element's mass would be the deuterium's mass if all H in X are deuterium. Wait, but the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so only one element is using a heavier isotope, others are normal. For example, if X is RMgD (deuteride?), then the H is replaced by D. So the lightest element is D (still hydrogen), so its mass would be 2. The heaviest element would be Mg (24) or the halogen. Wait, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is something like NaD (sodium deuteride). Then the elements are Na (23), D (2). Lightest is D (2), heaviest Na (23). Sum 25, which is option B. Hmm, that's possible. Let's see if that fits all clues.\n\nIf X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then:\n\nReaction with liquid Y (maybe water) would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nThe gas here is deuterium gas (D2). Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each D2 molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Total protons:2, neutrons:2. That fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons.\n\nThe reaction produces NaOH (aq) and D2 gas, and a precipitate? Wait, NaOH is soluble, so maybe no precipitate. Hmm, that contradicts the precipitate G part. So maybe the reaction is different. \n\nAlternatively, if Y is something else. Suppose Y is a metal oxide? Like MgO? Then NaD + MgO \u2192 ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another substance that forms a precipitate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if X is sodium deuteride, and the reaction is with water:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The products are NaOH (aqueous) and D2 gas. No precipitate here. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid. Suppose Y is H3PO4 (phosphoric acid). Then the reaction would produce Na3PO4, D2O, and H2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate forms in another reaction. Let's think of another approach.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. If B is H2O (melting point 273 K), then the precipitate could be Mg(OH)2, which when heated forms MgO and H2O. \n\nSo if the reaction between X and Y produces Mg(OH)2 and gas W (maybe D2?), then what is X and Y?\n\nIf Mg(OH)2 is the precipitate, then the reaction might be between magnesium metal and deuterium oxide (D2O):\n\nMg + D2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + D2\u2191. \n\nThen the gas W is D2, which meets the proton-neutron condition. The precipitate G is Mg(OH)2, which when heated gives MgO and H2O (B). \n\nSo substance X would be magnesium metal? But the problem says X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Magnesium metal is used in Grignard reagent preparation but isn't itself a reagent in the same way. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a Grignard reagent made with deuterium, like RMgD, reacting with something else. \n\nWait, the Grignard reagent RMgD reacting with water would give ROD, Mg(OH)D? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is RMgD + H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)D. The precipitate might be Mg(OH)D, which when heated releases D2O (B)? But the melting point of D2O is similar to H2O, around 273 K, so close to 277. \n\nIn this case, substance X is RMgD. The elements present are R (C, H, D), Mg, and D (or H?). The lightest element would be deuterium (still hydrogen, but mass 2), but maybe the lightest is hydrogen if there are regular H atoms. Wait, the problem states X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if the hydrogen in the organic group R is replaced by deuterium, but the Mg and the halogen are normal. Or maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope. \n\nWait, the question says \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So one element in X is present as a heavier isotope. For example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is a heavier isotope like Br-81, but the problem says the product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, then the elements are C, H, D (in R?), Mg, and the halogen (say Cl or Br). The lightest element is H (if there's regular H in R) or D. Wait, but the question says it uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Suppose the hydrogen in the organic group R is replaced by deuterium. So the lightest element is still H (if there are any H left), but the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\"\u2014so maybe all H in X are replaced by D. Then the lightest element is D (hydrogen isotope), mass 2. The heaviest element would be the halogen, say Br (atomic mass ~80). So sum would be 2 + 80 = 82. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the heavier isotope is in Mg? Mg has isotopes like Mg-25 (mass 24.98585) and Mg-26. But the problem states \"heavier isotope\"\u2014so maybe Mg-25 is considered the common one, and a heavier isotope like Mg-26? But that's a small difference and probably negligible for the problem's purposes. Not likely.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Let me think of the answer options. The options are 35,25,31,29. \n\nIf the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), sum is ~36.5, which rounds to 35? (Option A). Or maybe the halogen is Cl, so 35.5 (rounded to 35) plus 1 gives 36. Not exactly, but maybe the question uses whole numbers. Cl's atomic mass is about 35.5, so maybe they consider it as 35. So 1+35=36, but not an option. \n\nWait, maybe the heaviest element is Mg (24). Then if the lightest is H (1), sum is 25 (option B). So that's possible. \n\nIf the substance X is something like NaH (sodium hydride), then the elements are Na (23) and H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23), sum 24. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, if X is LiAlH4, the elements are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Al (27), sum 28. Not option. \n\nWait, maybe the substance is calcium hydride (CaH2). Elements Ca (40), H (1). Sum 41. Not in options. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider the product of the keto acid and X having 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), but that's a carboxylic acid, not a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. For example, pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH). If reacted with a reducing agent like LiAlH4, it would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols. So the product would have two OH groups, so two oxygen atoms. That fits. So LiAlH4 is the reagent. Then the elements in LiAlH4 are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28. Not an option. \n\nWait another possibility: the substance X is a Grignard reagent where the halogen is a heavier isotope. Suppose the halogen is iodine (I, atomic mass ~127). Then the lightest element is H (1), heaviest I (127). Sum is 128. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is potassium hydride (KH). Elements K (39), H (1). Sum 40. Not in options. \n\nWait, maybe the substance is a borohydride like NaBH4. Elements Na (23), B (11), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not in options. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-express the clues:\n\n- The gas has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. Possible candidates: He (2 p, 2 n), N2 (14 p,14 n), O2 (16 p,16 n), etc.\n\n- The reaction produces precipitate G, which when heated releases B with melting point ~277 K (near water's melting point, so B might be H2O).\n\n- The reagent X and its analog are used in organic chemistry. Common ones are Grignard (RMgX) and organolithium (RLi).\n\nLet's assume the gas is He. How would that form? Maybe from a reaction involving a metal hydride and something that releases He? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, if the gas is N2, perhaps from a reaction involving azide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas is O2. Let's think of a reaction that produces O2. For example, potassium superoxide (KO2) reacting with water produces KOH, H2O2, and O2. But KO2 isn't a common reagent in organic chemistry. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a compound that releases O2 when reacting with Y. Suppose X is PbO2 and Y is something else? Not organic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid producing O2. For example, some metals with concentrated acids? Not common.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the product of the keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms again. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (a diketone with two O atoms). Reacting with Grignard (RMgX), which adds to both ketone groups, forming a dialcohol. The product would have two OH groups (two O atoms). So that fits. \n\nSo X is a Grignard reagent. The elements in RMgBr are C, H (in R), Mg, and Br. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Br (35.5). Sum is ~36.5. The options have 35 (A) which is close. But the problem says \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". If they are using whole numbers, Br's atomic mass is about 80 (since Br-79 is the main isotope), so 80 + 1 =81. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the halogen is Cl (35.5). So Cl is 35.5, plus H (1) is 36.5. The closest option is 35 (A). Maybe they consider the atomic number instead of mass? H is 1, Cl is 17. 1+17=18. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the heavier isotope is in magnesium. For example, if the Grignard uses Mg-25 (which is the most common isotope of Mg has a mass of about 24.3). So the heaviest element would be Br (80), but maybe the question is considering the elements' atomic numbers. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Br (35). Their atomic numbers sum to 36, but again not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the substance is an organolithium, like phenyllithium (C6H5Li). The elements are C, H, Li. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not in options.\n\nHmm, this is really tough. Let me look at the options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. The closest I can get is 35 (A) if considering Br (35) and H (1). But the atomic mass of Br is around 80, so that's not adding up. Wait, perhaps the substance X is not a Grignard but something else. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe problem mentions the \"product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Suppose the product is a compound with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanal (which is an aldehyde, not a keto acid), but that's not. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but that has one oxygen. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, but that has two oxygens (in the COOH group). Wait, if the keto acid is a diketone (two ketone groups) and the reaction with X adds two groups, maybe the product loses an oxygen? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with X produces an alcohol with one oxygen and the carboxylic acid group (two oxygens?), totaling three. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is an ester with two oxygens. For example, if the keto acid reacts to form an ester, but I'm not sure how.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the answer options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. The sum of H (1) and Cl (35.5) is ~36.5, so 35 might be the rounded value. That would correspond to if the halogen is Cl. So if X is RMgCl, then the heaviest element is Cl (35.5), lightest H (1). Sum ~36.5 \u2192 35 (option A). \n\nAlternatively, if the heaviest element is Mg (24) and lightest H (1), sum 25 (option B). That would be if the heaviest element is Mg, which would be the case if the halogen is not present. But Grignard reagents have a halogen. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance is not a Grignard reagent but something else where the heaviest element is carbon? No, that would be too light.\n\nWait another possibility: the substance X is a lithium amide (Li2NH). The elements are Li (7), N (14), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum 15. Not option. \n\nHmm. Let me try to think of the gas again. If the gas is N2, then how is it produced? Maybe from a reaction involving azide? For example, NaN3 + something produces N2. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction of a nitride with water: for example, Li3N + 3H2O \u2192 3LiOH + NH3\u2191. The gas here is NH3. Not good. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction of calcium cyanamide with water? Not sure. \n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the melting point of B being close to 277 K. That's about 4\u00b0C. The melting point of water is 273.15 K, so 277 is 4 degrees higher. Maybe B is a hydrate? Or maybe a different compound like ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is higher. \n\nAlternatively, B could be a substance that's a solid at room temperature but melts near that. Maybe it's dry ice (CO2), but that sublimes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the B is MgO? Its melting point is around 2852\u00b0C, which is way off. \n\nHmm. Maybe the precipitate G is something like MgCO3, which when heated forms MgO and CO2. Then B would be CO2, but melting point is lower. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is BaSO4, but heating doesn't release a substance with that melting point. \n\nWait, perhaps the precipitate is something like CaCO3 (calcium carbonate), which when heated gives CaO and CO2. CO2's melting point is 216 K. Not close. \n\nHmm. Maybe the reaction produces a precipitate like Ca(OH)2. When heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B is H2O. The melting point is close enough. \n\nSo if the reaction between X and Y produces Ca(OH)2 and gas W (which must be something with equal protons and neutrons). Let's see, what would X and Y be?\n\nIf Y is water, then X must be something that reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and gas. For example, calcium metal reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 and H2 gas. The gas H2 has protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, if X is calcium carbide (CaC2), reacting with water produces Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (acetylene). The gas here is C2H2, which has 2*(6) + 1*2 =14 protons, and neutrons: 2*(6 neutrons in C-12) + 0 for H \u2192 12 neutrons. Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces N2 gas. For example, if X is a nitride like Ca3N2. Reacting with water:\n\nCa3N2 + 6H2O \u2192 3Ca(OH)2 + 2NH3\u2191. Gas is NH3, which doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me try to look back at the question's first part: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n\nThe key is gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's consider possible gases again. \n\n- He: 2p 2n \u2192 total 2 each. \n\n- N2: 14p, 14n (if N-14).\n\n- O2: 16p, 16n (if O-16).\n\n- Maybe C? (monatomic gas? Unlikely.)\n\nSo possible gases are He, N2, O2. \n\nSuppose the gas is N2. How to get that?\n\nA reaction that releases N2 could involve a nitride reacting with something. For example, sodium azide (NaN3) reacting with an acid?\n\n2NaN3 + 2H2SO4 \u2192 2Na2SO4 + 3N2\u2191 + 2H2O. Here, the gas is N2. The precipitate would be none unless something else forms. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is between a metal and a nitrate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, consider the reaction of magnesium with a nitrate? Unlikely. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the reaction between a metal and a nitride. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the product when a keto acid reacts with X to have 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is an alcohol with one oxygen and the original keto acid had one oxygen (like a ketone), so total two? \n\nWait, if the keto acid has one oxygen (a ketone group), then reacting with a reducing agent like NaBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol (one oxygen), so total one? Not two. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if the keto acid is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst, forming an ester with two oxygen atoms (one in the ester group, one in the original carboxylic acid?). Wait, a keto acid might have a carboxylic group and a ketone. \n\nAlternatively, the product could be an ether, but that has one oxygen. \n\nThis is really tough. Let me try to think of the elements in X again. If the answer is 25 (option B), that would be 1 (H) +24 (Mg) =25. So the heaviest element is Mg. That would be the case if the halogen is not present. But Grignard reagents do have a halogen. \n\nWait, maybe the substance X is a magnesium hydride (MgH2). The elements are Mg and H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Mg (24). Sum 25 (option B). \n\nThen the reaction with liquid Y (maybe water):\n\nMgH2 + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2H2\u2191. \n\nThe gas here is H2, which doesn't fit the proton-neutron condition. But if the hydride is deuterated (MgD2):\n\nMgD2 + 2H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each D has 1 p and 1 n). So that fits. \n\nThe precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated releases B (H2O), melting point 273 K (close to 277). \n\nThe product of a keto acid with X (MgD2?) would be? Hmm, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, magnesium hydride is not typically used as a reagent in organic chemistry like Grignard or organolithium. But the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". Magnesium hydride's analog could be Grignard. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If X is MgH2, how does it react with a keto acid? Maybe the MgH2 acts as a reducing agent? For example, reducing the keto group to an alcohol. \n\nSuppose the keto acid is something like propanone (CH3COCH3). Reacting with MgH2 might form an alcohol. The product would have one oxygen atom (from the alcohol), so not two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the keto acid has a carboxylic group, like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). Reacting with MgH2, maybe the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the ketone to a secondary alcohol, resulting in two oxygen atoms (each OH group has one O). So total two oxygens. That fits. \n\nSo the product would have two oxygen atoms from the two alcohol groups. \n\nSo this could work. \n\nTherefore, substance X is MgH2 (or MgD2, incorporating a heavier isotope like deuterium). The elements are Mg and H (or D). The lightest is H (or D, but still considered hydrogen's element), and the heaviest is Mg. Summing their atomic masses: H (1) + Mg (24) = 25 (option B). \n\nThis fits the options. \n\nSo the answer would be B) 25.\n\n\nThe question requires identifying Substance X based on several clues and calculating the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. \n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include He (2p/2n), N\u2082 (14p/14n), or O\u2082 (16p/16n). \n2. **Precipitate G and B**: The precipitate, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (\u2248273 K, water's melting point). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), implying G is Mg(OH)\u2082 (decomposes to MgO and H\u2082O when heated).\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a reducing agent like magnesium hydride (MgH\u2082), reacting with a keto acid (e.g., acetoacetic acid) would reduce the ketone and carboxylic groups to alcohols, yielding two oxygen atoms.\n4. **Isotope Consideration**: X incorporates a heavier isotope. Magnesium hydride (MgH\u2082) can be deuterated (MgD\u2082), using deuterium (D, 2 mass units) as the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n5. **Elements in X**: Mg (24) and H (or D, still hydrogen). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Mg (24). Their atomic masses sum to **25**.\n\nAnswer: B) 25.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about Substance X, and we need to find the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it. Let me parse the information given.\n\nFirst, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe one of its elements is present as a heavier isotope. The reaction with liquid Y releases gas W, which has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Let me think: the number of protons is the atomic number, and neutrons are the mass number minus protons. So if neutrons = protons, then mass number (A) = protons (Z) + neutrons (Z) = 2Z. So the molecule's atoms must have A=2Z. Let's see possible elements. Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally. If an isotope where neutrons equal protons would be H-2 (deuterium?), but then protons=1, neutrons=1, so yes. But the molecule's atoms must satisfy that. Wait, the molecule's molecule as a whole? Or each atom in it?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons\". Wait, maybe the total? Let me think again. The wording says \"the same number of protons and neutrons\", so for the entire molecule? Or per atom? Hmm. Let me consider possible gases. If it's a diatomic gas, maybe like H2, but H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally. So for H2, total protons=2, neutrons=0. Not equal. If it's D2 (heavy hydrogen), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons 2, neutrons 2. That would work. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas? But maybe another possibility. Let me think of other elements. Let's see, for example, if the gas is He (He-4 has 2 protons, 2 neutrons). So a helium atom would have Z=2, N=2. So He-4 would satisfy. If the molecule is He gas (monatomic), then each atom has Z=2 and N=2. So that could be. Alternatively, maybe nitrogen? Let's see: Nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So a nitrogen atom would have Z=7 and N=7. So a molecule like N2 would have total protons 14 and neutrons 14. That would also satisfy the condition. So possible candidates are He, N2, or D2. Hmm.\n\nThe problem also mentions that when heated, precipitate G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0\u00b0C). So a substance that melts around 4\u00b0C. Wait, water freezes at 0, so maybe B is something that melts at just above? Wait, 277 K is 4\u00b0C. That's the melting point of ice? Wait, no, water freezes at 273.15. So maybe B is a substance with a melting point near that. Wait, maybe B is water? But water's melting point is exactly 273.15 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), but that sublimes at lower temps. Wait, perhaps B is a metal? Let's think. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate? For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the problem says B has a melting point. Alternatively, maybe G is a metal hydroxide. For example, heating magnesium hydroxide gives MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. But again, H2O's melting point is around 273 K. Close to 277? Maybe the problem is approximating. Alternatively, perhaps B is another substance. Let me think again.\n\nThe product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid would have a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Wait, maybe the product is a salt? Like when a carboxylic acid reacts with a base, forming a carboxylate. But the question mentions a keto acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with a metal? Like a Grignard reagent? Wait, the question says substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like RMgX. So maybe X is a Grignard reagent? Let's see: Grignard reagents are typically RMgBr, RMgCl, etc. So the elements in X would be carbon, magnesium, and halogen (like Cl or Br). The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79, but the problem states \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Alternatively, maybe the magnesium? But Mg has a common isotope Mg-24, and others like Mg-25 and 26. But the question might be referring to a heavier isotope, perhaps in the halogen.\n\nThe product of the reaction with a keto acid would be, for example, when a Grignard reagent adds to the carbonyl group of the keto acid, forming a tertiary alcohol or something. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: if the keto acid is, say, propanone acid (acetone acid? Not sure, but maybe something like 3-oxopropanoic acid, which is pyruvic acid?), reacting with Grignard. The product would be a tertiary alcohol, which has no oxygen? Or maybe the product is a carboxylate? Let me think: the Grignard reagent (RMgX) reacts with a keto acid (like CH3COCH2COOH?), but perhaps the product would be an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol and Mg(OH)X? Not sure. The problem states the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. Wait, the reaction of X with liquid Y (maybe water?) gives gas W, precipitate G, and then heating G releases B. Let's try to outline possible reactions.\n\nSuppose X is a Grignard reagent, RMgX (like RMgBr). Reacting with water (liquid Y?), it would hydrolyze. The reaction of Grignard with water produces the hydrocarbon R-H, Mg(OH)X. Wait, but the products are gas W and precipitate G. The hydrocarbon (like methane or ethane) would be a gas. The Mg(OH)X would be insoluble, forming a precipitate. For example, if X is bromide, then Mg(OH)Br would form, which is a precipitate. Heating the precipitate might decompose it into MgO and HBr gas? Then B would be MgO. The melting point of MgO is around 2852\u00b0C, so that's way higher than 277 K. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the precipitate is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liquid Y is not water. Maybe it's another acid? Let's think again. Let me consider the gas W. The gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible gases. For example, if the gas is H2 (with deuterium?), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons in the molecule (H2 with D2) would be 2, neutrons 2. That works. So W could be D2 gas. Alternatively, He (He-4 has 2 protons, 2 neutrons). So a helium molecule? Wait, He is monoatomic, so He gas. Each atom has Z=2, N=2, so total protons and neutrons per atom equal. So that's possible. Another option: Neutron count equals proton count. For example, a nitrogen atom in N2: N-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That's also possible. So W could be N2, He, D2, etc.\n\nNow the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let's think of possible reactions. Suppose X is a Grignard reagent reacting with water (liquid Y). The reaction would produce the alkane (gas W?), magnesium hydroxide and the halide. Wait, if the halide is, say, bromide, then Mg(OH)Br would form. Mg(OH)Br is a precipitate? Let me check solubility. Mg(OH)2 is insoluble, but Mg(OH)Br might be less so. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces MgO as a precipitate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with another substance. Wait, maybe the liquid Y is an acid. For example, if Y is H2O, then Grignard reacts to form the hydrocarbon, Mg(OH)X. Heating the precipitate (Mg(OH)X) could lead to decomposition. For example, Mg(OH)Br \u2192 MgO + HBr gas. Then B would be MgO, which has a high melting point. But the problem states that B's melting point is around 277 K. That's way too low for MgO. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate G is a carbonate. Let's think of another scenario. Suppose X is sodium? But sodium reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W would be H2 (which would need to have protons equal neutrons. Regular H2 has protons 2 and neutrons 0. So not equal. But if it's D2, then yes. So if the reaction used D2O, but the problem says liquid Y is liquid, maybe water, but X has a heavier isotope. Wait, the problem says substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe the magnesium in Grignard is a heavier isotope, but that's less likely. Alternatively, the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Iodine instead of Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the element in X with the heavier isotope is the one that forms the gas's atoms. Like if the gas is D2, then the deuterium comes from X's isotope.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another approach. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of Grignard reagents. A keto acid, like acetoacetate (which is a diketone?), but maybe reacting with Grignard would form a tertiary alcohol and release the Mg(OH)X. The product (the organic part) would be an alcohol, which has an -OH group, so one oxygen. Wait, maybe the product is an ester? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid? Wait, perhaps the keto acid reacts with Grignard to form a tertiary alcohol, which has one oxygen (the hydroxyl group). Hmm. The problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a metal oxide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). But that's a reducing agent. Reacting with water would produce H2 gas (but again, protons vs neutrons). Let's see: H2's regular form has 0 neutrons, so only if it's deuterium. Alternatively, the gas could be something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Let me think of another reagent. Maybe X is a metal that reacts with the keto acid to form a salt. For instance, sodium or potassium? But sodium reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. But again, H2's issue with neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. But not sure. Let me go back to the clues.\n\nThe melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing. Water's melting point is 273 K. Maybe B is water? But then when heating G, it releases water. But then G would be something like a hydrate. For example, if G is a metal hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, heating it would give MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O, but H2O's melting point is 273 K. The problem says \"very close to 277 K\", which is 4 degrees higher. That's a bit off, but maybe it's a typo or approximation. Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, another possibility: the melting point of B is 277 K. Let me check some elements. For example, ice is 273.15 K. Maybe B is a different form, like a different allotrope? Or maybe it's a different substance. Wait, maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. For example, gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K), which is higher. Mercury is liquid at room temp. Bismuth's melting point is around 271\u00b0C (544 K). Not close. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound. Like, maybe the product is a salt, but the problem says B's melting point is around 277 K. Maybe B is ammonium chloride? Its melting point is around 338 K. Not close. Maybe something else. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the boiling point? No, the question states melting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is dry ice (solid CO2), which sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C (194.7 K). Not close. Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe B is something like a hydrate? Like CuSO4\u00b75H2O, but melting point of the anhydrous might be higher. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another angle. The substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents (organomagnesium) and organolithium reagents are common. The analog might be organolithium. So maybe X is Grignard (like RMgBr) and the analog is RLi. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps the halogen in Grignard is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79? Or maybe the magnesium? But magnesium's main isotope is Mg-24. Alternatively, the carbon? Unlikely. Alternatively, the element with the heavier isotope is part of the gas W. Since the gas's atoms have equal protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible elements.\n\nIf the gas is D2 (deuterium), then the deuterium comes from X. For example, if X is a Grignard reagent made with deuterium. Wait, but Grignard is RMgX, so the deuterium would be in the R group? Like if R is a deuterated alkyl group. Then when reacting with water (H2O), the deuterium might stay in the product. Wait, but the gas W would be H2 if the reaction is with water. Wait, the reaction of RMgX with water produces R-H (the alkane) and Mg(OH)X. So if the R group has deuterium, maybe the gas W is D2? Or maybe the reaction releases H2 from the Grignard? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with liquid Y (which might be D2O?) but then the problem states that X has the heavier isotope. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the gas is He. Then the He comes from X's decomposition. But how would that happen? Maybe the substance X is a compound that releases He when reacting. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be N2. So maybe the reaction produces nitrogen gas. Let's think of a reaction where a substance reacts to release N2. For instance, if X is an azide? But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product of the keto acid with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. If X is Grignard, then reacting with a keto acid (like, say, propanone acid?), the product would be an alcohol with one oxygen (the -OH group). So that doesn't fit. Maybe the product is an ester? Like if the keto acid is reacted with a Grignard to form an ester. Wait, maybe the keto acid is something like a \u03b2-keto acid. For example, acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group and the ketone). Reacting with Grignard might form an alcohol, but the product's oxygen count? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide. Wait, perhaps when the keto acid reacts with X (like a metal), the product is a metal salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetic acid, reacting with a metal might produce an acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group. But the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms total? Or in the molecule?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. For instance, if the keto acid is a strong acid, and X is a metal that reacts to form an oxide. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me try to piece together possible elements in X. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all instances. Let's suppose X is Grignard reagent (RMgX, where R is an alkyl group, Mg is magnesium, and X is a halogen like Br or Cl). The elements present would be C (from R), H (from R), Mg, and the halogen (Cl, Br, etc.). The lightest element would be hydrogen (1), and the heaviest would be the halogen (Cl is 35.5, Br is ~80). Wait, but the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br instead of Cl. But the problem says \"heavier isotope\", not a different element. So perhaps the halogen is Cl, but in a heavier isotope like Cl-37 instead of Cl-35. But the question says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present, considering all instances. Wait, the question says \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\". Wait, maybe that means for each element in the compound, sum all the isotopes present. But that would complicate. Alternatively, perhaps it means for each element present, take its atomic mass (accounting for isotopes) and then sum the lightest and heaviest elements. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read again:\n\n\"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nHmm. So, for each element present in X, if there are multiple isotopes present (like, say, X has both Cl-35 and Cl-37), then their masses must be summed. But the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements\". So perhaps first identify the lightest element (by atomic number) in X and the heaviest (by atomic number), then add their atomic masses. But considering their isotopes. Wait, the problem might mean that for each element in X, you have to account for the isotopes present. For example, if the substance has, say, carbon and magnesium, then sum their atomic masses considering their isotopes. But the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements\". So the lightest element (like H if present) and heaviest (like Br or Cl), then sum their atomic masses. But the problem mentions isotopes: so if the halogen is, say, Br-81, then its atomic mass would be 81, whereas normally Br has an average of about 80. But the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So perhaps one element in X is present as a heavier isotope. So for example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is, say, Br-81, then the atomic mass of Br would be 81 instead of the average. So we have to consider that in the sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is simpler. Let's try to figure out what X is. If X is Grignard reagent, then elements are C, H, Mg, and a halogen (like Br or Cl). The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest is the halogen (say Cl is 35.5, Br is ~80). So their sum would be 1 + 35.5 = 36.5, which is close to option A (35) or D (29). Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the halogen is Cl, so 35.5 + 1 = 36.5, which is not an option. Alternatively, if the halogen is iodine (I, ~127), but that would be too big. Alternatively, maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81, so 81 + 1 = 82, which is way higher than the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a different reagent. Let's think of another possibility. The analog of X is also a reagent. For example, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH), and its analog is potassium hydride. Sodium hydride reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W would be H2, but as before, regular H2 has neutrons 0. So to have equal protons and neutrons, the H must be deuterium. So if the hydride is D instead of H, then the gas would be D2. So the substance X is NaD (sodium deuteride)? Then the elements in X are Na and D (deuterium). The lightest element is D (which is isotope of H, atomic number 1, mass 2). The heaviest is Na (mass ~23). Sum is 2 + 23 =25, which is option B. Wait, that could fit.\n\nLet me check this possibility. If X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then when it reacts with liquid Y (water, H2O), the reaction would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). The precipitate G? Wait, the products here are NaOH (soluble), D2 (gas), and maybe no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. The problem mentions a precipitate G forms. So maybe not NaH.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). Then reacting with water would produce LiOH, Al(OH)3 (precipitate?), H2 gas. The gas W would be H2 (needs to have protons=neutrons, so D2). So if the hydride is LiAlD4, then the gas would be D2. The precipitate would be Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C (2345 K), which is way higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait the melting point of B is 277 K (~4\u00b0C). If B is water, then maybe the reaction produces water as B. Let me think again. Suppose the precipitate G, when heated, releases B (water), so G is a hydrate. For example, MgSO4\u00b77H2O when heated loses water. But then the initial reaction would have to form a hydrate. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a metal hydroxide like Mg(OH)2, which when heated decomposes to MgO and H2O. Then B is H2O, but as mentioned earlier, its melting point is ~273 K, close to 277? Maybe the question is approximating. Let's see:\n\nIf B is H2O, then the elements in X must be such that when reacted, H2O is released upon heating the precipitate. Let's see, if X is a Grignard reagent RMgX (like RMgBr), reacting with water gives R-H (gas W), Mg(OH)Br (precipitate). Heating Mg(OH)Br would give MgO + HBr(g) + H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, but how would that form? If the halide is Cl, then Mg(OH)Cl might not precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if X is sodium metal. Sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another approach. The problem says the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think of the reaction between a keto acid and a metal hydride. For example, if X is sodium hydride (NaH), reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, which has two oxygen in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). The reaction might produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction forms an alcohol and sodium salt. The alcohol has one oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if X is an organolithium reagent, like phenyllithium. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) might form an ester or another compound. The product might have two oxygen atoms. For instance, if it's an ester, like ethyl acetate has two oxygen atoms. But the exact product's structure might have two oxygens. If that's the case, then the product has two oxygen atoms. \n\nAssuming that X is Grignard (RMgX), the elements in X are C, H, Mg, and X (halogen). The lightest element is H (mass 1), the heaviest is the halogen (Cl: 35.5 or Br: 80). But the sum would be 1+35.5 = 36.5 or 1+80=81. Neither are in the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm. Alternatively, if the halogen is Cl-35, then 35 +1=36. Not an option. Wait, maybe the halogen's isotope is considered. If the halogen is Cl, but the problem says the substance incorporates a heavier isotope. So if Cl-37 is present, then the atomic mass would be 37, so 37+1=38. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements in X are different. Let's think again. Suppose X is sodium amide (NaNH2). Then reacting with water would produce NH3 gas, NaOH, and maybe a precipitate? Not sure. The gas would have N and H. The molecule NH3 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N is N-14, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons; H has 0). Total protons: 7 + 3 =10, neutrons:7 +0=7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the gas's molecule must have the same total protons and neutrons. So total protons = total neutrons. Let's think of a molecule like D2O. But that's a molecule with protons (2*1 + 8 =10) and neutrons (2*1 + 8 (O-16 has 8 neutrons)). Wait, D2O would have protons: 2(1) + 8 =10, neutrons: 2(1) (from D) + 8 (from O-16) = 10. Oh! So D2O would have equal protons and neutrons. So maybe the gas is D2O? But D2O is liquid at room temp. Not a gas. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be H2O, but in heavy water form (D2O) as a gas? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14), so N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that works. So gas W could be N2.\n\nIf gas W is N2, then where does that come from? Suppose the reaction of X with liquid Y produces nitrogen gas. For instance, if X is an azide, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a nitride? Like Li3N reacting with water to produce NH3 and LiOH. But NH3 has protons 10, neutrons 7 (from N-14). Not equal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between sodium and ammonia? No, that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction involves a nitrate or something else. Let me think of another angle.\n\nThe problem says that the product of the keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think of a scenario where that product has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a metal like sodium. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid), the product would be sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate group. So sodium acetate has two O in the COO- group. So that fits. So the product is sodium acetate. Then X would be sodium metal. \n\nIf X is sodium metal (Na), then when it reacts with liquid Y (maybe water?), the reaction would be:\n\n2Na + 2H2O \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nThe gas H2 has protons 2, neutrons 0 (if regular H2), which doesn't satisfy the condition. But if the hydrogen is deuterium (D2), then protons 2, neutrons 2. So the gas would be D2. That requires that the water is D2O. But the problem says liquid Y is liquid, so maybe it's D2O. However, the problem states that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium is Na, its common isotope is Na-23. A heavier isotope would be Na-23 is the main one. So perhaps the isotope is in another element. Wait, the problem says \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So if X is Na metal, it's just Na, so the isotope must be part of Na. The heavier isotopes of Na are like Na-24 (used in medicine), but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a heavier isotope of hydrogen in the water? But the question specifies that X has the isotope. \n\nHmm. If X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then when reacting with water (H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas W is D2, which has protons=neutrons (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total 2 and 2). That fits. The precipitate G: in this reaction, the products are NaOH (soluble) and D2 gas. There's no precipitate. So that doesn't work. The problem mentions a precipitate forms. So this scenario may not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the liquid Y is not water but something else. Let's think of another liquid. Maybe Y is an acid, like HCl? If X is sodium, reacting with HCl would form NaCl and H2 gas. Still no precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is calcium carbide (CaC2). Reacting with water produces acetylene gas (C2H2), and Ca(OH)2 precipitate. The gas W is C2H2. Let's see protons and neutrons. Acetylene has 2 C (each 6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12) and 2 H (protons 1 each, neutrons 0). Total protons: 12 + 2 =14. Neutrons: 12 (from C) +0 =12. Not equal. So that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think again of the gas W. The molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. Let me consider other possibilities:\n\n- Helium (He): monoatomic gas. Each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4). So each atom satisfies. The molecule is monoatomic, so yes. So gas W could be He.\n\nIf W is He, then where does it come from? Maybe the reaction releases helium gas. For example, if X contains a helium compound, but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of a borohydride with something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction of a substance with water producing He is unlikely. Let me think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). When it reacts with water:\n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191\n\nThe gas W is H2 (needs to be D2 for protons=neutrons). The precipitate is Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. B would be Al2O3 (melting point ~2072\u00b0C). Not close to 277 K. \n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, then heating gives MgO (melting point 2852 K). No. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the elements in X. The question asks for the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses. The options are 25,29,31,35. Let me see possible combinations:\n\n- If the elements are H (1), and Cl (35.5), sum is ~36.5 \u2192 not an option.\n\n- If the elements are H (1) and Br (79.9), sum is ~80.9 \u2192 no.\n\n- Maybe the elements are Li (6.94), and Cl (35.5): 6.94+35.5 ~42.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- If the elements are H (1) and Mg (24.3): 25.3 \u2192 option B (25).\n\nAh! Maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH). The elements are Na (23) and H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, but option B is 25. Close. But if the H is deuterium (mass 2), then sum is 23+2=25 (option B). So that fits.\n\nLet's see if this scenario works:\n\nX is NaD (sodium deuteride). Reacts with liquid Y (water, H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nGas W is D2: each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons 2, neutrons 2. That's good.\n\nThe products are NaOH (soluble) and D2 gas. No precipitate. Hmm, the problem states a precipitate forms. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Suppose Y is an acid like H2SO4? Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4 and D2. Still no precipitate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an alcohol? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with another substance. Wait, the problem says \"reacts violently with liquid Y\", so Y must be a liquid. If the reaction produces a precipitate, perhaps the liquid Y is an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is HCl and X is sodium deuteride, then:\n\nNaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl\u2193 (precipitate?) + D2\u2191. \n\nWait, NaCl is soluble in water. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X is calcium hydride (CaH2). Reacts with water:\n\nCaH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2\u2193 (precipitate) + 2 H2\u2191 (needs to be D2).\n\nIf the H in CaH2 is deuterium, then gas is D2. Then the precipitate is Ca(OH)2. Heating Ca(OH)2 would give CaO and H2O. B is H2O, which has a melting point ~273 K. Close to 277 K (the question says very close). So that works.\n\nThe elements in X (CaH2) are Ca and H. The lightest element is H (mass 1 if H-1, or 2 if D). The problem states X incorporates a heavier isotope, so H must be deuterium (D). So the H's mass is 2. The heaviest element is Ca (40.08). Sum is 2 +40.08 =42.08, which is not among the options. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the hydride is LiH, then X is LiD. Elements are Li (6.94) and D (2). Sum is ~9. Not in options.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. Suppose X is an organolithium reagent, like CH3Li. The elements are C, H, Li. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12) or Li (6.94). Wait, Li is lighter than C. So heaviest is C. Sum would be 1 +12 =13. Not in options.\n\nAlternatively, if X is phenyllithium (C6H5Li), elements are C, H, Li. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is something else. Let me think of the product of the keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is an ester, like ethyl acetate (C4H8O2). So two oxygen atoms. That requires X to be an alcohol (like ethanol) in a Fischer esterification? But that's not a reagent used in organic chemistry in that way. Alternatively, maybe X is an acid anhydride?\n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent reacting with a keto acid to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction between a \u03b2-keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, which has two oxygen in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone) and a Grignard reagent. The Grignard would add to the carbonyl, forming a tertiary alcohol. The product would have one oxygen (the -OH group). Not two. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the product is a metal oxide. Suppose the keto acid reacts with a metal to form a metal salt with two oxygen atoms. For instance, if the keto acid is acetic acid and the metal is sodium, forming sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The acetate has two oxygen atoms in the COO- group. So the product has two oxygen atoms. So X is sodium metal. \n\nIn that case, the reaction of sodium with liquid Y (water) would produce NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W is H2 (needs to be D2 to have protons=neutrons). So if the sodium is part of a compound with deuterium? Wait, the problem says X is sodium metal, which doesn't have deuterium. Unless the water is D2O, but then the gas would be D2. But the problem states that X incorporates the heavier isotope. So perhaps the sodium has a heavier isotope? Sodium's main isotope is Na-23. The heavier isotope is Na-24, but that's rare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is D2O. Then the reaction is:\n\n2Na + 2D2O \u2192 2NaOD + D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas is D2 (protons 2, neutrons 2). The precipitate? The product would be NaOD (sodium deuteroxide?), which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is something else. Let's think of another possibility.\n\nSuppose X is lithium. Reacting with water:\n\n2Li + 2H2O \u2192 2LiOH + H2\u2191.\n\nGas H2 (needs to be D2). Precipitate? No, LiOH is soluble. \n\nHmm.\n\nWait, going back to the earlier possibility where X is sodium hydride (NaH), but the reaction with water produces NaOH and H2. No precipitate. But if the liquid Y is something else, like an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is HCl, then:\n\nNaH + HCl \u2192 NaCl + H2\u2191. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate.\n\nAlternatively, if Y is a metal nitrate solution? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid that forms a precipitate with the product. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, then reacting with Na would form Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. The sum of H (1) and Na (23) would be 24, which is close to option B (25) if H is deuterium (2). So that fits. Let's see if the other conditions hold.\n\nIf X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then:\n\n- Reacts with liquid Y (maybe water, H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191.\n\nGas W is D2 (protons 2, neutrons 2).\n\nPrecipitate? No, NaOH is soluble. So this doesn't form a precipitate. So maybe Y is another liquid. Suppose Y is a solution of a salt that forms an insoluble compound. For example, if Y is a solution of MgCl2, then:\n\nNaD + MgCl2 \u2192 ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a precipitate when reacting with another substance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid like H2SO4, and the reaction produces Na2SO4 (soluble) and D2. Still no precipitate.\n\nHmm. The problem states that a precipitate forms. So perhaps the reaction is between X and another substance, like an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For instance, if X is calcium hydride (CaH2), reacting with water:\n\nCaH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2\u2193 + 2 H2\u2191 (or D2 if deuterium).\n\nThe precipitate is Ca(OH)2. Heating it would produce CaO and H2O. B is CaO (calcium oxide), which has a melting point of about 2613\u00b0C (2886 K), which is way higher than 277 K. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is magnesium hydroxide. If X is magnesium hydride (MgH2), reacting with water:\n\nMgH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2\u2193 + 2 H2\u2191 (or D2).\n\nThen heating Mg(OH)2 gives MgO and H2O. B is MgO, which has a high melting point again. Not good.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another possibility where the precipitate's decomposition product B has a low melting point. If B is water (melting point 273 K), then the precipitate must decompose to release water. So the precipitate could be a metal hydroxide that, when heated, loses water. For example, Cu(OH)2 \u2192 CuO + H2O. Then B would be H2O. \n\nIf the reaction of X with liquid Y (water) produces Cu(OH)2 precipitate, then X must be a copper hydride? Like CuH. \n\nCuH reacting with water:\n\n2 CuH + 2 H2O \u2192 2 Cu(OH)2\u2193 + H2\u2191.\n\nThe gas is H2 (needs to be D2). So if the hydride is CuD, then gas is D2. The elements in X (CuD) are Cu and D. The lightest is D (mass 2), heaviest is Cu (63.55). Sum would be 2+63.55=65.55, not an option.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate. For example, if the reaction produces calcium carbonate:\n\nCaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2\u2191 when heated. So B would be CaO, but its melting point is too high.\n\nAlternatively, if B is carbon dioxide (CO2), but its melting point is -56.6\u00b0C (216.6 K), which is lower than 277 K.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me try to consider the options again. The answer choices are 25, 29, 31, 35. \n\nIf the lightest element is H (mass 1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), their sum is ~36.5 \u2192 closest to 35 (option A). But the problem requires that X uses a heavier isotope. If the Cl is Cl-37, then 37+1=38 \u2192 not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the heaviest is bromine (Br-80), then 1+80=81 \u2192 no.\n\nWait another possibility: perhaps the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). The elements are Li (6.94), Al (27), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 1+27=28 \u2192 close to option D (29). If H is deuterium (mass 2), then 2+27=29 \u2192 option D. Let's see if this fits:\n\nLiAlH4 reacts with water:\n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191.\n\nGas W is H2 (needs to be D2). So if the hydride is LiAlD4, then the gas is D2. The precipitate is Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. B would be Al2O3, which has a high melting point. Not matching the 277 K requirement.\n\nHmm. But the sum would be 2 (D) +27 (Al) =29 (option D). \n\nThe problem states that B's melting point is near 277 K. If B is H2O, then the precipitate must decompose to release it. But Al(OH)3 heating gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B is H2O. Then the melting point is ~273 K, close to 277. Maybe the question allows that approximation. \n\nIn that case, the elements in X (LiAlD4) are Li (7), Al (27), D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29 \u2192 option D. \n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check all conditions:\n\n- X incorporates a heavier isotope: the hydride uses D (heavier than H).\n\n- Gas W is D2 (protons=2, neutrons=2).\n\n- Precipitate Al(OH)3, when heated, releases H2O (B), whose melting point is ~273 K, close to 277 K.\n\n- The product of the keto acid with X (LiAlH4): when reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid), the product would be the deprotonated form, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count. Alternatively, the product might be an alcohol with one oxygen, but perhaps the product includes the lithium salt, which has oxygen from the acid. If the keto acid is, say, propanoic acid (two oxygen atoms?), wait, propanoic acid has one oxygen in the COOH group. Maybe the product is an ester with two oxygens. Not sure, but the problem states it has two oxygen atoms, so perhaps this fits.\n\nThe atomic masses: Li (6.94), Al (27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29 \u2192 option D. \n\nThis seems to fit all the given options. So the answer is D) 29.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying Substance X based on its reaction properties and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: Gas W must have equal protons and neutrons. This is satisfied by deuterium gas (D\u2082), where each deuterium atom (\u00b9H\u2082) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, making total protons = total neutrons (2 each).\n\n2. **Precipitate and B**: The precipitate G forms when Substance X reacts with liquid Y. Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (\u22484\u00b0C). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), as its melting point is 273 K. The precipitate G is likely aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083), which decomposes to Al\u2082O\u2083 and H\u2082O when heated.\n\n3. **Substance X Identification**: The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points to an organometallic reagent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH\u2084). When LiAlH\u2084 reacts with water (liquid Y), it produces Al(OH)\u2083 (precipitate), LiOH, and D\u2082 gas (if using deuterium). The product with the keto acid would involve a reaction forming a compound with two oxygen atoms (e.g., an ester or carboxylate).\n\n4. **Isotopic Consideration**: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Here, the hydride component (H) is replaced with deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\n5. **Elemental Composition**: The elements in LiAlD\u2084 are lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and deuterium (D). The lightest element is deuterium (mass 2), and the heaviest is aluminum (mass 27). Their sum is **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about Substance X, and we need to find the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it. Let me parse the information given.\n\nFirst, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe one of its elements is present as a heavier isotope. The reaction with liquid Y releases gas W, which has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Let me think: the number of protons is the atomic number, and neutrons are the mass number minus protons. So if neutrons = protons, then mass number (A) = protons (Z) + neutrons (Z) = 2Z. So the molecule's atoms must have A=2Z. Let's see possible elements. Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally. If an isotope where neutrons equal protons would be H-2 (deuterium?), but then protons=1, neutrons=1, so yes. But the molecule's atoms must satisfy that. Wait, the molecule's molecule as a whole? Or each atom in it?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons\". Wait, maybe the total? Let me think again. The wording says \"the same number of protons and neutrons\", so for the entire molecule? Or per atom? Hmm. Let me consider possible gases. If it's a diatomic gas, maybe like H2, but H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally. So for H2, total protons=2, neutrons=0. Not equal. If it's D2 (heavy hydrogen), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons 2, neutrons 2. That would work. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas? But maybe another possibility. Let me think of other elements. Let's see, for example, if the gas is He (He-4 has 2 protons, 2 neutrons). So a helium atom would have Z=2, N=2. So He-4 would satisfy. If the molecule is He gas (monatomic), then each atom has Z=2 and N=2. So that could be. Alternatively, maybe nitrogen? Let's see: Nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So a nitrogen atom would have Z=7 and N=7. So a molecule like N2 would have total protons 14 and neutrons 14. That would also satisfy the condition. So possible candidates are He, N2, or D2. Hmm.\n\nThe problem also mentions that when heated, precipitate G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0\u00b0C). So a substance that melts around 4\u00b0C. Wait, water freezes at 0, so maybe B is something that melts at just above? Wait, 277 K is 4\u00b0C. That's the melting point of ice? Wait, no, water freezes at 273.15. So maybe B is a substance with a melting point near that. Wait, maybe B is water? But water's melting point is exactly 273.15 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), but that sublimes at lower temps. Wait, perhaps B is a metal? Let's think. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate? For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the problem says B has a melting point. Alternatively, maybe G is a metal hydroxide. For example, heating magnesium hydroxide gives MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O. But again, H2O's melting point is around 273 K. Close to 277? Maybe the problem is approximating. Alternatively, perhaps B is another substance. Let me think again.\n\nThe product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid would have a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Wait, maybe the product is a salt? Like when a carboxylic acid reacts with a base, forming a carboxylate. But the question mentions a keto acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with a metal? Like a Grignard reagent? Wait, the question says substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like RMgX. So maybe X is a Grignard reagent? Let's see: Grignard reagents are typically RMgBr, RMgCl, etc. So the elements in X would be carbon, magnesium, and halogen (like Cl or Br). The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79, but the problem states \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". Alternatively, maybe the magnesium? But Mg has a common isotope Mg-24, and others like Mg-25 and 26. But the question might be referring to a heavier isotope, perhaps in the halogen.\n\nThe product of the reaction with a keto acid would be, for example, when a Grignard reagent adds to the carbonyl group of the keto acid, forming a tertiary alcohol or something. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: if the keto acid is, say, propanone acid (acetone acid? Not sure, but maybe something like 3-oxopropanoic acid, which is pyruvic acid?), reacting with Grignard. The product would be a tertiary alcohol, which has no oxygen? Or maybe the product is a carboxylate? Let me think: the Grignard reagent (RMgX) reacts with a keto acid (like CH3COCH2COOH?), but perhaps the product would be an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol and Mg(OH)X? Not sure. The problem states the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. Wait, the reaction of X with liquid Y (maybe water?) gives gas W, precipitate G, and then heating G releases B. Let's try to outline possible reactions.\n\nSuppose X is a Grignard reagent, RMgX (like RMgBr). Reacting with water (liquid Y?), it would hydrolyze. The reaction of Grignard with water produces the hydrocarbon R-H, Mg(OH)X. Wait, but the products are gas W and precipitate G. The hydrocarbon (like methane or ethane) would be a gas. The Mg(OH)X would be insoluble, forming a precipitate. For example, if X is bromide, then Mg(OH)Br would form, which is a precipitate. Heating the precipitate might decompose it into MgO and HBr gas? Then B would be MgO. The melting point of MgO is around 2852\u00b0C, so that's way higher than 277 K. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the precipitate is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liquid Y is not water. Maybe it's another acid? Let's think again. Let me consider the gas W. The gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible gases. For example, if the gas is H2 (with deuterium?), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons in the molecule (H2 with D2) would be 2, neutrons 2. That works. So W could be D2 gas. Alternatively, He (He-4 has 2 protons, 2 neutrons). So a helium molecule? Wait, He is monoatomic, so He gas. Each atom has Z=2, N=2, so total protons and neutrons per atom equal. So that's possible. Another option: Neutron count equals proton count. For example, a nitrogen atom in N2: N-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That's also possible. So W could be N2, He, D2, etc.\n\nNow the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let's think of possible reactions. Suppose X is a Grignard reagent reacting with water (liquid Y). The reaction would produce the alkane (gas W?), magnesium hydroxide and the halide. Wait, if the halide is, say, bromide, then Mg(OH)Br would form. Mg(OH)Br is a precipitate? Let me check solubility. Mg(OH)2 is insoluble, but Mg(OH)Br might be less so. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces MgO as a precipitate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with another substance. Wait, maybe the liquid Y is an acid. For example, if Y is H2O, then Grignard reacts to form the hydrocarbon, Mg(OH)X. Heating the precipitate (Mg(OH)X) could lead to decomposition. For example, Mg(OH)Br \u2192 MgO + HBr gas. Then B would be MgO, which has a high melting point. But the problem states that B's melting point is around 277 K. That's way too low for MgO. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate G is a carbonate. Let's think of another scenario. Suppose X is sodium? But sodium reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W would be H2 (which would need to have protons equal neutrons. Regular H2 has protons 2 and neutrons 0. So not equal. But if it's D2, then yes. So if the reaction used D2O, but the problem says liquid Y is liquid, maybe water, but X has a heavier isotope. Wait, the problem says substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe the magnesium in Grignard is a heavier isotope, but that's less likely. Alternatively, the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Iodine instead of Cl? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the element in X with the heavier isotope is the one that forms the gas's atoms. Like if the gas is D2, then the deuterium comes from X's isotope.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another approach. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of Grignard reagents. A keto acid, like acetoacetate (which is a diketone?), but maybe reacting with Grignard would form a tertiary alcohol and release the Mg(OH)X. The product (the organic part) would be an alcohol, which has an -OH group, so one oxygen. Wait, maybe the product is an ester? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid? Wait, perhaps the keto acid reacts with Grignard to form a tertiary alcohol, which has one oxygen (the hydroxyl group). Hmm. The problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a metal oxide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). But that's a reducing agent. Reacting with water would produce H2 gas (but again, protons vs neutrons). Let's see: H2's regular form has 0 neutrons, so only if it's deuterium. Alternatively, the gas could be something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. Let me think of another reagent. Maybe X is a metal that reacts with the keto acid to form a salt. For instance, sodium or potassium? But sodium reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. But again, H2's issue with neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. But not sure. Let me go back to the clues.\n\nThe melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing. Water's melting point is 273 K. Maybe B is water? But then when heating G, it releases water. But then G would be something like a hydrate. For example, if G is a metal hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, heating it would give MgO and H2O. Then B would be H2O, but H2O's melting point is 273 K. The problem says \"very close to 277 K\", which is 4 degrees higher. That's a bit off, but maybe it's a typo or approximation. Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, another possibility: the melting point of B is 277 K. Let me check some elements. For example, ice is 273.15 K. Maybe B is a different form, like a different allotrope? Or maybe it's a different substance. Wait, maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. For example, gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K), which is higher. Mercury is liquid at room temp. Bismuth's melting point is around 271\u00b0C (544 K). Not close. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound. Like, maybe the product is a salt, but the problem says B's melting point is around 277 K. Maybe B is ammonium chloride? Its melting point is around 338 K. Not close. Maybe something else. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the boiling point? No, the question states melting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is dry ice (solid CO2), which sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C (194.7 K). Not close. Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe B is something like a hydrate? Like CuSO4\u00b75H2O, but melting point of the anhydrous might be higher. Not sure.\n\nLet me try another angle. The substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents (organomagnesium) and organolithium reagents are common. The analog might be organolithium. So maybe X is Grignard (like RMgBr) and the analog is RLi. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps the halogen in Grignard is a heavier isotope, like Br-81 instead of Br-79? Or maybe the magnesium? But magnesium's main isotope is Mg-24. Alternatively, the carbon? Unlikely. Alternatively, the element with the heavier isotope is part of the gas W. Since the gas's atoms have equal protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible elements.\n\nIf the gas is D2 (deuterium), then the deuterium comes from X. For example, if X is a Grignard reagent made with deuterium. Wait, but Grignard is RMgX, so the deuterium would be in the R group? Like if R is a deuterated alkyl group. Then when reacting with water (H2O), the deuterium might stay in the product. Wait, but the gas W would be H2 if the reaction is with water. Wait, the reaction of RMgX with water produces R-H (the alkane) and Mg(OH)X. So if the R group has deuterium, maybe the gas W is D2? Or maybe the reaction releases H2 from the Grignard? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with liquid Y (which might be D2O?) but then the problem states that X has the heavier isotope. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the gas is He. Then the He comes from X's decomposition. But how would that happen? Maybe the substance X is a compound that releases He when reacting. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be N2. So maybe the reaction produces nitrogen gas. Let's think of a reaction where a substance reacts to release N2. For instance, if X is an azide? But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product of the keto acid with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. If X is Grignard, then reacting with a keto acid (like, say, propanone acid?), the product would be an alcohol with one oxygen (the -OH group). So that doesn't fit. Maybe the product is an ester? Like if the keto acid is reacted with a Grignard to form an ester. Wait, maybe the keto acid is something like a \u03b2-keto acid. For example, acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group and the ketone). Reacting with Grignard might form an alcohol, but the product's oxygen count? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide. Wait, perhaps when the keto acid reacts with X (like a metal), the product is a metal salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetic acid, reacting with a metal might produce an acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate group. But the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms total? Or in the molecule?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide. For instance, if the keto acid is a strong acid, and X is a metal that reacts to form an oxide. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLet me try to piece together possible elements in X. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all instances. Let's suppose X is Grignard reagent (RMgX, where R is an alkyl group, Mg is magnesium, and X is a halogen like Br or Cl). The elements present would be C (from R), H (from R), Mg, and the halogen (Cl, Br, etc.). The lightest element would be hydrogen (1), and the heaviest would be the halogen (Cl is 35.5, Br is ~80). Wait, but the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br instead of Cl. But the problem says \"heavier isotope\", not a different element. So perhaps the halogen is Cl, but in a heavier isotope like Cl-37 instead of Cl-35. But the question says to sum the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present, considering all instances. Wait, the question says \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\". Wait, maybe that means for each element in the compound, sum all the isotopes present. But that would complicate. Alternatively, perhaps it means for each element present, take its atomic mass (accounting for isotopes) and then sum the lightest and heaviest elements. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read again:\n\n\"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nHmm. So, for each element present in X, if there are multiple isotopes present (like, say, X has both Cl-35 and Cl-37), then their masses must be summed. But the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements\". So perhaps first identify the lightest element (by atomic number) in X and the heaviest (by atomic number), then add their atomic masses. But considering their isotopes. Wait, the problem might mean that for each element in X, you have to account for the isotopes present. For example, if the substance has, say, carbon and magnesium, then sum their atomic masses considering their isotopes. But the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements\". So the lightest element (like H if present) and heaviest (like Br or Cl), then sum their atomic masses. But the problem mentions isotopes: so if the halogen is, say, Br-81, then its atomic mass would be 81, whereas normally Br has an average of about 80. But the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So perhaps one element in X is present as a heavier isotope. So for example, if X is RMgBr, and the Br is, say, Br-81, then the atomic mass of Br would be 81 instead of the average. So we have to consider that in the sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is simpler. Let's try to figure out what X is. If X is Grignard reagent, then elements are C, H, Mg, and a halogen (like Br or Cl). The lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest is the halogen (say Cl is 35.5, Br is ~80). So their sum would be 1 + 35.5 = 36.5, which is close to option A (35) or D (29). Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the halogen is Cl, so 35.5 + 1 = 36.5, which is not an option. Alternatively, if the halogen is iodine (I, ~127), but that would be too big. Alternatively, maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, like Br-81, so 81 + 1 = 82, which is way higher than the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a different reagent. Let's think of another possibility. The analog of X is also a reagent. For example, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH), and its analog is potassium hydride. Sodium hydride reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W would be H2, but as before, regular H2 has neutrons 0. So to have equal protons and neutrons, the H must be deuterium. So if the hydride is D instead of H, then the gas would be D2. So the substance X is NaD (sodium deuteride)? Then the elements in X are Na and D (deuterium). The lightest element is D (which is isotope of H, atomic number 1, mass 2). The heaviest is Na (mass ~23). Sum is 2 + 23 =25, which is option B. Wait, that could fit.\n\nLet me check this possibility. If X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then when it reacts with liquid Y (water, H2O), the reaction would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). The precipitate G? Wait, the products here are NaOH (soluble), D2 (gas), and maybe no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. The problem mentions a precipitate G forms. So maybe not NaH.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). Then reacting with water would produce LiOH, Al(OH)3 (precipitate?), H2 gas. The gas W would be H2 (needs to have protons=neutrons, so D2). So if the hydride is LiAlD4, then the gas would be D2. The precipitate would be Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C (2345 K), which is way higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait the melting point of B is 277 K (~4\u00b0C). If B is water, then maybe the reaction produces water as B. Let me think again. Suppose the precipitate G, when heated, releases B (water), so G is a hydrate. For example, MgSO4\u00b77H2O when heated loses water. But then the initial reaction would have to form a hydrate. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a metal hydroxide like Mg(OH)2, which when heated decomposes to MgO and H2O. Then B is H2O, but as mentioned earlier, its melting point is ~273 K, close to 277? Maybe the question is approximating. Let's see:\n\nIf B is H2O, then the elements in X must be such that when reacted, H2O is released upon heating the precipitate. Let's see, if X is a Grignard reagent RMgX (like RMgBr), reacting with water gives R-H (gas W), Mg(OH)Br (precipitate). Heating Mg(OH)Br would give MgO + HBr(g) + H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, but how would that form? If the halide is Cl, then Mg(OH)Cl might not precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if X is sodium metal. Sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another approach. The problem says the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think of the reaction between a keto acid and a metal hydride. For example, if X is sodium hydride (NaH), reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, which has two oxygen in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). The reaction might produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction forms an alcohol and sodium salt. The alcohol has one oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if X is an organolithium reagent, like phenyllithium. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) might form an ester or another compound. The product might have two oxygen atoms. For instance, if it's an ester, like ethyl acetate has two oxygen atoms. But the exact product's structure might have two oxygens. If that's the case, then the product has two oxygen atoms. \n\nAssuming that X is Grignard (RMgX), the elements in X are C, H, Mg, and X (halogen). The lightest element is H (mass 1), the heaviest is the halogen (Cl: 35.5 or Br: 80). But the sum would be 1+35.5 = 36.5 or 1+80=81. Neither are in the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm. Alternatively, if the halogen is Cl-35, then 35 +1=36. Not an option. Wait, maybe the halogen's isotope is considered. If the halogen is Cl, but the problem says the substance incorporates a heavier isotope. So if Cl-37 is present, then the atomic mass would be 37, so 37+1=38. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elements in X are different. Let's think again. Suppose X is sodium amide (NaNH2). Then reacting with water would produce NH3 gas, NaOH, and maybe a precipitate? Not sure. The gas would have N and H. The molecule NH3 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N is N-14, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons; H has 0). Total protons: 7 + 3 =10, neutrons:7 +0=7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the gas's molecule must have the same total protons and neutrons. So total protons = total neutrons. Let's think of a molecule like D2O. But that's a molecule with protons (2*1 + 8 =10) and neutrons (2*1 + 8 (O-16 has 8 neutrons)). Wait, D2O would have protons: 2(1) + 8 =10, neutrons: 2(1) (from D) + 8 (from O-16) = 10. Oh! So D2O would have equal protons and neutrons. So maybe the gas is D2O? But D2O is liquid at room temp. Not a gas. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be H2O, but in heavy water form (D2O) as a gas? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14), so N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that works. So gas W could be N2.\n\nIf gas W is N2, then where does that come from? Suppose the reaction of X with liquid Y produces nitrogen gas. For instance, if X is an azide, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a nitride? Like Li3N reacting with water to produce NH3 and LiOH. But NH3 has protons 10, neutrons 7 (from N-14). Not equal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction between sodium and ammonia? No, that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction involves a nitrate or something else. Let me think of another angle.\n\nThe problem says that the product of the keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think of a scenario where that product has two oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a metal like sodium. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid), the product would be sodium acetate, which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate group. So sodium acetate has two O in the COO- group. So that fits. So the product is sodium acetate. Then X would be sodium metal. \n\nIf X is sodium metal (Na), then when it reacts with liquid Y (maybe water?), the reaction would be:\n\n2Na + 2H2O \u2192 2NaOH + H2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nThe gas H2 has protons 2, neutrons 0 (if regular H2), which doesn't satisfy the condition. But if the hydrogen is deuterium (D2), then protons 2, neutrons 2. So the gas would be D2. That requires that the water is D2O. But the problem says liquid Y is liquid, so maybe it's D2O. However, the problem states that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium is Na, its common isotope is Na-23. A heavier isotope would be Na-23 is the main one. So perhaps the isotope is in another element. Wait, the problem says \"incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So if X is Na metal, it's just Na, so the isotope must be part of Na. The heavier isotopes of Na are like Na-24 (used in medicine), but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a heavier isotope of hydrogen in the water? But the question specifies that X has the isotope. \n\nHmm. If X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then when reacting with water (H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas W is D2, which has protons=neutrons (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total 2 and 2). That fits. The precipitate G: in this reaction, the products are NaOH (soluble) and D2 gas. There's no precipitate. So that doesn't work. The problem mentions a precipitate forms. So this scenario may not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the liquid Y is not water but something else. Let's think of another liquid. Maybe Y is an acid, like HCl? If X is sodium, reacting with HCl would form NaCl and H2 gas. Still no precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is calcium carbide (CaC2). Reacting with water produces acetylene gas (C2H2), and Ca(OH)2 precipitate. The gas W is C2H2. Let's see protons and neutrons. Acetylene has 2 C (each 6 protons, 6 neutrons in C-12) and 2 H (protons 1 each, neutrons 0). Total protons: 12 + 2 =14. Neutrons: 12 (from C) +0 =12. Not equal. So that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think again of the gas W. The molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. Let me consider other possibilities:\n\n- Helium (He): monoatomic gas. Each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4). So each atom satisfies. The molecule is monoatomic, so yes. So gas W could be He.\n\nIf W is He, then where does it come from? Maybe the reaction releases helium gas. For example, if X contains a helium compound, but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the reaction of a borohydride with something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the reaction of a substance with water producing He is unlikely. Let me think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). When it reacts with water:\n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191\n\nThe gas W is H2 (needs to be D2 for protons=neutrons). The precipitate is Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. B would be Al2O3 (melting point ~2072\u00b0C). Not close to 277 K. \n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, then heating gives MgO (melting point 2852 K). No. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the elements in X. The question asks for the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses. The options are 25,29,31,35. Let me see possible combinations:\n\n- If the elements are H (1), and Cl (35.5), sum is ~36.5 \u2192 not an option.\n\n- If the elements are H (1) and Br (79.9), sum is ~80.9 \u2192 no.\n\n- Maybe the elements are Li (6.94), and Cl (35.5): 6.94+35.5 ~42.5 \u2192 no.\n\n- If the elements are H (1) and Mg (24.3): 25.3 \u2192 option B (25).\n\nAh! Maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH). The elements are Na (23) and H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, but option B is 25. Close. But if the H is deuterium (mass 2), then sum is 23+2=25 (option B). So that fits.\n\nLet's see if this scenario works:\n\nX is NaD (sodium deuteride). Reacts with liquid Y (water, H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 (gas W). \n\nGas W is D2: each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons 2, neutrons 2. That's good.\n\nThe products are NaOH (soluble) and D2 gas. No precipitate. Hmm, the problem states a precipitate forms. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is with another liquid. Suppose Y is an acid like H2SO4? Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4 and D2. Still no precipitate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an alcohol? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with another substance. Wait, the problem says \"reacts violently with liquid Y\", so Y must be a liquid. If the reaction produces a precipitate, perhaps the liquid Y is an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is HCl and X is sodium deuteride, then:\n\nNaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl\u2193 (precipitate?) + D2\u2191. \n\nWait, NaCl is soluble in water. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X is calcium hydride (CaH2). Reacts with water:\n\nCaH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2\u2193 (precipitate) + 2 H2\u2191 (needs to be D2).\n\nIf the H in CaH2 is deuterium, then gas is D2. Then the precipitate is Ca(OH)2. Heating Ca(OH)2 would give CaO and H2O. B is H2O, which has a melting point ~273 K. Close to 277 K (the question says very close). So that works.\n\nThe elements in X (CaH2) are Ca and H. The lightest element is H (mass 1 if H-1, or 2 if D). The problem states X incorporates a heavier isotope, so H must be deuterium (D). So the H's mass is 2. The heaviest element is Ca (40.08). Sum is 2 +40.08 =42.08, which is not among the options. Hmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if the hydride is LiH, then X is LiD. Elements are Li (6.94) and D (2). Sum is ~9. Not in options.\n\nHmm. Let me try another angle. Suppose X is an organolithium reagent, like CH3Li. The elements are C, H, Li. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12) or Li (6.94). Wait, Li is lighter than C. So heaviest is C. Sum would be 1 +12 =13. Not in options.\n\nAlternatively, if X is phenyllithium (C6H5Li), elements are C, H, Li. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is something else. Let me think of the product of the keto acid and X having two oxygen atoms. Suppose the product is an ester, like ethyl acetate (C4H8O2). So two oxygen atoms. That requires X to be an alcohol (like ethanol) in a Fischer esterification? But that's not a reagent used in organic chemistry in that way. Alternatively, maybe X is an acid anhydride?\n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent reacting with a keto acid to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction between a \u03b2-keto acid (like acetoacetic acid, which has two oxygen in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone) and a Grignard reagent. The Grignard would add to the carbonyl, forming a tertiary alcohol. The product would have one oxygen (the -OH group). Not two. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the product is a metal oxide. Suppose the keto acid reacts with a metal to form a metal salt with two oxygen atoms. For instance, if the keto acid is acetic acid and the metal is sodium, forming sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The acetate has two oxygen atoms in the COO- group. So the product has two oxygen atoms. So X is sodium metal. \n\nIn that case, the reaction of sodium with liquid Y (water) would produce NaOH, H2 gas. The gas W is H2 (needs to be D2 to have protons=neutrons). So if the sodium is part of a compound with deuterium? Wait, the problem says X is sodium metal, which doesn't have deuterium. Unless the water is D2O, but then the gas would be D2. But the problem states that X incorporates the heavier isotope. So perhaps the sodium has a heavier isotope? Sodium's main isotope is Na-23. The heavier isotope is Na-24, but that's rare. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is D2O. Then the reaction is:\n\n2Na + 2D2O \u2192 2NaOD + D2\u2191. \n\nThe gas is D2 (protons 2, neutrons 2). The precipitate? The product would be NaOD (sodium deuteroxide?), which is soluble. So no precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is something else. Let's think of another possibility.\n\nSuppose X is lithium. Reacting with water:\n\n2Li + 2H2O \u2192 2LiOH + H2\u2191.\n\nGas H2 (needs to be D2). Precipitate? No, LiOH is soluble. \n\nHmm.\n\nWait, going back to the earlier possibility where X is sodium hydride (NaH), but the reaction with water produces NaOH and H2. No precipitate. But if the liquid Y is something else, like an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is HCl, then:\n\nNaH + HCl \u2192 NaCl + H2\u2191. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate.\n\nAlternatively, if Y is a metal nitrate solution? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid that forms a precipitate with the product. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, then reacting with Na would form Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. The sum of H (1) and Na (23) would be 24, which is close to option B (25) if H is deuterium (2). So that fits. Let's see if the other conditions hold.\n\nIf X is sodium deuteride (NaD), then:\n\n- Reacts with liquid Y (maybe water, H2O):\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191.\n\nGas W is D2 (protons 2, neutrons 2).\n\nPrecipitate? No, NaOH is soluble. So this doesn't form a precipitate. So maybe Y is another liquid. Suppose Y is a solution of a salt that forms an insoluble compound. For example, if Y is a solution of MgCl2, then:\n\nNaD + MgCl2 \u2192 ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a precipitate when reacting with another substance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid like H2SO4, and the reaction produces Na2SO4 (soluble) and D2. Still no precipitate.\n\nHmm. The problem states that a precipitate forms. So perhaps the reaction is between X and another substance, like an acid that forms an insoluble salt. For instance, if X is calcium hydride (CaH2), reacting with water:\n\nCaH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2\u2193 + 2 H2\u2191 (or D2 if deuterium).\n\nThe precipitate is Ca(OH)2. Heating it would produce CaO and H2O. B is CaO (calcium oxide), which has a melting point of about 2613\u00b0C (2886 K), which is way higher than 277 K. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is magnesium hydroxide. If X is magnesium hydride (MgH2), reacting with water:\n\nMgH2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2\u2193 + 2 H2\u2191 (or D2).\n\nThen heating Mg(OH)2 gives MgO and H2O. B is MgO, which has a high melting point again. Not good.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another possibility where the precipitate's decomposition product B has a low melting point. If B is water (melting point 273 K), then the precipitate must decompose to release water. So the precipitate could be a metal hydroxide that, when heated, loses water. For example, Cu(OH)2 \u2192 CuO + H2O. Then B would be H2O. \n\nIf the reaction of X with liquid Y (water) produces Cu(OH)2 precipitate, then X must be a copper hydride? Like CuH. \n\nCuH reacting with water:\n\n2 CuH + 2 H2O \u2192 2 Cu(OH)2\u2193 + H2\u2191.\n\nThe gas is H2 (needs to be D2). So if the hydride is CuD, then gas is D2. The elements in X (CuD) are Cu and D. The lightest is D (mass 2), heaviest is Cu (63.55). Sum would be 2+63.55=65.55, not an option.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate. For example, if the reaction produces calcium carbonate:\n\nCaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2\u2191 when heated. So B would be CaO, but its melting point is too high.\n\nAlternatively, if B is carbon dioxide (CO2), but its melting point is -56.6\u00b0C (216.6 K), which is lower than 277 K.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Let me try to consider the options again. The answer choices are 25, 29, 31, 35. \n\nIf the lightest element is H (mass 1) and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), their sum is ~36.5 \u2192 closest to 35 (option A). But the problem requires that X uses a heavier isotope. If the Cl is Cl-37, then 37+1=38 \u2192 not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if the heaviest is bromine (Br-80), then 1+80=81 \u2192 no.\n\nWait another possibility: perhaps the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). The elements are Li (6.94), Al (27), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 1+27=28 \u2192 close to option D (29). If H is deuterium (mass 2), then 2+27=29 \u2192 option D. Let's see if this fits:\n\nLiAlH4 reacts with water:\n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191.\n\nGas W is H2 (needs to be D2). So if the hydride is LiAlD4, then the gas is D2. The precipitate is Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 gives Al2O3 and H2O. B would be Al2O3, which has a high melting point. Not matching the 277 K requirement.\n\nHmm. But the sum would be 2 (D) +27 (Al) =29 (option D). \n\nThe problem states that B's melting point is near 277 K. If B is H2O, then the precipitate must decompose to release it. But Al(OH)3 heating gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B is H2O. Then the melting point is ~273 K, close to 277. Maybe the question allows that approximation. \n\nIn that case, the elements in X (LiAlD4) are Li (7), Al (27), D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29 \u2192 option D. \n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check all conditions:\n\n- X incorporates a heavier isotope: the hydride uses D (heavier than H).\n\n- Gas W is D2 (protons=2, neutrons=2).\n\n- Precipitate Al(OH)3, when heated, releases H2O (B), whose melting point is ~273 K, close to 277 K.\n\n- The product of the keto acid with X (LiAlH4): when reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid), the product would be the deprotonated form, but I'm not sure about the oxygen count. Alternatively, the product might be an alcohol with one oxygen, but perhaps the product includes the lithium salt, which has oxygen from the acid. If the keto acid is, say, propanoic acid (two oxygen atoms?), wait, propanoic acid has one oxygen in the COOH group. Maybe the product is an ester with two oxygens. Not sure, but the problem states it has two oxygen atoms, so perhaps this fits.\n\nThe atomic masses: Li (6.94), Al (27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29 \u2192 option D. \n\nThis seems to fit all the given options. So the answer is D) 29.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying Substance X based on its reaction properties and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: Gas W must have equal protons and neutrons. This is satisfied by deuterium gas (D\u2082), where each deuterium atom (\u00b9H\u2082) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, making total protons = total neutrons (2 each).\n\n2. **Precipitate and B**: The precipitate G forms when Substance X reacts with liquid Y. Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (\u22484\u00b0C). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), as its melting point is 273 K. The precipitate G is likely aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083), which decomposes to Al\u2082O\u2083 and H\u2082O when heated.\n\n3. **Substance X Identification**: The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This points to an organometallic reagent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH\u2084). When LiAlH\u2084 reacts with water (liquid Y), it produces Al(OH)\u2083 (precipitate), LiOH, and D\u2082 gas (if using deuterium). The product with the keto acid would involve a reaction forming a compound with two oxygen atoms (e.g., an ester or carboxylate).\n\n4. **Isotopic Consideration**: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Here, the hydride component (H) is replaced with deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\n5. **Elemental Composition**: The elements in LiAlD\u2084 are lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and deuterium (D). The lightest element is deuterium (mass 2), and the heaviest is aluminum (mass 27). Their sum is **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. Hmm, first, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The question gives several clues.\n\nStarting with the first part: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W, which has molecules with equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Let me think about elements where the number of neutrons equals protons. For a molecule, the total protons and neutrons in the molecule should be equal? Wait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons? Or each atom in the molecule? Or maybe the molecule as a whole has the same number of total protons and neutrons?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule's atoms each have that property. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally, but deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So a molecule made of deuterium would have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, like D2? Because each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons in D2 is 2, neutrons also 2. That fits. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas (D\u2082)? But the problem says the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogen gas (H2), but regular hydrogen has no neutrons. Unless they're considering a different isotope. Wait, maybe the gas is hydrogen but with deuterium? Like if W is D2, then that would work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another element. Let's see: For an atom to have equal protons and neutrons, the mass number would be 2 times the atomic number. So for example, Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the molecule has atoms like carbon-12, but that's a bit more complex. But the gas is likely a simple one. Since the reaction produces a gas, maybe it's hydrogen. So perhaps the gas is deuterium gas. That would make sense if Substance X contains deuterium. \n\nThe problem states that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. So maybe Substance X has deuterium. \n\nNow, the reaction between X and liquid Y produces gas W (maybe D\u2082?), and a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4\u00b0C, which is close to water's melting point (273 K). Wait, 277 is 4 degrees above zero. Hmm, maybe B is water? But water's melting point is 0\u00b0C (273 K). Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. Let me think: What substance has a melting point around 277 K? 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Maybe ice? No, that's 0. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, that's much higher. Wait, maybe the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let me think again.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. If B's melting point is near that, perhaps B is ice? But that's 273 K. Close enough maybe. Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium bicarbonate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound like water. Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something like calcium carbonate, which when heated releases CO2 and calcium oxide, but then B would be CO2? But CO2's melting point is lower. Hmm.\n\nLet me look at other clues. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid has a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). For example, acetoacetate. When reacting with a reagent like something, maybe a Grignard reagent? Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds. They are used with ketones. If Substance X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX, where X is a halogen), then reacting with a keto acid would produce a product. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but maybe the reaction would form an alcohol or something. Hmm, maybe the product is a diol or something with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Grignard reagent (like RMgBr) reacts with the keto acid. The keto acid might have a structure like RC(=O)CH2COOH. When reacting with Grignard, maybe the product would have two oxygen atoms? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a magnesium salt, but the problem says the product of the reaction contains two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the organic product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the Grignard adds to the ketone, leading to a hydroxyl group? Hmm, perhaps the product would have an oxygen from the acid part and another from the Grignard? Not sure. Let's see, maybe I need to look at other clues.\n\nThe problem also mentions that Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents fit here. The analog would be the regular Grignard (without the heavy isotope). Since the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements, maybe the Grignard has deuterium instead of regular hydrogen. For example, instead of RMgBr, it's RDMgBr, where the R group has a deuterium. Or perhaps the X in the Grignard is a halogen with a heavier isotope? Wait, the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". The elements in Grignard reagent are magnesium, carbon (in R), hydrogen (if R has it), and the halogen (like Cl, Br). So maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, but the question says the gas W has same protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is part of the R group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is sodium metal, but that's probably not. Wait, the reaction with liquid Y produces gas. Sodium reacts with water (liquid) to produce H2 gas. If Y is water, then the gas W would be H2. But in that case, if X has a heavier isotope, like deuterium, then the gas would be D2, which would satisfy the proton-neutron equality. So if X is sodium deuteride (NaD) instead of NaH, then reacting with water (H2O) would produce D2 gas. Then the precipitate G would be NaOH? Wait, but NaOH is soluble. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, sodium reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. If using NaD, then maybe the reaction would produce D2 instead. The precipitate G would then be NaOH, but that's a soluble salt, so maybe not a precipitate. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) but with a heavy isotope. If the hydride uses deuterium (LiAlD4), then reacting with something might produce D2? Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction with liquid Y produces a precipitate. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. Let me think of common substances near that temperature. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Ice's melting point is 273, so maybe B is ice? But then when heated, maybe G is something that releases water when heated. Like calcium carbonate heated releases CO2, but that's not water. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydrate, like CuSO4\u00b75H2O. When heated, it loses water (B?), but then B would be water. But the melting point of water is 273, so that's close. Maybe that's the case. So if B is H2O, then when G is heated, it releases water. \n\nPutting it together: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (maybe D2?), precipitate G (which is a hydrate?), and when G is heated, it releases B (water). Then the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. \n\nIf X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, then reacting with a keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but maybe the reaction would form a product with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, the product might be an ester or something else. Alternatively, the Grignard adds to the ketone, forming a primary alcohol, and then the acid part is still there, so maybe the product would have the original oxygen from the acid and the oxygen from the Grignard's hydrolysis? Not sure. Wait, Grignard reagents react with carbonyls to form alcohols. The keto acid's structure might be such that after reaction, the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of an example: Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone acid (though that's not a real name), but perhaps acetoacetic acid (which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group). The Grignard would add to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, and then the carboxylic acid part remains. The product might have the carboxylic acid (COOH) and the alcohol (OH), so two oxygen atoms. That could work. \n\nSo if X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX), and the heavy isotope is deuterium in the R group, then the isotope is deuterium. The Grignard's formula would be RMgBr, but with D instead of H in R. So the elements in X would be Mg, the halogen (like Br), carbon, and deuterium (as part of the organic group R). \n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering isotopes. Wait, the problem says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it means that for each element present in X, we have to sum the atomic masses of all the isotopes present. But perhaps it's simpler: the elements in X, and we have to take the lightest element (like H or D, which is hydrogen), and the heaviest element (like Mg, Br, C, or the halogen?), then add their atomic masses. \n\nWait, the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". So, find the lightest element in X and its atomic mass, plus the heaviest element in X and its atomic mass. So first, identify the elements in X. \n\nAssuming X is a Grignard reagent like RMgBr, where the R group contains deuterium instead of regular hydrogen. The elements present would be: \n\n- Carbon (from the R group, assuming it's an alkyl group like CH2CH2D or similar), \n- Deuterium (which is an isotope of hydrogen), \n- Magnesium, \n- Bromine (assuming Br is the halogen). \n\nSo the elements are H (or D, which is an isotope of H), C, Mg, Br. \n\nThe lightest element is hydrogen (either H or D, but both are H isotopes). The atomic mass of deuterium is about 2, but if the question is considering the element's standard atomic mass, but since the problem mentions isotopes, maybe we have to consider the specific isotope used. Since the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\", so the H in X is deuterium (D, mass 2), but the other elements (C, Mg, Br) are in their regular isotopes. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The lightest element is hydrogen (as D is still H), so its atomic mass is 2 (since it's deuterium). The heaviest element would be bromine (Br), which has an atomic mass around 80. But wait, maybe the heaviest is another element? Let's see: \n\nCarbon is 12, Mg is 24, Br is ~80. So Br is the heaviest. \n\nSo adding the lightest (H as D, 2) and the heaviest (Br, ~80) gives 82. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance isn't a Grignard reagent. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is sodium hydride (NaH) but with deuterium (NaD). Then reacting with liquid Y (like water), it would produce D2 gas. The precipitate might not form, but maybe with another liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When reacting with water (liquid Y), it might produce D2 gas and LiAl(OH)4, which might be soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid. For example, if X is sodium, reacting with water produces H2 (or D2 if using D2O?), but again, the precipitate part is unclear. \n\nWait the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y, and when heated it releases B. Let me think of a reaction that forms a precipitate. For example, if Y is an alcohol and X is a Grignard reagent, then the reaction might form an alkoxide which is soluble, but maybe with another reactant? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. Like sodium reacting with water (H2O) produces NaOH and H2. The NaOH is soluble, so not a precipitate. But if the liquid Y is something else. \n\nWait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a salt. For example, if X is a Grignard reagent (RMgBr) reacting with a solution of a halide, but that might not form a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a borohydride (like NaBH4 with a heavier isotope) and something else. Not sure. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Let's think of that part. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in its structure: one in the ketone and two in the carboxylic acid?), wait no. Acetoacetic acid has structure CH3COCH2COOH. The carbonyl (C=O) and the carboxylic acid (COOH) each have oxygen. So total three oxygen atoms. If reacting with Grignard, the Grignard would add to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid would remain. So the product would have the COOH group (two oxygens?) Wait, the carboxylic acid has two oxygens (COOH has two O: one in the carbonyl and one in the hydroxyl?), so maybe three? Hmm, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the reaction removes some oxygen? Or maybe the keto acid has two oxygen atoms to begin with. Let me think of another keto acid. For example, acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione) has two ketone groups, so two oxygen atoms. If that's the keto acid, then reacting with Grignard would form a product. The Grignard adds to the ketone, so the product would have a hydroxyl group but still the other ketone? Or maybe it's a different structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a diol or something with two oxygen atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is an ester formed from the acid and the Grignard? Not sure. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's try another angle. \n\nThe question mentions that the substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are common, so that's a good candidate. \n\nIf X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium (like RMgD), then the elements in X are R (which includes C and D), Mg, and the halogen (like Br). So the elements present are H (as deuterium), C, Mg, and Br. \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2 for D), the heaviest is Br (atomic mass ~79.9). Adding those gives 2 + 79.9 \u2248 81.9. But none of the options are close to that. The options are 35,25,31,29. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the heavier isotope is not in the R group but in the halogen part. For example, if the halogen is Br-81 instead of Br-80? But the problem states the heavier isotope of one of the constituent elements. The halogen (like Br) has heavier isotopes, but the question says the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas W is hydrogen (H2), but with regular hydrogen. Then the substance X doesn't have deuterium. Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas W is something else. Let me think again. The gas's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of a molecule where total protons = total neutrons. For example, CH4: each C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Total protons: 6 + 4 =10. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 0 =6. Not equal. \n\nAnother example: N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). Total protons:14, neutrons:14. So N2 would fit. So gas W could be N2. But how would that form in a reaction? Maybe if X is something reacting with a nitride? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the gas could be CO. Let's see: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). Total protons: 14, neutrons:14. So CO would work. But how would that form? Maybe from a reaction involving carbon and oxygen. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is deuterium (D2) as before. \n\nWait, let's try to think of the elements in X again. If the product with the keto acid has two oxygen atoms, perhaps the reagent X has oxygen? For example, if X is a borohydride (NaBH4), then the elements are Na, B, H. But borohydrides are used in organic synthesis. The analog would be the non-deuterated version. If the heavier isotope is deuterium in the hydride, then H is replaced with D. So elements in X: Na, B, D. The lightest is H (mass 2), heaviest is Na (23). 2+23=25. Option B is 25. That could be possible. \n\nWait, borohydrides are used as reducing agents. The reaction with a keto acid might produce something with two oxygen atoms. Let me see: For example, if the keto acid is something like benzophenone (a ketone), but the question specifies a keto acid. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid. The reaction with NaBD4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but the acid part would remain. The product would have the COOH group, which has two oxygen atoms (COOH has two oxygens?), so maybe that's where the two oxygens come from. \n\nThen, the elements in X (NaBD4) are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest element is deuterium (H, mass 2), the heaviest is sodium (23). 2 +23 =25, which is option B. That seems to fit. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If the keto acid has, say, three oxygen atoms (like in acetoacetic acid: COOH has two, plus the ketone's O?), then the product after reduction would still have the COOH, so two oxygens. That works. \n\nAlso, the reaction between NaBD4 and water (liquid Y) would produce D2 gas (since NaBH4 reacts with water to produce H2). The precipitate G would be NaOD (if using D), but sodium hydroxide is soluble. Hmm, but maybe the liquid isn't water. Alternatively, if the reaction is with an acid, like HCl, then maybe a precipitate forms. Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is something else. \n\nAlternatively, when NaBD4 reacts with water, the products are NaOD and D2 gas. But NaOD is soluble, so no precipitate. That contradicts the precipitate G. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between borohydride and an ester or something else. Wait, the problem says the reaction with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Let's think again. \n\nIf X is NaBD4, reacting with liquid Y (maybe an acid like H2SO4?), the reaction might produce H2 (or D2?), but not sure about the precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an aqueous solution of a metal salt. For example, if Y is an aqueous solution of AgNO3, then the reaction might produce Ag metal as a precipitate. But then the gas would be something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is something like an alcohol, and the reaction produces D2 gas and a borate salt. Still unclear. \n\nBut the key point is that if the answer is 25 (option B), then the elements would be Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Na (23). 2+23=25. That's option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) with deuterium. Then the elements would be Li (7), Al (27), H (or D). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). 2+27=29 (option D). \n\nWait, that's another possibility. Let's see: LiAlD4. The product with a keto acid would form an alcohol and the acid part. The product would have two oxygen atoms. The reaction with liquid Y (maybe water) would produce D2 gas. The precipitate G might be LiAl(OH)4? But that's soluble. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, when LiAlH4 reacts with water, it produces H2 (or D2 if deuterated) and LiAl(OH)4, which might not precipitate. So perhaps that's not right. \n\nWait, the problem states that the precipitate forms when X reacts with Y. If the reaction produces a salt that is insoluble, maybe the Y is a solution of a metal salt. For example, if Y is an aqueous solution of AgNO3, then the reaction between LiAlH4 and AgNO3 might produce Ag metal as a precipitate. But the gas would then be D2. \n\nIn that case, the elements in X (LiAlD4) are Li (7), Al (27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). 2+27=29, which is option D. \n\nThe product with the keto acid: LiAlH4 is a reducing agent. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid), it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid. The product would have the COOH group (two oxygen atoms?), so that matches the two oxygen atoms. \n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The precipitate might be something like silver metal (from reacting with AgNO3), but when heated, it wouldn't release anything. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a borohydride product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases water (B). The melting point of water is 273 K, close to 277 K. But the problem says B's melting point is very close to 277 K. 273 is close, maybe acceptable. \n\nSo if B is water, then heating Al(OH)3 would decompose to Al2O3 and H2O. But the precipitate G would be Al(OH)3. When heated, it releases water (B), which has a melting point near 273 K. The question says 277, which is 4\u00b0C higher, but maybe that's considered close enough. \n\nIf that's the case, then the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (or H). The heaviest is Al (27), lightest D (2). 27+2=29 (option D). \n\nAlternatively, the substance X could be LiAlD4, so the answer would be D) 29. \n\nAlternatively, if X is sodium borohydride (NaBD4), then the heaviest element is Na (23), lightest D (2), totaling 25 (B). \n\nHmm, now I'm confused between options B and D. \n\nLet me check the other clues again. The product of the reaction with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4: the reaction with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid. The product would have the COOH group (which has two oxygen atoms: the carbonyl O and the hydroxyl O?), so that's two oxygens. So that works. \n\nThe precipitate G when heated releases B (which is water, melting point 273K). The problem says B's melting point is very close to 277K. 273 is 4K less, but maybe the question rounds or allows that as \"very close\". \n\nThe substance X (LiAlD4) would have elements Li (7), Al (27), D (2), and maybe the boron isn't there. Wait, LiAlH4 is lithium aluminum hydride. Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. LiAlH4 is lithium aluminum hydride. The elements are Li, Al, H. So if the hydride is deuterated, it's LiAlD4. The elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), D (2). \n\nSo the lightest is D (2), heaviest Al (27). Sum is 29, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the hydride is sodium borohydride (NaBD4), then the elements are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Na (23), sum 25 (option B). \n\nWhich one is more likely? \n\nThe question mentions \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". The analog would be the non-deuterated version. LiAlH4 is a common reagent, and its deuterated version might be used in some cases. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is also a common reducing agent. \n\nThe reaction with the keto acid: LiAlH4 is more powerful, it reduces ketones to alcohols. Sodium borohydride is milder. Both could work, but the product having two oxygen atoms would fit either way. \n\nThe precipitate part: If using LiAlH4 with water, the products are LiAl(OH)4 and H2. LiAl(OH)4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, maybe the liquid Y isn't water. Suppose Y is an aqueous solution of a metal salt, like AgNO3. Then the reaction between LiAlH4 and AgNO3 would produce Ag metal (precipitate), LiNO3, Al(OH)3, and D2 (if deuterated). The precipitate G would be Ag and Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 would release water (B). \n\nAlternatively, the precipitate could be Al(OH)3, which when heated decomposes to Al2O3 and water. \n\nIn that case, the reaction with Y (maybe an acid) produces the precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, the liquid Y is an alcohol, but that might not form a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between the hydride and an acid like HCl, producing a chloride precipitate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is the metal from the hydride itself. For example, if X is AlH3, but that's unstable. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's see the options again. \n\nIf LiAlH4 is the substance, then the sum is 29 (D). \n\nIf NaBH4, then 25 (B). \n\nThe question mentions that the product of the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. If using NaBH4, the product would have the COOH group (two O), so that works. \n\nThe reaction of NaBD4 with water would produce NaOD and D2 gas. The precipitate G would require another component. Maybe the liquid Y is something like an aqueous solution of FeCl3. Then the reaction of NaBD4 with FeCl3 would produce Fe metal (precipitate?), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the liquid Y is an acid like H2SO4, and the reaction produces H2 (or D2) and a sulfate salt. The precipitate might not form. \n\nHmm. The key point might be the melting point of B being near 277 K. If B is water, then 273 is close enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is something else. Let's think of another substance. The melting point of ethanol is around 159 K? No, that's way lower. Methanol is 175 K. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is solid D2O (heavy water). Its melting point is 276 K, which is very close to 277 K. Oh! Wait, heavy water (D2O) has a melting point of 276 K. That's exactly near 277 K. So if B is D2O, then the melting point matches. \n\nHow would that happen? If the precipitate G, when heated, releases D2O. Let's see: Suppose the reaction between X (NaBD4) and Y (water) produces NaOD and D2 gas, and maybe a precipitate like a borate? Not sure. Alternatively, if the precipitate is something like Mg(OH)2, but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces NaOD and D2, but the precipitate is perhaps a borohydride compound. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal salt, like MgCl2, then the reaction of NaBD4 with MgCl2 would produce Mg(OH)2 precipitate and NaCl. When heated, Mg(OH)2 decomposes to MgO and H2O (but that's regular water, not D2O). Wait, but if the hydroxide is made with D from NaBD4, then it would be Mg(OD)2. Heating that would release D2O, which has a melting point of ~276K. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo, if X is NaBD4, reacting with Y (maybe MgCl2 solution), the reaction would produce Mg(OD)2 (precipitate), NaCl, and D2 gas. \n\nThe precipitate G is Mg(OD)2. When heated, it decomposes to MgO and D2O (which is B). The melting point of D2O is 276 K, very close to 277 K. \n\nThat fits perfectly. \n\nTherefore, Substance X is sodium deuteride borate? Or more accurately, sodium borohydride with deuterium (NaBD4). \n\nThe elements in X are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 2+23=25. That's option B. \n\nThis seems to fit all clues: \n\n- Gas W is D2 (protons=2, neutrons=2*1 (since D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so each D has equal protons and neutrons. The molecule D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons total? Wait, each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons in D2 is 2, neutrons also 2. So yes, the gas fits. \n\n- The precipitate G is Mg(OD)2, which when heated releases D2O (B), which has a melting point of 276 K (close to 277 K). \n\n- The product with the keto acid: NaBD4 reduces the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid part, which has two oxygen atoms. \n\nSo the answer should be B)25. \n\nWait but earlier I considered LiAlH4 giving 29. But with this reasoning for NaBD4, it's 25. \n\nAnother point: The question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If the keto acid has, say, three oxygen atoms (like in acetoacetic acid: COOH has two, plus the ketone O?), then the product after reduction would still have the COOH group, which has two oxygen atoms. So that matches. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)25.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question requires identifying Substance X based on several clues. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (D\u2082) fits, as each deuterium atom (\u00b9\u00b2H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. This implies Substance X contains deuterium.\n\n2. **Precipitate G and B**: Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. D\u2082O (melting point ~276 K) fits, indicating B is D\u2082O. The precipitate G must be a deuteride compound, such as Mg(OD)\u2082, formed when X reacts with a metal salt (e.g., MgCl\u2082).\n\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has 2 oxygen atoms.

The lightest element is deuterium (2), and the heaviest is sodium (23). Their sum is **25**.\n\nAnswer: B) 25.\n\nAnswer: B",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. Hmm, first, I need to figure out what Substance X is. The question gives several clues.\n\nStarting with the first part: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W, which has molecules with equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Let me think about elements where the number of neutrons equals protons. For a molecule, the total protons and neutrons in the molecule should be equal? Wait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons? Or each atom in the molecule? Or maybe the molecule as a whole has the same number of total protons and neutrons?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule's atoms each have that property. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons normally, but deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So a molecule made of deuterium would have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, like D2? Because each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons in D2 is 2, neutrons also 2. That fits. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas (D\u2082)? But the problem says the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogen gas (H2), but regular hydrogen has no neutrons. Unless they're considering a different isotope. Wait, maybe the gas is hydrogen but with deuterium? Like if W is D2, then that would work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another element. Let's see: For an atom to have equal protons and neutrons, the mass number would be 2 times the atomic number. So for example, Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the molecule has atoms like carbon-12, but that's a bit more complex. But the gas is likely a simple one. Since the reaction produces a gas, maybe it's hydrogen. So perhaps the gas is deuterium gas. That would make sense if Substance X contains deuterium. \n\nThe problem states that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. Deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. So maybe Substance X has deuterium. \n\nNow, the reaction between X and liquid Y produces gas W (maybe D\u2082?), and a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4\u00b0C, which is close to water's melting point (273 K). Wait, 277 is 4 degrees above zero. Hmm, maybe B is water? But water's melting point is 0\u00b0C (273 K). Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. Let me think: What substance has a melting point around 277 K? 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Maybe ice? No, that's 0. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium chloride? No, that's much higher. Wait, maybe the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let me think again.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. If B's melting point is near that, perhaps B is ice? But that's 273 K. Close enough maybe. Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium bicarbonate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound like water. Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something like calcium carbonate, which when heated releases CO2 and calcium oxide, but then B would be CO2? But CO2's melting point is lower. Hmm.\n\nLet me look at other clues. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. A keto acid has a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). For example, acetoacetate. When reacting with a reagent like something, maybe a Grignard reagent? Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds. They are used with ketones. If Substance X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX, where X is a halogen), then reacting with a keto acid would produce a product. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but maybe the reaction would form an alcohol or something. Hmm, maybe the product is a diol or something with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Grignard reagent (like RMgBr) reacts with the keto acid. The keto acid might have a structure like RC(=O)CH2COOH. When reacting with Grignard, maybe the product would have two oxygen atoms? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a magnesium salt, but the problem says the product of the reaction contains two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the organic product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the Grignard adds to the ketone, leading to a hydroxyl group? Hmm, perhaps the product would have an oxygen from the acid part and another from the Grignard? Not sure. Let's see, maybe I need to look at other clues.\n\nThe problem also mentions that Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents fit here. The analog would be the regular Grignard (without the heavy isotope). Since the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements, maybe the Grignard has deuterium instead of regular hydrogen. For example, instead of RMgBr, it's RDMgBr, where the R group has a deuterium. Or perhaps the X in the Grignard is a halogen with a heavier isotope? Wait, the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". The elements in Grignard reagent are magnesium, carbon (in R), hydrogen (if R has it), and the halogen (like Cl, Br). So maybe the halogen is a heavier isotope, but the question says the gas W has same protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is part of the R group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is sodium metal, but that's probably not. Wait, the reaction with liquid Y produces gas. Sodium reacts with water (liquid) to produce H2 gas. If Y is water, then the gas W would be H2. But in that case, if X has a heavier isotope, like deuterium, then the gas would be D2, which would satisfy the proton-neutron equality. So if X is sodium deuteride (NaD) instead of NaH, then reacting with water (H2O) would produce D2 gas. Then the precipitate G would be NaOH? Wait, but NaOH is soluble. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Wait, sodium reacts with water to form NaOH and H2. If using NaD, then maybe the reaction would produce D2 instead. The precipitate G would then be NaOH, but that's a soluble salt, so maybe not a precipitate. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) but with a heavy isotope. If the hydride uses deuterium (LiAlD4), then reacting with something might produce D2? Not sure. Alternatively, the reaction with liquid Y produces a precipitate. Let me think of another approach.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. Let me think of common substances near that temperature. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Ice's melting point is 273, so maybe B is ice? But then when heated, maybe G is something that releases water when heated. Like calcium carbonate heated releases CO2, but that's not water. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydrate, like CuSO4\u00b75H2O. When heated, it loses water (B?), but then B would be water. But the melting point of water is 273, so that's close. Maybe that's the case. So if B is H2O, then when G is heated, it releases water. \n\nPutting it together: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (maybe D2?), precipitate G (which is a hydrate?), and when G is heated, it releases B (water). Then the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. \n\nIf X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, then reacting with a keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but maybe the reaction would form a product with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, the product might be an ester or something else. Alternatively, the Grignard adds to the ketone, forming a primary alcohol, and then the acid part is still there, so maybe the product would have the original oxygen from the acid and the oxygen from the Grignard's hydrolysis? Not sure. Wait, Grignard reagents react with carbonyls to form alcohols. The keto acid's structure might be such that after reaction, the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of an example: Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone acid (though that's not a real name), but perhaps acetoacetic acid (which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group). The Grignard would add to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, and then the carboxylic acid part remains. The product might have the carboxylic acid (COOH) and the alcohol (OH), so two oxygen atoms. That could work. \n\nSo if X is a Grignard reagent (like RMgX), and the heavy isotope is deuterium in the R group, then the isotope is deuterium. The Grignard's formula would be RMgBr, but with D instead of H in R. So the elements in X would be Mg, the halogen (like Br), carbon, and deuterium (as part of the organic group R). \n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X, considering isotopes. Wait, the problem says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it means that for each element present in X, we have to sum the atomic masses of all the isotopes present. But perhaps it's simpler: the elements in X, and we have to take the lightest element (like H or D, which is hydrogen), and the heaviest element (like Mg, Br, C, or the halogen?), then add their atomic masses. \n\nWait, the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". So, find the lightest element in X and its atomic mass, plus the heaviest element in X and its atomic mass. So first, identify the elements in X. \n\nAssuming X is a Grignard reagent like RMgBr, where the R group contains deuterium instead of regular hydrogen. The elements present would be: \n\n- Carbon (from the R group, assuming it's an alkyl group like CH2CH2D or similar), \n- Deuterium (which is an isotope of hydrogen), \n- Magnesium, \n- Bromine (assuming Br is the halogen). \n\nSo the elements are H (or D, which is an isotope of H), C, Mg, Br. \n\nThe lightest element is hydrogen (either H or D, but both are H isotopes). The atomic mass of deuterium is about 2, but if the question is considering the element's standard atomic mass, but since the problem mentions isotopes, maybe we have to consider the specific isotope used. Since the problem says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\", so the H in X is deuterium (D, mass 2), but the other elements (C, Mg, Br) are in their regular isotopes. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The lightest element is hydrogen (as D is still H), so its atomic mass is 2 (since it's deuterium). The heaviest element would be bromine (Br), which has an atomic mass around 80. But wait, maybe the heaviest is another element? Let's see: \n\nCarbon is 12, Mg is 24, Br is ~80. So Br is the heaviest. \n\nSo adding the lightest (H as D, 2) and the heaviest (Br, ~80) gives 82. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance isn't a Grignard reagent. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Substance X is sodium hydride (NaH) but with deuterium (NaD). Then reacting with liquid Y (like water), it would produce D2 gas. The precipitate might not form, but maybe with another liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When reacting with water (liquid Y), it might produce D2 gas and LiAl(OH)4, which might be soluble. Hmm, not a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is an acid. For example, if X is sodium, reacting with water produces H2 (or D2 if using D2O?), but again, the precipitate part is unclear. \n\nWait the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y, and when heated it releases B. Let me think of a reaction that forms a precipitate. For example, if Y is an alcohol and X is a Grignard reagent, then the reaction might form an alkoxide which is soluble, but maybe with another reactant? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. Like sodium reacting with water (H2O) produces NaOH and H2. The NaOH is soluble, so not a precipitate. But if the liquid Y is something else. \n\nWait, perhaps Y is a solution containing a salt. For example, if X is a Grignard reagent (RMgBr) reacting with a solution of a halide, but that might not form a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a borohydride (like NaBH4 with a heavier isotope) and something else. Not sure. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Let's think of that part. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in its structure: one in the ketone and two in the carboxylic acid?), wait no. Acetoacetic acid has structure CH3COCH2COOH. The carbonyl (C=O) and the carboxylic acid (COOH) each have oxygen. So total three oxygen atoms. If reacting with Grignard, the Grignard would add to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid would remain. So the product would have the COOH group (two oxygens?) Wait, the carboxylic acid has two oxygens (COOH has two O: one in the carbonyl and one in the hydroxyl?), so maybe three? Hmm, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the reaction removes some oxygen? Or maybe the keto acid has two oxygen atoms to begin with. Let me think of another keto acid. For example, acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione) has two ketone groups, so two oxygen atoms. If that's the keto acid, then reacting with Grignard would form a product. The Grignard adds to the ketone, so the product would have a hydroxyl group but still the other ketone? Or maybe it's a different structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a diol or something with two oxygen atoms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is an ester formed from the acid and the Grignard? Not sure. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's try another angle. \n\nThe question mentions that the substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are common, so that's a good candidate. \n\nIf X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium (like RMgD), then the elements in X are R (which includes C and D), Mg, and the halogen (like Br). So the elements present are H (as deuterium), C, Mg, and Br. \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2 for D), the heaviest is Br (atomic mass ~79.9). Adding those gives 2 + 79.9 \u2248 81.9. But none of the options are close to that. The options are 35,25,31,29. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, perhaps the heavier isotope is not in the R group but in the halogen part. For example, if the halogen is Br-81 instead of Br-80? But the problem states the heavier isotope of one of the constituent elements. The halogen (like Br) has heavier isotopes, but the question says the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas W is hydrogen (H2), but with regular hydrogen. Then the substance X doesn't have deuterium. Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas W is something else. Let me think again. The gas's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of a molecule where total protons = total neutrons. For example, CH4: each C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Total protons: 6 + 4 =10. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 0 =6. Not equal. \n\nAnother example: N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). Total protons:14, neutrons:14. So N2 would fit. So gas W could be N2. But how would that form in a reaction? Maybe if X is something reacting with a nitride? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the gas could be CO. Let's see: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). Total protons: 14, neutrons:14. So CO would work. But how would that form? Maybe from a reaction involving carbon and oxygen. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is deuterium (D2) as before. \n\nWait, let's try to think of the elements in X again. If the product with the keto acid has two oxygen atoms, perhaps the reagent X has oxygen? For example, if X is a borohydride (NaBH4), then the elements are Na, B, H. But borohydrides are used in organic synthesis. The analog would be the non-deuterated version. If the heavier isotope is deuterium in the hydride, then H is replaced with D. So elements in X: Na, B, D. The lightest is H (mass 2), heaviest is Na (23). 2+23=25. Option B is 25. That could be possible. \n\nWait, borohydrides are used as reducing agents. The reaction with a keto acid might produce something with two oxygen atoms. Let me see: For example, if the keto acid is something like benzophenone (a ketone), but the question specifies a keto acid. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid. The reaction with NaBD4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but the acid part would remain. The product would have the COOH group, which has two oxygen atoms (COOH has two oxygens?), so maybe that's where the two oxygens come from. \n\nThen, the elements in X (NaBD4) are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest element is deuterium (H, mass 2), the heaviest is sodium (23). 2 +23 =25, which is option B. That seems to fit. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If the keto acid has, say, three oxygen atoms (like in acetoacetic acid: COOH has two, plus the ketone's O?), then the product after reduction would still have the COOH, so two oxygens. That works. \n\nAlso, the reaction between NaBD4 and water (liquid Y) would produce D2 gas (since NaBH4 reacts with water to produce H2). The precipitate G would be NaOD (if using D), but sodium hydroxide is soluble. Hmm, but maybe the liquid isn't water. Alternatively, if the reaction is with an acid, like HCl, then maybe a precipitate forms. Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is something else. \n\nAlternatively, when NaBD4 reacts with water, the products are NaOD and D2 gas. But NaOD is soluble, so no precipitate. That contradicts the precipitate G. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between borohydride and an ester or something else. Wait, the problem says the reaction with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Let's think again. \n\nIf X is NaBD4, reacting with liquid Y (maybe an acid like H2SO4?), the reaction might produce H2 (or D2?), but not sure about the precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an aqueous solution of a metal salt. For example, if Y is an aqueous solution of AgNO3, then the reaction might produce Ag metal as a precipitate. But then the gas would be something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is something like an alcohol, and the reaction produces D2 gas and a borate salt. Still unclear. \n\nBut the key point is that if the answer is 25 (option B), then the elements would be Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Na (23). 2+23=25. That's option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) with deuterium. Then the elements would be Li (7), Al (27), H (or D). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). 2+27=29 (option D). \n\nWait, that's another possibility. Let's see: LiAlD4. The product with a keto acid would form an alcohol and the acid part. The product would have two oxygen atoms. The reaction with liquid Y (maybe water) would produce D2 gas. The precipitate G might be LiAl(OH)4? But that's soluble. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, when LiAlH4 reacts with water, it produces H2 (or D2 if deuterated) and LiAl(OH)4, which might not precipitate. So perhaps that's not right. \n\nWait, the problem states that the precipitate forms when X reacts with Y. If the reaction produces a salt that is insoluble, maybe the Y is a solution of a metal salt. For example, if Y is an aqueous solution of AgNO3, then the reaction between LiAlH4 and AgNO3 might produce Ag metal as a precipitate. But the gas would then be D2. \n\nIn that case, the elements in X (LiAlD4) are Li (7), Al (27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). 2+27=29, which is option D. \n\nThe product with the keto acid: LiAlH4 is a reducing agent. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid), it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid. The product would have the COOH group (two oxygen atoms?), so that matches the two oxygen atoms. \n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The precipitate might be something like silver metal (from reacting with AgNO3), but when heated, it wouldn't release anything. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a borohydride product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases water (B). The melting point of water is 273 K, close to 277 K. But the problem says B's melting point is very close to 277 K. 273 is close, maybe acceptable. \n\nSo if B is water, then heating Al(OH)3 would decompose to Al2O3 and H2O. But the precipitate G would be Al(OH)3. When heated, it releases water (B), which has a melting point near 273 K. The question says 277, which is 4\u00b0C higher, but maybe that's considered close enough. \n\nIf that's the case, then the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (or H). The heaviest is Al (27), lightest D (2). 27+2=29 (option D). \n\nAlternatively, the substance X could be LiAlD4, so the answer would be D) 29. \n\nAlternatively, if X is sodium borohydride (NaBD4), then the heaviest element is Na (23), lightest D (2), totaling 25 (B). \n\nHmm, now I'm confused between options B and D. \n\nLet me check the other clues again. The product of the reaction with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4: the reaction with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid. The product would have the COOH group (which has two oxygen atoms: the carbonyl O and the hydroxyl O?), so that's two oxygens. So that works. \n\nThe precipitate G when heated releases B (which is water, melting point 273K). The problem says B's melting point is very close to 277K. 273 is 4K less, but maybe the question rounds or allows that as \"very close\". \n\nThe substance X (LiAlD4) would have elements Li (7), Al (27), D (2), and maybe the boron isn't there. Wait, LiAlH4 is lithium aluminum hydride. Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. LiAlH4 is lithium aluminum hydride. The elements are Li, Al, H. So if the hydride is deuterated, it's LiAlD4. The elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), D (2). \n\nSo the lightest is D (2), heaviest Al (27). Sum is 29, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the hydride is sodium borohydride (NaBD4), then the elements are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Na (23), sum 25 (option B). \n\nWhich one is more likely? \n\nThe question mentions \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". The analog would be the non-deuterated version. LiAlH4 is a common reagent, and its deuterated version might be used in some cases. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is also a common reducing agent. \n\nThe reaction with the keto acid: LiAlH4 is more powerful, it reduces ketones to alcohols. Sodium borohydride is milder. Both could work, but the product having two oxygen atoms would fit either way. \n\nThe precipitate part: If using LiAlH4 with water, the products are LiAl(OH)4 and H2. LiAl(OH)4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, maybe the liquid Y isn't water. Suppose Y is an aqueous solution of a metal salt, like AgNO3. Then the reaction between LiAlH4 and AgNO3 would produce Ag metal (precipitate), LiNO3, Al(OH)3, and D2 (if deuterated). The precipitate G would be Ag and Al(OH)3. Heating Al(OH)3 would release water (B). \n\nAlternatively, the precipitate could be Al(OH)3, which when heated decomposes to Al2O3 and water. \n\nIn that case, the reaction with Y (maybe an acid) produces the precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, the liquid Y is an alcohol, but that might not form a precipitate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between the hydride and an acid like HCl, producing a chloride precipitate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is the metal from the hydride itself. For example, if X is AlH3, but that's unstable. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's see the options again. \n\nIf LiAlH4 is the substance, then the sum is 29 (D). \n\nIf NaBH4, then 25 (B). \n\nThe question mentions that the product of the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. If using NaBH4, the product would have the COOH group (two O), so that works. \n\nThe reaction of NaBD4 with water would produce NaOD and D2 gas. The precipitate G would require another component. Maybe the liquid Y is something like an aqueous solution of FeCl3. Then the reaction of NaBD4 with FeCl3 would produce Fe metal (precipitate?), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the liquid Y is an acid like H2SO4, and the reaction produces H2 (or D2) and a sulfate salt. The precipitate might not form. \n\nHmm. The key point might be the melting point of B being near 277 K. If B is water, then 273 is close enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is something else. Let's think of another substance. The melting point of ethanol is around 159 K? No, that's way lower. Methanol is 175 K. Not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is solid D2O (heavy water). Its melting point is 276 K, which is very close to 277 K. Oh! Wait, heavy water (D2O) has a melting point of 276 K. That's exactly near 277 K. So if B is D2O, then the melting point matches. \n\nHow would that happen? If the precipitate G, when heated, releases D2O. Let's see: Suppose the reaction between X (NaBD4) and Y (water) produces NaOD and D2 gas, and maybe a precipitate like a borate? Not sure. Alternatively, if the precipitate is something like Mg(OH)2, but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction produces NaOD and D2, but the precipitate is perhaps a borohydride compound. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal salt, like MgCl2, then the reaction of NaBD4 with MgCl2 would produce Mg(OH)2 precipitate and NaCl. When heated, Mg(OH)2 decomposes to MgO and H2O (but that's regular water, not D2O). Wait, but if the hydroxide is made with D from NaBD4, then it would be Mg(OD)2. Heating that would release D2O, which has a melting point of ~276K. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo, if X is NaBD4, reacting with Y (maybe MgCl2 solution), the reaction would produce Mg(OD)2 (precipitate), NaCl, and D2 gas. \n\nThe precipitate G is Mg(OD)2. When heated, it decomposes to MgO and D2O (which is B). The melting point of D2O is 276 K, very close to 277 K. \n\nThat fits perfectly. \n\nTherefore, Substance X is sodium deuteride borate? Or more accurately, sodium borohydride with deuterium (NaBD4). \n\nThe elements in X are Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 2+23=25. That's option B. \n\nThis seems to fit all clues: \n\n- Gas W is D2 (protons=2, neutrons=2*1 (since D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so each D has equal protons and neutrons. The molecule D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons total? Wait, each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons in D2 is 2, neutrons also 2. So yes, the gas fits. \n\n- The precipitate G is Mg(OD)2, which when heated releases D2O (B), which has a melting point of 276 K (close to 277 K). \n\n- The product with the keto acid: NaBD4 reduces the ketone to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid part, which has two oxygen atoms. \n\nSo the answer should be B)25. \n\nWait but earlier I considered LiAlH4 giving 29. But with this reasoning for NaBD4, it's 25. \n\nAnother point: The question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". If the keto acid has, say, three oxygen atoms (like in acetoacetic acid: COOH has two, plus the ketone O?), then the product after reduction would still have the COOH group, which has two oxygen atoms. So that matches. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)25.\n\n\nThe question requires identifying Substance X based on several clues. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (D\u2082) fits, as each deuterium atom (\u00b9\u00b2H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. This implies Substance X contains deuterium.\n\n2. **Precipitate G and B**: Heating G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. D\u2082O (melting point ~276 K) fits, indicating B is D\u2082O. The precipitate G must be a deuteride compound, such as Mg(OD)\u2082, formed when X reacts with a metal salt (e.g., MgCl\u2082).\n\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has 2 oxygen atoms. Sodium borohydride (NaBD\u2084, with deuterium) reduces a keto acid, leaving the carboxylic acid group (two oxygen atoms).\n\n4. **Elements in X**: Sodium borohydride (NaBD\u2084) contains Na (23), B (11), and D (2). The lightest element is deuterium (2), and the heaviest is sodium (23). Their sum is **25**.\n\nAnswer: B) 25.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Substance X and then calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n\nLet me start by figuring out what B is. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Converting that to Celsius: 277 - 273 = 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing, so maybe it's water? Wait, water's melting point is 0\u00b0C, so maybe B is a different substance. Alternatively, maybe it's sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH's melting point is around 318\u00b0C. Wait, maybe it's something like ammonium chloride? Let me think. Wait, 277 K is 4\u00b0C, so maybe the substance B is something that melts around that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps it's dry ice (solid CO2) but that sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLooking at the reaction products: the gas W has molecules with equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Since the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, the atomic number (protons) plus neutrons would be twice the protons. The simplest case is a molecule like H2, but hydrogen's proton is 1, neutron 0 in the most common isotope. Wait, but the question says the gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's see. Let's consider possible gases. Let's see, for each atom in the molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons must be even? Wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. For example, if it's hydrogen gas (H2), each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2, neutrons:0. Not equal. If it's deuterium (D2), each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons 2, neutrons 2. That would fit. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas? But the question says Substance X uses a heavier isotope, which might be deuterium. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be methane (CH4), but let's see. Each carbon has 6 protons and maybe 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. The total protons would be 6 +4=10. Neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 0 (from H) =6. Not equal. Hmm. Another possibility: nitrogen gas (N2). Each N has 7 protons. The most common isotope is N-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons). So each atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule N2 would have total protons 14 and neutrons 14. That fits! So gas W could be N2. That would mean the reaction produces nitrogen gas. Alternatively, maybe oxygen? O2 would have protons 16, neutrons 16 (if O-16, which has 8 neutrons each). So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that also fits. So gas W could be either O2 or N2, but let's see other clues.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So heating G gives B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Let me think of possible B's. If B is a metal oxide? Or maybe a carbonate? Let's see. If G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2. The melting point of CO2 is solid at low temps, but its melting point is about 217 K, which is too low. Alternatively, maybe B is water. Wait, but water's melting point is 273.15 K. Close to 277? Well, 277 is 4 degrees C, which is just above freezing. Maybe B is water. Then, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating it would release water. But then the gas W would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O, but that's a liquid or gas, but the problem says gas W. Hmm, perhaps the gas is O2, then B would be something else. Alternatively, if the gas is N2, perhaps the precipitate is something like ammonium carbonate, but that would release NH3 on heating. Not sure. Maybe I need to think of the reaction between X and Y.\n\nThe question mentions that Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents (organomagnesium halides), organolithium compounds, or maybe alkyl lithiums. Alternatively, perhaps sodium hydride (NaH) or something else. But the key point is that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is sodium hydride (NaH), but then the heavier isotope might be deuterium (D instead of H). Alternatively, Grignard reagents are RMgX, where X is Cl, Br, I. The heavier isotope could be in the magnesium? Probably not. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen in the reagent is deuterium. So perhaps the substance X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD?\n\nThe product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about Grignard reactions. A keto acid reacting with Grignard would form a tertiary alcohol or something, but maybe when it's a keto acid (like, say, acetoacetic acid), the reaction might form a product with two oxygens. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with the keto acid leads to a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's see, for example, if the keto acid is something like propanone acid (but that's not a keto acid). Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When reacted with Grignard reagent, it would form a tertiary alcohol and then maybe more reactions. The product might have multiple oxygens, but the problem states the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps the product is an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a compound like a carboxylic acid, but that has two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group). Wait, the product would have two oxygens? Let's see. Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone acid, but maybe the product after reaction with Grignard would have two oxygen atoms. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol, which has one oxygen, but perhaps in the case of a keto acid, the product would have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, but that would have two oxygens. Maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4), but that's used as a reducing agent. However, the problem states that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Boron has isotopes like B-10 and B-11. If the heavier isotope is used, like B-11, but that's already common. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D instead of H). The product when reacting with a keto acid would form something with two oxygen atoms. Let me think. When a keto acid reacts with LiAlH4, perhaps it reduces the carbonyl groups, leading to alcohols. But the product might have fewer oxygens. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the product of the reaction with the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction of a Grignard reagent with a keto acid. For example, the Grignard adds to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, then maybe the acid part is deprotonated and adds again. The final product might be a tertiary alcohol, but that has one oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is an organolithium reagent. For example, butyllithium. The heavier isotope might be deuterium. But the product when reacting with a keto acid would form a tertiary alcohol, but again, maybe not two oxygens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of a keto acid with X (like a Grignard) gives a compound with two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the example: Acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group and the ketone). Wait, acetoacetic acid has three oxygen atoms (COOH and the ketone O). Hmm. Maybe when reacting, it forms a product with two oxygens. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol, so one oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is sodium amide (NaNH2). Sodium amide is used in organic synthesis. If the heavier isotope is deuterium, then NaND2? Wait, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So one of the elements in X is present as a heavier isotope. For sodium amide, the elements are Na, N, H. The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D) instead of H. The reaction with a keto acid might form an amide, perhaps with two oxygen atoms? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an amine, which has no oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the gas W. Let me think again. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's take another approach. Let's list possible gases and their neutron/proton counts.\n\n- H2: protons 2, neutrons 0 (if H-1). Not equal. But if deuterium (D2), protons 2, neutrons 2. So that works. So W could be D2 gas.\n\nIf W is D2, then maybe the reaction involves the release of deuterium gas. That would imply that Substance X contains deuterium. Since X uses a heavier isotope (deuterium instead of hydrogen), then perhaps X is a deuterated compound, like a Grignard reagent with deuterium, or sodium deuteride (NaD). Sodium deuteride is a common reagent in organic chemistry (like NaBH4 but with deuterium). \n\nLet me consider sodium deuteride (NaD). When it reacts with liquid Y, perhaps water (H2O), the reaction would produce deuterium gas (D2), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the precipitate? Wait, but NaOH is soluble in water. Hmm, so maybe the liquid Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid. Let's think of the reaction between NaD and water: NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The precipitate might not form here, but NaOH is a solid? No, it's soluble. Hmm, maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid. For example, if Y is HCl, then NaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl + D2\u2191. The precipitate would be NaCl? But NaCl is soluble in water. Hmm, maybe the liquid Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ester or another compound. Maybe the reaction is between NaD and an alcohol, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liquid Y is something like an acid chloride. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). The reaction with water would produce LiOH, Al(OH)3 (which is a precipitate?), and D2. When heated, the precipitate (maybe Al(OH)3) would decompose to Al2O3 and H2O. Wait, but B's melting point is near 277 K. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C, way too high. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate G is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which when heated doesn't decompose much, but perhaps the reaction produces a different solid. Wait, maybe the reaction of sodium deuteride with an acid like H2SO4 would produce D2 and sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate is soluble in water, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X (a Grignard reagent with deuterium) and liquid Y (maybe an ester or something). Not sure.\n\nLet me think of B's melting point again. The melting point is 277 K, which is 4\u00b0C. That's very close to water's melting point (0\u00b0C). So maybe B is water? If the precipitate G, when heated, releases water, then G could be something like a metal carbonate. For example, if G is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), heating it gives CaO and CO2. But the melting point of CaO is high. Alternatively, if G is a metal hydroxide like Mg(OH)2, when heated, it decomposes to MgO and H2O. MgO's melting point is 2852\u00b0C, so not relevant. But the B here would be water. The melting point of B is near 277 K (4\u00b0C), which is slightly above freezing, so perhaps B is water, but its melting point is exactly 273.15 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe that's acceptable. Then, if heating G produces water, then G is a hydroxide that decomposes to oxide and water. So G might be something like a metal hydroxide like Cu(OH)2, but when heated, it forms CuO and H2O. The oxide would have a high melting point. But the key here is that B is water. So the gas W would then be something else.\n\nWait, going back to the reaction: Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons) and precipitate G. If W is D2 (neutrons equal protons), then X must contain deuterium. Let's think of sodium deuteride (NaD). If the liquid Y is water (H2O), then the reaction would be NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. But NaOH is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid. Let's try with HCl: NaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl + D2\u2191. The NaCl would be in solution, so again no precipitate. Maybe Y is a different acid, like a stronger one. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X and an ester. Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is an ester like ethyl acetate. Then the Grignard reagent (like RMgD) would react, forming an alcohol and Mg salt. The Mg salt might precipitate. The gas W would be D2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces a metal hydride and another product. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that when heated, the precipitate G releases B. If B is water, then G must be a hydrate or a hydroxide that releases water on heating. For example, if G is Cu(OH)2, then heating gives CuO + H2O. So B would be H2O. Then, the reaction between X and Y must produce Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate. What would X be in that case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between sodium deuteride and a copper salt. For example, if Y is a solution containing Cu\u00b2+ ions. Then, NaD + Cu\u00b2+ \u2192 Cu(OH)2\u2193 + ...? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid and a metal salt. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try another angle. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of Grignard reagents. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms). When reacted with Grignard, it forms a tertiary alcohol, which has one oxygen (as -OH). But the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an ester? Or perhaps a diketone? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (OHC-COOH). When reacted with a Grignard reagent, it might form a diol, which has two -OH groups, so two oxygens. That could fit. So the product has two oxygen atoms. If that's the case, then X is a Grignard reagent. Since X uses a heavier isotope, perhaps the Grignard has deuterium instead of hydrogen. So the Grignard reagent would be, say, RMgD. The product would have two oxygen atoms, as in the example.\n\nSo, if X is an organomagnesium deuteride (Grignard with D instead of H), then the elements in X are C, Mg, D (deuterium). The lightest element is hydrogen (since deuterium is isotope of H), so atomic mass is 2 (since it's D). Wait, but the lightest element would be hydrogen (even as D). The heaviest element in X would be magnesium (Mg, atomic mass ~24) or carbon? Wait, the elements present in a Grignard reagent RMgD are carbon (in the R group), magnesium, and deuterium. The lightest element is deuterium (still H, so atomic number 1) and the heaviest would be magnesium (atomic number 12). So the atomic masses would be: lightest is 2 (since it's D, which has a mass number of 2, but the atomic mass is about 2), and magnesium is ~24. Wait, but the question says to consider the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present. So the lightest element is hydrogen (even as deuterium), so its atomic mass is 2 (since it's the isotope D). The heaviest element is Mg, atomic mass ~24. So sum would be 24 + 2 = 26? But the options don't have 26. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Grignard reagent is not the case. Let me consider another possibility. Maybe Substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), but with deuterium instead of H, so LiAlD4. The elements present would be Li, Al, D. The lightest is D (mass 2), heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. That's option D. That might be the answer. Let's see.\n\nIf X is LiAlD4, then the reaction with liquid Y (maybe water?) would produce LiAlO2, but maybe a precipitate. Wait, LiAlH4 reacts with water to form LiOH, Al(OH)3, and H2 (or D2 if deuterium). The Al(OH)3 would precipitate, and when heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O (or D2O). The B would then be H2O (melting point ~273 K), which is close to 277 K? Well, the question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe they consider that. Alternatively, maybe the B is Al2O3, but that's way too high. Hmm. Alternatively, the precipitate G is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases water (B is H2O). The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is 4\u00b0C. That's just slightly above water's freezing point, maybe due to impurities or something. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29, which is option D. That's possible. \n\nAnother possibility: the analog of X is LiAlH4 (the regular hydride), so the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". LiAlH4 is indeed a common reagent. So X would be LiAlD4. \n\nThen the product of the reaction with a keto acid would be? Let's see. When a keto acid reacts with LiAlH4, it would reduce the carbonyl groups. The product would have two oxygens? Let's see: For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms), the reduction would give a tertiary alcohol (which has one oxygen as -OH). Hmm, but the problem states two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an ester or another form. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces an alcohol and the acid part is reduced as well, leading to two oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol (two -OH groups), so two oxygens. That fits. For example, if the keto acid is glyoxylic acid (OHC-COOH), reacting with LiAlH4 would reduce both carbonyl groups to -CH2OH, giving HO-CH2-CH2-OH (ethylene glycol?), which has two -OH groups (two oxygen atoms). Yes, that would work. So the product would have two oxygen atoms. \n\nThat seems to fit. So X is LiAlD4. The elements present are Li (lightest?), wait Li has atomic mass ~7, but D (deuterium) is lighter (mass 2). So lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29. That's option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lightest element is lithium (Li) with atomic mass ~7, but D is lighter. So the correct sum is 2 (D) + 27 (Al) =29. So answer is D)29. \n\nAnother check: The gas W would be D2, which has equal protons and neutrons (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so molecule D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons). That matches the description. \n\nThe precipitate G is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases H2O (B). The melting point of B (H2O) is 273 K, which is close to 277 K (within 4 degrees). The question says \"very close\", so that's acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)29.\n",

Summing these gives **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nAnswer: D)29\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Substance X and then calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction with liquid Y produces gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n\nLet me start by figuring out what B is. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Converting that to Celsius: 277 - 273 = 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing, so maybe it's water? Wait, water's melting point is 0\u00b0C, so maybe B is a different substance. Alternatively, maybe it's sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH's melting point is around 318\u00b0C. Wait, maybe it's something like ammonium chloride? Let me think. Wait, 277 K is 4\u00b0C, so maybe the substance B is something that melts around that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps it's dry ice (solid CO2) but that sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLooking at the reaction products: the gas W has molecules with equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Since the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, the atomic number (protons) plus neutrons would be twice the protons. The simplest case is a molecule like H2, but hydrogen's proton is 1, neutron 0 in the most common isotope. Wait, but the question says the gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's see. Let's consider possible gases. Let's see, for each atom in the molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons must be even? Wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. For example, if it's hydrogen gas (H2), each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2, neutrons:0. Not equal. If it's deuterium (D2), each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons 2, neutrons 2. That would fit. So maybe gas W is deuterium gas? But the question says Substance X uses a heavier isotope, which might be deuterium. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, the gas could be methane (CH4), but let's see. Each carbon has 6 protons and maybe 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. The total protons would be 6 +4=10. Neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 0 (from H) =6. Not equal. Hmm. Another possibility: nitrogen gas (N2). Each N has 7 protons. The most common isotope is N-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons). So each atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule N2 would have total protons 14 and neutrons 14. That fits! So gas W could be N2. That would mean the reaction produces nitrogen gas. Alternatively, maybe oxygen? O2 would have protons 16, neutrons 16 (if O-16, which has 8 neutrons each). So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that also fits. So gas W could be either O2 or N2, but let's see other clues.\n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So heating G gives B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Let me think of possible B's. If B is a metal oxide? Or maybe a carbonate? Let's see. If G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2. The melting point of CO2 is solid at low temps, but its melting point is about 217 K, which is too low. Alternatively, maybe B is water. Wait, but water's melting point is 273.15 K. Close to 277? Well, 277 is 4 degrees C, which is just above freezing. Maybe B is water. Then, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating it would release water. But then the gas W would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O, but that's a liquid or gas, but the problem says gas W. Hmm, perhaps the gas is O2, then B would be something else. Alternatively, if the gas is N2, perhaps the precipitate is something like ammonium carbonate, but that would release NH3 on heating. Not sure. Maybe I need to think of the reaction between X and Y.\n\nThe question mentions that Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents (organomagnesium halides), organolithium compounds, or maybe alkyl lithiums. Alternatively, perhaps sodium hydride (NaH) or something else. But the key point is that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is sodium hydride (NaH), but then the heavier isotope might be deuterium (D instead of H). Alternatively, Grignard reagents are RMgX, where X is Cl, Br, I. The heavier isotope could be in the magnesium? Probably not. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen in the reagent is deuterium. So perhaps the substance X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD?\n\nThe product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about Grignard reactions. A keto acid reacting with Grignard would form a tertiary alcohol or something, but maybe when it's a keto acid (like, say, acetoacetic acid), the reaction might form a product with two oxygens. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with the keto acid leads to a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's see, for example, if the keto acid is something like propanone acid (but that's not a keto acid). Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When reacted with Grignard reagent, it would form a tertiary alcohol and then maybe more reactions. The product might have multiple oxygens, but the problem states the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps the product is an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a compound like a carboxylic acid, but that has two oxygen atoms (in the -COOH group). Wait, the product would have two oxygens? Let's see. Suppose the keto acid is something like propanone acid, but maybe the product after reaction with Grignard would have two oxygen atoms. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol, which has one oxygen, but perhaps in the case of a keto acid, the product would have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, but that would have two oxygens. Maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4), but that's used as a reducing agent. However, the problem states that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Boron has isotopes like B-10 and B-11. If the heavier isotope is used, like B-11, but that's already common. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4). The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D instead of H). The product when reacting with a keto acid would form something with two oxygen atoms. Let me think. When a keto acid reacts with LiAlH4, perhaps it reduces the carbonyl groups, leading to alcohols. But the product might have fewer oxygens. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the product of the reaction with the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction of a Grignard reagent with a keto acid. For example, the Grignard adds to the ketone part, forming an alcohol, then maybe the acid part is deprotonated and adds again. The final product might be a tertiary alcohol, but that has one oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is an organolithium reagent. For example, butyllithium. The heavier isotope might be deuterium. But the product when reacting with a keto acid would form a tertiary alcohol, but again, maybe not two oxygens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of a keto acid with X (like a Grignard) gives a compound with two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the example: Acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group and the ketone). Wait, acetoacetic acid has three oxygen atoms (COOH and the ketone O). Hmm. Maybe when reacting, it forms a product with two oxygens. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol, so one oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is sodium amide (NaNH2). Sodium amide is used in organic synthesis. If the heavier isotope is deuterium, then NaND2? Wait, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So one of the elements in X is present as a heavier isotope. For sodium amide, the elements are Na, N, H. The heavier isotope could be deuterium (D) instead of H. The reaction with a keto acid might form an amide, perhaps with two oxygen atoms? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an amine, which has no oxygen. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the gas W. Let me think again. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's take another approach. Let's list possible gases and their neutron/proton counts.\n\n- H2: protons 2, neutrons 0 (if H-1). Not equal. But if deuterium (D2), protons 2, neutrons 2. So that works. So W could be D2 gas.\n\nIf W is D2, then maybe the reaction involves the release of deuterium gas. That would imply that Substance X contains deuterium. Since X uses a heavier isotope (deuterium instead of hydrogen), then perhaps X is a deuterated compound, like a Grignard reagent with deuterium, or sodium deuteride (NaD). Sodium deuteride is a common reagent in organic chemistry (like NaBH4 but with deuterium). \n\nLet me consider sodium deuteride (NaD). When it reacts with liquid Y, perhaps water (H2O), the reaction would produce deuterium gas (D2), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the precipitate? Wait, but NaOH is soluble in water. Hmm, so maybe the liquid Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid. Let's think of the reaction between NaD and water: NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The precipitate might not form here, but NaOH is a solid? No, it's soluble. Hmm, maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid. For example, if Y is HCl, then NaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl + D2\u2191. The precipitate would be NaCl? But NaCl is soluble in water. Hmm, maybe the liquid Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ester or another compound. Maybe the reaction is between NaD and an alcohol, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the liquid Y is something like an acid chloride. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). The reaction with water would produce LiOH, Al(OH)3 (which is a precipitate?), and D2. When heated, the precipitate (maybe Al(OH)3) would decompose to Al2O3 and H2O. Wait, but B's melting point is near 277 K. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C, way too high. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the precipitate G is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which when heated doesn't decompose much, but perhaps the reaction produces a different solid. Wait, maybe the reaction of sodium deuteride with an acid like H2SO4 would produce D2 and sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate is soluble in water, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X (a Grignard reagent with deuterium) and liquid Y (maybe an ester or something). Not sure.\n\nLet me think of B's melting point again. The melting point is 277 K, which is 4\u00b0C. That's very close to water's melting point (0\u00b0C). So maybe B is water? If the precipitate G, when heated, releases water, then G could be something like a metal carbonate. For example, if G is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), heating it gives CaO and CO2. But the melting point of CaO is high. Alternatively, if G is a metal hydroxide like Mg(OH)2, when heated, it decomposes to MgO and H2O. MgO's melting point is 2852\u00b0C, so not relevant. But the B here would be water. The melting point of B is near 277 K (4\u00b0C), which is slightly above freezing, so perhaps B is water, but its melting point is exactly 273.15 K. The question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe that's acceptable. Then, if heating G produces water, then G is a hydroxide that decomposes to oxide and water. So G might be something like a metal hydroxide like Cu(OH)2, but when heated, it forms CuO and H2O. The oxide would have a high melting point. But the key here is that B is water. So the gas W would then be something else.\n\nWait, going back to the reaction: Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal protons and neutrons) and precipitate G. If W is D2 (neutrons equal protons), then X must contain deuterium. Let's think of sodium deuteride (NaD). If the liquid Y is water (H2O), then the reaction would be NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. But NaOH is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid. Let's try with HCl: NaD + HCl \u2192 NaCl + D2\u2191. The NaCl would be in solution, so again no precipitate. Maybe Y is a different acid, like a stronger one. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between X and an ester. Wait, perhaps the liquid Y is an ester like ethyl acetate. Then the Grignard reagent (like RMgD) would react, forming an alcohol and Mg salt. The Mg salt might precipitate. The gas W would be D2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces a metal hydride and another product. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem states that when heated, the precipitate G releases B. If B is water, then G must be a hydrate or a hydroxide that releases water on heating. For example, if G is Cu(OH)2, then heating gives CuO + H2O. So B would be H2O. Then, the reaction between X and Y must produce Cu(OH)2 as a precipitate. What would X be in that case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between sodium deuteride and a copper salt. For example, if Y is a solution containing Cu\u00b2+ ions. Then, NaD + Cu\u00b2+ \u2192 Cu(OH)2\u2193 + ...? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with an acid and a metal salt. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try another angle. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of Grignard reagents. Suppose the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms). When reacted with Grignard, it forms a tertiary alcohol, which has one oxygen (as -OH). But the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an ester? Or perhaps a diketone? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (OHC-COOH). When reacted with a Grignard reagent, it might form a diol, which has two -OH groups, so two oxygens. That could fit. So the product has two oxygen atoms. If that's the case, then X is a Grignard reagent. Since X uses a heavier isotope, perhaps the Grignard has deuterium instead of hydrogen. So the Grignard reagent would be, say, RMgD. The product would have two oxygen atoms, as in the example.\n\nSo, if X is an organomagnesium deuteride (Grignard with D instead of H), then the elements in X are C, Mg, D (deuterium). The lightest element is hydrogen (since deuterium is isotope of H), so atomic mass is 2 (since it's D). Wait, but the lightest element would be hydrogen (even as D). The heaviest element in X would be magnesium (Mg, atomic mass ~24) or carbon? Wait, the elements present in a Grignard reagent RMgD are carbon (in the R group), magnesium, and deuterium. The lightest element is deuterium (still H, so atomic number 1) and the heaviest would be magnesium (atomic number 12). So the atomic masses would be: lightest is 2 (since it's D, which has a mass number of 2, but the atomic mass is about 2), and magnesium is ~24. Wait, but the question says to consider the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present. So the lightest element is hydrogen (even as deuterium), so its atomic mass is 2 (since it's the isotope D). The heaviest element is Mg, atomic mass ~24. So sum would be 24 + 2 = 26? But the options don't have 26. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Grignard reagent is not the case. Let me consider another possibility. Maybe Substance X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), but with deuterium instead of H, so LiAlD4. The elements present would be Li, Al, D. The lightest is D (mass 2), heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. That's option D. That might be the answer. Let's see.\n\nIf X is LiAlD4, then the reaction with liquid Y (maybe water?) would produce LiAlO2, but maybe a precipitate. Wait, LiAlH4 reacts with water to form LiOH, Al(OH)3, and H2 (or D2 if deuterium). The Al(OH)3 would precipitate, and when heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O (or D2O). The B would then be H2O (melting point ~273 K), which is close to 277 K? Well, the question says \"very close to 277 K\", so maybe they consider that. Alternatively, maybe the B is Al2O3, but that's way too high. Hmm. Alternatively, the precipitate G is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases water (B is H2O). The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is 4\u00b0C. That's just slightly above water's freezing point, maybe due to impurities or something. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), and D (2). The lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29, which is option D. That's possible. \n\nAnother possibility: the analog of X is LiAlH4 (the regular hydride), so the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". LiAlH4 is indeed a common reagent. So X would be LiAlD4. \n\nThen the product of the reaction with a keto acid would be? Let's see. When a keto acid reacts with LiAlH4, it would reduce the carbonyl groups. The product would have two oxygens? Let's see: For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms), the reduction would give a tertiary alcohol (which has one oxygen as -OH). Hmm, but the problem states two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is an ester or another form. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces an alcohol and the acid part is reduced as well, leading to two oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol (two -OH groups), so two oxygens. That fits. For example, if the keto acid is glyoxylic acid (OHC-COOH), reacting with LiAlH4 would reduce both carbonyl groups to -CH2OH, giving HO-CH2-CH2-OH (ethylene glycol?), which has two -OH groups (two oxygen atoms). Yes, that would work. So the product would have two oxygen atoms. \n\nThat seems to fit. So X is LiAlD4. The elements present are Li (lightest?), wait Li has atomic mass ~7, but D (deuterium) is lighter (mass 2). So lightest is D (2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29. That's option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lightest element is lithium (Li) with atomic mass ~7, but D is lighter. So the correct sum is 2 (D) + 27 (Al) =29. So answer is D)29. \n\nAnother check: The gas W would be D2, which has equal protons and neutrons (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so molecule D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons). That matches the description. \n\nThe precipitate G is Al(OH)3, which when heated releases H2O (B). The melting point of B (H2O) is 273 K, which is close to 277 K (within 4 degrees). The question says \"very close\", so that's acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)29.\n\n\nSubstance X is identified as lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD\u2084), given its use as an organic reagent and the presence of a heavier isotope (deuterium, D). The reaction with liquid Y (e.g., water) produces deuterium gas (D\u2082), which has equal protons and neutrons (each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron). The precipitate G, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083), decomposes when heated to release water (B), whose melting point (273 K) is close to 277 K. The product of a keto acid reaction with LiAlD\u2084 (e.g., reducing glyoxylic acid to a diol) contains two oxygen atoms. \n\nThe lightest element in LiAlD\u2084 is deuterium (H-2, atomic mass 2), and the heaviest is aluminum (Al, atomic mass 27).

When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Also, there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. The final part asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let me parse each clue carefully. The key points are:\n\n1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe an isotope like deuterium (D, which is hydrogen-2) since that's a common heavier isotope used in chemistry?\n\n2. Reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. The number of protons equals neutrons. The simplest would be H2 (protons=2, neutrons=0? Wait no. Wait, H has 1 proton and no neutrons, so H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. Maybe something like He? But He is monoatomic. Wait, maybe a molecule like CH4? No, that's more protons. Wait, maybe a molecule like H2O? Let's see: H2O has 10 protons (O is 8, 2 from H). Neutrons: O has 8 (since 16-8=8), H has 0, so total neutrons 8. Protons total 10. Not equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like D2 (deuterium gas)? Then protons would be 2, neutrons also 2 (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron). So 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So that fits. So gas W is D2? But D is an isotope of H. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen (H2) but with deuterium? Wait, but if the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, then each atom must have equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule must have p = n. So, for an element with p = n, the mass number would be 2p. So possible elements where p = n would be:\n\nHydrogen-2 (D): p=1, n=1 \u2192 yes. So deuterium.\n\nHelium-4: p=2, n=2 \u2192 yes. But He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But if the gas is He, but He is monoatomic. The question says the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. So if the molecule is He, then the total protons (2) and neutrons (2) would match. So He would fit. Alternatively, maybe other elements. Let's see:\n\nLithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons (since 6-3=3). So Li-6 would satisfy p=n. So a molecule like Li2 would have 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But that's less likely as a common gas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is D2 (deuterium gas), which would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That's possible. Since the problem mentions that Substance X has a heavier isotope, perhaps deuterium is part of X. So maybe X is a compound with deuterium?\n\nMoving on to the next clue: the precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273.15 is 0 C). So melting around 4\u00b0C. That's the melting point of ice, but ice melts at 0\u00b0C. Hmm, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe B is a metal? Let me think. Let's see some elements' melting points:\n\n- Mercury (Hg) melts at about 234 K, so no.\n\n- Gallium (Ga) melts at around 303 K (29.76\u00b0C), so that's higher.\n\nWait 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Wait, maybe the substance is something like sodium acetate? No, that's a salt. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate? Or maybe B is water? Wait, but water's melting point is 0\u00b0C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of other substances. Wait, maybe B is a solid that when heated releases a gas. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate or something that decomposes when heated. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) decomposes into CaO and CO2 when heated. But then B would be CO2, but CO2's melting point isn't near 277 K. Alternatively, maybe G is a metal oxide?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is water. If G is something like calcium hydroxide, but when heated, maybe it forms calcium oxide and releases water. But the melting point of water is 0\u00b0C. Hmm, but the question says the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. So perhaps B is a solid that melts at that temperature. Let me check some common substances. Wait, maybe it's dry ice (CO2), which sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C (194.7 K), so no. Maybe another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal like gallium, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a metal that has a melting point near 4\u00b0C. Wait, maybe it's mercury, but mercury's melting point is lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate? Not sure. Let's try to see other clues.\n\nThe reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid has the structure RCO-COOH or something, but when reacting with X, maybe it's a reduction or some substitution. Wait, maybe X is a reducing agent? Like sodium borohydride (NaBD4) or something similar? Wait, but the problem states that X contains a heavier isotope. Sodium borohydride has deuterium in some forms, but maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but when reacting with X, maybe it's a dehydrogenation or something. Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction. For example, if X is a reducing agent, then maybe the product would lose oxygen. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. The keto acid itself has oxygen. Maybe the product is a ketone, which has one oxygen, so that might not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is an esterification or something where the number of oxygen atoms changes. Let me think. Maybe the keto acid (RCO2H) reacts with X, which is a dehydrating agent, leading to a loss of water (so two oxygens in the product?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent? Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like RMgX. But if the heavier isotope is in there, maybe deuterium (so RD instead of RH?), making it a deuterated Grignard. The product of a Grignard reaction with a keto acid might form an alcohol or something else, but not sure about the oxygen count. Wait, Grignard reagents are used in carbonyl additions. For example, reacting with a ketone would form an alcohol, but with a keto acid maybe forming a different product. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the question says that Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are common, so maybe X is a Grignard reagent. The \"very close analog\" might be the non-deuterated version. So if X is, say, RMgD (with deuterium), then the analog would be RMgH (regular Grignard with H). The heavier isotope here is deuterium.\n\nNow, the reaction with liquid Y. If Y is water, then Grignard reagents react violently with water to form the hydrocarbon, Mg(OH)2 precipitate, and releasing a gas. Wait, let's think. The reaction of RMgX with water would produce ROH, Mg(OH)2, and maybe H2 gas? Wait, no. Let me recall: the Grignard reagent reacts with water to produce the alcohol, Mg(OH)2 as precipitate, and the other products? Wait, the reaction is RMgX + H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)X. Hmm, but maybe the gas is H2? No, perhaps not. Wait, maybe the gas is H2 in some cases? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when the Grignard reacts with water, the Mg(OH)2 precipitates, and the gas is the H2 from the reaction? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, but that would have protons and neutrons: H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not matching the requirement of equal protons and neutrons. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, but if the Grignard is deuterated, like RMgD, then the reaction with water would produce ROD (the alcohol with deuterium), Mg(OH)D? Hmm, but the gas released might be D2? Let me think again. The reaction would be RMgD + H2O \u2192 ROD (alcohol) + Mg(OH)D. But the Mg(OH)D might not precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps the Mg(OH)2 would precipitate. Wait, maybe the reaction is RMgX (X is halogen) with water gives ROH, Mg(OH)X. If X is Cl, then Mg(OH)Cl would form. But the precipitate might be Mg(OH)2 if there's another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of X with Y is something else. Let's think of another possibility. If X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), which is a reducing agent. The heavier isotope might be deuterium, so LiAlD4. When reacted with water, LiAlH4 reacts violently, producing H2 gas (or D2?), and forming LiOH, Al(OH)3 precipitate. The gas would be H2 (or D2), but again the neutron count. For D2, protons 2, neutrons 2. So that would fit. The precipitate here would be Al(OH)3. When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3? But the melting point of Al2O3 is very high (over 2000\u00b0C). Hmm, that doesn't match the 277 K (about 4\u00b0C). So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's try to think of the melting point of B. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. What substance has a melting point near that? Wait, maybe B is ice? But ice's melting point is 0\u00b0C. Close enough? Maybe the question allows for rounding. Alternatively, maybe it's another substance. Wait, maybe B is a hydrate, like sodium acetate trihydrate which has a melting point around 58\u00b0C? No. Alternatively, maybe the substance is a eutectic mixture, but perhaps the question is pointing to water. If B is water, then when heated, it would release water vapor, but the precipitate G might be something that releases water upon heating. For example, if G is a hydrate like CuSO4\u00b75H2O, heating would release water. But then B would be water, which melts at 0\u00b0C. Close to 277 K (which is 4\u00b0C), so maybe that's acceptable. Let's see if that fits.\n\nSo if the reaction of X with Y (water) produces gas W (maybe D2?), a precipitate G (like CuSO4\u00b75H2O?), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated releases water (B is H2O). The melting point is 0\u00b0C (273 K), so 277 is close. So maybe B is water. Then gas W would need to have equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, if gas W is D2, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron), that would fit. \n\nSo if X is a deuteride, such as sodium borohydride with deuterium (NaBD4), then reacting with water (liquid Y) would produce D2 gas, and maybe a precipitate like Mg(OH)2? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's consider the reaction of NaBD4 with water: \n\nNaBD4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 + B(OH)3. Wait, maybe the precipitate here is B(OH)3? But boron hydroxide is not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe another reaction. Alternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, reacting with water would give ROD (alcohol) and Mg(OH)D. The Mg(OH)D might not be a precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When reacted with water, it would produce D2 gas, along with LiOH and Al(OH)3 precipitate. The Al(OH)3 would precipitate, and when heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O (gas B would be water). The melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, D (which is H-2), and maybe something else? Wait, LiAlD4 would have Li (Li), Al (Al), D (H isotope), and oxygen? No, LiAlD4 is lithium aluminum tetrahydride with deuterium. The formula is LiAlD4. The elements present are Li, Al, and D (which is H). So the elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), and H (but the isotope here is D, which has mass 2, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\", so the H in X is deuterium. But when considering the atomic masses, we have to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present. The elements are Li (lightest?), Al, and H (but the H here is D, but H's atomic mass is considered as the isotope present. Wait the question says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nHmm. So, for each element present in X, if there are multiple isotopes (like H and D), we have to sum all their masses. Wait, but maybe it's per element. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again: \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nSo, perhaps for each element in X, if there are multiple isotopes present (like H and D), then their masses are added. But if the element is present as a single isotope (like Li, Al in LiAlD4), then just their standard atomic mass? Or perhaps the problem is considering that for each element in the compound, if it has a heavier isotope (like H in X is D), then we take the mass of the isotope. Wait, the question says \"the heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" is incorporated in X. So for example, if X is LiAlD4, then the H (deuterium) is the heavier isotope. The other elements (Li, Al) are present as their normal isotopes. So the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (H-2). \n\nThe lightest element in X would be Li (atomic number 3), but wait: H (deuterium is still element 1, so H is the lightest. The heaviest is Al (13). Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so H (1) is lighter than Li. So the lightest is H (mass 2, since it's D), and the heaviest is Al (27). So their masses would be 2 (H) + 27 (Al) = 29. So that would be option D (29). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other possibilities. Let's see if there's another possible X.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH), but with deuterium (NaD). Then reacting with water would produce D2 gas. The reaction would be NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The precipitate here might not form. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent RMgD, reacting with water would produce ROD and Mg(OH)D. The Mg(OH)D might not precipitate, but if Mg(OH)2 is formed, perhaps in the case of regular Grignard with H. But with deuterium, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)D? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a different compound. Let's think of the product when a keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms?), when reacted with X (a reducing agent like LiAlH4), would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, so the product might lose an oxygen. But not sure about the exact oxygen count. \n\nWait, LiAlH4 (or its deuterated form) is used in reductions. For example, reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, which has one oxygen. But a keto acid might have two carbonyl groups. Let's take acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). The keto acid has two carbonyl groups. If reduced with LiAlH4, the product would be a diol (two OH groups), so maybe the product would have two oxygen atoms (the two OH groups). So the product would have two oxygen atoms, which matches the question. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements are Li (atomic mass ~6.94), Al (26.98), and D (2.014). The lightest element is H (D, mass ~2), and the heaviest is Al (~27). Adding those: 2 + 27 = 29, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is NaBD4 (sodium borohydride with deuterium), then elements are Na (~23), B (~11), and D. The lightest is H (2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum would be 2+23=25 (option B). Hmm, but the question says the product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's see, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reacts with keto acids to reduce them. For example, acetoacetic acid would become the corresponding alcohol, but again, the product's oxygen count depends. Maybe that works. \n\nWait, the problem states that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of the reaction. If the keto acid is something like propanone acid (which is actually a diketone?), maybe acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione). Reduction would form a diol, which has two OH groups (two oxygens). So that would fit. \n\nSo if X is NaBD4, then elements are Na, B, D. Lightest is H (D, mass 2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 25 (option B). But earlier, LiAlD4 would give 29 (D). Which is correct?\n\nHmm, the question mentions that X and its very close analog are used as reagents. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and its deuterated version are common reagents. LiAlH4 is also a common reducing agent, but perhaps the question refers to a hydride reagent. Let me see the clues again.\n\nThe reaction with liquid Y (probably water) produces gas W (D2, since H2 would not satisfy the protons-neutron condition unless deuterium). The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (which is water, melting point ~273 K, close to 277). \n\nIf X is NaBD4, reacting with water:\n\nNaBD4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 + B(OH)3 ?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction produces D2 gas, and the precipitate would be B(OH)3? But boric acid is soluble in water. Hmm, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces NaOH and D2, but no precipitate. That might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, with LiAlD4 reacting with water, the reaction would be:\n\nLiAlD4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 D2\u2191 \n\nHere, Al(OH)3 is the precipitate. When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O (B would be H2O). The melting point of H2O is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. That fits. So in this case, the elements in LiAlD4 are Li, Al, and D (H-2). \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27 = 29 (option D). \n\nBut then why the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". LiAlH4 and LiAlD4 are analogs. Yes, so that fits. \n\nAlternatively, if X is NaBD4, then the elements are Na (23), B (11), D (2). Lightest is H (2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 25 (option B). \n\nWhich scenario is correct? Let's see the product with the keto acid. \n\nIf the keto acid reacts with LiAlD4, the product would have two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid, the reduction would give a diol with two -OH groups (so two oxygens). That works. \n\nAlternatively, with NaBD4, the reduction of acetoacetic acid would also give a diol with two oxygens. \n\nHmm. The question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" Both scenarios might fit. \n\nNow, the question is to calculate the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4: elements are Li (6.94), Al (26.98), and D (2.014). The lightest is D (H isotope, mass ~2), heaviest Al (~27). Total ~2+27=29 (D option). \n\nIf X is NaBD4: elements Na (~23), B (~11), D (~2). Lightest is D (2), heaviest Na (23). Sum 25 (B option). \n\nSo which one is correct? The key difference is the precipitate and the gas. Let's think again about the reaction's products. \n\nFor LiAlD4 reacting with water:\n\nThe reaction produces LiOH (soluble), Al(OH)3 (precipitate), and D2 gas. When heating Al(OH)3, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O (so B is H2O, which melts at 273 K). \n\nFor NaBD4 reacting with water:\n\nThe products would be NaOH (soluble), B(OH)3 (which is boric acid, soluble in water), and D2 gas. But then there's no precipitate. So the precipitate G must form. Hence, LiAlD4 is more likely because Al(OH)3 is a precipitate. \n\nThus, LiAlD4 is the correct X. So the sum is 29 (D). \n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Let me confirm with LiAlD4. The reduction of a keto acid would produce an alcohol. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms: two in the acid group and one in the ketone?), when reduced, it would become a diol, which has two -OH groups (two oxygens). So that fits. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D (29). \n\nWait, but let me check the elements again in LiAlD4. The formula is LiAlD4. So elements are Li, Al, and D (which is H-2). So the lightest is H (2), heaviest is Al (27). Their atomic masses are approximately 6.94 (Li), 26.98 (Al), and 2.014 (D). But the question says \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements\". So lightest element is H (mass ~2), heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. \n\nYes, so the answer is D) 29.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying Substance X based on several clues and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. \n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Deuterium (D\u2082) fits because each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, totaling 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n   \n2. **Precipitate G and B Identification**: Heating G releases B, which melts near 277 K (4\u00b0C). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), as its melting point is 273 K (0\u00b0C), close to 277 K. The precipitate G must decompose into water upon heating, indicating G is aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083), which decomposes to Al\u2082O\u2083 and H\u2082O.\n\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has two oxygen atoms.

Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (deuterium), the analog is LiAlD\u2084.\n\n4. **Elements in LiAlD\u2084**: The elements are lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen). The lightest element is hydrogen (D, atomic mass ~2), and the heaviest is aluminum (atomic mass ~27). Their sum is **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nThe correct answer is **D) 29**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the question is about Substance X, which reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Also, there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. The final part asks for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let me parse each clue carefully. The key points are:\n\n1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe an isotope like deuterium (D, which is hydrogen-2) since that's a common heavier isotope used in chemistry?\n\n2. Reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. The number of protons equals neutrons. The simplest would be H2 (protons=2, neutrons=0? Wait no. Wait, H has 1 proton and no neutrons, so H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. Maybe something like He? But He is monoatomic. Wait, maybe a molecule like CH4? No, that's more protons. Wait, maybe a molecule like H2O? Let's see: H2O has 10 protons (O is 8, 2 from H). Neutrons: O has 8 (since 16-8=8), H has 0, so total neutrons 8. Protons total 10. Not equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule is something like D2 (deuterium gas)? Then protons would be 2, neutrons also 2 (each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron). So 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So that fits. So gas W is D2? But D is an isotope of H. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen (H2) but with deuterium? Wait, but if the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, then each atom must have equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule must have p = n. So, for an element with p = n, the mass number would be 2p. So possible elements where p = n would be:\n\nHydrogen-2 (D): p=1, n=1 \u2192 yes. So deuterium.\n\nHelium-4: p=2, n=2 \u2192 yes. But He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. But if the gas is He, but He is monoatomic. The question says the molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. So if the molecule is He, then the total protons (2) and neutrons (2) would match. So He would fit. Alternatively, maybe other elements. Let's see:\n\nLithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons (since 6-3=3). So Li-6 would satisfy p=n. So a molecule like Li2 would have 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But that's less likely as a common gas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is D2 (deuterium gas), which would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That's possible. Since the problem mentions that Substance X has a heavier isotope, perhaps deuterium is part of X. So maybe X is a compound with deuterium?\n\nMoving on to the next clue: the precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273.15 is 0 C). So melting around 4\u00b0C. That's the melting point of ice, but ice melts at 0\u00b0C. Hmm, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe B is a metal? Let me think. Let's see some elements' melting points:\n\n- Mercury (Hg) melts at about 234 K, so no.\n\n- Gallium (Ga) melts at around 303 K (29.76\u00b0C), so that's higher.\n\nWait 277 K is 4\u00b0C. Wait, maybe the substance is something like sodium acetate? No, that's a salt. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate? Or maybe B is water? Wait, but water's melting point is 0\u00b0C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of other substances. Wait, maybe B is a solid that when heated releases a gas. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate or something that decomposes when heated. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) decomposes into CaO and CO2 when heated. But then B would be CO2, but CO2's melting point isn't near 277 K. Alternatively, maybe G is a metal oxide?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is water. If G is something like calcium hydroxide, but when heated, maybe it forms calcium oxide and releases water. But the melting point of water is 0\u00b0C. Hmm, but the question says the melting point of B is very close to 277 K. So perhaps B is a solid that melts at that temperature. Let me check some common substances. Wait, maybe it's dry ice (CO2), which sublimes at -78.5\u00b0C (194.7 K), so no. Maybe another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal like gallium, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a metal that has a melting point near 4\u00b0C. Wait, maybe it's mercury, but mercury's melting point is lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate? Not sure. Let's try to see other clues.\n\nThe reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid has the structure RCO-COOH or something, but when reacting with X, maybe it's a reduction or some substitution. Wait, maybe X is a reducing agent? Like sodium borohydride (NaBD4) or something similar? Wait, but the problem states that X contains a heavier isotope. Sodium borohydride has deuterium in some forms, but maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two carbonyl groups?), but when reacting with X, maybe it's a dehydrogenation or something. Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction. For example, if X is a reducing agent, then maybe the product would lose oxygen. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. The keto acid itself has oxygen. Maybe the product is a ketone, which has one oxygen, so that might not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is an esterification or something where the number of oxygen atoms changes. Let me think. Maybe the keto acid (RCO2H) reacts with X, which is a dehydrating agent, leading to a loss of water (so two oxygens in the product?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent? Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, like RMgX. But if the heavier isotope is in there, maybe deuterium (so RD instead of RH?), making it a deuterated Grignard. The product of a Grignard reaction with a keto acid might form an alcohol or something else, but not sure about the oxygen count. Wait, Grignard reagents are used in carbonyl additions. For example, reacting with a ketone would form an alcohol, but with a keto acid maybe forming a different product. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the question says that Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Grignard reagents are common, so maybe X is a Grignard reagent. The \"very close analog\" might be the non-deuterated version. So if X is, say, RMgD (with deuterium), then the analog would be RMgH (regular Grignard with H). The heavier isotope here is deuterium.\n\nNow, the reaction with liquid Y. If Y is water, then Grignard reagents react violently with water to form the hydrocarbon, Mg(OH)2 precipitate, and releasing a gas. Wait, let's think. The reaction of RMgX with water would produce ROH, Mg(OH)2, and maybe H2 gas? Wait, no. Let me recall: the Grignard reagent reacts with water to produce the alcohol, Mg(OH)2 as precipitate, and the other products? Wait, the reaction is RMgX + H2O \u2192 ROH + Mg(OH)X. Hmm, but maybe the gas is H2? No, perhaps not. Wait, maybe the gas is H2 in some cases? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when the Grignard reacts with water, the Mg(OH)2 precipitates, and the gas is the H2 from the reaction? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, but that would have protons and neutrons: H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not matching the requirement of equal protons and neutrons. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, but if the Grignard is deuterated, like RMgD, then the reaction with water would produce ROD (the alcohol with deuterium), Mg(OH)D? Hmm, but the gas released might be D2? Let me think again. The reaction would be RMgD + H2O \u2192 ROD (alcohol) + Mg(OH)D. But the Mg(OH)D might not precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps the Mg(OH)2 would precipitate. Wait, maybe the reaction is RMgX (X is halogen) with water gives ROH, Mg(OH)X. If X is Cl, then Mg(OH)Cl would form. But the precipitate might be Mg(OH)2 if there's another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of X with Y is something else. Let's think of another possibility. If X is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), which is a reducing agent. The heavier isotope might be deuterium, so LiAlD4. When reacted with water, LiAlH4 reacts violently, producing H2 gas (or D2?), and forming LiOH, Al(OH)3 precipitate. The gas would be H2 (or D2), but again the neutron count. For D2, protons 2, neutrons 2. So that would fit. The precipitate here would be Al(OH)3. When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3? But the melting point of Al2O3 is very high (over 2000\u00b0C). Hmm, that doesn't match the 277 K (about 4\u00b0C). So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's try to think of the melting point of B. 277 K is 4\u00b0C. What substance has a melting point near that? Wait, maybe B is ice? But ice's melting point is 0\u00b0C. Close enough? Maybe the question allows for rounding. Alternatively, maybe it's another substance. Wait, maybe B is a hydrate, like sodium acetate trihydrate which has a melting point around 58\u00b0C? No. Alternatively, maybe the substance is a eutectic mixture, but perhaps the question is pointing to water. If B is water, then when heated, it would release water vapor, but the precipitate G might be something that releases water upon heating. For example, if G is a hydrate like CuSO4\u00b75H2O, heating would release water. But then B would be water, which melts at 0\u00b0C. Close to 277 K (which is 4\u00b0C), so maybe that's acceptable. Let's see if that fits.\n\nSo if the reaction of X with Y (water) produces gas W (maybe D2?), a precipitate G (like CuSO4\u00b75H2O?), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated releases water (B is H2O). The melting point is 0\u00b0C (273 K), so 277 is close. So maybe B is water. Then gas W would need to have equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, if gas W is D2, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron), that would fit. \n\nSo if X is a deuteride, such as sodium borohydride with deuterium (NaBD4), then reacting with water (liquid Y) would produce D2 gas, and maybe a precipitate like Mg(OH)2? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Let's consider the reaction of NaBD4 with water: \n\nNaBD4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 + B(OH)3. Wait, maybe the precipitate here is B(OH)3? But boron hydroxide is not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe another reaction. Alternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent with deuterium, like RMgD, reacting with water would give ROD (alcohol) and Mg(OH)D. The Mg(OH)D might not be a precipitate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4). When reacted with water, it would produce D2 gas, along with LiOH and Al(OH)3 precipitate. The Al(OH)3 would precipitate, and when heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O (gas B would be water). The melting point of water is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, D (which is H-2), and maybe something else? Wait, LiAlD4 would have Li (Li), Al (Al), D (H isotope), and oxygen? No, LiAlD4 is lithium aluminum tetrahydride with deuterium. The formula is LiAlD4. The elements present are Li, Al, and D (which is H). So the elements are Li (atomic mass ~7), Al (~27), and H (but the isotope here is D, which has mass 2, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\", so the H in X is deuterium. But when considering the atomic masses, we have to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present. The elements are Li (lightest?), Al, and H (but the H here is D, but H's atomic mass is considered as the isotope present. Wait the question says \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" Wait, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nHmm. So, for each element present in X, if there are multiple isotopes (like H and D), we have to sum all their masses. Wait, but maybe it's per element. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again: \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n\nSo, perhaps for each element in X, if there are multiple isotopes present (like H and D), then their masses are added. But if the element is present as a single isotope (like Li, Al in LiAlD4), then just their standard atomic mass? Or perhaps the problem is considering that for each element in the compound, if it has a heavier isotope (like H in X is D), then we take the mass of the isotope. Wait, the question says \"the heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" is incorporated in X. So for example, if X is LiAlD4, then the H (deuterium) is the heavier isotope. The other elements (Li, Al) are present as their normal isotopes. So the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (H-2). \n\nThe lightest element in X would be Li (atomic number 3), but wait: H (deuterium is still element 1, so H is the lightest. The heaviest is Al (13). Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so H (1) is lighter than Li. So the lightest is H (mass 2, since it's D), and the heaviest is Al (27). So their masses would be 2 (H) + 27 (Al) = 29. So that would be option D (29). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other possibilities. Let's see if there's another possible X.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is sodium hydride (NaH), but with deuterium (NaD). Then reacting with water would produce D2 gas. The reaction would be NaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191. The precipitate here might not form. So perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a Grignard reagent RMgD, reacting with water would produce ROD and Mg(OH)D. The Mg(OH)D might not precipitate, but if Mg(OH)2 is formed, perhaps in the case of regular Grignard with H. But with deuterium, maybe the precipitate is Mg(OH)D? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a different compound. Let's think of the product when a keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms?), when reacted with X (a reducing agent like LiAlH4), would reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, so the product might lose an oxygen. But not sure about the exact oxygen count. \n\nWait, LiAlH4 (or its deuterated form) is used in reductions. For example, reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, which has one oxygen. But a keto acid might have two carbonyl groups. Let's take acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). The keto acid has two carbonyl groups. If reduced with LiAlH4, the product would be a diol (two OH groups), so maybe the product would have two oxygen atoms (the two OH groups). So the product would have two oxygen atoms, which matches the question. So that fits. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then the elements are Li (atomic mass ~6.94), Al (26.98), and D (2.014). The lightest element is H (D, mass ~2), and the heaviest is Al (~27). Adding those: 2 + 27 = 29, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is NaBD4 (sodium borohydride with deuterium), then elements are Na (~23), B (~11), and D. The lightest is H (2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum would be 2+23=25 (option B). Hmm, but the question says the product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's see, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reacts with keto acids to reduce them. For example, acetoacetic acid would become the corresponding alcohol, but again, the product's oxygen count depends. Maybe that works. \n\nWait, the problem states that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of the reaction. If the keto acid is something like propanone acid (which is actually a diketone?), maybe acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione). Reduction would form a diol, which has two OH groups (two oxygens). So that would fit. \n\nSo if X is NaBD4, then elements are Na, B, D. Lightest is H (D, mass 2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 25 (option B). But earlier, LiAlD4 would give 29 (D). Which is correct?\n\nHmm, the question mentions that X and its very close analog are used as reagents. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and its deuterated version are common reagents. LiAlH4 is also a common reducing agent, but perhaps the question refers to a hydride reagent. Let me see the clues again.\n\nThe reaction with liquid Y (probably water) produces gas W (D2, since H2 would not satisfy the protons-neutron condition unless deuterium). The precipitate G, when heated, releases B (which is water, melting point ~273 K, close to 277). \n\nIf X is NaBD4, reacting with water:\n\nNaBD4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2\u2191 + B(OH)3 ?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction produces D2 gas, and the precipitate would be B(OH)3? But boric acid is soluble in water. Hmm, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces NaOH and D2, but no precipitate. That might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, with LiAlD4 reacting with water, the reaction would be:\n\nLiAlD4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 D2\u2191 \n\nHere, Al(OH)3 is the precipitate. When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O (B would be H2O). The melting point of H2O is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. That fits. So in this case, the elements in LiAlD4 are Li, Al, and D (H-2). \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27 = 29 (option D). \n\nBut then why the question says \"especially its very close analog is used as a reagent\". LiAlH4 and LiAlD4 are analogs. Yes, so that fits. \n\nAlternatively, if X is NaBD4, then the elements are Na (23), B (11), D (2). Lightest is H (2), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 25 (option B). \n\nWhich scenario is correct? Let's see the product with the keto acid. \n\nIf the keto acid reacts with LiAlD4, the product would have two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid, the reduction would give a diol with two -OH groups (so two oxygens). That works. \n\nAlternatively, with NaBD4, the reduction of acetoacetic acid would also give a diol with two oxygens. \n\nHmm. The question says \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" Both scenarios might fit. \n\nNow, the question is to calculate the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4: elements are Li (6.94), Al (26.98), and D (2.014). The lightest is D (H isotope, mass ~2), heaviest Al (~27). Total ~2+27=29 (D option). \n\nIf X is NaBD4: elements Na (~23), B (~11), D (~2). Lightest is D (2), heaviest Na (23). Sum 25 (B option). \n\nSo which one is correct? The key difference is the precipitate and the gas. Let's think again about the reaction's products. \n\nFor LiAlD4 reacting with water:\n\nThe reaction produces LiOH (soluble), Al(OH)3 (precipitate), and D2 gas. When heating Al(OH)3, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O (so B is H2O, which melts at 273 K). \n\nFor NaBD4 reacting with water:\n\nThe products would be NaOH (soluble), B(OH)3 (which is boric acid, soluble in water), and D2 gas. But then there's no precipitate. So the precipitate G must form. Hence, LiAlD4 is more likely because Al(OH)3 is a precipitate. \n\nThus, LiAlD4 is the correct X. So the sum is 29 (D). \n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen\". Let me confirm with LiAlD4. The reduction of a keto acid would produce an alcohol. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid (which has three oxygen atoms: two in the acid group and one in the ketone?), when reduced, it would become a diol, which has two -OH groups (two oxygens). So that fits. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D (29). \n\nWait, but let me check the elements again in LiAlD4. The formula is LiAlD4. So elements are Li, Al, and D (which is H-2). So the lightest is H (2), heaviest is Al (27). Their atomic masses are approximately 6.94 (Li), 26.98 (Al), and 2.014 (D). But the question says \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements\". So lightest element is H (mass ~2), heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. \n\nYes, so the answer is D) 29.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying Substance X based on several clues and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. \n\n1. **Gas W Analysis**: The gas must have equal protons and neutrons. Deuterium (D\u2082) fits because each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, totaling 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n   \n2. **Precipitate G and B Identification**: Heating G releases B, which melts near 277 K (4\u00b0C). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), as its melting point is 273 K (0\u00b0C), close to 277 K. The precipitate G must decompose into water upon heating, indicating G is aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083), which decomposes to Al\u2082O\u2083 and H\u2082O.\n\n3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product has two oxygen atoms. A common reagent for reducing keto acids to diols (with two oxygen atoms) is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH\u2084). Since X incorporates a heavier isotope (deuterium), the analog is LiAlD\u2084.\n\n4. **Elements in LiAlD\u2084**: The elements are lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and deuterium (D, an isotope of hydrogen). The lightest element is hydrogen (D, atomic mass ~2), and the heaviest is aluminum (atomic mass ~27). Their sum is **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nThe correct answer is **D) 29**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about identifying Substance X and then calculating the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the question mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, maybe it's a compound where one element is present as a heavy isotope, like deuterium instead of hydrogen, or something similar. \n\nNext, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. The number of protons equals neutrons. Let's see: Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So no. Helium has 2 protons, maybe 2 neutrons (He-4), but He has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Then the molecule would have each atom contributing protons and neutrons. Wait, but the question says the molecule as a whole has equal numbers? Or per atom? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let's think of common gases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen gas (H2). Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so total protons would be 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. If it's deuterium gas (D2), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons 2, neutrons 2. That works. So maybe the gas W is D2? But the problem says the molecule's neutrons and protons are equal. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's see. \n\nAnother possibility: H2O? No, that's a liquid. Maybe methane? CH4? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the gas is hydrogen, but as deuterium. So if W is D2, that would fit. \n\nThe reaction also forms a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Let's convert that to Celsius. 277 K is about 5 degrees Celsius (since 273.15 is 0\u00b0C, so 277 is 3.85\u00b0C). That's a very low melting point. Common substances with such a melting point... Hmm, maybe water? Wait, water's melting point is 273 K. 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ammonium chloride? Let me think. Wait, maybe B is a metal? Or another compound. \n\nWait, the precipitate G when heated releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate? When heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide? But the melting point of the oxide... Alternatively, maybe G is a metal hydroxide that when heated decomposes into metal oxide and water. Then B would be the oxide. The melting point of B is 277 K. Let me check some oxides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a substance like bromine? Wait, bromine's melting point is around 266 K, which is close but a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like ammonium chloride, which melts at 338 K, which is higher. Hmm. Wait, perhaps B is a metal? Let me think of metals with melting points around 5\u00b0C. That's really low. Mercury's melting point is -38\u00b0C (235 K), so that's lower. Gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K), which is higher. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound like ice? But that's H2O, which melts at 273 K. Close, but not exactly 277. Hmm. Maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe the precipitate G is something like sodium bicarbonate, which when heated releases CO2 (gas W?), but then B would be sodium carbonate? But sodium carbonate's melting point is much higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and water. Let's think of the reaction of a metal with water. For example, sodium reacting with water produces NaOH, H2 gas. The H2 would be gas W. The precipitate might be NaOH? But sodium hydroxide is soluble. Wait, maybe the metal is potassium? Still, KOH is soluble. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a more reactive metal like calcium? Calcium reacting with water produces Ca(OH)2, which is a precipitate. Wait, calcium hydroxide has low solubility, so maybe that forms a precipitate G. Then when heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. Then B would be CaO (calcium oxide). The melting point of calcium oxide is 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way higher than 277 K. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe another approach. The question mentions that Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents... Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) is a reagent. But it reacts with water violently. Let me think. LiAlH4 reacts with water to form LiAlO2, Al(OH)3, and H2 gas. The H2 would be gas W. The precipitate might be Al(OH)3, which is insoluble. When heated, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. Then B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C (2345 K), way too high. Not matching 277 K. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a Grignard reagent? Like phenylmagnesium bromide. But Grignard reagents react with water to produce Mg(OH)Br and the phenyl group. The precipitate might be Mg(OH)Br, which when heated might release something else. Not sure. \n\nWait the question says the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. A keto acid would have a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH). Wait, actually, a keto acid has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group? Like acetoacetate? For example, acetoacetic acid is a 3-keto acid. But when reacted with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with a reducing agent. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent used in organic chemistry. If the keto acid is reduced, perhaps the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product has exactly two oxygen atoms. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is, say, acetone (which is a ketone, not an acid, but maybe the question refers to a different structure). Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (propanedioic acid?), but when reacted with a hydride reagent like LiAlH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol? Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a hydride reagent, like NaBH4 or LiAlH4, then when reacting with a keto acid, the product would have less oxygen. Let me think of an example: if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen in the ketone and two in the carboxylic acid?), then after reduction, maybe the product has two oxygen? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol, which has one oxygen, but maybe other groups. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- X reacts with liquid Y (probably water, since it's common) to produce gas W (H2?), precipitate G, which when heated gives B with melting point ~277 K.\n\n- X has a heavier isotope of one element. For example, if X contains deuterium (D), which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. \n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of sodium with heavy water (D2O). Sodium reacts with D2O to form NaOD (sodium deuteroxide) and D2 gas. The gas W would be D2. Then the precipitate might not be there, but maybe in another case. Alternatively, perhaps the substance X is a metal hydride, like lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4) instead of the usual LiAlH4. Since the question mentions X incorporates a heavier isotope, maybe the hydride uses deuterium instead of hydrogen. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then when it reacts with water (liquid Y), it would produce LiAlO2, and maybe release D2 gas (since the hydride would react with water to release D2). The precipitate could be aluminum hydroxide, which is insoluble? Wait, but the product would be LiAlO2 and maybe Al(OH)3 as a precipitate? Hmm. \n\nThe precipitate G would then be Al(OH)3, which when heated decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. But then B would be Al2O3, whose melting point is way too high. Not matching the 277 K. \n\nHmm, maybe the product B is something else. Let me think again. Maybe the reaction is between sodium and water, but with deuterium. Let's try that. Sodium (Na) reacting with D2O would produce NaOD and D2 gas. The product would be NaOD in solution, but since NaOD is soluble, maybe there's no precipitate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between calcium and water. Calcium reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 (which is a precipitate as it's not very soluble) and H2 gas. The gas W is H2. Then when G (Ca(OH)2) is heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. Then B would be CaO (calcium oxide). The melting point of CaO is about 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way too high. Not matching. \n\nWait the melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing point of water. So maybe B is a substance that melts at that temperature, like a eutectic mixture? Or perhaps it's a compound like ammonium chloride? Wait, ammonium chloride's melting point is 338 K (65\u00b0C). Not close. \n\nWait, maybe B is a metal? Let me think of metals with low melting points. Gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K). That's higher than 277. Mercury is -38\u00b0C (235 K), too low. Bismuth melts at about 271\u00b0C (544 K). No. Maybe the substance is a different compound. Wait, perhaps B is water? But water's melting point is 273 K. Close, but not exactly 277. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate? Or maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The melting point of B under normal conditions is very close to 277 K. Let me check the melting point of ice again. 273.15 K. 277 is about 4\u00b0C. Maybe B is a compound that's solid at room temperature but melts just above freezing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a substance like ethanol? Ethanol's melting point is -114\u00b0C (159 K), no. \n\nWait, maybe B is a metal oxide that's actually a solid with low melting point? Not sure. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question also says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of that. If the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group), then reacting it with a reducing agent like LiAlH4 would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid would become a primary alcohol, and the ketone would become a secondary alcohol. The product would have two oxygen atoms? Let's see: Acetoacetic acid has three oxygens (two in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). After reduction, the carboxylic becomes -CH2OH (so one O), and the ketone becomes -CH(OH)CH2OH? Wait, maybe the product would have fewer oxygens. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol with only one oxygen, but the question says two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something else. Let me think of another example. If the keto acid is something like 2-oxopropanoic acid (which is pyruvic acid), which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. If you reduce it with LiAlH4, you get a diol? Maybe. But the product's oxygen count might still be two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with X (a hydride) gives an alcohol with two oxygen atoms? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent. Let's say the Grignard reagent reacts with a keto acid. For example, phenylmagnesium bromide reacting with a keto acid would form an alcohol. But the product would have an oxygen from the alcohol. Maybe the product has two oxygens? Not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key here is that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let's consider that. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (a diketone?), but that's not an acid. Alternatively, maybe the product after reaction has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction of a ketone with a hydride. For example, LiAlH4 reduces a ketone to an alcohol, removing an oxygen. So if the original keto acid had three oxygens (like a carboxylic acid plus ketone), then after reduction, maybe two oxygens remain? Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the product is a diol (two alcohol groups) with two oxygen atoms. That would work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Let me think of the reaction with a keto acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of the keto acid with X produces a compound with two oxygen atoms. Let's try to think of X. \n\nWait, the problem says that X and its very close analog are used as reagents. So maybe the analog is the regular form (without the heavy isotope). So for example, if X is LiAlD4, its analog is LiAlH4. Both are common reducing agents. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then when it reacts with water (liquid Y), the reaction would produce LiAlO2, and D2 gas. The precipitate might be aluminum hydroxide, but maybe that's not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with water produces the hydroxide and the gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with something else. Let me think again about the gas W. The gas's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's see:\n\nIf the gas is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2. Neutrons: 0. Not equal. \n\nIf it's D2 (deuterium), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Total protons: 2, neutrons: 2. So that works. \n\nSo W is D2. So the reaction produces deuterium gas. So the substance X must be a hydride but using deuterium. \n\nSo X is likely a metal hydride where the hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. For example, LiAlD4 instead of LiAlH4. \n\nSo the elements in X would be Li, Al, and D (deuterium, which is an isotope of H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (or D, but they're the same element). The heaviest is Al (atomic number 13). Wait, but the elements present are Li (atomic number 3), Al (13), and D (1). Wait, D is still hydrogen, so the elements are Li, Al, and H (or D, but same element). \n\nWait, the question asks for the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The lightest is hydrogen (element 1), and the heaviest is aluminum (13). But wait, what about lithium? Lithium is element 3, so lighter than Al but heavier than H. \n\nSo the lightest is H (mass 1 or 2 for D?), but the question says to consider isotopes. Wait, the problem states \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" \n\nWait, so for each element in X, we need to consider all instances. For example, if X has multiple hydrogen atoms, each as deuterium, then their total mass would be sum all the isotopes. But in this case, the substance X uses a heavier isotope of one element. So, for example, in LiAlD4, the hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. \n\nSo the elements are Li (mass ~7), Al (~27), and D (mass ~2). \n\nSo the lightest element is H (but as D, its atomic mass is 2). Wait, but the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements present\". The element with the lowest atomic number is H (even if it's deuterium, it's still H). The atomic mass of H in this case would be the mass of deuterium, which is 2. So the lightest element's atomic mass is 2 (since all H are D here). The heaviest element is Al (mass 27). \n\nWait, but lithium is part of the compound. Li's atomic mass is approximately 6.94. So the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (as H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (atomic number 1), with all its atoms in X being D (mass 2 each). The heaviest is Al (atomic mass ~27). \n\nSo the cumulative atomic masses would be (2) + (27) = 29? \n\nWait, but the options include 29 (option D). Let me confirm. \n\nWait, LiAlD4 has Li (mass ~7), Al (~27), and four D atoms (each 2). The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses. The lightest is H (element 1, with atomic mass 2 here, since all are deuterium), the heaviest is Al (27). So adding 2+27 = 29. That's option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lightest element is lithium? No, hydrogen is lighter. \n\nWait, the atomic mass of the lightest element (H, which is D here) is 2, and the heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. \n\nYes, that would be option D. \n\nLet me check the other parts of the question again to confirm. \n\nThe product of the keto acid and X (LiAlD4) would form what? Let's see, if the keto acid is, say, a compound like acetoacetic acid, then reduction with LiAlH4 would give a diol. But with LiAlD4, maybe the product has deuterium instead of H. However, the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of the product. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanone acid (but not sure), maybe after reduction, the oxygen count reduces. Suppose the original keto acid has three oxygen atoms (like a carboxylic acid and a ketone group). The product would lose one oxygen (maybe the carboxylic becomes an alcohol, so two oxygens left?), so that fits. \n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let's say the reaction of LiAlD4 with water produces Al(OH)3 as a precipitate (if it's insoluble). When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. But the melting point of Al2O3 is way higher than 277 K. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see, perhaps the precipitate isn't Al(OH)3. Let me think again. \n\nWait, when LiAlH4 reacts with water, the reaction is: \n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191 \n\nSo the precipitate is Al(OH)3. When heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3, which has a very high melting point. But the question states B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4\u00b0C. That's conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink the substance X. \n\nWait, perhaps X is not LiAlD4 but another compound. Let's consider sodium. Suppose X is sodium metal, but with a heavier isotope. Wait, sodium has isotopes, but the heavier ones are not common. Alternatively, maybe the substance is a hydride like NaH, but with deuterium (NaD). \n\nSodium deuteride (NaD) reacts with water (H2O) to produce NaOD and D2 gas. The reaction would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOD + D\u2191 (but wait, maybe more accurately: \n\nThe reaction is: \n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2? \n\nWait, maybe:\n\n2 NaD + 2 H2O \u2192 2 NaOH + 2 D2O + D2\u2191? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nNaD reacts with H2O to produce NaOH, D2O, and D2 gas. \n\nIn any case, the gas W would be D2. The precipitate might not form here since NaOH is soluble. So maybe the precipitate isn't part of this reaction. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the reaction isn't sodium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is calcium hydride (CaH2), but with deuterium (CaD2). Let's see:\n\nCalcium deuteride (CaD2) reacting with water would produce Ca(OH)2 and D2 gas. \n\nCaD2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2 + 2 D2\u2191 \n\nThe precipitate here would be Ca(OH)2, which is slightly soluble. When heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B would be CaO (calcium oxide), which has a melting point around 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way too high. Doesn't fit the 277 K. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is magnesium hydride (MgH2) with deuterium (MgD2). Reacting with water:\n\nMgD2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2 D2\u2191 \n\nThe precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated decomposes into MgO and H2O. MgO's melting point is around 2852\u00b0C (3125 K). Still way too high. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of B's melting point again. 277 K is about 4\u00b0C. What substance has a melting point around that? \n\nWater ice's melting point is 273 K, so close. Maybe B is water? But when G is heated, it releases B. If G is a hydrate, like calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), when heated, it loses water. Then B would be the anhydrous form. But the melting point of anhydrous calcium sulfate is around 1500\u00b0C, not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a different hydrate. Wait, maybe the precipitate G is something like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The B here would be Na2CO3, which melts at about 851\u00b0C (1124 K). No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a borohydride and water. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reacting with water: \n\nNaBH4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaBO2 + 4 H2\u2191 + ... \n\nWait, the products are NaBO2, which is sodium metaborate, and H2 gas. The precipitate might be borate, but sodium metaborate is soluble. So no precipitate. \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nThe problem states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's suppose that X is a reducing agent. When a keto acid is reduced, the ketone group becomes an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid group becomes an alcohol as well (since carboxylic acid is more oxidized). So a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (which has a carboxylic acid and a ketone) would become a diol, with two alcohol groups. Each alcohol has one oxygen, so total two oxygens. That fits. \n\nSo the product has two oxygen atoms. So the reaction of the keto acid with X produces a diol with two oxygen atoms. \n\nSo X is a reducing agent. Common reducing agents in organic chemistry are LiAlH4, NaBH4. \n\nSince the question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements, maybe it's LiAlD4 (instead of LiAlH4). \n\nSo the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (which is H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (D, mass 2), the heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29. \n\nSo the answer is D) 29. \n\nEven though earlier there was a problem with B's melting point, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me see. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4, the reaction with water produces LiAlO2, and D2 gas. The precipitate might be aluminum hydroxide? Wait, the reaction is: \n\nLiAlD4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 D2\u2191 \n\nSo Al(OH)3 is the precipitate. When heated, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B is Al2O3. But Al2O3 has a very high melting point. Hmm. \n\nBut the question says the melting point of B is around 277 K. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the precipitate is not Al(OH)3 but something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with a different metal. \n\nWait, maybe X is not LiAlD4 but something else. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is sodium, and the reaction is with heavy water. \n\nSodium reacting with D2O: \n\n2 Na + 2 D2O \u2192 2 NaOD + D2\u2191 \n\nThe products are sodium deuteroxide (soluble) and D2 gas. No precipitate. So that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is the metal itself? No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is not water but something else. The question says liquid Y. Common liquid could be ethanol or something else, but more likely water. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a metal hydride and another substance. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question says that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So X reduces the keto acid to a diol, as I thought earlier. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, D (H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2, since it's D), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29. \n\nThe problem with B's melting point might be a red herring, or I might have made a mistake in identifying B. Let's see, if G is Al(OH)3, then when heated, it gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. But the melting point is way too high. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is not Al(OH)3 but something else. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between calcium hydride (CaD2) and water, producing Ca(OH)2 (precipitate), which when heated gives CaO and H2O. B is CaO, which has a very high melting point. \n\nHmm, maybe the substance X is not a metal hydride. \n\nWait, another possibility: the substance X is a Grignard reagent. For example, phenylmagnesium bromide (PhMgBr). The heavier isotope could be deuterium in the phenyl group, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So perhaps the Mg is a heavier isotope? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Grignard reagent uses deuterium instead of hydrogen in the alkyl or aryl group. But that's more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride with deuterium, like NaBD4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is a metal such as sodium, but with a heavier isotope of sodium? Sodium has isotopes like 23Na (most common) and 23Na is already the major isotope. Not sure. \n\nHmm, given that the answer seems to fit as 29, and the problem might have a trick with B's melting point (maybe B is water, but that's part of the decomposition?), perhaps I should proceed with that. \n\nThe calculation gives 2 (H's atomic mass as D) + 27 (Al) = 29. \n\nThe options have D as 29, so I think that's the answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question involves identifying Substance X and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Key clues include:\n\n1. **Reaction with Liquid Y (likely water)**: Produces gas W (with equal protons and neutrons, suggesting deuterium gas, D\u2082) and precipitate G. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (close to water's melting point but slightly higher, possibly a different compound).\n2. **Substance X's Isotope**: Incorporates a heavier isotope (e.g., deuterium for hydrogen).\n3. **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: X and its analog (e.g., LiAlH\u2084) are common reducing agents.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about identifying Substance X and then calculating the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the question mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, maybe it's a compound where one element is present as a heavy isotope, like deuterium instead of hydrogen, or something similar. \n\nNext, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. The number of protons equals neutrons. Let's see: Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So no. Helium has 2 protons, maybe 2 neutrons (He-4), but He has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, He-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Then the molecule would have each atom contributing protons and neutrons. Wait, but the question says the molecule as a whole has equal numbers? Or per atom? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let's think of common gases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen gas (H2). Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so total protons would be 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. If it's deuterium gas (D2), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so total protons 2, neutrons 2. That works. So maybe the gas W is D2? But the problem says the molecule's neutrons and protons are equal. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's see. \n\nAnother possibility: H2O? No, that's a liquid. Maybe methane? CH4? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the gas is hydrogen, but as deuterium. So if W is D2, that would fit. \n\nThe reaction also forms a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Let's convert that to Celsius. 277 K is about 5 degrees Celsius (since 273.15 is 0\u00b0C, so 277 is 3.85\u00b0C). That's a very low melting point. Common substances with such a melting point... Hmm, maybe water? Wait, water's melting point is 273 K. 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ammonium chloride? Let me think. Wait, maybe B is a metal? Or another compound. \n\nWait, the precipitate G when heated releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate? When heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide? But the melting point of the oxide... Alternatively, maybe G is a metal hydroxide that when heated decomposes into metal oxide and water. Then B would be the oxide. The melting point of B is 277 K. Let me check some oxides. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a substance like bromine? Wait, bromine's melting point is around 266 K, which is close but a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like ammonium chloride, which melts at 338 K, which is higher. Hmm. Wait, perhaps B is a metal? Let me think of metals with melting points around 5\u00b0C. That's really low. Mercury's melting point is -38\u00b0C (235 K), so that's lower. Gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K), which is higher. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound like ice? But that's H2O, which melts at 273 K. Close, but not exactly 277. Hmm. Maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe the precipitate G is something like sodium bicarbonate, which when heated releases CO2 (gas W?), but then B would be sodium carbonate? But sodium carbonate's melting point is much higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and water. Let's think of the reaction of a metal with water. For example, sodium reacting with water produces NaOH, H2 gas. The H2 would be gas W. The precipitate might be NaOH? But sodium hydroxide is soluble. Wait, maybe the metal is potassium? Still, KOH is soluble. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a more reactive metal like calcium? Calcium reacting with water produces Ca(OH)2, which is a precipitate. Wait, calcium hydroxide has low solubility, so maybe that forms a precipitate G. Then when heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. Then B would be CaO (calcium oxide). The melting point of calcium oxide is 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way higher than 277 K. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe another approach. The question mentions that Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents... Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) is a reagent. But it reacts with water violently. Let me think. LiAlH4 reacts with water to form LiAlO2, Al(OH)3, and H2 gas. The H2 would be gas W. The precipitate might be Al(OH)3, which is insoluble. When heated, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. Then B would be Al2O3. The melting point of Al2O3 is around 2072\u00b0C (2345 K), way too high. Not matching 277 K. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is a Grignard reagent? Like phenylmagnesium bromide. But Grignard reagents react with water to produce Mg(OH)Br and the phenyl group. The precipitate might be Mg(OH)Br, which when heated might release something else. Not sure. \n\nWait the question says the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. A keto acid would have a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH). Wait, actually, a keto acid has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group? Like acetoacetate? For example, acetoacetic acid is a 3-keto acid. But when reacted with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with a reducing agent. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent used in organic chemistry. If the keto acid is reduced, perhaps the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product has exactly two oxygen atoms. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is, say, acetone (which is a ketone, not an acid, but maybe the question refers to a different structure). Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like 3-oxobutyric acid (propanedioic acid?), but when reacted with a hydride reagent like LiAlH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol? Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if X is a hydride reagent, like NaBH4 or LiAlH4, then when reacting with a keto acid, the product would have less oxygen. Let me think of an example: if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two oxygen in the ketone and two in the carboxylic acid?), then after reduction, maybe the product has two oxygen? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol, which has one oxygen, but maybe other groups. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- X reacts with liquid Y (probably water, since it's common) to produce gas W (H2?), precipitate G, which when heated gives B with melting point ~277 K.\n\n- X has a heavier isotope of one element. For example, if X contains deuterium (D), which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. \n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of sodium with heavy water (D2O). Sodium reacts with D2O to form NaOD (sodium deuteroxide) and D2 gas. The gas W would be D2. Then the precipitate might not be there, but maybe in another case. Alternatively, perhaps the substance X is a metal hydride, like lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4) instead of the usual LiAlH4. Since the question mentions X incorporates a heavier isotope, maybe the hydride uses deuterium instead of hydrogen. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then when it reacts with water (liquid Y), it would produce LiAlO2, and maybe release D2 gas (since the hydride would react with water to release D2). The precipitate could be aluminum hydroxide, which is insoluble? Wait, but the product would be LiAlO2 and maybe Al(OH)3 as a precipitate? Hmm. \n\nThe precipitate G would then be Al(OH)3, which when heated decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. But then B would be Al2O3, whose melting point is way too high. Not matching the 277 K. \n\nHmm, maybe the product B is something else. Let me think again. Maybe the reaction is between sodium and water, but with deuterium. Let's try that. Sodium (Na) reacting with D2O would produce NaOD and D2 gas. The product would be NaOD in solution, but since NaOD is soluble, maybe there's no precipitate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is between calcium and water. Calcium reacts with water to form Ca(OH)2 (which is a precipitate as it's not very soluble) and H2 gas. The gas W is H2. Then when G (Ca(OH)2) is heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. Then B would be CaO (calcium oxide). The melting point of CaO is about 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way too high. Not matching. \n\nWait the melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4\u00b0C. That's just above freezing point of water. So maybe B is a substance that melts at that temperature, like a eutectic mixture? Or perhaps it's a compound like ammonium chloride? Wait, ammonium chloride's melting point is 338 K (65\u00b0C). Not close. \n\nWait, maybe B is a metal? Let me think of metals with low melting points. Gallium melts at about 30\u00b0C (303 K). That's higher than 277. Mercury is -38\u00b0C (235 K), too low. Bismuth melts at about 271\u00b0C (544 K). No. Maybe the substance is a different compound. Wait, perhaps B is water? But water's melting point is 273 K. Close, but not exactly 277. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate? Or maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The melting point of B under normal conditions is very close to 277 K. Let me check the melting point of ice again. 273.15 K. 277 is about 4\u00b0C. Maybe B is a compound that's solid at room temperature but melts just above freezing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a substance like ethanol? Ethanol's melting point is -114\u00b0C (159 K), no. \n\nWait, maybe B is a metal oxide that's actually a solid with low melting point? Not sure. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question also says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of that. If the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid group), then reacting it with a reducing agent like LiAlH4 would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid would become a primary alcohol, and the ketone would become a secondary alcohol. The product would have two oxygen atoms? Let's see: Acetoacetic acid has three oxygens (two in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). After reduction, the carboxylic becomes -CH2OH (so one O), and the ketone becomes -CH(OH)CH2OH? Wait, maybe the product would have fewer oxygens. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol with only one oxygen, but the question says two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the keto acid is something else. Let me think of another example. If the keto acid is something like 2-oxopropanoic acid (which is pyruvic acid), which has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. If you reduce it with LiAlH4, you get a diol? Maybe. But the product's oxygen count might still be two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of a keto acid with X (a hydride) gives an alcohol with two oxygen atoms? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent. Let's say the Grignard reagent reacts with a keto acid. For example, phenylmagnesium bromide reacting with a keto acid would form an alcohol. But the product would have an oxygen from the alcohol. Maybe the product has two oxygens? Not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key here is that the product has two oxygen atoms. Let's consider that. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetylacetone (a diketone?), but that's not an acid. Alternatively, maybe the product after reaction has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of the reaction of a ketone with a hydride. For example, LiAlH4 reduces a ketone to an alcohol, removing an oxygen. So if the original keto acid had three oxygens (like a carboxylic acid plus ketone), then after reduction, maybe two oxygens remain? Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the product is a diol (two alcohol groups) with two oxygen atoms. That would work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Let me think of the reaction with a keto acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of the keto acid with X produces a compound with two oxygen atoms. Let's try to think of X. \n\nWait, the problem says that X and its very close analog are used as reagents. So maybe the analog is the regular form (without the heavy isotope). So for example, if X is LiAlD4, its analog is LiAlH4. Both are common reducing agents. \n\nSo if X is LiAlD4, then when it reacts with water (liquid Y), the reaction would produce LiAlO2, and D2 gas. The precipitate might be aluminum hydroxide, but maybe that's not a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with water produces the hydroxide and the gas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with something else. Let me think again about the gas W. The gas's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's see:\n\nIf the gas is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Total protons: 2. Neutrons: 0. Not equal. \n\nIf it's D2 (deuterium), each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Total protons: 2, neutrons: 2. So that works. \n\nSo W is D2. So the reaction produces deuterium gas. So the substance X must be a hydride but using deuterium. \n\nSo X is likely a metal hydride where the hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. For example, LiAlD4 instead of LiAlH4. \n\nSo the elements in X would be Li, Al, and D (deuterium, which is an isotope of H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (or D, but they're the same element). The heaviest is Al (atomic number 13). Wait, but the elements present are Li (atomic number 3), Al (13), and D (1). Wait, D is still hydrogen, so the elements are Li, Al, and H (or D, but same element). \n\nWait, the question asks for the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The lightest is hydrogen (element 1), and the heaviest is aluminum (13). But wait, what about lithium? Lithium is element 3, so lighter than Al but heavier than H. \n\nSo the lightest is H (mass 1 or 2 for D?), but the question says to consider isotopes. Wait, the problem states \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" \n\nWait, so for each element in X, we need to consider all instances. For example, if X has multiple hydrogen atoms, each as deuterium, then their total mass would be sum all the isotopes. But in this case, the substance X uses a heavier isotope of one element. So, for example, in LiAlD4, the hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. \n\nSo the elements are Li (mass ~7), Al (~27), and D (mass ~2). \n\nSo the lightest element is H (but as D, its atomic mass is 2). Wait, but the question says \"the lightest and heaviest elements present\". The element with the lowest atomic number is H (even if it's deuterium, it's still H). The atomic mass of H in this case would be the mass of deuterium, which is 2. So the lightest element's atomic mass is 2 (since all H are D here). The heaviest element is Al (mass 27). \n\nWait, but lithium is part of the compound. Li's atomic mass is approximately 6.94. So the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (as H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (atomic number 1), with all its atoms in X being D (mass 2 each). The heaviest is Al (atomic mass ~27). \n\nSo the cumulative atomic masses would be (2) + (27) = 29? \n\nWait, but the options include 29 (option D). Let me confirm. \n\nWait, LiAlD4 has Li (mass ~7), Al (~27), and four D atoms (each 2). The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses. The lightest is H (element 1, with atomic mass 2 here, since all are deuterium), the heaviest is Al (27). So adding 2+27 = 29. That's option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lightest element is lithium? No, hydrogen is lighter. \n\nWait, the atomic mass of the lightest element (H, which is D here) is 2, and the heaviest is Al (27). So 2 +27 =29. \n\nYes, that would be option D. \n\nLet me check the other parts of the question again to confirm. \n\nThe product of the keto acid and X (LiAlD4) would form what? Let's see, if the keto acid is, say, a compound like acetoacetic acid, then reduction with LiAlH4 would give a diol. But with LiAlD4, maybe the product has deuterium instead of H. However, the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think of the product. For example, if the keto acid is something like propanone acid (but not sure), maybe after reduction, the oxygen count reduces. Suppose the original keto acid has three oxygen atoms (like a carboxylic acid and a ketone group). The product would lose one oxygen (maybe the carboxylic becomes an alcohol, so two oxygens left?), so that fits. \n\nThe precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Let's say the reaction of LiAlD4 with water produces Al(OH)3 as a precipitate (if it's insoluble). When heated, Al(OH)3 decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. But the melting point of Al2O3 is way higher than 277 K. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see, perhaps the precipitate isn't Al(OH)3. Let me think again. \n\nWait, when LiAlH4 reacts with water, the reaction is: \n\nLiAlH4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 H2\u2191 \n\nSo the precipitate is Al(OH)3. When heated, it decomposes to Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3, which has a very high melting point. But the question states B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4\u00b0C. That's conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink the substance X. \n\nWait, perhaps X is not LiAlD4 but another compound. Let's consider sodium. Suppose X is sodium metal, but with a heavier isotope. Wait, sodium has isotopes, but the heavier ones are not common. Alternatively, maybe the substance is a hydride like NaH, but with deuterium (NaD). \n\nSodium deuteride (NaD) reacts with water (H2O) to produce NaOD and D2 gas. The reaction would be:\n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOD + D\u2191 (but wait, maybe more accurately: \n\nThe reaction is: \n\nNaD + H2O \u2192 NaOH + D2? \n\nWait, maybe:\n\n2 NaD + 2 H2O \u2192 2 NaOH + 2 D2O + D2\u2191? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nNaD reacts with H2O to produce NaOH, D2O, and D2 gas. \n\nIn any case, the gas W would be D2. The precipitate might not form here since NaOH is soluble. So maybe the precipitate isn't part of this reaction. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the reaction isn't sodium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substance X is calcium hydride (CaH2), but with deuterium (CaD2). Let's see:\n\nCalcium deuteride (CaD2) reacting with water would produce Ca(OH)2 and D2 gas. \n\nCaD2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Ca(OH)2 + 2 D2\u2191 \n\nThe precipitate here would be Ca(OH)2, which is slightly soluble. When heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B would be CaO (calcium oxide), which has a melting point around 2614\u00b0C (2887 K), which is way too high. Doesn't fit the 277 K. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is magnesium hydride (MgH2) with deuterium (MgD2). Reacting with water:\n\nMgD2 + 2 H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2 + 2 D2\u2191 \n\nThe precipitate is Mg(OH)2, which when heated decomposes into MgO and H2O. MgO's melting point is around 2852\u00b0C (3125 K). Still way too high. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of B's melting point again. 277 K is about 4\u00b0C. What substance has a melting point around that? \n\nWater ice's melting point is 273 K, so close. Maybe B is water? But when G is heated, it releases B. If G is a hydrate, like calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), when heated, it loses water. Then B would be the anhydrous form. But the melting point of anhydrous calcium sulfate is around 1500\u00b0C, not close. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a different hydrate. Wait, maybe the precipitate G is something like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The B here would be Na2CO3, which melts at about 851\u00b0C (1124 K). No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between a borohydride and water. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reacting with water: \n\nNaBH4 + 2 H2O \u2192 NaBO2 + 4 H2\u2191 + ... \n\nWait, the products are NaBO2, which is sodium metaborate, and H2 gas. The precipitate might be borate, but sodium metaborate is soluble. So no precipitate. \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nThe problem states that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Let's suppose that X is a reducing agent. When a keto acid is reduced, the ketone group becomes an alcohol, and the carboxylic acid group becomes an alcohol as well (since carboxylic acid is more oxidized). So a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (which has a carboxylic acid and a ketone) would become a diol, with two alcohol groups. Each alcohol has one oxygen, so total two oxygens. That fits. \n\nSo the product has two oxygen atoms. So the reaction of the keto acid with X produces a diol with two oxygen atoms. \n\nSo X is a reducing agent. Common reducing agents in organic chemistry are LiAlH4, NaBH4. \n\nSince the question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements, maybe it's LiAlD4 (instead of LiAlH4). \n\nSo the elements in X are Li, Al, and D (which is H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (D, mass 2), the heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 2+27=29. \n\nSo the answer is D) 29. \n\nEven though earlier there was a problem with B's melting point, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me see. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4, the reaction with water produces LiAlO2, and D2 gas. The precipitate might be aluminum hydroxide? Wait, the reaction is: \n\nLiAlD4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3\u2193 + 4 D2\u2191 \n\nSo Al(OH)3 is the precipitate. When heated, it decomposes into Al2O3 and H2O. So B is Al2O3. But Al2O3 has a very high melting point. Hmm. \n\nBut the question says the melting point of B is around 277 K. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the precipitate is not Al(OH)3 but something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is with a different metal. \n\nWait, maybe X is not LiAlD4 but something else. \n\nWait, perhaps the substance X is sodium, and the reaction is with heavy water. \n\nSodium reacting with D2O: \n\n2 Na + 2 D2O \u2192 2 NaOD + D2\u2191 \n\nThe products are sodium deuteroxide (soluble) and D2 gas. No precipitate. So that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the precipitate is the metal itself? No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the liquid Y is not water but something else. The question says liquid Y. Common liquid could be ethanol or something else, but more likely water. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a metal hydride and another substance. Let me think of another approach. \n\nThe question says that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So X reduces the keto acid to a diol, as I thought earlier. \n\nIf X is LiAlD4, then the elements in X are Li, Al, D (H). \n\nThe lightest element is H (mass 2, since it's D), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 29. \n\nThe problem with B's melting point might be a red herring, or I might have made a mistake in identifying B. Let's see, if G is Al(OH)3, then when heated, it gives Al2O3 and H2O. So B would be Al2O3. But the melting point is way too high. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is not Al(OH)3 but something else. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between calcium hydride (CaD2) and water, producing Ca(OH)2 (precipitate), which when heated gives CaO and H2O. B is CaO, which has a very high melting point. \n\nHmm, maybe the substance X is not a metal hydride. \n\nWait, another possibility: the substance X is a Grignard reagent. For example, phenylmagnesium bromide (PhMgBr). The heavier isotope could be deuterium in the phenyl group, but the question says \"heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". So perhaps the Mg is a heavier isotope? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Grignard reagent uses deuterium instead of hydrogen in the alkyl or aryl group. But that's more complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride with deuterium, like NaBD4? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance X is a metal such as sodium, but with a heavier isotope of sodium? Sodium has isotopes like 23Na (most common) and 23Na is already the major isotope. Not sure. \n\nHmm, given that the answer seems to fit as 29, and the problem might have a trick with B's melting point (maybe B is water, but that's part of the decomposition?), perhaps I should proceed with that. \n\nThe calculation gives 2 (H's atomic mass as D) + 27 (Al) = 29. \n\nThe options have D as 29, so I think that's the answer.\n\n\nThe question involves identifying Substance X and calculating the sum of the atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements. Key clues include:\n\n1. **Reaction with Liquid Y (likely water)**: Produces gas W (with equal protons and neutrons, suggesting deuterium gas, D\u2082) and precipitate G. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (close to water's melting point but slightly higher, possibly a different compound).\n2. **Substance X's Isotope**: Incorporates a heavier isotope (e.g., deuterium for hydrogen).\n3. **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: X and its analog (e.g., LiAlH\u2084) are common reducing agents. LiAlD\u2084 (with deuterium) fits, as it reduces keto acids to diols (two oxygen atoms).\n4. **Elements in X**: Li (lighter than Al), Al (heaviest), and D (heavier isotope of H, the lightest element).\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Lightest element (H, as deuterium, atomic mass = 2).\n- Heaviest element (Al, atomic mass \u2248 27).\n- Sum: **2 + 27 = 29**.\n\nAnswer: D) 29.\n\nAnswer: D",
