      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photons. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the angle between the two photons produced when an electron and a positron annihilate each other. Both have certain Lorentz factors, and the photons have the same energy but are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. I need to figure out the angle between their directions. \n\nFirst, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their collision should be head-on, right? Wait, but the problem states that both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the same axis. \n\nThe key points here are conservation of momentum and energy. Since photons have momentum, the total momentum before and after the collision must be the same. Also, the energies of the photons are equal. The problem says both photons have the same energy, so that's a clue. \n\nLet me recall that the energy of a photon is E = pc, since photons have no rest mass. So their energies are related to their momenta. Since their energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum must be equal. \n\nLet me denote the electron's Lorentz factor as \u03b3_e = 4, and the positron's as \u03b3_p = 2. The rest mass of each is m_e (electron mass). \n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The energy of each is \u03b3*mc\u00b2. So total energy E_total = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2 + \u03b3_p m c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2. Since energy is conserved, the total energy of the two photons must also be 6 m c\u00b2. Since each photon has energy E_photon = E/2 = 3 m c\u00b2 each. \n\nNow, the momenta. The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is positive x). The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative x direction). \n\nThe momentum of the electron is p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. Wait, but to get the momentum, maybe I need to express it in terms of Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the momentum of a relativistic particle is \u03b3 m v. But since the Lorentz factor is given, perhaps I can write the momentum as sqrt( (\u03b3 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of relativistic momentum components. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is one-dimensional before the collision (along the x-axis), but after collision, the photons can have components in other directions. Since the photons have the same energy, and their directions are symmetric in some way, maybe their momenta vectors add up to zero in the x-direction? Because the total momentum before collision must equal the total after.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let's set up coordinates: let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). \n\nSo the electron's momentum is in the positive x direction, and the positron's is negative. Let me compute their magnitudes. \n\nThe momentum of a particle with Lorentz factor \u03b3 is p = \u03b3 m v. But velocity v can be expressed in terms of \u03b3 as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Hmm, maybe I can compute the magnitudes of their momenta first.\n\nAlternatively, since the total energy is 6 m c\u00b2, and the total momentum is the vector sum of their momenta. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p (since one is positive, the other negative). Wait, actually, if I take electron's direction as positive, then the positron's momentum is in the negative direction. So total initial momentum is p_e (electron's momentum) minus p_p (positron's momentum). \n\nBut after collision, the photons can have momenta in any direction. The problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, perhaps. The angle between each photon and the x-axis would be the same but in opposite vertical directions (one above, one below). That would make sense for symmetric situations. \n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p_photon. Since E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2, and E = pc, so p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m c. \n\nThe two photons are moving in directions symmetric about the x-axis. Let me suppose that each makes an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, but one is above and the other below. The angle between the two photons would then be 2\u03b8. Wait, no, the angle between their directions would be 2\u03b8 if they are symmetric. But the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are mirror images across the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis. \n\nNow, to find the angle between the two photons, I need to find 2\u03b8. \n\nNow, applying conservation of momentum. The total momentum after collision must equal the total before. Let's compute the initial momentum. \n\nThe electron's momentum is p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. But since v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3_e\u00b2). Alternatively, the momentum can be written as p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. But maybe it's easier to compute using energy and momentum relationship. \n\nThe energy of the electron is E_e = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2. The momentum of the electron is p_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c? Wait, no. Wait, the relation is (E/c)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc\u00b2/c)^2 ) / c? Wait, let me get this straight. \n\nThe energy of a particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The momentum is p = \u03b3 m v. Alternatively, p = E / c\u00b2 * v. Since v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)), so substituting, p = \u03b3 m c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between energy and momentum:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2 \n\nSo, p = sqrt( (E\u00b2/c\u00b2) - (mc\u00b2)^2/c\u00b2 ) / c? Wait, perhaps better to write p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\nWait, let me see: E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \u2192 p = sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2/c\u00b2 ) * c? Wait, maybe I should just compute p for each particle.\n\nFor the electron (moving to the right):\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2\n\np_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The momentum p is given by:\n\np = \u03b3 m v \n\nBut v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2))\n\nSo p = \u03b3 m c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, using E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2,\n\np = (E / c\u00b2) * v \n\n= (\u03b3 m c\u00b2 / c\u00b2) * v \n\n= \u03b3 m v \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 )\n\nWait, let's compute p_e:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2,\n\nso (E_e / c)^2 = (4 m c)^2,\n\nthen p_e = sqrt( (4 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\n= sqrt( 16 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = m c sqrt(15)\n\nSimilarly for the positron. The positron's energy is 2 m c\u00b2,\n\nso p_p = sqrt( (2 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\n= sqrt(4 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(3 m\u00b2 c\u00b2) = m c sqrt(3)\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is m c sqrt(15) in the +x direction, and the positron's momentum is m c sqrt(3) in the -x direction. Therefore, the total initial momentum is:\n\np_initial = p_e - p_p = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nWait, because the positron's momentum is opposite direction. So the total momentum before collision is (electron's momentum) minus (positron's momentum). \n\nWait, actually, if the positron is moving to the left, then its momentum is in the negative x direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative). So p_initial = p_e - p_p (since p_p is in the opposite direction). \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nNow, after the collision, the two photons have momenta p1 and p2. Each has magnitude p_photon = 3 m c, since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2 (since total energy is 6 m c\u00b2 and they are equal). \n\nThe photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis as \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively. The angle between them would then be 2\u03b8. \n\nSo each photon's momentum vector can be written in components. \n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right) has momentum components:\n\np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8,\n\np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8,\n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right):\n\np2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8,\n\np2_y = -p_photon * sin\u03b8,\n\nBecause it's below the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photons' momenta. \n\nTotal momentum after collision in x-direction:\n\np_total_x = p1_x + p2_x = p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8\n\nTotal momentum in y-direction:\n\np_total_y = p1_y + p2_y = p_photon sin\u03b8 - p_photon sin\u03b8 = 0 \n\nWhich makes sense, because the initial momentum had no y-component. \n\nTherefore, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum after collision equals the total before. \n\nSo, in the x-direction:\n\np_initial = p_total_x \n\n=> m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * p_photon * cos\u03b8 \n\nBut p_photon is the magnitude of each photon's momentum. Since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2, then p_photon = (3 m c\u00b2)/c = 3 m c (since E = pc for photons). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nLeft side: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nRight side: 2 * 3 m c * cos\u03b8 \n\nWe can divide both sides by m c:\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \n\nSolve for cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 \n\nHmm, let me compute the numerical value here. \n\nFirst compute sqrt(15): approx 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) is approx 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nThen \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \n\nCalculating that: arccos(0.3568). Let me think, cos(67 degrees) is about 0.3907, cos(70) is ~0.3428. Since 0.3568 is between those, closer to 70 degrees. Let me compute:\n\ncos(69 degrees) = cos(69) \u2248 0.3584 (since 70 is 0.3428, 69 is a bit higher). \n\nWait 0.3568 is slightly less than 0.3584, so maybe 69.2 degrees or so. Let me see. Let's calculate more precisely. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator-like steps. Let me see:\n\ncos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\n\u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). Let me compute in radians first? Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute it exactly?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(15) is sqrt(9+6) = 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. The difference is about 2.14093. Divided by 6 is approx 0.3568. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation. Wait, let me check the steps again. \n\nWait the equation was:\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 ?\n\nWait, let me recheck the algebra:\n\nWe had p_initial = p_e - p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\np_total_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 \n\np_photon is 3 m c (since E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2 = p c \u2192 p = E/c = 3 m c\u00b2 / c = 3 m c). \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2*(3 m c)*cos\u03b8 \n\nYes, so dividing both sides by m c gives sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u2248 (2.14093)/6\u22480.3568. \n\nThus, \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). \n\nLet me compute this angle. \n\nUsing a calculator (if I imagine), arccos(0.3568):\n\nLet me see, cos(67.5) is about 0.3827, cos(70) is 0.3428. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70. \n\nLet me try 69 degrees: cos(69\u00b0)=cos(69)= approx. Let me compute 69 degrees:\n\ncos(60)=0.5, cos(60)=0.5, cos(60+9)=cos69. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator steps: \n\ncos(69) = 0.3584 (exactly, perhaps 0.3583679). \n\nSo 0.3568 is slightly less than that, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is about 0.0016. Since the cosine decreases as the angle increases, so to get to 0.3568, the angle is 69 + (0.3584-0.3568)/(0.3584 - 0.3428)*1 degree? \n\nWait, the difference between 69 and 70 degrees in cosine is 0.3584 - 0.3428 = 0.0156 per degree. Wait, but that's over 1 degree. \n\nWait, the difference between cos(69) and cos(70) is 0.3584 - 0.3428 = 0.0156 over 1 degree. \n\nWe need to find the angle where cos\u03b8 = 0.3568. The value 0.3568 is 0.3584 - 0.0016. \n\nSo the angle is 69 degrees plus (0.0016)/0.0156 * 1 degree. Wait, but since the cosine decreases as angle increases, the angle would be 69 + (0.3584 - 0.3568)/0.0156 * delta? Hmm, maybe better to compute delta_theta as (0.3584 - 0.3568)/ (derivative?), but perhaps it's easier to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's around 69.5 degrees. Let me see:\n\ncos(69.5) is cos(69 + 0.5). \n\nUsing small angle approximation for the difference:\n\ncos(69 + \u0394\u03b8) \u2248 cos(69) - sin(69)*\u0394\u03b8 (in radians). \n\nWait, let me think in radians. \n\n\u0394\u03b8 = 0.5 degrees = \u03c0/360 radians \u2248 0.0087 radians. \n\ncos(69.5\u00b0) \u2248 cos(69\u00b0) - sin(69\u00b0)*(0.0087)\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584\n\nsin(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.9336\n\nSo the approximate cos(69.5) is 0.3584 - 0.9336*0.0087 \u2248 0.3584 - 0.0081 \u2248 0.3503. \n\nHmm, that's lower than 0.3568. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should do linear approximation between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWe have at 69\u00b0, cos=0.3584\n\nAt 70\u00b0, cos=0.3428\n\nWe need to find x where cos(x)=0.3568 between 69 and 70.\n\nThe difference between 0.3568 and 0.3584 is -0.0016. The total change over 1 degree is -0.0156. \n\nSo the fraction is (0.3568 - 0.3584)/(-0.0156) = (-0.0016)/(-0.0156) \u2248 0.1025. \n\nSo the angle is 69 + 0.1025*(1 degree) \u2248 69.1 degrees. \n\nHmm, so \u03b8 is approximately 69.1 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248 138.2 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which would be the closest. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation again to ensure no mistakes. \n\nWait, the angle between the photons is 2\u03b8. So if \u03b8 is 69 degrees, then 2\u03b8 is 138, which matches option C. \n\nBut let me check the calculation steps again for any possible errors. \n\nFirst, the initial momentum calculation:\n\nElectron's momentum:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2. \n\np_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / (c^2/c) ? Wait, no, let me redo that properly. \n\nThe momentum p is given by p = sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u00b2)/c? Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me recall that:\n\nThe relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3 m v. \n\nAlternatively, since E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2,\n\nthen p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 ) \n\nWait, yes. So p (in units of kg\u00b7m/s?) Let me clarify units. \n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \u2192 \n\nSo p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 ) \n\nWait, no, units: E is in joules (kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2), pc is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so \n\np = sqrt( (E^2 / c^2) - (m^2 c^4) ) / c^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically:\n\nFor electron:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2 \u2192 (E_e/c)^2 = (4 m c\u00b2 / c)^2 = (4 m c)^2 \n\nThen subtract (m c)^2:\n\np_e squared: (4 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 = 16 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 15 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2192 p_e = m c sqrt(15). Correct.\n\nPositron: E_p = 2 m c\u00b2 \u2192 (E_p/c)^2 = (2 m c)^2 \u2192 subtract (m c)^2 \u2192 4 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 3 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2192 p_p = m c sqrt(3). Correct.\n\nTotal initial momentum: p_e - p_p (since positron's is opposite direction):\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nTotal final momentum in x-direction is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8. \n\nPhoton energy: 3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m c. \n\nSo 2*(3 m c) cos\u03b8 = 6 m c cos\u03b8. \n\nSetting equal:\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 m c cos\u03b8 \u2192 divide both sides by m c \u2192 sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 \u2248 (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 \u2248 2.14093/6 \u2248 0.3568 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248 69.1\u00b0, so angle between photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248 138.2\u00b0, which is option C (138). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the center-of-momentum frame? \n\nHmm, but perhaps the given information is in the lab frame? Or is there another way?\n\nAlternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame. Wait, but perhaps the way I did it is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the angle calculation. Let me check with another approach. \n\nSuppose the angle between the two photons is \u03b8_total = 2\u03b8, so the angle between their direction vectors is 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, since the photons have equal energy, their momenta are equal in magnitude, and the angle between them must satisfy that the vector sum of their momenta equals the initial momentum. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel. Which they do because they are symmetric. \n\nThus, the angle between them is indeed 2\u03b8, and the calculation seems correct. \n\nSo the answer should be C) 138 degrees.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons, positrons, and photons. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the angle between the two photons produced when an electron and a positron annihilate each other.

Since their energies are the same, their magnitudes of momentum must be equal. \n\nLet me denote the electron's Lorentz factor as \u03b3_e = 4, and the positron's as \u03b3_p = 2. The rest mass of each is m_e (electron mass). \n\nThe total energy before collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The energy of each is \u03b3*mc\u00b2. So total energy E_total = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2 + \u03b3_p m c\u00b2 = (4 + 2) m c\u00b2 = 6 m c\u00b2. Since energy is conserved, the total energy of the two photons must also be 6 m c\u00b2. Since each photon has energy E_photon = E/2 = 3 m c\u00b2 each. \n\nNow, the momenta. The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is positive x). The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative x direction). \n\nThe momentum of the electron is p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. Wait, but to get the momentum, maybe I need to express it in terms of Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the momentum of a relativistic particle is \u03b3 m v. But since the Lorentz factor is given, perhaps I can write the momentum as sqrt( (\u03b3 m c\u00b2)^2 - (m c\u00b2)^2 ) / c? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of relativistic momentum components. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is one-dimensional before the collision (along the x-axis), but after collision, the photons can have components in other directions. Since the photons have the same energy, and their directions are symmetric in some way, maybe their momenta vectors add up to zero in the x-direction? Because the total momentum before collision must equal the total after.\n\nWait, let me think again. The total momentum before collision is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. Let's set up coordinates: let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). \n\nSo the electron's momentum is in the positive x direction, and the positron's is negative. Let me compute their magnitudes. \n\nThe momentum of a particle with Lorentz factor \u03b3 is p = \u03b3 m v. But velocity v can be expressed in terms of \u03b3 as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Hmm, maybe I can compute the magnitudes of their momenta first.\n\nAlternatively, since the total energy is 6 m c\u00b2, and the total momentum is the vector sum of their momenta. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p (since one is positive, the other negative). Wait, actually, if I take electron's direction as positive, then the positron's momentum is in the negative direction. So total initial momentum is p_e (electron's momentum) minus p_p (positron's momentum). \n\nBut after collision, the photons can have momenta in any direction. The problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, perhaps. The angle between each photon and the x-axis would be the same but in opposite vertical directions (one above, one below). That would make sense for symmetric situations. \n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p_photon. Since E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2, and E = pc, so p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m c. \n\nThe two photons are moving in directions symmetric about the x-axis. Let me suppose that each makes an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, but one is above and the other below. The angle between the two photons would then be 2\u03b8. Wait, no, the angle between their directions would be 2\u03b8 if they are symmetric. But the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are mirror images across the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle each makes with the x-axis. \n\nNow, to find the angle between the two photons, I need to find 2\u03b8. \n\nNow, applying conservation of momentum. The total momentum after collision must equal the total before. Let's compute the initial momentum. \n\nThe electron's momentum is p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. But since v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3_e\u00b2). Alternatively, the momentum can be written as p_e = \u03b3_e m v_e. But maybe it's easier to compute using energy and momentum relationship. \n\nThe energy of the electron is E_e = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2. The momentum of the electron is p_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c? Wait, no. Wait, the relation is (E/c)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc\u00b2/c)^2 ) / c? Wait, let me get this straight. \n\nThe energy of a particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The momentum is p = \u03b3 m v. Alternatively, p = E / c\u00b2 * v. Since v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2)), so substituting, p = \u03b3 m c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between energy and momentum:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2 \n\nSo, p = sqrt( (E\u00b2/c\u00b2) - (mc\u00b2)^2/c\u00b2 ) / c? Wait, perhaps better to write p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\nWait, let me see: E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \u2192 p = sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2/c\u00b2 ) * c? Wait, maybe I should just compute p for each particle.\n\nFor the electron (moving to the right):\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2\n\np_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The momentum p is given by:\n\np = \u03b3 m v \n\nBut v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3\u00b2))\n\nSo p = \u03b3 m c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2)\n\nAlternatively, using E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2,\n\np = (E / c\u00b2) * v \n\n= (\u03b3 m c\u00b2 / c\u00b2) * v \n\n= \u03b3 m v \n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 )\n\nWait, let's compute p_e:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2,\n\nso (E_e / c)^2 = (4 m c)^2,\n\nthen p_e = sqrt( (4 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\n= sqrt( 16 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(15 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = m c sqrt(15)\n\nSimilarly for the positron. The positron's energy is 2 m c\u00b2,\n\nso p_p = sqrt( (2 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) \n\n= sqrt(4 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(3 m\u00b2 c\u00b2) = m c sqrt(3)\n\nSo the momentum of the electron is m c sqrt(15) in the +x direction, and the positron's momentum is m c sqrt(3) in the -x direction. Therefore, the total initial momentum is:\n\np_initial = p_e - p_p = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )\n\nWait, because the positron's momentum is opposite direction. So the total momentum before collision is (electron's momentum) minus (positron's momentum). \n\nWait, actually, if the positron is moving to the left, then its momentum is in the negative x direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative). So p_initial = p_e - p_p (since p_p is in the opposite direction). \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nNow, after the collision, the two photons have momenta p1 and p2. Each has magnitude p_photon = 3 m c, since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2 (since total energy is 6 m c\u00b2 and they are equal). \n\nThe photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis as \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively. The angle between them would then be 2\u03b8. \n\nSo each photon's momentum vector can be written in components. \n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right) has momentum components:\n\np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8,\n\np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8,\n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right):\n\np2_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8,\n\np2_y = -p_photon * sin\u03b8,\n\nBecause it's below the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photons' momenta. \n\nTotal momentum after collision in x-direction:\n\np_total_x = p1_x + p2_x = p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8\n\nTotal momentum in y-direction:\n\np_total_y = p1_y + p2_y = p_photon sin\u03b8 - p_photon sin\u03b8 = 0 \n\nWhich makes sense, because the initial momentum had no y-component. \n\nTherefore, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum after collision equals the total before. \n\nSo, in the x-direction:\n\np_initial = p_total_x \n\n=> m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * p_photon * cos\u03b8 \n\nBut p_photon is the magnitude of each photon's momentum. Since their energy is 3 m c\u00b2, then p_photon = (3 m c\u00b2)/c = 3 m c (since E = pc for photons). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nLeft side: m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\nRight side: 2 * 3 m c * cos\u03b8 \n\nWe can divide both sides by m c:\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \n\nSolve for cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 \n\nHmm, let me compute the numerical value here. \n\nFirst compute sqrt(15): approx 3.87298\n\nsqrt(3) is approx 1.73205\n\nSo sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093\n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nThen \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568) \n\nCalculating that: arccos(0.3568). Let me think, cos(67 degrees) is about 0.3907, cos(70) is ~0.3428. Since 0.3568 is between those, closer to 70 degrees. Let me compute:\n\ncos(69 degrees) = cos(69) \u2248 0.3584 (since 70 is 0.3428, 69 is a bit higher). \n\nWait 0.3568 is slightly less than 0.3584, so maybe 69.2 degrees or so. Let me see. Let's calculate more precisely. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator-like steps. Let me see:\n\ncos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\n\u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). Let me compute in radians first? Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute it exactly?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(15) is sqrt(9+6) = 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. The difference is about 2.14093. Divided by 6 is approx 0.3568. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation. Wait, let me check the steps again. \n\nWait the equation was:\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 ?\n\nWait, let me recheck the algebra:\n\nWe had p_initial = p_e - p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n\np_total_x = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 \n\np_photon is 3 m c (since E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2 = p c \u2192 p = E/c = 3 m c\u00b2 / c = 3 m c). \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2*(3 m c)*cos\u03b8 \n\nYes, so dividing both sides by m c gives sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u2248 (2.14093)/6\u22480.3568. \n\nThus, \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). \n\nLet me compute this angle. \n\nUsing a calculator (if I imagine), arccos(0.3568):\n\nLet me see, cos(67.5) is about 0.3827, cos(70) is 0.3428. So 0.3568 is between 69 and 70. \n\nLet me try 69 degrees: cos(69\u00b0)=cos(69)= approx. Let me compute 69 degrees:\n\ncos(60)=0.5, cos(60)=0.5, cos(60+9)=cos69. \n\nAlternatively, using calculator steps: \n\ncos(69) = 0.3584 (exactly, perhaps 0.3583679). \n\nSo 0.3568 is slightly less than that, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is about 0.0016. Since the cosine decreases as the angle increases, so to get to 0.3568, the angle is 69 + (0.3584-0.3568)/(0.3584 - 0.3428)*1 degree? \n\nWait, the difference between 69 and 70 degrees in cosine is 0.3584 - 0.3428 = 0.0156 per degree. Wait, but that's over 1 degree. \n\nWait, the difference between cos(69) and cos(70) is 0.3584 - 0.3428 = 0.0156 over 1 degree. \n\nWe need to find the angle where cos\u03b8 = 0.3568. The value 0.3568 is 0.3584 - 0.0016. \n\nSo the angle is 69 degrees plus (0.0016)/0.0156 * 1 degree. Wait, but since the cosine decreases as angle increases, the angle would be 69 + (0.3584 - 0.3568)/0.0156 * delta? Hmm, maybe better to compute delta_theta as (0.3584 - 0.3568)/ (derivative?), but perhaps it's easier to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's around 69.5 degrees. Let me see:\n\ncos(69.5) is cos(69 + 0.5). \n\nUsing small angle approximation for the difference:\n\ncos(69 + \u0394\u03b8) \u2248 cos(69) - sin(69)*\u0394\u03b8 (in radians). \n\nWait, let me think in radians. \n\n\u0394\u03b8 = 0.5 degrees = \u03c0/360 radians \u2248 0.0087 radians. \n\ncos(69.5\u00b0) \u2248 cos(69\u00b0) - sin(69\u00b0)*(0.0087)\n\ncos(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.3584\n\nsin(69\u00b0) \u2248 0.9336\n\nSo the approximate cos(69.5) is 0.3584 - 0.9336*0.0087 \u2248 0.3584 - 0.0081 \u2248 0.3503. \n\nHmm, that's lower than 0.3568. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should do linear approximation between 69 and 70 degrees.\n\nWe have at 69\u00b0, cos=0.3584\n\nAt 70\u00b0, cos=0.3428\n\nWe need to find x where cos(x)=0.3568 between 69 and 70.\n\nThe difference between 0.3568 and 0.3584 is -0.0016. The total change over 1 degree is -0.0156. \n\nSo the fraction is (0.3568 - 0.3584)/(-0.0156) = (-0.0016)/(-0.0156) \u2248 0.1025. \n\nSo the angle is 69 + 0.1025*(1 degree) \u2248 69.1 degrees. \n\nHmm, so \u03b8 is approximately 69.1 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248 138.2 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138, which would be the closest. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation again to ensure no mistakes. \n\nWait, the angle between the photons is 2\u03b8. So if \u03b8 is 69 degrees, then 2\u03b8 is 138, which matches option C. \n\nBut let me check the calculation steps again for any possible errors. \n\nFirst, the initial momentum calculation:\n\nElectron's momentum:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2. \n\np_e = sqrt( (E_e/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / (c^2/c) ? Wait, no, let me redo that properly. \n\nThe momentum p is given by p = sqrt(E\u00b2/c\u2074 - m\u00b2c\u00b2)/c? Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me recall that:\n\nThe relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3 m v. \n\nAlternatively, since E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2,\n\nthen p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 ) \n\nWait, yes. So p (in units of kg\u00b7m/s?) Let me clarify units. \n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nE\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)^2 \u2192 \n\nSo p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (mc)^2 ) \n\nWait, no, units: E is in joules (kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2), pc is kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so \n\np = sqrt( (E^2 / c^2) - (m^2 c^4) ) / c^2? Wait, perhaps better to compute numerically:\n\nFor electron:\n\nE_e = 4 m c\u00b2 \u2192 (E_e/c)^2 = (4 m c\u00b2 / c)^2 = (4 m c)^2 \n\nThen subtract (m c)^2:\n\np_e squared: (4 m c)^2 - (m c)^2 = 16 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 15 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2192 p_e = m c sqrt(15). Correct.\n\nPositron: E_p = 2 m c\u00b2 \u2192 (E_p/c)^2 = (2 m c)^2 \u2192 subtract (m c)^2 \u2192 4 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 - m\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 3 m\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2192 p_p = m c sqrt(3). Correct.\n\nTotal initial momentum: p_e - p_p (since positron's is opposite direction):\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nTotal final momentum in x-direction is 2 p_photon cos\u03b8. \n\nPhoton energy: 3 m c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m c. \n\nSo 2*(3 m c) cos\u03b8 = 6 m c cos\u03b8. \n\nSetting equal:\n\nm c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 m c cos\u03b8 \u2192 divide both sides by m c \u2192 sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) = 6 cos\u03b8 \u2192 cos\u03b8 = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 \u2248 (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 \u2248 2.14093/6 \u2248 0.3568 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2248 69.1\u00b0, so angle between photons is 2\u03b8 \u2248 138.2\u00b0, which is option C (138). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the center-of-momentum frame? \n\nHmm, but perhaps the given information is in the lab frame? Or is there another way?\n\nAlternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame. Wait, but perhaps the way I did it is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the angle calculation. Let me check with another approach. \n\nSuppose the angle between the two photons is \u03b8_total = 2\u03b8, so the angle between their direction vectors is 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, since the photons have equal energy, their momenta are equal in magnitude, and the angle between them must satisfy that the vector sum of their momenta equals the initial momentum. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel. Which they do because they are symmetric. \n\nThus, the angle between them is indeed 2\u03b8, and the calculation seems correct. \n\nSo the answer should be C) 138 degrees.\n\n\nThe electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons with equal energy. Using conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum (along the x-axis) must equal the total final momentum. \n\nThe electron's momentum is \\( p_e = \\sqrt{(4mc^2/c)^2 - (mc)^2} = mc\\sqrt{15} \\), and the positron's momentum is \\( p_p = \\sqrt{(2mc^2/c)^2 - (mc)^2} = mc\\sqrt{3} \\). The total initial momentum is \\( p_{\\text{initial}} = mc(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\nEach photon has energy \\( 3mc^2 \\), so their momentum magnitudes are \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = 3mc \\). The photons' momenta are symmetric about the x-axis, forming angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\). The x-components sum to \\( 2 \\cdot 3mc \\cos\\theta \\). Setting this equal to the initial momentum:\n\n\\[\nmc(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) = 6mc\\cos\\theta \\implies \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\approx 0.3568\n\\]\n\nThis gives \\( \\theta \\approx 69.1^\\circ \\). The angle between the photons is \\( 2\\theta \\approx 138.2^\\circ \\), closest to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. We need to find the angle between their paths.\n\nHmm, right. Let me recall some concepts here. Annihilation of electron-positron pairs usually results in two photons going in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But in this case, the particles are moving with different speeds, so their momenta are different. The key here is conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nSince both photons have the same energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but perhaps not opposite. Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/c, so if their energies are equal, their magnitudes of momentum are equal. But their directions are different. The problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. That suggests that the angle between them is symmetric above and below the horizontal.\n\nLet me think about the setup. Let's set up coordinates. Let me imagine the electron moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). The collision happens at the origin, and the photons are emitted at some angles above and below the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after. Since the photons are the only products, their combined momentum must equal the initial total momentum of the electron and positron.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial momenta of the electron and positron. \n\nThe Lorentz factor (\u03b3) for the electron is 4, so its total energy is \u03b3m_e c\u00b2. The positron has \u03b3=2, so its energy is 2m_e c\u00b2. \n\nThe momentum of a particle is p = \u03b3 m v. Alternatively, since p = \u03b3 m v, and since v = (sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2))c? Wait, maybe better to compute using the relation between gamma and momentum. Alternatively, since p = \u03b3 m v, and also, we know that gamma is related to the velocity via \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma. Since the total energy is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and the momentum p = \u03b3 m v. But we can also relate p and energy via E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSo for the electron: E_e = 4 m_e c\u00b2. Then, its momentum p_e is sqrt(E_e\u00b2/(c\u00b2) - (m_e c)^2)/c? Wait, maybe better to rearrange that equation:\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2/(c^4) - (m_e^2 c\u00b2)/c^4) * c ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m_e c)^2 ) / c^2? Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me compute the momentum of the electron first. \n\nThe electron's total energy is E_e = \u03b3_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2. \n\nThe momentum magnitude is p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e. \n\nBut we can also find v_e from gamma. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me solve for v_e.\n\nFor the electron, \u03b3_e =4.\n\nSo 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSquare both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.968c. \n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e sqrt(15) c. \n\nWait, since v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c, then multiplying by gamma (4) gives 4*(sqrt(15)/4 c) = sqrt(15)c. So p_e = m_e * sqrt(15)c. \n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma is 2. Let's compute its momentum. \n\n\u03b3_p = 2. \n\nSo, v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) c. Wait, same formula. So:\n\nv_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) c = sqrt(3/4)c = (sqrt(3)/2)c \u2248 0.866c. \n\nThen the momentum of the positron is p_p = \u03b3_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) = m_e sqrt(3)c. \n\nSince the positron is moving in the opposite direction (from right to left), its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive x) plus (-p_p) (negative x direction). \n\nTotal initial momentum P_initial = p_e - p_p = m_e sqrt(15)c - m_e sqrt(3)c. \n\nHmm, let me factor out m_e c:\n\nP_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nWait sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.14. So positive, meaning the total momentum is in the direction of the electron's motion. \n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are emitted. Let's denote their momenta as p1 and p2. The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. \n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p = E/c). Let me denote each photon's momentum magnitude as p_photon = E_photon/c. \n\nBut the photons are moving at angles \u03b8 above and below the x-axis. Since their directions are upper-right and lower-right, the angles with respect to the x-axis are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively. \n\nSo, the momenta of the photons can be written in vector form. Let me set up coordinate system where the x-axis is the direction of the electron's initial motion (from left to right). \n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right) has momentum components: \np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 \np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8 \n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right) has momentum components: \np2_x = p_photon * cos(-\u03b8) = p_photon cos\u03b8 (since cosine is even)\np2_y = p_photon * sin(-\u03b8) = -p_photon sin\u03b8 \n\nTherefore, the total momentum after collision is: \n\nTotal P_x = p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 \n\nTotal P_y = p_photon sin\u03b8 - p_photon sin\u03b8 = 0 \n\nSo the total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum was along the x-axis, the y-components must cancel (they do), so the x-component must equal P_initial. \n\nTherefore: \n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nNow, also, the total energy must be conserved. \n\nThe initial total energy is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. \n\nE_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \n\nThe total energy after collision is the sum of the two photons' energies. Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c (since E=pc for photons), so total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nThus: \n\n2 p_photon c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m_e c \n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation: \n\n2*(3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nSimplify both sides by dividing by m_e c: \n\n2*3 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 \n\nLet me compute the numerical value of that. \n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205 \n\nSo numerator \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093 \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nNow, \u03b8 is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. But the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +\u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. \n\nSo we need to compute 2\u03b8. \n\nFirst, find \u03b8: arccos(0.3568). Let me compute that. \n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately, let's see, cos(69 degrees) is about 0.358, so very close. So \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees. \n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0): Let me check. \n\ncos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)= ~0.3428. Wait, 0.3428 at 70 degrees. Wait, 69 degrees: cos(69) is cos(60+9)= ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute:\n\nLet me compute arccos(0.3568):\n\nUsing calculator steps:\n\nTake inverse cosine of 0.3568. Let me think, since cos(67) is about 0.3907, cos(68) is ~0.3746, cos(69)=0.3584, cos(70)=0.3428. \n\nSo 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let's see:\n\nAt 69 degrees, cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3584. \n\nThe value we have is 0.3568, which is slightly less, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is 0.0016. \n\nBetween 69 and 70 degrees, the cosine decreases by about 0.0156 (0.3584-0.3428 \u22480.0156) per degree. \n\nSo to get a decrease of 0.0016, the angle would be 69 + (0.0016)/0.0156 \u2248 69 + ~0.1 degrees. So roughly 69.1 degrees. \n\nTherefore, \u03b8 \u224869.1 degrees. \n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8, so that would be ~138.2 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. That seems to fit. \n\nWait let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, energies: electron has \u03b3=4, so 4m c\u00b2. Positron \u03b3=2, so 2m c\u00b2. Total energy 6m c\u00b2. That's correct. \n\nThe photons each have energy E_photon, so total 2E_photon =6m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon =3 m c\u00b2. So p_photon = E_photon/c =3 m c. \n\nThen momentum equation: 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 equals the initial momentum. \n\nInitial momentum was p_e - p_p. \n\nElectron's momentum p_e: Let me recheck that. \n\ngamma_e =4, so v_e = sqrt(1 -1/16)c = sqrt(15/16)c = (sqrt15)/4 c. \n\nSo p_e = gamma m v =4 m_e * (sqrt15 /4 c ) = m_e sqrt15 c. \n\nSimilarly for positron: gamma=2, so v_p = sqrt(1 -1/4)c = sqrt(3)/2 c. \n\np_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt3/2 c) = m_e sqrt3 c. \n\nThus, p_e - p_p = m_e (sqrt15 - sqrt3)c. \n\nSo the total initial momentum is that. \n\nThen 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt15 - sqrt3). \n\nBut p_photon is 3 m_e c. So plug that in:\n\n2*(3 m_e c) cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt15 - sqrt3)\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt15 - sqrt3 \u2192 yes, same as before. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt15 - sqrt3)/6 \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u2248 2.14093 /6 \u22480.3568. \n\nThat's correct. \n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can compute the angle more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle between the two photons directly. Since each photon is at angle \u03b8 above and below, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity here. Let's see:\n\nThe angle between the two vectors (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) and (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8) is indeed 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, the angle between two vectors can be found via the dot product:\n\nThe vectors are (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) and (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8). The dot product is cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8). The magnitude of each vector is 1, so the cosine of the angle between them is cos(2\u03b8). Thus, the angle is 2\u03b8. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nThus, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u22482 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees, so 138 degrees. The closest option is C) 138. \n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the sign of the initial momentum? \n\nWait, the electron is moving to the right (positive x) with momentum p_e = m_e sqrt15 c. \n\nThe positron is moving to the left (negative x direction), so its momentum is -p_p = - m_e sqrt3 c. \n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is p_e + (-p_p) \u2192 p_e - p_p. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation when substituting. Let me recheck the calculation of sqrt(15) minus sqrt(3). \n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt3 is 1.73205. Subtract: 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093. Divide by 6 gives approx 0.3568. Correct. \n\nHmm, so everything seems to check out. So the angle is 2\u03b8 \u2248138 degrees, so the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use conservation of momentum and energy.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. We need to find the angle between their paths.\n\nHmm, right. Let me recall some concepts here. Annihilation of electron-positron pairs usually results in two photons going in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But in this case, the particles are moving with different speeds, so their momenta are different. The key here is conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nSince both photons have the same energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but perhaps not opposite. Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/c, so if their energies are equal, their magnitudes of momentum are equal. But their directions are different. The problem states one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis. That suggests that the angle between them is symmetric above and below the horizontal.\n\nLet me think about the setup. Let's set up coordinates. Let me imagine the electron moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). The collision happens at the origin, and the photons are emitted at some angles above and below the x-axis. \n\nThe total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after. Since the photons are the only products, their combined momentum must equal the initial total momentum of the electron and positron.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial momenta of the electron and positron. \n\nThe Lorentz factor (\u03b3) for the electron is 4, so its total energy is \u03b3m_e c\u00b2. The positron has \u03b3=2, so its energy is 2m_e c\u00b2. \n\nThe momentum of a particle is p = \u03b3 m v. Alternatively, since p = \u03b3 m v, and since v = (sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2))c? Wait, maybe better to compute using the relation between gamma and momentum. Alternatively, since p = \u03b3 m v, and also, we know that gamma is related to the velocity via \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma. Since the total energy is \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and the momentum p = \u03b3 m v. But we can also relate p and energy via E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (m c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSo for the electron: E_e = 4 m_e c\u00b2. Then, its momentum p_e is sqrt(E_e\u00b2/(c\u00b2) - (m_e c)^2)/c? Wait, maybe better to rearrange that equation:\n\np = sqrt(E\u00b2/(c^4) - (m_e^2 c\u00b2)/c^4) * c ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m_e c)^2 ) / c^2? Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me compute the momentum of the electron first. \n\nThe electron's total energy is E_e = \u03b3_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 m_e c\u00b2. \n\nThe momentum magnitude is p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e. \n\nBut we can also find v_e from gamma. Since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me solve for v_e.\n\nFor the electron, \u03b3_e =4.\n\nSo 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSquare both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 1 - v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/16 \u2192 v_e\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 15/16 \u2192 v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c \u2248 0.968c. \n\nSo the momentum of the electron is p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e sqrt(15) c. \n\nWait, since v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c, then multiplying by gamma (4) gives 4*(sqrt(15)/4 c) = sqrt(15)c. So p_e = m_e * sqrt(15)c. \n\nSimilarly, for the positron, gamma is 2. Let's compute its momentum. \n\n\u03b3_p = 2. \n\nSo, v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) c. Wait, same formula. So:\n\nv_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) c = sqrt(3/4)c = (sqrt(3)/2)c \u2248 0.866c. \n\nThen the momentum of the positron is p_p = \u03b3_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) = m_e sqrt(3)c. \n\nSince the positron is moving in the opposite direction (from right to left), its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive x) plus (-p_p) (negative x direction). \n\nTotal initial momentum P_initial = p_e - p_p = m_e sqrt(15)c - m_e sqrt(3)c. \n\nHmm, let me factor out m_e c:\n\nP_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). \n\nWait sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \u2248 2.14. So positive, meaning the total momentum is in the direction of the electron's motion. \n\nNow, after annihilation, two photons are emitted. Let's denote their momenta as p1 and p2. The total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. \n\nSince the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are equal (since p = E/c). Let me denote each photon's momentum magnitude as p_photon = E_photon/c. \n\nBut the photons are moving at angles \u03b8 above and below the x-axis. Since their directions are upper-right and lower-right, the angles with respect to the x-axis are \u03b8 and -\u03b8, respectively. \n\nSo, the momenta of the photons can be written in vector form. Let me set up coordinate system where the x-axis is the direction of the electron's initial motion (from left to right). \n\nPhoton 1 (upper-right) has momentum components: \np1_x = p_photon * cos\u03b8 \np1_y = p_photon * sin\u03b8 \n\nPhoton 2 (lower-right) has momentum components: \np2_x = p_photon * cos(-\u03b8) = p_photon cos\u03b8 (since cosine is even)\np2_y = p_photon * sin(-\u03b8) = -p_photon sin\u03b8 \n\nTherefore, the total momentum after collision is: \n\nTotal P_x = p_photon cos\u03b8 + p_photon cos\u03b8 = 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 \n\nTotal P_y = p_photon sin\u03b8 - p_photon sin\u03b8 = 0 \n\nSo the total momentum after collision must equal the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum was along the x-axis, the y-components must cancel (they do), so the x-component must equal P_initial. \n\nTherefore: \n\n2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nNow, also, the total energy must be conserved. \n\nThe initial total energy is the sum of the electron and positron's energies. \n\nE_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c\u00b2 + 2 m_e c\u00b2 = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \n\nThe total energy after collision is the sum of the two photons' energies. Since each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c (since E=pc for photons), so total energy is 2 p_photon c. \n\nThus: \n\n2 p_photon c = 6 m_e c\u00b2 \u2192 p_photon = 3 m_e c \n\nSo substituting back into the momentum equation: \n\n2*(3 m_e c) * cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) \n\nSimplify both sides by dividing by m_e c: \n\n2*3 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \n\n6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) \n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 \n\nLet me compute the numerical value of that. \n\nsqrt(15) \u2248 3.87298, sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73205 \n\nSo numerator \u2248 3.87298 - 1.73205 \u2248 2.14093 \n\nDivide by 6: 2.14093 /6 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nSo cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3568 \n\nNow, \u03b8 is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. But the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +\u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. \n\nSo we need to compute 2\u03b8. \n\nFirst, find \u03b8: arccos(0.3568). Let me compute that. \n\nUsing a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately, let's see, cos(69 degrees) is about 0.358, so very close. So \u03b8 \u2248 69 degrees. \n\nWait, cos(69\u00b0): Let me check. \n\ncos(60\u00b0)=0.5, cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)= ~0.3428. Wait, 0.3428 at 70 degrees. Wait, 69 degrees: cos(69) is cos(60+9)= ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute:\n\nLet me compute arccos(0.3568):\n\nUsing calculator steps:\n\nTake inverse cosine of 0.3568. Let me think, since cos(67) is about 0.3907, cos(68) is ~0.3746, cos(69)=0.3584, cos(70)=0.3428. \n\nSo 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let's see:\n\nAt 69 degrees, cos\u03b8 \u2248 0.3584. \n\nThe value we have is 0.3568, which is slightly less, so angle is slightly more than 69 degrees. \n\nThe difference between 0.3584 and 0.3568 is 0.0016. \n\nBetween 69 and 70 degrees, the cosine decreases by about 0.0156 (0.3584-0.3428 \u22480.0156) per degree. \n\nSo to get a decrease of 0.0016, the angle would be 69 + (0.0016)/0.0156 \u2248 69 + ~0.1 degrees. So roughly 69.1 degrees. \n\nTherefore, \u03b8 \u224869.1 degrees. \n\nThe angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8, so that would be ~138.2 degrees. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 138. That seems to fit. \n\nWait let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, energies: electron has \u03b3=4, so 4m c\u00b2. Positron \u03b3=2, so 2m c\u00b2. Total energy 6m c\u00b2. That's correct. \n\nThe photons each have energy E_photon, so total 2E_photon =6m c\u00b2 \u2192 E_photon =3 m c\u00b2. So p_photon = E_photon/c =3 m c. \n\nThen momentum equation: 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 equals the initial momentum. \n\nInitial momentum was p_e - p_p. \n\nElectron's momentum p_e: Let me recheck that. \n\ngamma_e =4, so v_e = sqrt(1 -1/16)c = sqrt(15/16)c = (sqrt15)/4 c. \n\nSo p_e = gamma m v =4 m_e * (sqrt15 /4 c ) = m_e sqrt15 c. \n\nSimilarly for positron: gamma=2, so v_p = sqrt(1 -1/4)c = sqrt(3)/2 c. \n\np_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt3/2 c) = m_e sqrt3 c. \n\nThus, p_e - p_p = m_e (sqrt15 - sqrt3)c. \n\nSo the total initial momentum is that. \n\nThen 2 p_photon cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt15 - sqrt3). \n\nBut p_photon is 3 m_e c. So plug that in:\n\n2*(3 m_e c) cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt15 - sqrt3)\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos\u03b8 = sqrt15 - sqrt3 \u2192 yes, same as before. \n\nSo cos\u03b8 = (sqrt15 - sqrt3)/6 \u2248 (3.87298 -1.73205)/6 \u2248 2.14093 /6 \u22480.3568. \n\nThat's correct. \n\nSo \u03b8 \u2248 arccos(0.3568). \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can compute the angle more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle between the two photons directly. Since each photon is at angle \u03b8 above and below, the angle between them is 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity here. Let's see:\n\nThe angle between the two vectors (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) and (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8) is indeed 2\u03b8. \n\nAlternatively, the angle between two vectors can be found via the dot product:\n\nThe vectors are (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) and (cos\u03b8, -sin\u03b8). The dot product is cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos(2\u03b8). The magnitude of each vector is 1, so the cosine of the angle between them is cos(2\u03b8). Thus, the angle is 2\u03b8. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nThus, the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8 \u22482 * 69.1 \u2248 138.2 degrees, so 138 degrees. The closest option is C) 138. \n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the sign of the initial momentum? \n\nWait, the electron is moving to the right (positive x) with momentum p_e = m_e sqrt15 c. \n\nThe positron is moving to the left (negative x direction), so its momentum is -p_p = - m_e sqrt3 c. \n\nTherefore, the total initial momentum is p_e + (-p_p) \u2192 p_e - p_p. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation when substituting. Let me recheck the calculation of sqrt(15) minus sqrt(3). \n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt3 is 1.73205. Subtract: 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093. Divide by 6 gives approx 0.3568. Correct. \n\nHmm, so everything seems to check out. So the angle is 2\u03b8 \u2248138 degrees, so the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use conservation of momentum and energy. The electron (\u03b3=4) and positron (\u03b3=2) have initial momenta calculated using their Lorentz factors. The electron's momentum is \\( p_e = \\gamma_e m_e v_e = m_e \\sqrt{15}c \\), and the positron's momentum is \\( p_p = \\gamma_p m_e v_p = m_e \\sqrt{3}c \\). The total initial momentum is \\( P_{\\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons with equal energy (each \\( E_{\\text{photon}} = 3m_e c^2 \\)) have momenta \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = 3m_e c \\). The photons travel at angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( -\\theta \\) relative to the x-axis. The total momentum conservation gives:\n\\[\n2 p_{\\text{photon}} \\cos\\theta = P_{\\text{initial}} \\implies 2(3m_e c) \\cos\\theta = m_e c (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\nSolving for \\( \\cos\\theta \\):\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\approx 0.3568\n\\]\nThis yields \\( \\theta \\approx 69.1^\\circ \\). The angle between the photons is \\( 2\\theta \\approx 138.2^\\circ \\), closest to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
