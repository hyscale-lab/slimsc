      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, which are part of a system with five planets in orbital resonance. The orbital periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, right, equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Since they're orbiting the same star, the luminosity part should be the same for all. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T0 * (L/(4\u03c0d\u00b2\u03c3))^(1/4), but maybe simplified as T \u221d (L/d\u00b2)^(1/4) when considering the star's luminosity L and distance d. Wait, actually, the standard formula is T_eq = T_star * (R/d)^(1/2), but that might be when considering the star's radius and distance? Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.\n\nOh right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( sqrt( L / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 d\u00b2) ) ), but perhaps more straightforwardly, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/d\u00b2)^(1/4). Since all planets orbit the same star, L is constant, so T \u221d 1/sqrt(d). Because if T \u221d (1/d\u00b2)^(1/4), then that's 1/d^(0.5), so 1 over square root of d. Wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula properly.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is given by the effective temperature when the planet absorbs energy from the star and re-emits it. The Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The incoming flux is L/(4\u03c0d\u00b2), and the absorbed flux is (1 - albedo) * that. But since they all have the same albedo, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to [ (L/(4\u03c0d\u00b2)) * (1 - albedo) / \u03c3 ]^(1/4). Since albedo is the same, the ratio between T4 and T2 would be [ (d2/d4)^2 ]^(1/4) ? Wait, let me re-derive.\n\nLet me do it step by step. The equilibrium temperature T is given by:\n\nT = [ ( (L(1 - A) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 d\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nWhere L is the star's luminosity, A is the albedo, \u03c3 is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the orbital distance. Since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term is a constant, so when taking the ratio of T4 over T2, that term cancels out. The L and \u03c3 are also constants for all planets. So T4/T2 = [ (d2\u00b2)/(d4\u00b2) ]^(1/4) ?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me write T for each planet:\n\nT4 = [ L * (1 - A) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 d4\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSimilarly for T2:\n\nT2 = [ L * (1 - A) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 d2\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4)\n\nSo the ratio T4 / T2 = [ (d2\u00b2)/(d4\u00b2) ) ]^(1/4) ) = (d2 / d4)^(1/2). Because (d2\u00b2/d4\u00b2)^(1/4) is (d2/d4)^(2*(1/4)) = (d2/d4)^(1/2). So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt(d2/d4). Wait, but that's the inverse of distance's square root. Wait, so if Planet 4 is farther out, then its temperature would be lower.\n\nBut to get the ratio T4/T2, it's sqrt( d2 / d4 ). So the key is to find the ratio of their distances. Since they are in orbital resonance with given periods, we can use Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = (4\u03c0\u00b2)/(G(M_star)), so the ratio of their semi-major axes (distance) can be found from their orbital periods. Since all planets orbit the same star, the ratio a1/a2 = ( (P1/P2)^2 )^(1/3) ) = (P1/P2)^(2/3).\n\nWait, more precisely, a^3 is proportional to P^2. So a \u221d P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of their distances d4/d2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nGiven the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let me list them as Planet_1 to 5. So Planet_2 has period 2 units, Planet_4 has period 3.5 units. \n\nSo P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. Therefore, the ratio of their distances a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nSo let's compute that. \n\nP4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. \n\nSo (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, take natural log of 1.75 is about 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3 gives ~0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 \u2248 1.452. So a4/a2 \u2248 1.452. \n\nTherefore, the distance of Planet4 is about 1.452 times that of Planet2. \n\nSo then the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d4 ) = sqrt( 1 / 1.452 ). Let me compute that. \n\n1 divided by 1.452 is approximately 0.689. Square root of that is sqrt(0.689) \u2248 0.83. \n\nWait, because sqrt(0.689) is approximately sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85, so 0.689 would be around 0.83, yes. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. Hmm, but let me check the calculation again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me redo the exponent steps precisely.\n\nFirst, P4/P2 is 3.5 divided by 2 = 1.75. \n\na4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nCalculating 1.75^(2/3):\n\nLet me compute 1.75^(1/3) first. \n\nCube root of 1.75. 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 + a little. Let's see: 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.75 -1.728 = 0.022. So maybe approximately 1.205?\n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). Let me write it as (1.75^(1/3))^2.\n\nAlternatively, since 1.75 = 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3). Maybe better to compute numerically. \n\nAlternatively, use logarithms. Let me use base 10 logs for easier calculation.\n\nlog10(1.75) \u2248 0.2430. \n\nMultiply by (2/3): 0.2430 * (2/3) \u2248 0.162. \n\nThen 10^0.162 \u2248 10^0.16 = approx 1.445 (since 10^0.158 \u2248 1.44). \n\nSo 1.445. So a4/a2 \u22481.445. \n\nThus, the distance ratio d4/d2 is ~1.445. \n\nSo d2/d4 = 1/1.445 \u22480.692. \n\nThen sqrt(0.692) is sqrt(0.692). Let's see, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85, sqrt(0.692) is between those. Let me compute 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is very close. So sqrt(0.692) is approx 0.832, so ~0.83. \n\nTherefore, the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if I inverted anything. Because the temperature ratio is sqrt( d2/d4 ), which is sqrt(1/1.445) = sqrt(0.692) \u22480.83. So yes. \n\nSo the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula: T \u221d (L/(d\u00b2))^(1/4) * (1 - A)^(1/4). Since albedo is same, (1 - A) cancels. So T \u221d (1/d)^(1/2). Wait, because (d\u00b2) in the denominator inside the (1/d\u00b2) term, so when taking the 1/4 power, that becomes (1/d\u00b2)^(1/4) = 1/d^(0.5). So T \u221d 1/sqrt(d). \n\nTherefore, T4 / T2 = (d2 / d4)^(1/2). Which is exactly what I did. So yes. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is C) ~0.83. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A) 0.57, B)0.69, C)0.83, D)0.75. So 0.83 is option C. That's correct. \n\nHmm, but I need to make sure that the orbital periods are given in the order 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet 1 has period 1, Planet 2 is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the exponent. Let me recheck Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law: P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3. So a \u221d P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). \n\nYes, so that's correct. So all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about finding the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that part should be straightforward. The key here is the orbital resonance given by their orbital periods. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then each subsequent planet has a longer period. Planet_4 is the fourth one, which would have an orbital period of 3.5 units, and Planet_2 is the second, with a period of 2 units. \n\nWait, the question is about equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I remember is something like T_eq = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/4), where R is the radius of the star, and a is the orbital distance. But maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L_star/(a^2))^(1/4), since Luminosity is involved. Since all the planets are around the same star, L_star and the albedo are constants here. The albedo is given as the same for all, so that cancels out in the ratio. \n\nSo the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be sqrt(sqrt( (a2/a4)^2 ))? Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T0 * ( (1-a) / (4\u03c3) )^(1/4) * (L / (16 \u03c0 a\u00b2) )^(1/4) )? Hmm, maybe I should recall the exact formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature equation is usually given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but that's when the planet is at the same distance as the star's radius? Wait, maybe better to use the formula where T_eq is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). Because the energy received depends on Luminosity over distance squared, and then taking the fourth root because of the Stefan-Boltzmann law (power ~ T^4). \n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would be ( (a2/a4)^(-1/2) )^(1/2) ? Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( L / (a\u00b2) )^(1/4). Since L is the same for both planets (same star), the ratio T4/T2 would be ( (a2 / a4 )^(1/2) )^(1/2) ? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's denote T1 and T2 as the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. \n\nT4 / T2 = [ (L/(a4\u00b2))^(1/4) ] / [ (L/(a2\u00b2))^(1/4) ) ] = (a2\u00b2 / a4\u00b2)^(1/4) ) = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nAh, right. So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2/a4 ), since (a2^2 / a4^2)^(1/4) is the same as (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nSo the key is to find the ratio of their orbital distances a2/a4. But how do we get the distances from the orbital periods?\n\nKepler's third law comes into play here. For circular orbits around the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, the ratio of a^3 between two planets is equal to the ratio of their periods squared. \n\nSo for Planet_2 and Planet_4, let's denote their orbital periods as P2 and P4. The given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so Planet_2 has P2 = 2 units, Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units. \n\nTherefore, (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2. \n\nSolving for a2/a4: \n\na2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5. \n\nSo (2/3.5)^(2/3). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 2 divided by 3.5 is equal to 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo (0.5714)^(2/3). Hmm, how to calculate that? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write 2/3.5 as 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, take natural logs: ln(4/7) * (2/3) then exponentiate. \n\nAlternatively, approximate:\n\nLet me compute 0.5714^(2/3). Let me see:\n\nThe exponent 2/3 is the same as taking the cube root first, then squaring. \n\nCube root of 0.5714: let's see. The cube root of 0.512 is 0.8 (since 0.8^3 = 0.512). The cube root of 0.5714 is a bit higher. Maybe around 0.83? Let me check 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83 = 0.6889, times 0.83 \u2248 0.571. Oh wait! Exactly. 0.83^3 = (approx) 0.83 * 0.83 is 0.6889, then *0.83 gives 0.6889*0.83. Let me compute that:\n\n0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.5511, plus 0.6889 *0.03 = ~0.0207. Total \u2248 0.5718. That's very close to 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. \n\nSo then (0.5714)^(1/3) \u2248 0.83, then squaring that gives (0.83)^2 \u2248 0.6889. \n\nSo (4/7)^(2/3) \u2248 0.6889. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u2248 0.6889. \n\nThen, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4). Wait, wait, no, earlier we had T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 )? Wait, let's double-check the steps. \n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio T4/T2 is equal to (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T \u221d (a^(-1/2)), so T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). Wait, let me verify again:\n\nT \u221d (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). So T1/T2 = ( (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) = ( (a2\u00b2)/(a1\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nAh, so yes. So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be (a2/a4)^(1/2). Wait, sorry, let me clarify variables here. Let me rephrase:\n\nLet me call the two planets as Planet_2 (P2) and Planet_4 (P4). Let a2 be the semi-major axis of Planet_2, a4 that of Planet_4. \n\nThen T2 is proportional to (1/a2\u00b2)^(1/4) = (a2)^(-1/2). \n\nSimilarly, T4 is proportional to (a4)^(-1/2). \n\nTherefore, T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me see:\n\nT2 is proportional to (a2)^(-1/2), T4 proportional to (a4)^(-1/2). \n\nSo the ratio T4 / T2 = [ (a4)^(-1/2) ] / [ (a2)^(-1/2) ] = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nYes, correct. So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2/a4 ). \n\nWait, so that's sqrt of (a2/a4) which is sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ). \n\nWait, but earlier steps: \n\na2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3) \u2248 0.6889. \n\nThen, T4/T2 = sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 0.83. \n\nWait, because sqrt(0.6889) is sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 0.83, since 0.83 squared is 0.6889. \n\nWait a second, so the calculation is:\n\nT4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) \n\n= [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nOh! Wait, that's a better way to see it. Let me redo the algebra:\n\nStarting from Kepler's law: \n\n(P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3 \n\nSo (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2 \n\nThus, (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3) \n\nThen, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3) \n\nAh, so that's another way to see it. So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, so that's a simpler way. Let me confirm:\n\nYes. Because:\n\nT is proportional to a^(-1/2), and a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nSo, T \u221d (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). \n\nTherefore, T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nAh, so that's a much simpler way to get there. \n\nSo substituting the values, P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nThus, (2/3.5)^(1/3). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\n2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo the cube root of 0.5714 is the same as before. \n\nEarlier, we saw that (0.83)^3 \u2248 0.571, so cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. \n\nSo (2/3.5)^(1/3) \u2248 0.83. \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my steps again because the options include 0.75, which is another possible answer if I messed up exponents. \n\nWait let me recast all steps again carefully. \n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. \n\nThe formula is: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is when the energy absorbed equals the energy emitted. \n\nThe energy absorbed per unit area is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is planet's radius. \n\nThe energy emitted is 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * \u03c3T^4. \n\nSetting them equal: \n\n(L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))*(1 - a) \u03c0 r\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nSimplify: \n\n( L (1 - a) r\u00b2 ) / (4a\u00b2) ) = 4 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nCancel r\u00b2 terms. \n\nMultiply both sides by 4a\u00b2: \n\nL(1 - a) = 16 \u03c3 T^4 a\u00b2 \n\nThen, solving for T: \n\nT = [ L(1 - a) / (16 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4) \n\nAssuming albedo (a) is same for both planets, then (1 - a) is a constant. Since the question says same albedo, so (1 - a) is same for both, so the ratio will eliminate that term. \n\nThus, T \u221d ( L / a\u00b2 )^(1/4 ). \n\nSince L is same for both planets (same star), T \u221d 1/(a)^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nNow, from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, so (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\n=> (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3) \n\n=> a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) \n\nThus, T4/T2 = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2 ) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nSo, substituting P2=2, P4=3.5: \n\n(2/3.5)^(1/3). \n\n2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83 as before. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but wait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 over T2 is 0.83. So the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) ~0.57 \n\nB) ~0.69 \n\nC) ~0.83 \n\nD) ~0.75 \n\nYes, so C is the correct option. \n\nWait but let me think once more to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the ratio inverted? Let me check. \n\nThe formula T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So if Planet_4 is farther out (since it has longer orbital period), then its temperature should be lower than Planet_2. \n\nWait, Planet_2 has P2=2, Planet_4 has P4=3.5. Since longer period means larger orbital distance (from Kepler's law), so Planet_4 is farther away. Therefore, its equilibrium temperature should be lower than Planet_2. \n\nSo T4/T2 should be less than 1. \n\nThe calculation gave ~0.83, which is less than 1. That makes sense. So that's correct. \n\nIf the ratio were, say, 0.57 (option A), that would be even lower, but our calculation gives ~0.83. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me see:\n\nWait, the exponent steps again. \n\nStarting with T \u221d (1/a)^{1/2}. \n\nSo T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^{1/2}. \n\nBut since a4 > a2 (because P4 > P2), so a2/a4 <1, so T4 is less than T2. \n\nThe ratio (a2/a4) is (2/3.5)^{2/3}. Let me compute that again numerically. \n\nLet me compute (2/3.5) first. 2 divided by 3.5 is equal to 0.571428... \n\nNow, (0.5714)^{2/3}. \n\nAlternatively, since 2/3 is the exponent, perhaps taking natural logs. \n\nLet me compute ln(0.5714) \u2248 ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. \n\n0.5714 is between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nLet me compute ln(0.5714): \n\nUsing calculator-like steps: \n\nln(0.5714) \u2248 \n\nWell, 0.5714 is 4/7. Let me compute ln(4/7) = ln(4) - ln(7) \u2248 1.3863 - 1.9459 \u2248 -0.5596. \n\nMultiply by (2/3): \n\n-0.5596 * (2/3) \u2248 -0.373. \n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.373) \u2248 ?\n\ne^-0.3 is about 0.7408, e^-0.373 is a bit less. \n\nLet me compute:\n\ne^-0.373 \u2248 1 / e^0.373. \n\ne^0.3 is ~1.3499, e^0.373 \u2248 e^0.3 * e^0.073. \n\ne^0.073 \u2248 1 + 0.073 + (0.073)^2/2 \u2248 1.073 + 0.0026 \u2248 1.0756. \n\nSo total e^0.373 \u2248 1.3499 * 1.0756 \u2248 1.3499*1.07 \u2248 1.444, plus the extra 0.0056 gives roughly 1.444 + (1.3499*0.0056) ~ 1.444 + 0.0076 \u2248 1.4516. \n\nThus, e^-0.373 \u2248 1/1.4516 \u2248 ~0.689. \n\nWait, so that gives (4/7)^(2/3) \u2248 0.689. \n\nThen T4/T2 = sqrt(0.689) \u2248 sqrt(0.689). \n\nsqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85. 0.689 is between those. \n\nCalculating sqrt(0.689):\n\nLet me see, 0.83^2 = 0.6889. Exactly. So sqrt(0.6889)=0.83. So the approximate value is exactly 0.83. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.83, so the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, if I messed up the exponent in the temperature relation, like using T \u221d a^(-1/2), then the calculation is correct. \n\nYes, so the correct answer should be option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so the question is about finding the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that part should be straightforward. The key here is the orbital resonance given by their orbital periods. The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then each subsequent planet has a longer period. Planet_4 is the fourth one, which would have an orbital period of 3.5 units, and Planet_2 is the second, with a period of 2 units. \n\nWait, the question is about equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I remember is something like T_eq = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/4), where R is the radius of the star, and a is the orbital distance. But maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L_star/(a^2))^(1/4), since Luminosity is involved. Since all the planets are around the same star, L_star and the albedo are constants here. The albedo is given as the same for all, so that cancels out in the ratio. \n\nSo the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be sqrt(sqrt( (a2/a4)^2 ))? Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T0 * ( (1-a) / (4\u03c3) )^(1/4) * (L / (16 \u03c0 a\u00b2) )^(1/4) )? Hmm, maybe I should recall the exact formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature equation is usually given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), but that's when the planet is at the same distance as the star's radius? Wait, maybe better to use the formula where T_eq is proportional to (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). Because the energy received depends on Luminosity over distance squared, and then taking the fourth root because of the Stefan-Boltzmann law (power ~ T^4). \n\nSo, the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would be ( (a2/a4)^(-1/2) )^(1/2) ? Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( L / (a\u00b2) )^(1/4). Since L is the same for both planets (same star), the ratio T4/T2 would be ( (a2 / a4 )^(1/2) )^(1/2) ? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's denote T1 and T2 as the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. \n\nT4 / T2 = [ (L/(a4\u00b2))^(1/4) ] / [ (L/(a2\u00b2))^(1/4) ) ] = (a2\u00b2 / a4\u00b2)^(1/4) ) = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nAh, right. So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2/a4 ), since (a2^2 / a4^2)^(1/4) is the same as (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nSo the key is to find the ratio of their orbital distances a2/a4. But how do we get the distances from the orbital periods?\n\nKepler's third law comes into play here. For circular orbits around the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 \u221d a^3. Therefore, the ratio of a^3 between two planets is equal to the ratio of their periods squared. \n\nSo for Planet_2 and Planet_4, let's denote their orbital periods as P2 and P4. The given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so Planet_2 has P2 = 2 units, Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units. \n\nTherefore, (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2. \n\nSolving for a2/a4: \n\na2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5. \n\nSo (2/3.5)^(2/3). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 2 divided by 3.5 is equal to 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo (0.5714)^(2/3). Hmm, how to calculate that? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write 2/3.5 as 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3). \n\nAlternatively, take natural logs: ln(4/7) * (2/3) then exponentiate. \n\nAlternatively, approximate:\n\nLet me compute 0.5714^(2/3). Let me see:\n\nThe exponent 2/3 is the same as taking the cube root first, then squaring. \n\nCube root of 0.5714: let's see. The cube root of 0.512 is 0.8 (since 0.8^3 = 0.512). The cube root of 0.5714 is a bit higher. Maybe around 0.83? Let me check 0.83^3: 0.83*0.83 = 0.6889, times 0.83 \u2248 0.571. Oh wait! Exactly. 0.83^3 = (approx) 0.83 * 0.83 is 0.6889, then *0.83 gives 0.6889*0.83. Let me compute that:\n\n0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.5511, plus 0.6889 *0.03 = ~0.0207. Total \u2248 0.5718. That's very close to 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. \n\nSo then (0.5714)^(1/3) \u2248 0.83, then squaring that gives (0.83)^2 \u2248 0.6889. \n\nSo (4/7)^(2/3) \u2248 0.6889. \n\nTherefore, a2/a4 \u2248 0.6889. \n\nThen, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2/a4). Wait, wait, no, earlier we had T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 )? Wait, let's double-check the steps. \n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio T4/T2 is equal to (a2/a4)^(1/2). Because T \u221d (a^(-1/2)), so T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). Wait, let me verify again:\n\nT \u221d (L/(a\u00b2))^(1/4). So T1/T2 = ( (L/a1\u00b2) / (L/a2\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) = ( (a2\u00b2)/(a1\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nAh, so yes. So the ratio of T4 to T2 would be (a2/a4)^(1/2). Wait, sorry, let me clarify variables here. Let me rephrase:\n\nLet me call the two planets as Planet_2 (P2) and Planet_4 (P4). Let a2 be the semi-major axis of Planet_2, a4 that of Planet_4. \n\nThen T2 is proportional to (1/a2\u00b2)^(1/4) = (a2)^(-1/2). \n\nSimilarly, T4 is proportional to (a4)^(-1/2). \n\nTherefore, T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me see:\n\nT2 is proportional to (a2)^(-1/2), T4 proportional to (a4)^(-1/2). \n\nSo the ratio T4 / T2 = [ (a4)^(-1/2) ] / [ (a2)^(-1/2) ] = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nYes, correct. So the ratio of temperatures is sqrt( a2/a4 ). \n\nWait, so that's sqrt of (a2/a4) which is sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ). \n\nWait, but earlier steps: \n\na2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of a2/a4 is (2/3.5)^(2/3) \u2248 0.6889. \n\nThen, T4/T2 = sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 0.83. \n\nWait, because sqrt(0.6889) is sqrt(0.6889) \u2248 0.83, since 0.83 squared is 0.6889. \n\nWait a second, so the calculation is:\n\nT4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) \n\n= [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nOh! Wait, that's a better way to see it. Let me redo the algebra:\n\nStarting from Kepler's law: \n\n(P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3 \n\nSo (a2/a4)^3 = (P2/P4)^2 \n\nThus, (a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(2/3) \n\nThen, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3) \n\nAh, so that's another way to see it. So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nWait, so that's a simpler way. Let me confirm:\n\nYes. Because:\n\nT is proportional to a^(-1/2), and a is proportional to P^(2/3). \n\nSo, T \u221d (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). \n\nTherefore, T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). \n\nTherefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nAh, so that's a much simpler way to get there. \n\nSo substituting the values, P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. \n\nThus, (2/3.5)^(1/3). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\n2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo the cube root of 0.5714 is the same as before. \n\nEarlier, we saw that (0.83)^3 \u2248 0.571, so cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. \n\nSo (2/3.5)^(1/3) \u2248 0.83. \n\nSo the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.83. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my steps again because the options include 0.75, which is another possible answer if I messed up exponents. \n\nWait let me recast all steps again carefully. \n\nEquilibrium temperature formula: \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. \n\nThe formula is: \n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature is when the energy absorbed equals the energy emitted. \n\nThe energy absorbed per unit area is L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2) * (1 - albedo) * \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is planet's radius. \n\nThe energy emitted is 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * \u03c3T^4. \n\nSetting them equal: \n\n(L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2))*(1 - a) \u03c0 r\u00b2 = 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nSimplify: \n\n( L (1 - a) r\u00b2 ) / (4a\u00b2) ) = 4 \u03c3 T^4 \n\nCancel r\u00b2 terms. \n\nMultiply both sides by 4a\u00b2: \n\nL(1 - a) = 16 \u03c3 T^4 a\u00b2 \n\nThen, solving for T: \n\nT = [ L(1 - a) / (16 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4) \n\nAssuming albedo (a) is same for both planets, then (1 - a) is a constant. Since the question says same albedo, so (1 - a) is same for both, so the ratio will eliminate that term. \n\nThus, T \u221d ( L / a\u00b2 )^(1/4 ). \n\nSince L is same for both planets (same star), T \u221d 1/(a)^(1/2). \n\nTherefore, T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2). \n\nNow, from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, so (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3 \n\n=> (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3) \n\n=> a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) \n\nThus, T4/T2 = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2 ) \n\n= (P2/P4)^(1/3). \n\nSo, substituting P2=2, P4=3.5: \n\n(2/3.5)^(1/3). \n\n2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7 \u2248 0.5714. \n\nSo cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83 as before. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but wait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 over T2 is 0.83. So the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) ~0.57 \n\nB) ~0.69 \n\nC) ~0.83 \n\nD) ~0.75 \n\nYes, so C is the correct option. \n\nWait but let me think once more to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the ratio inverted? Let me check. \n\nThe formula T \u221d 1/sqrt(a). So if Planet_4 is farther out (since it has longer orbital period), then its temperature should be lower than Planet_2. \n\nWait, Planet_2 has P2=2, Planet_4 has P4=3.5. Since longer period means larger orbital distance (from Kepler's law), so Planet_4 is farther away. Therefore, its equilibrium temperature should be lower than Planet_2. \n\nSo T4/T2 should be less than 1. \n\nThe calculation gave ~0.83, which is less than 1. That makes sense. So that's correct. \n\nIf the ratio were, say, 0.57 (option A), that would be even lower, but our calculation gives ~0.83. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me see:\n\nWait, the exponent steps again. \n\nStarting with T \u221d (1/a)^{1/2}. \n\nSo T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^{1/2}. \n\nBut since a4 > a2 (because P4 > P2), so a2/a4 <1, so T4 is less than T2. \n\nThe ratio (a2/a4) is (2/3.5)^{2/3}. Let me compute that again numerically. \n\nLet me compute (2/3.5) first. 2 divided by 3.5 is equal to 0.571428... \n\nNow, (0.5714)^{2/3}. \n\nAlternatively, since 2/3 is the exponent, perhaps taking natural logs. \n\nLet me compute ln(0.5714) \u2248 ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. \n\n0.5714 is between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nLet me compute ln(0.5714): \n\nUsing calculator-like steps: \n\nln(0.5714) \u2248 \n\nWell, 0.5714 is 4/7. Let me compute ln(4/7) = ln(4) - ln(7) \u2248 1.3863 - 1.9459 \u2248 -0.5596. \n\nMultiply by (2/3): \n\n-0.5596 * (2/3) \u2248 -0.373. \n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.373) \u2248 ?\n\ne^-0.3 is about 0.7408, e^-0.373 is a bit less. \n\nLet me compute:\n\ne^-0.373 \u2248 1 / e^0.373. \n\ne^0.3 is ~1.3499, e^0.373 \u2248 e^0.3 * e^0.073. \n\ne^0.073 \u2248 1 + 0.073 + (0.073)^2/2 \u2248 1.073 + 0.0026 \u2248 1.0756. \n\nSo total e^0.373 \u2248 1.3499 * 1.0756 \u2248 1.3499*1.07 \u2248 1.444, plus the extra 0.0056 gives roughly 1.444 + (1.3499*0.0056) ~ 1.444 + 0.0076 \u2248 1.4516. \n\nThus, e^-0.373 \u2248 1/1.4516 \u2248 ~0.689. \n\nWait, so that gives (4/7)^(2/3) \u2248 0.689. \n\nThen T4/T2 = sqrt(0.689) \u2248 sqrt(0.689). \n\nsqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225)=0.85. 0.689 is between those. \n\nCalculating sqrt(0.689):\n\nLet me see, 0.83^2 = 0.6889. Exactly. So sqrt(0.6889)=0.83. So the approximate value is exactly 0.83. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.83, so the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, if I messed up the exponent in the temperature relation, like using T \u221d a^(-1/2), then the calculation is correct. \n\nYes, so the correct answer should be option C.\n\n\nTo determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula \\( T \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^{1/2} \\), where \\( a \\) is the orbital distance. From Kepler's third law (\\( P^2 \\propto a^3 \\)), the orbital distance ratio \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\) is derived from their orbital periods \\( P_2 = 2 \\) and \\( P_4 = 3.5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx 0.689.\n\\]\n\nThe temperature ratio \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\) is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \\sqrt{0.689} \\approx 0.83.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
