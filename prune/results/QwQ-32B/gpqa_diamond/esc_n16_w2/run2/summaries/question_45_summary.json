      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. We need to find their ground state, first excited, and second excited state energies in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite square well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized and given by E_n = (n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2), so here they define E as that base term, so each particle's energy level would be n\u00b2 times E. But since there are four particles, and they're identical fermions (since spin-1/2 implies they are fermions), we have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. \n\nFermions can't occupy the same quantum state, so each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum number n is the only one (since there's no angular momentum or other degrees of freedom here). But since the particles are spin-1/2, each n level can hold two particles with opposite spins. \n\nSo, let's start by figuring out how the four particles are arranged in the lowest energy states. The lowest energy state (ground state) would have the particles in the lowest possible n levels with the Pauli exclusion principle considered. \n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). The second level (n=2) can also hold 2 particles. The third (n=3) another 2, but since we have four particles, we need to fill up to n=2. Wait, 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2. That's four particles total. \n\nSo for the ground state configuration, the four particles would occupy n=1 (twice) and n=2 (twice). Each particle's energy is n\u00b2E, so the total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the options include 4E, 10E, etc. Hmm, so maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nWait, no, the question says four particles. Let me think again. Each n level can have two particles (since spin-1/2). So for the ground state, the first two particles go into n=1, each with spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So the total energy would be 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that would be the ground state. \n\nLooking at the options, option C has 10E as the first excited state, and D has 10E as the first excited. Wait, the question is asking for ground state, first excited, and second excited. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption A: 30E, 39E, 50E \u2013 that seems way too high. \n\nOption B: 4E, 10E, 50E \u2013 Hmm, first is 4E. That would mean ground is 4E, but according to my calculation, ground is 10E. So maybe I messed up?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error here. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the particles are distinguishable? But no, they are identical. Wait, spin-1/2 fermions, so yes, must obey Pauli exclusion. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of each particle's state as a combination of n and spin. Each n can have two particles (spin up/down). So for four particles, the lowest possible configuration is indeed n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So total energy is 2*(1^2) + 2*(2^2) = 2 + 8 = 10E. So ground state is 10E. \n\nLooking at the options, the ground state is 10E in options C and D. But let's see the first excited state. \n\nWait, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The system is in the ground state, so to get the first excited state, one of the particles must be excited to a higher energy level. Since all four are filled in n=1 and 2, the first excited would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's think about the possible configurations. The ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state would have the next lowest possible energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to arrange the particles. Let's see: \n\nThe ground state is n1=1 (two particles), n2=2 (two particles) \u2192 total energy 10E. \n\nThe first excited state could be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. Then the configuration is n1=1 (2), n2=1 (since we have two particles in n=2 but one is moved?), no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think: \n\nThe particles in the ground state are two in n=1, two in n=2. To get the first excited state, the minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. \n\nSo the new configuration would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 2E +4E +9E = 15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=1 to a higher state? But that would require more energy. Since moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller increase. \n\nSo the first excited state energy would be 15E? Then the second excited state would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3?), or moving one to n=4. \n\nWait, let's see. Let's think of all possible excited states. The first excited state is the lowest energy state higher than ground. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe instead of moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, you could have another configuration where one of the particles in n=1 is moved to a higher state. But that would require more energy. For instance, moving from n=1 to n=3 would give a bigger increase. So that's not the first excited state. \n\nSo the first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Wait, but that's not possible because you can only have two in each n. Wait, no. Wait, original ground state had two in n=2. If you move one to n=3, you have one in n=2. Then to get the next excited state, maybe moving another from n=2 to n=3? Then n=2 would have zero, n=3 would have two. \n\nSo the total energy would be 2*(1^2) + 0*(2^2) + 2*(3^2) = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E? But that might be higher than another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving one particle from n=2 to n=4. Then the energy would be 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) + 1*(4^2) = 2 +4 +16 = 22E. Hmm, but maybe there's another arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are both moved to n=3. Then the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 = 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let me see the energy difference. \n\nMoving from n=2 to n=3: the energy added is (3^2 - 2^2) E = (9-4)E =5E. The ground state is 10E, so first excited is 15E. \n\nAlternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would add (9-1)E=8E, so total energy would be 10E +8E=18E, which is higher than 15E, so that's not the first excited. \n\nSo first excited is 15E. Then the second excited could be moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the total energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 =20E? \n\nAlternatively, maybe another configuration. Let's see: \n\nAnother possible first excited state could be when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3, but that's higher energy than moving from n=2 to 3. So the first excited is 15E. \n\nThen the second excited could be moving the other particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration would have two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. So that's 20E. But looking at the options, option C has the second excited as 15E, which is the same as first excited. That can't be. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption C is 4E, 10E, 15E. Hmm, that can't be. Because the ground state is 10E, so first excited is 15E, second would be higher. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the ground state calculation. Wait, wait a second. Maybe the particles are distinguishable? No, they are identical. Wait, but spin-1/2. Let me recheck the ground state calculation. \n\nWait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, each single-particle state (n, spin) can hold only one particle. For each n, there are two possible spin states (up and down), so each n can have two particles. \n\nSo the ground state would be filling the lowest energy states. \n\nThe lowest n is 1, which can have two particles. Then n=2 can also have two. So that fills all four particles. So the total energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(2)^2 E = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground is 10E. \n\nSo the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3. The configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, no, originally n=2 had two particles. Moving one to n=3 leaves one in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) = 2 +4 +9 =15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be when the second particle from n=2 is also moved to n=3. Then n=2 has zero, so two in n=3. So the total energy becomes 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 +0 +18 =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead. Let's see. If instead of moving the second n=2 particle to n=3, you move it to n=4, then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(4)^2 = 2+4+16=22E. But that's higher than 20E. So the lower energy would be the one with two in n=3. \n\nAlternatively, is there another possible configuration with energy between 15E and 20E? Like moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3? That would give 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Then total energy would be 1*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 1 +4 +18 =23E. No, that's higher. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is different? Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the first excited state could have another configuration where one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. But that would require more energy. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would add (9-1)E =8E. The ground is 10E, so that gives 18E, which is higher than 15E, so that's not the first excited. \n\nTherefore, first excited is 15E, second excited would be 20E. \n\nLooking at the options, let me see. \n\nOption D says 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, but the second excited here would be 20E, which is not in any option. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a lower energy configuration for the second excited state. Let's see. \n\nAfter the first excited state (15E), the next excited state might be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, and leaving the other in n=2? Wait, no, that's already accounted for. Wait, perhaps the second excited is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement where one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited is when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3, so the configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Then total energy is (1*1 + 2*4 +1*9) =1+8+9=18E. That's 18E, which is between 15E and 20E. \n\nAh! That's possible. Let me see. \n\nIn this scenario, after the first excited (15E) which is moving one from n=2 to n=3, the next could be moving one from n=1 to n=3 instead. Wait, but that would require higher energy. \n\nWait, the first excited is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 15E). The second excited could be moving one from n=2 to n=4 (so configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy is 2+4 +16 = 22E?), or moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited might be moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3) plus the other from n=2 to n= something else? \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving one from n=1 to n=3, so that the configuration is 1 in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. \n\nWait, the energy would be 1*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 = 1 + 8 +9 =18E. \n\nAh, that's possible. So the order of excited states might depend on which transitions are possible. Let me think. \n\nThe first excited is 15E (moving one from n=2 to n=3). The second excited could be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total 20E) or moving one from n=1 to n=3 (giving 18E). \n\nBut which is lower? 18E is lower than 20E, so that would be the next. \n\nWait, how is that possible? \n\nWait, let me recalculate the configuration where one particle is moved from n=1 to n=3. \n\nOriginal ground state has two in n=1. If one moves to n=3, then n=1 has one, n=3 has one. The other particles in n=2 remain two. So the total energy is (1*1^2 + 2*2^2 +1*3^2) = 1+8+9 =18E. \n\nSo that's an energy of 18E, which is lower than 20E. So that would be the second excited state, since 18E is less than 20E. \n\nHmm, so then the first excited is 15E, second is 18E. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. That would fit. \n\nWait, but then what's the configuration for 18E? \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than moving another from n=2 to n=3? Let me check the energy difference. \n\nMoving a particle from n=2 to n=3: \u0394E = (3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) E =5E. \n\nMoving a particle from n=1 to n=3: \u0394E = (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2)E =8E. \n\nTherefore, moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller increase. So the first excited state is indeed 15E (10 +5). \n\nThe next would be the next smallest possible increase. The next smallest would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (another +5E) leading to total 20E, but wait, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 is +8E, but that's more than moving another from n=2. \n\nWait, but the second excited state has to be the next lowest energy after the first excited. So after 15E, the next could be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 10E +5E +5E=20E?), or moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4 (but that's higher). \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 (first excited:15E) and then moving the other particle from n=2 to n=3 as well, so both n=2 particles are moved to n=3. That would give total energy: 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2 +0 +18=20E. \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and one from n=2 to n=4 would give 2*(1)^2 +0*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 +1*(4)^2 =2 +0 +9 +16=27E. \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and one from n=1 to n=3 would give 1*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 \u2192 1+4+18=23E. \n\nHmm, so the lowest next after 15E is 20E. \n\nWait but then why did I get the 18E scenario? \n\nWait, perhaps that configuration is not allowed. Wait, the configuration where you have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. \n\nWait, but how do you get there? To get that, you have to move one particle from n=1 to n=3. But that requires moving a particle from n=1, which is lower in energy than moving from n=2. \n\nWait, but the ground state has two in n=1. To move one from n=1 to n=3, you have to \"empty\" one of the n=1 slots, but the other is still filled. That would require that you have one particle in n=1, and the rest. \n\nSo the energy increase is (3^2 -1^2)E =8E. But since the ground is 10E, the total energy would be 10E +8E=18E. But why is this not the first excited state? Because moving from n=2 to n=3 requires less energy (5E). \n\nAh, right, so the first excited is 15E (the minimal increase), then the next is 18E, and then 20E. \n\nWait, but then the second excited would be 18E, not 20E. \n\nWait, so the order of excited states is based on the minimal energy increments. So after 15E (from moving one from n=2 to n=3), the next would be the next smallest possible, which is moving one from n=1 to n=3 (adding 8E). So the second excited would be 18E. \n\nThen the third excited would be moving the second n=2 particle to n=3 (adding another 5E), so 15E +5E =20E. \n\nSo in this case, the first excited is 15E, second is 18E, and third is 20E. \n\nLooking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. That matches the ground, first, and second excited states. \n\nAlternatively, option C has 10E as first excited? No, the ground is 10E. \n\nSo the answer would be D: 10E,15E,18E. \n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Let me think of all possible configurations:\n\nGround state: n1=2, n2=2 \u2192 total energy 10E.\n\nFirst excited: moving one from n2 to n3 \u2192 total energy 15E.\n\nSecond excited: moving one from n1 to n3 \u2192 18E.\n\nThird excited: moving the second from n2 to n3 \u219220E.\n\nSo the first three excited states (ground, first, second excited) are 10,15,18. So the answer would be D. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nD) 10E,15E,18E \u2192 yes. \n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E.\n\nYes, so D is the correct option. \n\nWait, but why is option C there? Maybe a common mistake if someone thought the ground state is lower. Let me think again why I thought the ground state is 10E. \n\nBecause four particles: two in n=1 (each with spin up and down), two in n=2. So 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 =2+8=10E. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the ground is 10E. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. We need to find their ground state, first excited, and second excited state energies in terms of E, where E is given as \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite square well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized and given by E_n = (n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2), so here they define E as that base term, so each particle's energy level would be n\u00b2 times E. But since there are four particles, and they're identical fermions (since spin-1/2 implies they are fermions), we have to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. \n\nFermions can't occupy the same quantum state, so each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum number n is the only one (since there's no angular momentum or other degrees of freedom here). But since the particles are spin-1/2, each n level can hold two particles with opposite spins. \n\nSo, let's start by figuring out how the four particles are arranged in the lowest energy states. The lowest energy state (ground state) would have the particles in the lowest possible n levels with the Pauli exclusion principle considered. \n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). The second level (n=2) can also hold 2 particles. The third (n=3) another 2, but since we have four particles, we need to fill up to n=2. Wait, 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2. That's four particles total. \n\nSo for the ground state configuration, the four particles would occupy n=1 (twice) and n=2 (twice). Each particle's energy is n\u00b2E, so the total energy is 2*(1\u00b2E) + 2*(2\u00b2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the options include 4E, 10E, etc. Hmm, so maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nWait, no, the question says four particles. Let me think again. Each n level can have two particles (since spin-1/2). So for the ground state, the first two particles go into n=1, each with spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So the total energy would be 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that would be the ground state. \n\nLooking at the options, option C has 10E as the first excited state, and D has 10E as the first excited. Wait, the question is asking for ground state, first excited, and second excited. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption A: 30E, 39E, 50E \u2013 that seems way too high. \n\nOption B: 4E, 10E, 50E \u2013 Hmm, first is 4E. That would mean ground is 4E, but according to my calculation, ground is 10E. So maybe I messed up?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error here. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the particles are distinguishable? But no, they are identical. Wait, spin-1/2 fermions, so yes, must obey Pauli exclusion. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of each particle's state as a combination of n and spin. Each n can have two particles (spin up/down). So for four particles, the lowest possible configuration is indeed n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So total energy is 2*(1^2) + 2*(2^2) = 2 + 8 = 10E. So ground state is 10E. \n\nLooking at the options, the ground state is 10E in options C and D. But let's see the first excited state. \n\nWait, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. The system is in the ground state, so to get the first excited state, one of the particles must be excited to a higher energy level. Since all four are filled in n=1 and 2, the first excited would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's think about the possible configurations. The ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state would have the next lowest possible energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to arrange the particles. Let's see: \n\nThe ground state is n1=1 (two particles), n2=2 (two particles) \u2192 total energy 10E. \n\nThe first excited state could be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. Then the configuration is n1=1 (2), n2=1 (since we have two particles in n=2 but one is moved?), no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think: \n\nThe particles in the ground state are two in n=1, two in n=2. To get the first excited state, the minimal energy increase would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. \n\nSo the new configuration would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 1*(2^2 E) + 1*(3^2 E) \u2192 2E +4E +9E = 15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=1 to a higher state? But that would require more energy. Since moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller increase. \n\nSo the first excited state energy would be 15E? Then the second excited state would be either moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3?), or moving one to n=4. \n\nWait, let's see. Let's think of all possible excited states. The first excited state is the lowest energy state higher than ground. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe instead of moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, you could have another configuration where one of the particles in n=1 is moved to a higher state. But that would require more energy. For instance, moving from n=1 to n=3 would give a bigger increase. So that's not the first excited state. \n\nSo the first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Wait, but that's not possible because you can only have two in each n. Wait, no. Wait, original ground state had two in n=2. If you move one to n=3, you have one in n=2. Then to get the next excited state, maybe moving another from n=2 to n=3? Then n=2 would have zero, n=3 would have two. \n\nSo the total energy would be 2*(1^2) + 0*(2^2) + 2*(3^2) = 2 + 0 + 18 = 20E? But that might be higher than another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving one particle from n=2 to n=4. Then the energy would be 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) + 1*(4^2) = 2 +4 +16 = 22E. Hmm, but maybe there's another arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are both moved to n=3. Then the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 = 20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. Let me see the energy difference. \n\nMoving from n=2 to n=3: the energy added is (3^2 - 2^2) E = (9-4)E =5E. The ground state is 10E, so first excited is 15E. \n\nAlternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would add (9-1)E=8E, so total energy would be 10E +8E=18E, which is higher than 15E, so that's not the first excited. \n\nSo first excited is 15E. Then the second excited could be moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the total energy would be 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 + 18 =20E? \n\nAlternatively, maybe another configuration. Let's see: \n\nAnother possible first excited state could be when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3, but that's higher energy than moving from n=2 to 3. So the first excited is 15E. \n\nThen the second excited could be moving the other particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration would have two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. So that's 20E. But looking at the options, option C has the second excited as 15E, which is the same as first excited. That can't be. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption C is 4E, 10E, 15E. Hmm, that can't be. Because the ground state is 10E, so first excited is 15E, second would be higher. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the ground state calculation. Wait, wait a second. Maybe the particles are distinguishable? No, they are identical. Wait, but spin-1/2. Let me recheck the ground state calculation. \n\nWait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are fermions, each single-particle state (n, spin) can hold only one particle. For each n, there are two possible spin states (up and down), so each n can have two particles. \n\nSo the ground state would be filling the lowest energy states. \n\nThe lowest n is 1, which can have two particles. Then n=2 can also have two. So that fills all four particles. So the total energy is 2*(1)^2 E + 2*(2)^2 E = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground is 10E. \n\nSo the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3. The configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, no, originally n=2 had two particles. Moving one to n=3 leaves one in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) = 2 +4 +9 =15E. \n\nThe next excited state (second excited) would be when the second particle from n=2 is also moved to n=3. Then n=2 has zero, so two in n=3. So the total energy becomes 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 2 +0 +18 =20E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another configuration where one particle is promoted to n=4 instead. Let's see. If instead of moving the second n=2 particle to n=3, you move it to n=4, then the energy would be 2*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +1*(4)^2 = 2+4+16=22E. But that's higher than 20E. So the lower energy would be the one with two in n=3. \n\nAlternatively, is there another possible configuration with energy between 15E and 20E? Like moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=3? That would give 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Then total energy would be 1*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 = 1 +4 +18 =23E. No, that's higher. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is different? Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the first excited state could have another configuration where one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. But that would require more energy. For example, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would add (9-1)E =8E. The ground is 10E, so that gives 18E, which is higher than 15E, so that's not the first excited. \n\nTherefore, first excited is 15E, second excited would be 20E. \n\nLooking at the options, let me see. \n\nOption D says 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, but the second excited here would be 20E, which is not in any option. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a lower energy configuration for the second excited state. Let's see. \n\nAfter the first excited state (15E), the next excited state might be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, and leaving the other in n=2? Wait, no, that's already accounted for. Wait, perhaps the second excited is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement where one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second excited is when one particle from n=1 is moved to n=3, so the configuration is 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Then total energy is (1*1 + 2*4 +1*9) =1+8+9=18E. That's 18E, which is between 15E and 20E. \n\nAh! That's possible. Let me see. \n\nIn this scenario, after the first excited (15E) which is moving one from n=2 to n=3, the next could be moving one from n=1 to n=3 instead. Wait, but that would require higher energy. \n\nWait, the first excited is moving one from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 15E). The second excited could be moving one from n=2 to n=4 (so configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Energy is 2+4 +16 = 22E?), or moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=2? No. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited might be moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3) plus the other from n=2 to n= something else? \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving one from n=1 to n=3, so that the configuration is 1 in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. \n\nWait, the energy would be 1*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 = 1 + 8 +9 =18E. \n\nAh, that's possible. So the order of excited states might depend on which transitions are possible. Let me think. \n\nThe first excited is 15E (moving one from n=2 to n=3). The second excited could be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total 20E) or moving one from n=1 to n=3 (giving 18E). \n\nBut which is lower? 18E is lower than 20E, so that would be the next. \n\nWait, how is that possible? \n\nWait, let me recalculate the configuration where one particle is moved from n=1 to n=3. \n\nOriginal ground state has two in n=1. If one moves to n=3, then n=1 has one, n=3 has one. The other particles in n=2 remain two. So the total energy is (1*1^2 + 2*2^2 +1*3^2) = 1+8+9 =18E. \n\nSo that's an energy of 18E, which is lower than 20E. So that would be the second excited state, since 18E is less than 20E. \n\nHmm, so then the first excited is 15E, second is 18E. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. That would fit. \n\nWait, but then what's the configuration for 18E? \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving one particle from n=1 to n=3 requires more energy than moving another from n=2 to n=3? Let me check the energy difference. \n\nMoving a particle from n=2 to n=3: \u0394E = (3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) E =5E. \n\nMoving a particle from n=1 to n=3: \u0394E = (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2)E =8E. \n\nTherefore, moving from n=2 to n=3 gives a smaller increase. So the first excited state is indeed 15E (10 +5). \n\nThe next would be the next smallest possible increase. The next smallest would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (another +5E) leading to total 20E, but wait, but moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 is +8E, but that's more than moving another from n=2. \n\nWait, but the second excited state has to be the next lowest energy after the first excited. So after 15E, the next could be either moving another from n=2 to n=3 (total energy 10E +5E +5E=20E?), or moving one from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4 (but that's higher). \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 (first excited:15E) and then moving the other particle from n=2 to n=3 as well, so both n=2 particles are moved to n=3. That would give total energy: 2*(1)^2 + 0*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 =2 +0 +18=20E. \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and one from n=2 to n=4 would give 2*(1)^2 +0*(2)^2 +1*(3)^2 +1*(4)^2 =2 +0 +9 +16=27E. \n\nAlternatively, moving one from n=2 to n=3 and one from n=1 to n=3 would give 1*(1)^2 +1*(2)^2 +2*(3)^2 \u2192 1+4+18=23E. \n\nHmm, so the lowest next after 15E is 20E. \n\nWait but then why did I get the 18E scenario? \n\nWait, perhaps that configuration is not allowed. Wait, the configuration where you have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. \n\nWait, but how do you get there? To get that, you have to move one particle from n=1 to n=3. But that requires moving a particle from n=1, which is lower in energy than moving from n=2. \n\nWait, but the ground state has two in n=1. To move one from n=1 to n=3, you have to \"empty\" one of the n=1 slots, but the other is still filled. That would require that you have one particle in n=1, and the rest. \n\nSo the energy increase is (3^2 -1^2)E =8E. But since the ground is 10E, the total energy would be 10E +8E=18E. But why is this not the first excited state? Because moving from n=2 to n=3 requires less energy (5E). \n\nAh, right, so the first excited is 15E (the minimal increase), then the next is 18E, and then 20E. \n\nWait, but then the second excited would be 18E, not 20E. \n\nWait, so the order of excited states is based on the minimal energy increments. So after 15E (from moving one from n=2 to n=3), the next would be the next smallest possible, which is moving one from n=1 to n=3 (adding 8E). So the second excited would be 18E. \n\nThen the third excited would be moving the second n=2 particle to n=3 (adding another 5E), so 15E +5E =20E. \n\nSo in this case, the first excited is 15E, second is 18E, and third is 20E. \n\nLooking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. That matches the ground, first, and second excited states. \n\nAlternatively, option C has 10E as first excited? No, the ground is 10E. \n\nSo the answer would be D: 10E,15E,18E. \n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Let me think of all possible configurations:\n\nGround state: n1=2, n2=2 \u2192 total energy 10E.\n\nFirst excited: moving one from n2 to n3 \u2192 total energy 15E.\n\nSecond excited: moving one from n1 to n3 \u2192 18E.\n\nThird excited: moving the second from n2 to n3 \u219220E.\n\nSo the first three excited states (ground, first, second excited) are 10,15,18. So the answer would be D. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nD) 10E,15E,18E \u2192 yes. \n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB) 4E, 10E, 50E\n\nC)4E,10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E.\n\nYes, so D is the correct option. \n\nWait, but why is option C there? Maybe a common mistake if someone thought the ground state is lower. Let me think again why I thought the ground state is 10E. \n\nBecause four particles: two in n=1 (each with spin up and down), two in n=2. So 2*(1)^2 + 2*(2)^2 =2+8=10E. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the ground is 10E. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well, we consider the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level \\( n \\) can hold two particles with opposite spins. \n\n**Ground State**: The lowest energy configuration fills the lowest two energy levels completely.  \n- \\( n = 1 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E \\)  \n- \\( n = 2 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 8E \\)  \n**Total energy**: \\( 2E + 8E = 10E \\).\n\n**First Excited State**: The next lowest energy configuration involves promoting one particle from \\( n = 2 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\).  \n- \\( n = 1 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 2E \\)  \n- \\( n = 2 \\): 1 particle \u2192 \\( 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E \\)  \n- \\( n = 3 \\): 1 particle \u2192 \\( 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E \\)  \n**Total energy**: \\( 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \\).\n\n**Second Excited State**: The next lowest energy increase comes from promoting one particle from \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\) (or alternatively, moving another particle from \\( n = 2 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\)). The smallest energy increment here is moving one particle from \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\):  \n- \\( n = 1 \\): 1 particle \u2192 \\( 1 \\times (1^2 E) = 1E \\)  \n- \\( n = 2 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 8E \\)  \n- \\( n = 3 \\): 1 particle \u2192 \\( 9E \\)  \nHowever, the minimal configuration after the first excited state (15E) is moving the remaining particle from \\( n = 2 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\):  \n- \\( n = 1 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 2E \\)  \n- \\( n = 2 \\): 0 particles \u2192 \\( 0E \\)  \n- \\( n = 3 \\): 2 particles \u2192 \\( 2 \\times (3^2 E) = 18E \\)  \n**Total energy**: \\( 2E + 18E = 20E \\). But considering the next smallest increment after 15E is moving one particle from \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 3 \\), which gives \\( 18E \\). This is the correct second excited state.\n\nThus, the energies are **10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited)**, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A through D, each with different values.\n\nHmm, first, I need to remember how particles in a box work, especially when they're fermions. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because of their spin-up and spin-down states). \n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by E_n = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) which is exactly what E is here. So each E_n is n\u00b2 times E. Wait, actually, the given E is exactly that expression with n=1? Let me check. The formula for E_n is n\u00b2 times (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)), so the given E is E_1. So each energy level n is n\u00b2E. Got it.\n\nNow, with four particles, each being a fermion, I need to fill the lowest energy levels. Let's start with the ground state. The ground state would have all particles in the lowest possible energy states, considering the exclusion principle.\n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles (since spin-up and spin-down). The next level, n=2, can also hold two. So for four particles, we can fill n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Since E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E (since n=2 squared is 4). So total energy would be 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, let me think again. Wait, E is already the first energy level. So E_1 = E, E_2 = (2)^2 E = 4E. So two particles in n=1 contribute 2*E each? Wait no, each particle in n=1 contributes E. Since two particles are there, total for n=1 is 2E. The two in n=2 would each contribute 4E, so total for n=2 is 8E. So total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's the ground state energy. Wait but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D has 10E as first, but let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E, 10E,50E\n\nC)4E, 10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nHmm, so if the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state must be higher. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the four particles: each n level can have two particles. So for the ground state, the lowest possible would be filling n=1 twice (spin up and down), and n=2 twice as well? Wait wait no. Wait, four particles. Let me think again. Wait, n=1 can take two particles (since spin can be +1/2 or -1/2). Then n=2 can also take two. So two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. That would correspond to option D's first entry. Then first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. \n\nWait, but let me see the options. Option D has the first entry as 10E, so that's ground state. Then the first excited state would be the next possible state. How do you get the first excited state? It's when one of the particles is promoted to the next available level. Since the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2. The next available level is n=3, but since we can only have two particles in n=3, but we have four particles total. Wait, perhaps another configuration?\n\nWait, maybe I made an error here. Let me think again. Wait, four particles. Let's see:\n\nThe possible energy levels for each particle are n=1,2,3,... Each n can have two particles. So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's correct. \n\nNow, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement where one particle is promoted to the next higher energy level. Wait, but since the particles are fermions, they can't have the same quantum numbers. So, perhaps one of the particles in the n=2 level can't go up? Wait no, the next available is n=3. But since all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, to get an excited state, you have to move one of them to a higher n. So moving one from n=2 to n=3. But wait, there are two particles in n=2. Each of those can be promoted to n=3? Let me see:\n\nWait, the first excited state would have the minimal possible energy above the ground state. So moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration would be: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait but that would leave a hole in n=2? Wait, but that might not be allowed because the original n=2 had two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in the n=2 level is moved to n=3. So the total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E). So total would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Wait, maybe there are multiple particles that can be promoted. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the ground state is n1=1 (2 particles), n2=2 (2 particles). To get the first excited state, you need to have one of the particles in the highest filled level (n=2) to move to the next available level, n=3. So the new configuration would have two in n1, one in n2, and one in n3. So the energy would be 2E + 4E +9E= 15E. So that would be the first excited state. \n\nThen the second excited state would be moving another particle from n2 to n3, so now n2 has zero, and n3 has two. But wait, the second excited state may not require all particles to be in the highest possible. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state could also be moving a particle from n2 to n3, but perhaps another arrangement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state could be moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3, leading to total energy 15E, which would be the first excited state. Then the next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so now n2 has one, n3 has two. So total energy would be 2E + 4E + 2*(9E) = 2 +4 +18 =24E? Wait, but that's not in the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me see the options again. The options have the second excited state as 50E, 15E, 18E, etc. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Let me think again. The first excited state should have the minimal energy higher than the ground state. The ground is 10E. The next possible would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. The energy difference is (9E -4E) =5E, so total energy is 10E +5E =15E. So that's the first excited. Then the next would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3, so energy would be 2E (n=1) +0 (since n=2 has none now?) Wait no, original n=2 had two, moving two to n=3. Wait, no, the first excited state only moves one. The second excited would be moving another one from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has one left, and n=3 has two. The total energy would be 2E +4E (for one in n=2?) Wait, no, if we move one from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 has one left. So the energy for n=2 is 4E (for that one particle) plus 9E (two in n=3). So total would be 2*E (n=1) +4E (n=2) + 2*(9E) (n=3). Wait no, wait the two particles in n=3 would contribute 2*9E. So 2E +4E +18E = 24E. But that's not in the options. Hmm. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require a higher energy. Wait, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would give a higher energy difference (9E -1E=8E), so the total energy would be higher than moving from n=2. Since the first excited state should be the minimal, moving from n=2 to n=3 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, giving 15E, which would be the first excited. Then the next excited state (second) could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, which gives 2E + (n=2 has one, so 4E) + 2*9E (since two in n=3). So total would be 2+4+18=24E. But none of the options have that. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's 24E. Not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there is another arrangement where a particle is promoted to a higher level but in a different way.\n\nWait, let's look at the options again. Option C has 4E, 10E,15E. The first entry is 4E, which can't be the ground state since we already calculated the ground as 10E. So that's probably not. Option D has first entry 10E (ground), then 15E (first excited), then 18E. Hmm. Let me think about the second excited state again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is moved to n=3? But that would require a higher energy. The first excited should be the smallest possible increase. Moving from n=2 to n=3 gives +5E, but moving from n=1 to n=3 would give +8E, so that's worse. So 15E is first excited. \n\nNow for the second excited state, the next possible would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. That gives 2E + (n=2 has one left, so 4E) plus two in n=3 (so 18E). Total 2+4+18=24. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=4? Let's see. Let's try moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 (first excited: 15E). The second excited state could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3. The energy would then be 2E (n=1) + (n=2 has one, so 4E) + (n=3 has one, so 9E) + (n=4 has one, 16E). Wait, but no, if you move one from n=2 to n=4, then n=2 has one, and n=4 has one. So total would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2) +16E (n4). Wait, but that's 2+4+16=22E, which is also not in the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. So that would give: one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Then the total energy would be 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1 +8 +9=18E. That's option D's second entry (15E and then 18E). Wait, that would make sense. Wait, but why would moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 give a higher energy than moving another from n=2 to n=3?\n\nWait, the first excited is moving from n=2 to n=3 (15E). The next would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3, but that requires leaving n=2 with one, so energy would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2's one) + 2*9E (n3's two) = 2+4+18=24E. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3, which would give a total energy of (1E for one in n1, two in n2 (total 2*4E=8E) and one in n3 (9E) plus the other in n1? Wait, no. Wait, if one of the n1 particles is moved to n3, then n1 has one left (since originally two), so n1 has one (E), n2 has two (each 4E, total 8E), and n3 has one (9E). So total is 1+8+9=18E. That's lower than 24E. So maybe that's the second excited state. So the order would be first excited at 15E (from moving a n2 to n3), then next is moving a n1 to n3 (18E). Wait, but why would that be the next?\n\nWait, the energy difference between the ground (10E) and first excited (15E) is 5E. The difference between first and second (18E) is 3E. But that would mean that moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a smaller energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3. Hmm, that might not make sense because moving from n2 to n3 adds 5E (from 4E to 9E), but moving from n1 to n3 adds 8E (from 1E to 9E). Wait, but the total energy would be:\n\nOriginal ground state: 10E.\n\nAfter moving n2 to n3: total becomes 15E (increase of 5E).\n\nAfter moving n1 to n3: the total would be 1E (remaining in n1) + 2*(4E) (n2's two?) Wait no, if you move one from n1 to n3, then n1 has one left, n2 still has two. So n2's total is 2*(4E)=8E. n3 has one (9E). So total is 1 +8 +9 =18E. That's an increase of 8E from the ground? Wait no, the first excited was 15E. So from the ground (10E) to 15E is +5, then to 18E would be another +3. So 18E is a lower energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3 (which would require going to 24E). So perhaps the second excited state is 18E. \n\nSo in that case, the ground is 10E (D's first), first excited 15E (D's second), second excited 18E (D's third). So D would be the answer? Wait but let's check the options again. Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. \n\nWait, but wait another possibility. Let me think again. The first excited state may have another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. But that would require more energy. Let's see:\n\nIf I move one particle from n=1 to n=3, then the total energy would be (1E for the remaining in n1) + 2*(4E for n2's two) +9E (the one in n3) = 1+8+9 =18E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E is the first excited. \n\nSo the first excited is 15E, then the next is 18E. So D's options would be correct. \n\nWait, but let me see other options. Option C has 10E as the second entry. Option A and B don't have 10E as first. So the correct answer would be D? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state calculation. Let me check again. \n\nThe four particles are spin-1/2, so each single-particle state (n, spin) can have one particle. For n=1, there are two states (spin up/down). So filling all four particles would need to fill n=1 and n=2. Because n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two. So four particles. So the ground state's total energy is 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E +8E=10E. That's correct. \n\nThen the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available energy level. The highest occupied level in ground state is n=2, so promoting one from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is n1 (2), n2 (1), n3 (1). The total energy is 2*(1\u00b2 E) +1*(2\u00b2 E) +1*(3\u00b2 E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. \n\nThen the second excited state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So total energy is 2E +0 (since n2 has none) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But 20E isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps another way. \n\nAlternatively, after the first excited state (15E), the next could be moving one of the n1 particles to n3. So n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Wait, that's the same as the first scenario. Wait no, if you move a particle from n1 to n3, then n1 has 1, n2 remains 2, n3 has 1. So total energy is (1E) + (2*4E) +9E = 1 +8 +9 =18E. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving a particle from n2 to n4, giving n2 has 1, n4 has 1. So total energy would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2) +16E (n4). That's 2+4+16=22E. Not in the options. \n\nHmm. So between the two possibilities, moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives 18E, which is an option in D (third entry). So then D would have the three energies as 10,15,18. Which matches. \n\nAlternatively, what if the second excited is moving a particle from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n3? Then n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So total energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2+18=20E. Not in the options. \n\nSo perhaps the second excited state is the one where we have 18E, so D's third entry. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possible configurations. \n\nGround state: n1(2), n2(2). Energy 10E.\n\nFirst excited: promote one from n2 to n3. So n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). Total 15E.\n\nSecond excited: promote another from n2 to n3, so n2(0), n3(2). Energy 2*(1E) + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2+18=20E. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, instead of moving both from n2 to n3, maybe after the first excited (15E), the next is moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n1 to n3? Wait that might not be the next step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 (15E). The second excited could be moving one of the n1 particles to n2. Wait, but n2 already has one. Since n=2 can hold two, but in the first excited state, n2 has one. So moving a particle from n1 to n2 would allow the n2 to go back to two? Wait, but that would lower the energy. So that's not an excited state. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second excited is when one of the particles in n2 moves to n4. Then the energy would be 2E + (4E for one in n2) +16E (one in n4). So 2+4+16=22E, which isn't in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is moving a particle from n1 to n3, giving 18E, but that would require a higher energy jump, so the first excited would have to be the lower one (15E). \n\nTherefore, the second excited must be 18E, which is option D's third value. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 10E,15E,18E. \n\nAlternatively, let me check another approach. Maybe I need to consider all possible configurations and their energies, then sort them. \n\nPossible configurations for four particles:\n\nGround: n1(2), n2(2) \u2192 10E.\n\nPossible first excitations:\n\n1. n1(2), n2(1), n3(1) \u2192 2E +4E +9E=15E.\n\n2. n1(1), n2(2), n3(1) \u2192 1E +8E +9E=18E.\n\n3. n1(2), n2(0), n3(2) \u2192 2E +0 +18E=20E.\n\n4. n1(1), n2(1), n3(1), n4(1) \u2192 1 +4 +9 +16 =30E (but that's higher).\n\nSo the first excited state is the lowest of these, which is 15E. The second excited would be the next, which is 18E. The third would be 20E, etc. \n\nThus, the first excited is 15E, second is 18E. So D's options (10E,15E,18E) would be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, which is given as E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2). The options are A through D, each with different values.\n\nHmm, first, I need to remember how particles in a box work, especially when they're fermions. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because of their spin-up and spin-down states). \n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by E_n = (n\u00b2 \u03c0\u00b2 \u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2) which is exactly what E is here. So each E_n is n\u00b2 times E. Wait, actually, the given E is exactly that expression with n=1? Let me check. The formula for E_n is n\u00b2 times (\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2)), so the given E is E_1. So each energy level n is n\u00b2E. Got it.\n\nNow, with four particles, each being a fermion, I need to fill the lowest energy levels. Let's start with the ground state. The ground state would have all particles in the lowest possible energy states, considering the exclusion principle.\n\nThe first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles (since spin-up and spin-down). The next level, n=2, can also hold two. So for four particles, we can fill n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Since E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E (since n=2 squared is 4). So total energy would be 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, let me think again. Wait, E is already the first energy level. So E_1 = E, E_2 = (2)^2 E = 4E. So two particles in n=1 contribute 2*E each? Wait no, each particle in n=1 contributes E. Since two particles are there, total for n=1 is 2E. The two in n=2 would each contribute 4E, so total for n=2 is 8E. So total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's the ground state energy. Wait but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D has 10E as first, but let me see the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nB)4E, 10E,50E\n\nC)4E, 10E,15E\n\nD)10E,15E,18E\n\nHmm, so if the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state must be higher. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the four particles: each n level can have two particles. So for the ground state, the lowest possible would be filling n=1 twice (spin up and down), and n=2 twice as well? Wait wait no. Wait, four particles. Let me think again. Wait, n=1 can take two particles (since spin can be +1/2 or -1/2). Then n=2 can also take two. So two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E. That would correspond to option D's first entry. Then first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. \n\nWait, but let me see the options. Option D has the first entry as 10E, so that's ground state. Then the first excited state would be the next possible state. How do you get the first excited state? It's when one of the particles is promoted to the next available level. Since the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2. The next available level is n=3, but since we can only have two particles in n=3, but we have four particles total. Wait, perhaps another configuration?\n\nWait, maybe I made an error here. Let me think again. Wait, four particles. Let's see:\n\nThe possible energy levels for each particle are n=1,2,3,... Each n can have two particles. So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that's correct. \n\nNow, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement where one particle is promoted to the next higher energy level. Wait, but since the particles are fermions, they can't have the same quantum numbers. So, perhaps one of the particles in the n=2 level can't go up? Wait no, the next available is n=3. But since all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, to get an excited state, you have to move one of them to a higher n. So moving one from n=2 to n=3. But wait, there are two particles in n=2. Each of those can be promoted to n=3? Let me see:\n\nWait, the first excited state would have the minimal possible energy above the ground state. So moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration would be: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait but that would leave a hole in n=2? Wait, but that might not be allowed because the original n=2 had two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in the n=2 level is moved to n=3. So the total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E). So total would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Wait, maybe there are multiple particles that can be promoted. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the ground state is n1=1 (2 particles), n2=2 (2 particles). To get the first excited state, you need to have one of the particles in the highest filled level (n=2) to move to the next available level, n=3. So the new configuration would have two in n1, one in n2, and one in n3. So the energy would be 2E + 4E +9E= 15E. So that would be the first excited state. \n\nThen the second excited state would be moving another particle from n2 to n3, so now n2 has zero, and n3 has two. But wait, the second excited state may not require all particles to be in the highest possible. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state could also be moving a particle from n2 to n3, but perhaps another arrangement?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state could be moving one of the particles from n=2 to n=3, leading to total energy 15E, which would be the first excited state. Then the next excited state (second excited) would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so now n2 has one, n3 has two. So total energy would be 2E + 4E + 2*(9E) = 2 +4 +18 =24E? Wait, but that's not in the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me see the options again. The options have the second excited state as 50E, 15E, 18E, etc. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Let me think again. The first excited state should have the minimal energy higher than the ground state. The ground is 10E. The next possible would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. The energy difference is (9E -4E) =5E, so total energy is 10E +5E =15E. So that's the first excited. Then the next would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3, so energy would be 2E (n=1) +0 (since n=2 has none now?) Wait no, original n=2 had two, moving two to n=3. Wait, no, the first excited state only moves one. The second excited would be moving another one from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has one left, and n=3 has two. The total energy would be 2E +4E (for one in n=2?) Wait, no, if we move one from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 has one left. So the energy for n=2 is 4E (for that one particle) plus 9E (two in n=3). So total would be 2*E (n=1) +4E (n=2) + 2*(9E) (n=3). Wait no, wait the two particles in n=3 would contribute 2*9E. So 2E +4E +18E = 24E. But that's not in the options. Hmm. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead moving a particle from n=1 to n=3? But that would require a higher energy. Wait, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would give a higher energy difference (9E -1E=8E), so the total energy would be higher than moving from n=2. Since the first excited state should be the minimal, moving from n=2 to n=3 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first excited state is moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, giving 15E, which would be the first excited. Then the next excited state (second) could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, which gives 2E + (n=2 has one, so 4E) + 2*9E (since two in n=3). So total would be 2+4+18=24E. But none of the options have that. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's 24E. Not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there is another arrangement where a particle is promoted to a higher level but in a different way.\n\nWait, let's look at the options again. Option C has 4E, 10E,15E. The first entry is 4E, which can't be the ground state since we already calculated the ground as 10E. So that's probably not. Option D has first entry 10E (ground), then 15E (first excited), then 18E. Hmm. Let me think about the second excited state again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is moved to n=3? But that would require a higher energy. The first excited should be the smallest possible increase. Moving from n=2 to n=3 gives +5E, but moving from n=1 to n=3 would give +8E, so that's worse. So 15E is first excited. \n\nNow for the second excited state, the next possible would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. That gives 2E + (n=2 has one left, so 4E) plus two in n=3 (so 18E). Total 2+4+18=24. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=4? Let's see. Let's try moving one particle from n=2 to n=3 (first excited: 15E). The second excited state could be moving a particle from n=2 to n=4 instead of n=3. The energy would then be 2E (n=1) + (n=2 has one, so 4E) + (n=3 has one, so 9E) + (n=4 has one, 16E). Wait, but no, if you move one from n=2 to n=4, then n=2 has one, and n=4 has one. So total would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2) +16E (n4). Wait, but that's 2+4+16=22E, which is also not in the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second excited state is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. So that would give: one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Then the total energy would be 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1 +8 +9=18E. That's option D's second entry (15E and then 18E). Wait, that would make sense. Wait, but why would moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 give a higher energy than moving another from n=2 to n=3?\n\nWait, the first excited is moving from n=2 to n=3 (15E). The next would be moving another from n=2 to n=3 (so two in n=3, but that requires leaving n=2 with one, so energy would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2's one) + 2*9E (n3's two) = 2+4+18=24E. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited is moving a particle from n=1 to n=3, which would give a total energy of (1E for one in n1, two in n2 (total 2*4E=8E) and one in n3 (9E) plus the other in n1? Wait, no. Wait, if one of the n1 particles is moved to n3, then n1 has one left (since originally two), so n1 has one (E), n2 has two (each 4E, total 8E), and n3 has one (9E). So total is 1+8+9=18E. That's lower than 24E. So maybe that's the second excited state. So the order would be first excited at 15E (from moving a n2 to n3), then next is moving a n1 to n3 (18E). Wait, but why would that be the next?\n\nWait, the energy difference between the ground (10E) and first excited (15E) is 5E. The difference between first and second (18E) is 3E. But that would mean that moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives a smaller energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3. Hmm, that might not make sense because moving from n2 to n3 adds 5E (from 4E to 9E), but moving from n1 to n3 adds 8E (from 1E to 9E). Wait, but the total energy would be:\n\nOriginal ground state: 10E.\n\nAfter moving n2 to n3: total becomes 15E (increase of 5E).\n\nAfter moving n1 to n3: the total would be 1E (remaining in n1) + 2*(4E) (n2's two?) Wait no, if you move one from n1 to n3, then n1 has one left, n2 still has two. So n2's total is 2*(4E)=8E. n3 has one (9E). So total is 1 +8 +9 =18E. That's an increase of 8E from the ground? Wait no, the first excited was 15E. So from the ground (10E) to 15E is +5, then to 18E would be another +3. So 18E is a lower energy increase than moving another from n2 to n3 (which would require going to 24E). So perhaps the second excited state is 18E. \n\nSo in that case, the ground is 10E (D's first), first excited 15E (D's second), second excited 18E (D's third). So D would be the answer? Wait but let's check the options again. Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E. \n\nWait, but wait another possibility. Let me think again. The first excited state may have another configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is promoted to a higher level. But that would require more energy. Let's see:\n\nIf I move one particle from n=1 to n=3, then the total energy would be (1E for the remaining in n1) + 2*(4E for n2's two) +9E (the one in n3) = 1+8+9 =18E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E is the first excited. \n\nSo the first excited is 15E, then the next is 18E. So D's options would be correct. \n\nWait, but let me see other options. Option C has 10E as the second entry. Option A and B don't have 10E as first. So the correct answer would be D? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state calculation. Let me check again. \n\nThe four particles are spin-1/2, so each single-particle state (n, spin) can have one particle. For n=1, there are two states (spin up/down). So filling all four particles would need to fill n=1 and n=2. Because n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two. So four particles. So the ground state's total energy is 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E +8E=10E. That's correct. \n\nThen the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available energy level. The highest occupied level in ground state is n=2, so promoting one from n=2 to n=3. The new configuration is n1 (2), n2 (1), n3 (1). The total energy is 2*(1\u00b2 E) +1*(2\u00b2 E) +1*(3\u00b2 E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. \n\nThen the second excited state would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now, n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So total energy is 2E +0 (since n2 has none) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E =20E. But 20E isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps another way. \n\nAlternatively, after the first excited state (15E), the next could be moving one of the n1 particles to n3. So n1 has 1, n2 has 2, n3 has 1. Wait, that's the same as the first scenario. Wait no, if you move a particle from n1 to n3, then n1 has 1, n2 remains 2, n3 has 1. So total energy is (1E) + (2*4E) +9E = 1 +8 +9 =18E. \n\nAlternatively, the second excited could be moving a particle from n2 to n4, giving n2 has 1, n4 has 1. So total energy would be 2E (n1) +4E (n2) +16E (n4). That's 2+4+16=22E. Not in the options. \n\nHmm. So between the two possibilities, moving a particle from n1 to n3 gives 18E, which is an option in D (third entry). So then D would have the three energies as 10,15,18. Which matches. \n\nAlternatively, what if the second excited is moving a particle from n2 to n3 and another from n2 to n3? Then n2 has 0, n3 has 2. So total energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2+18=20E. Not in the options. \n\nSo perhaps the second excited state is the one where we have 18E, so D's third entry. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possible configurations. \n\nGround state: n1(2), n2(2). Energy 10E.\n\nFirst excited: promote one from n2 to n3. So n1(2), n2(1), n3(1). Total 15E.\n\nSecond excited: promote another from n2 to n3, so n2(0), n3(2). Energy 2*(1E) + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2+18=20E. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, instead of moving both from n2 to n3, maybe after the first excited (15E), the next is moving one from n2 to n3 and another from n1 to n3? Wait that might not be the next step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is when one of the n2 particles moves to n3 (15E). The second excited could be moving one of the n1 particles to n2. Wait, but n2 already has one. Since n=2 can hold two, but in the first excited state, n2 has one. So moving a particle from n1 to n2 would allow the n2 to go back to two? Wait, but that would lower the energy. So that's not an excited state. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second excited is when one of the particles in n2 moves to n4. Then the energy would be 2E + (4E for one in n2) +16E (one in n4). So 2+4+16=22E, which isn't in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first excited is moving a particle from n1 to n3, giving 18E, but that would require a higher energy jump, so the first excited would have to be the lower one (15E). \n\nTherefore, the second excited must be 18E, which is option D's third value. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 10E,15E,18E. \n\nAlternatively, let me check another approach. Maybe I need to consider all possible configurations and their energies, then sort them. \n\nPossible configurations for four particles:\n\nGround: n1(2), n2(2) \u2192 10E.\n\nPossible first excitations:\n\n1. n1(2), n2(1), n3(1) \u2192 2E +4E +9E=15E.\n\n2. n1(1), n2(2), n3(1) \u2192 1E +8E +9E=18E.\n\n3. n1(2), n2(0), n3(2) \u2192 2E +0 +18E=20E.\n\n4. n1(1), n2(1), n3(1), n4(1) \u2192 1 +4 +9 +16 =30E (but that's higher).\n\nSo the first excited state is the lowest of these, which is 15E. The second excited would be the next, which is 18E. The third would be 20E, etc. \n\nThus, the first excited is 15E, second is 18E. So D's options (10E,15E,18E) would be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the energy levels for a single particle, \\( E_n = n^2 E \\), where \\( E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} \\).\n\n**Ground State:**  \nThe lowest energy configuration fills the lowest available energy levels while respecting the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level \\( n \\) can hold two particles (due to spin). For four particles:  \n- Two particles occupy \\( n=1 \\): \\( 2 \\times 1^2 E = 2E \\).  \n- Two particles occupy \\( n=2 \\): \\( 2 \\times 2^2 E = 8E \\).  \nTotal ground state energy: \\( 2E + 8E = 10E \\).\n\n**First Excited State:**  \nThe first excited state is the minimal increase above the ground state. Promote one particle from \\( n=2 \\) to \\( n=3 \\):  \n- Two particles in \\( n=1 \\): \\( 2E \\).  \n- One particle in \\( n=2 \\): \\( 1 \\times 4E = 4E \\).  \n- One particle in \\( n=3 \\): \\( 1 \\times 9E = 9E \\).  \nTotal energy: \\( 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \\).\n\n**Second Excited State:**  \nThe next minimal increase involves promoting a particle from \\( n=1 \\) to \\( n=3 \\):  \n- One particle in \\( n=1 \\): \\( 1 \\times E = E \\).  \n- Two particles in \\( n=2 \\): \\( 2 \\times 4E = 8E \\).  \n- One particle in \\( n=3 \\): \\( 1 \\times 9E = 9E \\).  \nTotal energy: \\( E + 8E + 9E = 18E \\).\n\nThe energies correspond to option **D** (10E, 15E, 18E).\n\nAnswer: D",
