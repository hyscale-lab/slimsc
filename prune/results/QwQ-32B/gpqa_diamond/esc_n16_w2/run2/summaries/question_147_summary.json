      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the velocity of particle A in this annihilation process. The reaction given is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe I can treat its kinetic energy as negligible? And the mass of A is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle annihilation, the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton should be converted into the kinetic and rest mass energies of the products. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, so maybe I can approximate the total initial energy as just twice the rest mass energy of the proton? Wait, the proton and antiproton each have rest mass energy. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV, so the total rest energy would be 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But if the antiproton is at rest, then the total energy is just the sum of their rest energies. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible. So the initial energy is approximately the sum of their rest masses. \n\nThe products are two A+ and two A- particles. Each has a rest mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300 MeV) = 1200 MeV. \n\nBut the total energy from the initial must equal the total energy of the products. Since the initial energy is 1876 MeV, the products must have kinetic energy plus their rest energy adding up to that. So the kinetic energy of the A particles would be 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nWait, but how do I find the velocity of each A particle? Since there are four particles, each A has some kinetic energy. But maybe the system is symmetric, so each pair (like the two A+ and two A-) would have the same speed? Or maybe all four have the same speed and direction? Hmm, annihilation processes often result in particles moving in opposite directions, but maybe here they are emitted symmetrically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is approximately zero (if the antiproton is at rest, then the proton and antiproton must be moving towards each other? Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly? The problem isn't entirely clear. Wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But if it's moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the total initial momentum would be approximately the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is negligible. \n\nWait, in any case, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, maybe they are moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ go in one direction and two A- in the opposite, each with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nSo each A particle would have the same speed, but opposite directions. Therefore, the magnitude of their velocities would be the same. \n\nTo calculate their velocity, perhaps I can use energy and momentum conservation. Let me try setting up equations. \n\nLet me denote the mass of each A as m_A = 300 MeV / c\u00b2. \n\nTotal initial energy is approximately 2*(938 MeV) since the antiproton's KE is negligible. So E_initial \u2248 2*938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal rest mass of products is 4*m_A*c\u00b2 = 1200 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the products is then 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nBut each of the four particles has kinetic energy. So each has (676)/4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. \n\nWait, but kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (\u03b3-1)m c\u00b2. So perhaps I need to compute the total energy of each particle. \n\nEach particle's total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The kinetic energy is (\u03b3-1)m c\u00b2. \n\nLet me denote each A particle's total energy as E_A. Since there are four of them, the total energy of all four is 4 E_A. \n\nSo 4 E_A = 1876 MeV \u2192 E_A = 1876 /4 = 469 MeV. \n\nEach A's total energy is 469 MeV. Since m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV, the gamma factor is E/(m c\u00b2) = 469 /300 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 1.5633. \n\nLet me compute v. \n\nLet me rearrange the gamma equation:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 = 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2) \n\nSo v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2))\n\nPlugging in gamma \u2248 1.5633:\n\n1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.443) \u2248 0.409. \n\nSo 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. \n\nThen sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769. So v \u2248 0.769 c. Hmm, that would be around 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. \n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nE_A = 469 MeV. m_A c\u00b2 is 300. \n\ngamma = 469 / 300 = 1.563333... \n\nSo gamma squared is (1.5633)^2. Let me compute 1.5633 squared:\n\n1.5633 * 1.5633: \n\n1.5^2 = 2.25 \n\n0.0633^2 \u2248 0.004 \n\nCross terms: 2*1.5 *0.0633 \u2248 0.19 \n\nWait maybe better to compute as:\n\n(1.5633)^2 = (1.5 + 0.0633)^2 = 1.5\u00b2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + 0.0633\u00b2 = 2.25 + 0.19 + ~0.004 \u2248 2.25 + 0.19 is 2.44, plus 0.004 gives ~2.444. So gamma squared is 2.444. \n\nSo 1/gamma squared is 1/2.444 \u2248 0.409. \n\nThen 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. Square root of 0.591. \n\nLet me see sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746, so sqrt(0.591) would be a bit less. Let me calculate 0.769 squared is 0.591 (since 0.77^2 is 0.5929). So 0.769 squared is 0.5913, so yes. \n\nTherefore, v \u2248 0.769c, which rounds to 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nWait but wait a second. Let me check if I considered momentum conservation. \n\nBecause in the initial state, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate the initial momentum as zero. \n\nThe products must have total momentum zero. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, their momenta must cancel. For example, if all four are moving symmetrically in opposite directions. Let's say the two A+ are moving in the +x direction and two A- in the -x direction. Then each pair would have momenta that cancel. \n\nAssuming all particles have the same speed, then their momenta are just gamma m v in their respective directions. Since momentum must cancel, the total momentum from the A+ and A- must be opposite. \n\nWait, but for each A+, the momentum is gamma m v, and for A-, it's also gamma m v in the opposite direction. Since there are two of each, the total momentum would be (2 gamma m v) in +x and (2 gamma m v) in -x, so total momentum is zero. That works. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that all particles have the same speed is valid. So my calculation above holds. \n\nSo the velocity is approximately 0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm but wait, the options include 0.91c and others. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check the initial energy again. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest? The problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is stationary. Then the initial energy is the rest mass of proton plus the antiproton's total energy (which is its rest mass plus kinetic energy). But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v\u00b2, but relativistic? Wait, no, for low speeds, the total energy is gamma m c\u00b2 \u2248 m c\u00b2 (1 + 0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m c\u00b2 \u2248 (0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2) m c\u00b2 = 0.5 m v\u00b2. \n\nBut since it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. Therefore, the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2, since both proton and antiproton are at rest? Wait, no. Wait, if the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total energy would be m_p c\u00b2 (proton's rest) plus the antiproton's total energy (which is approximately m_p c\u00b2 + 0.5 m_p v\u00b2). But if the antiproton's speed is very small, then the kinetic energy is negligible. So total initial energy is roughly 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the rest mass energy of products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. \n\nSo the total energy from the initial is 2*938 = 1876. \n\nThus the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nEach of the four particles gets 676/4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. \n\nSo each particle's total energy is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. \n\nSo gamma is 469 / 300 \u2248 1.563. \n\nThen velocity calculation as before gives ~0.77c. \n\nHmm, but the options have 0.91c as option C. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the kinetic energy is equally divided? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is not zero. Wait, let's think again about momentum. \n\nSuppose the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity v. Then the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma_p m_p v. Since v is small, gamma \u2248 1, so momentum \u2248 m_p v. \n\nThe final momentum must equal this. But the products have four particles. Let's say they are emitted symmetrically so that their total momentum cancels except in the direction of the antiproton's initial motion. But that complicates things. \n\nWait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe we can consider it as being at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, then the momentum is negligible, so initial momentum is zero. The problem might be expecting that approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using non-relativistic calculations for the initial energy, but the particles A are relativistic. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy of each A particle as (E_initial)/(4). \n\nYes, that's what I did. \n\nHmm. Let me check the gamma calculation again. \n\nIf gamma is 1.563, then 1/gamma^2 is 1/(1.563)^2. Let me calculate it more precisely. \n\n1.563 squared: \n\n1.563 * 1.563. Let's compute 1.5*1.5 =2.25, 1.5*0.063=0.0945, 0.063*1.5=0.0945, and 0.063^2\u22480.003969. Adding all terms:\n\n2.25 + 0.0945 +0.0945 +0.003969 = 2.25 + 0.189 + 0.003969 \u2248 2.442969. \n\nSo 1 over that is 0.4093. \n\nThen 1-0.4093 =0.5907. The square root of that is sqrt(0.5907). \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5907):\n\nSince 0.77^2 =0.5929, which is a bit higher. So 0.77 squared is 0.5929. \n\nThe value we need sqrt(0.5907) is a bit less than 0.77. \n\nLet me compute 0.769 squared: 0.769 *0.769. \n\n0.7*0.7 =0.49, 0.7*0.069*2 =0.0966, and 0.069^2\u22480.004761. \n\nWait, actually, (a + b)^2 where a=0.7 and b=0.069. \n\nWait, better to compute 769^2: \n\n700\u00b2 =490000, 2*700*69=2*700*69 = 96600, 69\u00b2=4761. Total 490000 +96600=586600 +4761 =591,361. \n\nSo (0.769)^2 = (769/1000)^2 = 0.591361. Which is about 0.5914, which is very close to our 0.5907. So the square root of 0.5907 is about 0.7685. So approx 0.769c. \n\nSo 0.77c is correct, so answer A. \n\nHmm, but why is option C 0.91c there? Maybe I messed up some step. Let me check the energy again. \n\nWait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is not negligible? \n\nWait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. But in that case, the total energy would be (proton rest) + (antiproton total energy). \n\nBut the antiproton's total energy is gamma_p m_p c\u00b2, but since it's moving slowly, gamma is approx 1 + 0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 0.5 m_p v\u00b2. \n\nIf the antiproton's velocity is very small, then this term is negligible. So the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p)c\u00b2 = 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with some kinetic energy? But the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the proton. Let me check the proton rest mass. \n\nThe proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question expects a different approach? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the invariant quantity s, the square of the center-of-mass energy. \n\nThe initial state is a proton and antiproton. If they are moving slowly, their relative velocity is small, so the center-of-mass energy is approximately sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 c^2 ). But if they are moving slowly, then the center-of-mass energy is roughly the sum of their rest masses. \n\nWait, the total energy in the center of mass frame would be the sum of their energies, but since they're moving slowly, maybe it's their rest masses. \n\nAlternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), and the invariant is s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of this as a reaction where the initial particles are at rest? Because if the antiproton is slowly moving, and the proton is at rest, then the initial system's momentum is approximately that of the antiproton, but if it's very small, then the center of mass frame is approximately the rest frame of the proton? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's see if the energy is 1876 MeV, and the rest mass of products is 1200 MeV. The total energy must go into the kinetic energy of the particles. \n\nThe total energy of each A particle is 469 MeV as before. So gamma = 469 / 300 = 1.5633. \n\nThen the velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) \n\nWait, let me use the formula: \n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (m/(E))^2 c^2 /c^2) \u2192 m is m_A, E is E_A. \n\nWait, another way: \n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nThe relation between v and gamma is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo using gamma =1.5633, \n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) \u2248 c * sqrt(1 - 0.4093) = sqrt(0.5907) c \u2248 0.768c. \n\nSo that's ~0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm. The options given are A)0.77, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. So the correct answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the total energy is divided equally? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose there are four particles. Each has energy E_A. The total energy is 4E_A = 1876 \u2192 E_A = 469, so each has 469 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two positive and two negative particles have different energies? But the problem doesn't specify any difference, so it's reasonable to assume symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with some kinetic energy? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". It doesn't specify the proton's state. Maybe both are at rest? If the proton and antiproton are both at rest, then their initial momentum is zero, and the total energy is exactly 2*(938) = 1876. \n\nThat would be the case if they are at rest. Then, the products must have zero total momentum, so symmetric. \n\nSo the calculation holds. \n\nHmm, maybe the question expects relativistic kinetic energy, but my approach was correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use relativistic momentum conservation. Let me try that approach. \n\nAssuming all four particles have the same speed v, and two go in opposite directions. Let's assume all particles have momentum p in their respective directions. \n\nThe total momentum of the system must be zero. Since there are two particles moving in each direction, their momenta cancel. \n\nThe total energy is 4*(gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 4*( (E_A) ). \n\nThe total energy is also the initial energy, 2*m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo, 4*gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but that would be if all the energy went into rest mass. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, no. The total energy is the sum of the rest mass and kinetic energy of all particles. \n\nAlternatively, the total energy must equal the initial energy (which is 2m_p c\u00b2). \n\nSo 4*(gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but that would imply that the kinetic energy is zero. But in reality, the particles have kinetic energy. So this approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to set up equations with momentum and energy. \n\nLet me denote the speed as v, and since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are vectors. Let's suppose two particles move in +x and two in -x. \n\nTotal momentum is zero. \n\nTotal energy is 4 * gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but then the energy would be 2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = (m_p)/(2 m_A). \n\nPlugging numbers: m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo gamma = 938/(2*300) \u2248 938/600 \u2248 1.5633, same as before. \n\nAh! Wait a second, this approach gives the same gamma. \n\nSo that's the same result. So the total energy of the products is exactly equal to the initial energy (assuming initial momentum is zero). \n\nWait, but then the kinetic energy is included in that. \n\nSo gamma is (m_p / (2 m_A)), so the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is as before. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)0.77c. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C)0.91c? Maybe I messed up the mass of the proton? Let me check again. \n\nThe proton's mass is approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Yes. \n\nSo 938/(2*300) is indeed ~1.5633. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the total energy as 2*(m_p c\u00b2) plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. \n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is negligible. So that would be 2*(m_p c\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects to use the rest mass of the proton and antiproton as 938 each, so their total rest mass is 1876, and the products have rest mass 1200. The difference is 676 MeV as kinetic. \n\nBut in that case, each particle's kinetic energy is (676)/4 = 169 MeV. \n\nTotal energy of each particle is rest + kinetic: 300 + 169 = 469. \n\nThus, gamma is 469/300, which is the same as before. \n\nSo I think the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the antiproton and proton are moving towards each other with some speed, so their kinetic energy adds. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But even then, that would be negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute using the invariant s. \n\nThe center of mass energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. \n\nIf the antiproton is moving slowly, then p2 is small, so the invariant s \u2248 (E1 + E2)^2. \n\nE1 is the proton's rest energy, E2 is the antiproton's total energy. If the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then E2 \u2248 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nThus s \u2248 (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe products must have the same s. \n\nThe products are four particles. The invariant for them would be (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. \n\nAssuming they are moving symmetrically, the total momentum is zero, so sum p c is zero. \n\nThus, the invariant is (4 E_A)^2. \n\nSetting equal to (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 4 E_A = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 E_A = (m_p c\u00b2)/2. \n\nWait, but that would be E_A = (938)/2 = 469 MeV, which is the same as before. \n\nSo that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is as calculated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is indeed A)0.77c. \n\nWait, but let me check the possible miscalculations. \n\nWait, let me compute gamma again. \n\ngamma = 469 / 300 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nThen, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\n1/gamma is approx 0.639. \n\n(1/gamma)^2 \u2248 0.408. \n\n1 -0.408 =0.592. \n\nSquare root is sqrt(0.592) \u2248 0.769. \n\nSo 0.769c, which rounds to 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n",

The antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe I can treat its kinetic energy as negligible? And the mass of A is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle annihilation, the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton should be converted into the kinetic and rest mass energies of the products. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, so maybe I can approximate the total initial energy as just twice the rest mass energy of the proton? Wait, the proton and antiproton each have rest mass energy. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV, so the total rest energy would be 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But if the antiproton is at rest, then the total energy is just the sum of their rest energies. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible. So the initial energy is approximately the sum of their rest masses. \n\nThe products are two A+ and two A- particles. Each has a rest mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4*(300 MeV) = 1200 MeV. \n\nBut the total energy from the initial must equal the total energy of the products. Since the initial energy is 1876 MeV, the products must have kinetic energy plus their rest energy adding up to that. So the kinetic energy of the A particles would be 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nWait, but how do I find the velocity of each A particle? Since there are four particles, each A has some kinetic energy. But maybe the system is symmetric, so each pair (like the two A+ and two A-) would have the same speed? Or maybe all four have the same speed and direction? Hmm, annihilation processes often result in particles moving in opposite directions, but maybe here they are emitted symmetrically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is approximately zero (if the antiproton is at rest, then the proton and antiproton must be moving towards each other? Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly? The problem isn't entirely clear. Wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But if it's moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So the total initial momentum would be approximately the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is negligible. \n\nWait, in any case, if the initial momentum is negligible, then the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the four particles must have momenta that cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, maybe they are moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ go in one direction and two A- in the opposite, each with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nSo each A particle would have the same speed, but opposite directions. Therefore, the magnitude of their velocities would be the same. \n\nTo calculate their velocity, perhaps I can use energy and momentum conservation. Let me try setting up equations. \n\nLet me denote the mass of each A as m_A = 300 MeV / c\u00b2. \n\nTotal initial energy is approximately 2*(938 MeV) since the antiproton's KE is negligible. So E_initial \u2248 2*938 = 1876 MeV.\n\nTotal rest mass of products is 4*m_A*c\u00b2 = 1200 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the products is then 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nBut each of the four particles has kinetic energy. So each has (676)/4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. \n\nWait, but kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (\u03b3-1)m c\u00b2. So perhaps I need to compute the total energy of each particle. \n\nEach particle's total energy is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. The kinetic energy is (\u03b3-1)m c\u00b2. \n\nLet me denote each A particle's total energy as E_A. Since there are four of them, the total energy of all four is 4 E_A. \n\nSo 4 E_A = 1876 MeV \u2192 E_A = 1876 /4 = 469 MeV. \n\nEach A's total energy is 469 MeV. Since m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV, the gamma factor is E/(m c\u00b2) = 469 /300 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 1.5633. \n\nLet me compute v. \n\nLet me rearrange the gamma equation:\n\n1/gamma\u00b2 = 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2) \n\nSo v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma\u00b2))\n\nPlugging in gamma \u2248 1.5633:\n\n1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.443) \u2248 0.409. \n\nSo 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. \n\nThen sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769. So v \u2248 0.769 c. Hmm, that would be around 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. \n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nE_A = 469 MeV. m_A c\u00b2 is 300. \n\ngamma = 469 / 300 = 1.563333... \n\nSo gamma squared is (1.5633)^2. Let me compute 1.5633 squared:\n\n1.5633 * 1.5633: \n\n1.5^2 = 2.25 \n\n0.0633^2 \u2248 0.004 \n\nCross terms: 2*1.5 *0.0633 \u2248 0.19 \n\nWait maybe better to compute as:\n\n(1.5633)^2 = (1.5 + 0.0633)^2 = 1.5\u00b2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + 0.0633\u00b2 = 2.25 + 0.19 + ~0.004 \u2248 2.25 + 0.19 is 2.44, plus 0.004 gives ~2.444. So gamma squared is 2.444. \n\nSo 1/gamma squared is 1/2.444 \u2248 0.409. \n\nThen 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. Square root of 0.591. \n\nLet me see sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746, so sqrt(0.591) would be a bit less. Let me calculate 0.769 squared is 0.591 (since 0.77^2 is 0.5929). So 0.769 squared is 0.5913, so yes. \n\nTherefore, v \u2248 0.769c, which rounds to 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nWait but wait a second. Let me check if I considered momentum conservation. \n\nBecause in the initial state, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate the initial momentum as zero. \n\nThe products must have total momentum zero. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, their momenta must cancel. For example, if all four are moving symmetrically in opposite directions. Let's say the two A+ are moving in the +x direction and two A- in the -x direction. Then each pair would have momenta that cancel. \n\nAssuming all particles have the same speed, then their momenta are just gamma m v in their respective directions. Since momentum must cancel, the total momentum from the A+ and A- must be opposite. \n\nWait, but for each A+, the momentum is gamma m v, and for A-, it's also gamma m v in the opposite direction. Since there are two of each, the total momentum would be (2 gamma m v) in +x and (2 gamma m v) in -x, so total momentum is zero. That works. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that all particles have the same speed is valid. So my calculation above holds. \n\nSo the velocity is approximately 0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm but wait, the options include 0.91c and others. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check the initial energy again. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest? The problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is stationary. Then the initial energy is the rest mass of proton plus the antiproton's total energy (which is its rest mass plus kinetic energy). But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v\u00b2, but relativistic? Wait, no, for low speeds, the total energy is gamma m c\u00b2 \u2248 m c\u00b2 (1 + 0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m c\u00b2 \u2248 (0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2) m c\u00b2 = 0.5 m v\u00b2. \n\nBut since it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. Therefore, the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p) c\u00b2, since both proton and antiproton are at rest? Wait, no. Wait, if the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total energy would be m_p c\u00b2 (proton's rest) plus the antiproton's total energy (which is approximately m_p c\u00b2 + 0.5 m_p v\u00b2). But if the antiproton's speed is very small, then the kinetic energy is negligible. So total initial energy is roughly 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the rest mass energy of products is 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. \n\nSo the total energy from the initial is 2*938 = 1876. \n\nThus the excess energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nEach of the four particles gets 676/4 = 169 MeV of kinetic energy. \n\nSo each particle's total energy is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. \n\nSo gamma is 469 / 300 \u2248 1.563. \n\nThen velocity calculation as before gives ~0.77c. \n\nHmm, but the options have 0.91c as option C. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the kinetic energy is equally divided? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is not zero. Wait, let's think again about momentum. \n\nSuppose the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity v. Then the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma_p m_p v. Since v is small, gamma \u2248 1, so momentum \u2248 m_p v. \n\nThe final momentum must equal this. But the products have four particles. Let's say they are emitted symmetrically so that their total momentum cancels except in the direction of the antiproton's initial motion. But that complicates things. \n\nWait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe we can consider it as being at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, then the momentum is negligible, so initial momentum is zero. The problem might be expecting that approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using non-relativistic calculations for the initial energy, but the particles A are relativistic. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy of each A particle as (E_initial)/(4). \n\nYes, that's what I did. \n\nHmm. Let me check the gamma calculation again. \n\nIf gamma is 1.563, then 1/gamma^2 is 1/(1.563)^2. Let me calculate it more precisely. \n\n1.563 squared: \n\n1.563 * 1.563. Let's compute 1.5*1.5 =2.25, 1.5*0.063=0.0945, 0.063*1.5=0.0945, and 0.063^2\u22480.003969. Adding all terms:\n\n2.25 + 0.0945 +0.0945 +0.003969 = 2.25 + 0.189 + 0.003969 \u2248 2.442969. \n\nSo 1 over that is 0.4093. \n\nThen 1-0.4093 =0.5907. The square root of that is sqrt(0.5907). \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5907):\n\nSince 0.77^2 =0.5929, which is a bit higher. So 0.77 squared is 0.5929. \n\nThe value we need sqrt(0.5907) is a bit less than 0.77. \n\nLet me compute 0.769 squared: 0.769 *0.769. \n\n0.7*0.7 =0.49, 0.7*0.069*2 =0.0966, and 0.069^2\u22480.004761. \n\nWait, actually, (a + b)^2 where a=0.7 and b=0.069. \n\nWait, better to compute 769^2: \n\n700\u00b2 =490000, 2*700*69=2*700*69 = 96600, 69\u00b2=4761. Total 490000 +96600=586600 +4761 =591,361. \n\nSo (0.769)^2 = (769/1000)^2 = 0.591361. Which is about 0.5914, which is very close to our 0.5907. So the square root of 0.5907 is about 0.7685. So approx 0.769c. \n\nSo 0.77c is correct, so answer A. \n\nHmm, but why is option C 0.91c there? Maybe I messed up some step. Let me check the energy again. \n\nWait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is not negligible? \n\nWait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. But in that case, the total energy would be (proton rest) + (antiproton total energy). \n\nBut the antiproton's total energy is gamma_p m_p c\u00b2, but since it's moving slowly, gamma is approx 1 + 0.5 v\u00b2/c\u00b2. So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 0.5 m_p v\u00b2. \n\nIf the antiproton's velocity is very small, then this term is negligible. So the total initial energy is approximately (m_p + m_p)c\u00b2 = 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with some kinetic energy? But the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the proton. Let me check the proton rest mass. \n\nThe proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question expects a different approach? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the invariant quantity s, the square of the center-of-mass energy. \n\nThe initial state is a proton and antiproton. If they are moving slowly, their relative velocity is small, so the center-of-mass energy is approximately sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 c^2 ). But if they are moving slowly, then the center-of-mass energy is roughly the sum of their rest masses. \n\nWait, the total energy in the center of mass frame would be the sum of their energies, but since they're moving slowly, maybe it's their rest masses. \n\nAlternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), and the invariant is s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of this as a reaction where the initial particles are at rest? Because if the antiproton is slowly moving, and the proton is at rest, then the initial system's momentum is approximately that of the antiproton, but if it's very small, then the center of mass frame is approximately the rest frame of the proton? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's see if the energy is 1876 MeV, and the rest mass of products is 1200 MeV. The total energy must go into the kinetic energy of the particles. \n\nThe total energy of each A particle is 469 MeV as before. So gamma = 469 / 300 = 1.5633. \n\nThen the velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) \n\nWait, let me use the formula: \n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (m/(E))^2 c^2 /c^2) \u2192 m is m_A, E is E_A. \n\nWait, another way: \n\ngamma = E/(m c\u00b2). \n\nThe relation between v and gamma is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo using gamma =1.5633, \n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) \u2248 c * sqrt(1 - 0.4093) = sqrt(0.5907) c \u2248 0.768c. \n\nSo that's ~0.77c, so answer A. \n\nHmm. The options given are A)0.77, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. So the correct answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the total energy is divided equally? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose there are four particles. Each has energy E_A. The total energy is 4E_A = 1876 \u2192 E_A = 469, so each has 469 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two positive and two negative particles have different energies? But the problem doesn't specify any difference, so it's reasonable to assume symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with some kinetic energy? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". It doesn't specify the proton's state. Maybe both are at rest? If the proton and antiproton are both at rest, then their initial momentum is zero, and the total energy is exactly 2*(938) = 1876. \n\nThat would be the case if they are at rest. Then, the products must have zero total momentum, so symmetric. \n\nSo the calculation holds. \n\nHmm, maybe the question expects relativistic kinetic energy, but my approach was correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use relativistic momentum conservation. Let me try that approach. \n\nAssuming all four particles have the same speed v, and two go in opposite directions. Let's assume all particles have momentum p in their respective directions. \n\nThe total momentum of the system must be zero. Since there are two particles moving in each direction, their momenta cancel. \n\nThe total energy is 4*(gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 4*( (E_A) ). \n\nThe total energy is also the initial energy, 2*m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo, 4*gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but that would be if all the energy went into rest mass. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, no. The total energy is the sum of the rest mass and kinetic energy of all particles. \n\nAlternatively, the total energy must equal the initial energy (which is 2m_p c\u00b2). \n\nSo 4*(gamma m_A c\u00b2) = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but that would imply that the kinetic energy is zero. But in reality, the particles have kinetic energy. So this approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to set up equations with momentum and energy. \n\nLet me denote the speed as v, and since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are vectors. Let's suppose two particles move in +x and two in -x. \n\nTotal momentum is zero. \n\nTotal energy is 4 * gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but then the energy would be 2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = (m_p)/(2 m_A). \n\nPlugging numbers: m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo gamma = 938/(2*300) \u2248 938/600 \u2248 1.5633, same as before. \n\nAh! Wait a second, this approach gives the same gamma. \n\nSo that's the same result. So the total energy of the products is exactly equal to the initial energy (assuming initial momentum is zero). \n\nWait, but then the kinetic energy is included in that. \n\nSo gamma is (m_p / (2 m_A)), so the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is as before. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is A)0.77c. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C)0.91c? Maybe I messed up the mass of the proton? Let me check again. \n\nThe proton's mass is approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2. Yes. \n\nSo 938/(2*300) is indeed ~1.5633. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the total energy as 2*(m_p c\u00b2) plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. \n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is negligible. So that would be 2*(m_p c\u00b2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects to use the rest mass of the proton and antiproton as 938 each, so their total rest mass is 1876, and the products have rest mass 1200. The difference is 676 MeV as kinetic. \n\nBut in that case, each particle's kinetic energy is (676)/4 = 169 MeV. \n\nTotal energy of each particle is rest + kinetic: 300 + 169 = 469. \n\nThus, gamma is 469/300, which is the same as before. \n\nSo I think the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the antiproton and proton are moving towards each other with some speed, so their kinetic energy adds. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small kinetic energy. But even then, that would be negligible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute using the invariant s. \n\nThe center of mass energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. \n\nIf the antiproton is moving slowly, then p2 is small, so the invariant s \u2248 (E1 + E2)^2. \n\nE1 is the proton's rest energy, E2 is the antiproton's total energy. If the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then E2 \u2248 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nThus s \u2248 (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe products must have the same s. \n\nThe products are four particles. The invariant for them would be (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. \n\nAssuming they are moving symmetrically, the total momentum is zero, so sum p c is zero. \n\nThus, the invariant is (4 E_A)^2. \n\nSetting equal to (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 \u2192 4 E_A = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 E_A = (m_p c\u00b2)/2. \n\nWait, but that would be E_A = (938)/2 = 469 MeV, which is the same as before. \n\nSo that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is as calculated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is indeed A)0.77c. \n\nWait, but let me check the possible miscalculations. \n\nWait, let me compute gamma again. \n\ngamma = 469 / 300 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nThen, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\n1/gamma is approx 0.639. \n\n(1/gamma)^2 \u2248 0.408. \n\n1 -0.408 =0.592. \n\nSquare root is sqrt(0.592) \u2248 0.769. \n\nSo 0.769c, which rounds to 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the velocity of particle A, we start by noting that the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible due to its slow motion. The total initial energy comes from the rest masses of the proton and antiproton: \n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nThe total rest mass energy of the products (2A\u207a and 2A\u207b) is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times m_A c^2 = 4 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nThe remaining energy (1876 \u2013 1200 = 676 MeV) is distributed as kinetic energy among the four particles. Each particle's total energy is:\n\n\\[\nE_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\nThe Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) for each particle is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.5633.\n\\]\n\nUsing the relation between \\(\\gamma\\) and velocity \\(v\\):\n\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\gamma \\approx 1.5633\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \\approx 0.409,\n\\]\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} \\approx c \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.77c.\n\\]\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is closest to **0.77c**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, the question is about annihilation of a proton and antiproton producing two positive and two negative particles A. The mass energy of A is 300 MeV, and we need to find the velocity of particle A. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can assume it's at rest? Wait, the problem says \"slowly moving,\" but in annihilation reactions, if one is moving slowly, perhaps we can consider the center-of-mass frame?\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle annihilation processes like matter-antimatter reactions, the total energy before and after must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So, the total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. \n\nThe proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So total rest mass energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, the problem gives mA*c\u00b2 as 300 MeV. So each A particle has that rest mass. \n\nThe reaction produces 2 A+ and 2 A-. So total particles produced are four, each with mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The total rest mass energy of the products would be 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. \n\nBut the initial energy (from proton and antiproton) is 1876 MeV. Since energy is conserved, the excess energy must go into the kinetic energy of the particles A. \n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is approximately zero. So the total momentum after the reaction must also be zero. That means the particles must be emitted symmetrically. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions in pairs. \n\nAssuming all four particles have the same speed (since they are produced symmetrically), their momenta must cancel out. Let me think. Let's suppose each pair (like A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions. But since there are two of each, maybe each pair has opposite momenta. Wait, but all four particles would need their momenta to sum to zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all four move in such a way that their total momentum cancels. Since the proton and antiproton are at rest (since antiproton is slow and proton is presumably at rest?), their initial momentum is zero. So the final momentum must also be zero. Thus, the four particles must have momenta that sum to zero. \n\nIf all four particles have the same speed and mass, their momenta would have to be arranged such that the vectors cancel. The simplest case would be that they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two particles going in one direction and two in the opposite. But since they are all moving at the same speed, the total momentum would be zero only if the number in each direction is equal. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions, but with equal and opposite momenta. Wait, but each has the same mass, so their velocities must be the same in magnitude. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the four particles moves in a different direction such that their vectors cancel. But maybe it's simpler to assume that all four have the same speed and their directions are arranged to cancel momentum. \n\nLet me think about energy first. The total energy after annihilation must equal the total energy before. Since the initial particles are at rest (or nearly so), the initial energy is just their rest mass energy. \n\nTotal initial energy E_initial = (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2 = 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSo total final energy is 4*gamma*(300 MeV). \n\nSetting equal: 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \n\nSolving for gamma: gamma = 1876 / (4*300) \n\nLet me compute that. 4*300 = 1200. 1876/1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.5633. \n\nNow, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, \n\n1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1.5633 \n\nTake reciprocal: sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64 \n\nSquaring both sides: 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 (0.64)^2 = 0.4096 \n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \n\nTaking square root: v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 0.77c. Which is option A. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the calculations again. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200 exactly. 1876 divided by 1200. Let me see: 1200*1.5 is 1800. 1876-1800 is 76. So 1.5 + 76/1200. 76/1200 = 0.063333..., so total is 1.563333... So that part is correct. \n\nThen reciprocal of 1.563333 is 1/1.563333. Let me compute that: 1 divided by approximately 1.5633. Let me think, 1/1.5 is 0.666..., but 1.56 is a bit higher, so reciprocal is lower. Let me compute 1.563333 squared: 1.5633^2 = approx (1.5)^2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + (0.0633)^2 = 2.25 + 0.19 + 0.004 = ~2.443. Wait, no, that's not needed. Wait, I need to compute 1/1.563333. Let me approximate. \n\nLet me write 1.563333 \u2248 1.5633. Let me use calculator steps. Let me think of it as 1 / 1.5633. Let's see, 1.5633 * 0.64 = 1.5633 * 0.6 + 1.5633*0.04 = 0.93798 + 0.062532 = ~0.9995, so that's very close to 1. So 0.64 gives us approximately 1. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.64, so v/c \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.64^2) ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, the steps were correct earlier. Let me retrace. \n\nThe calculation: \n\ngamma = E_rest_initial / (4 * m_A c\u00b2) \n\nWait, no, actually, the total energy of the products is 4*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2). The initial energy is 2*(m_p c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but m_p is the proton mass, which is 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So initial energy is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final energy is 4*(gamma * 300 MeV). \n\nThus, 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(4*300) = 1876/1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64 \n\nSo (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768, so 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have 0.77c as option A. However, let me check if I made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait a second, I assumed that all four particles have the same speed and that their total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. But is that valid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles are moving at different speeds, but since the problem says \"velocity of particle A\", perhaps they all have the same speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that all four have the same gamma. But since the problem states \"velocity of particle A\", it's implied that all A particles have the same velocity, so the calculation should hold. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. The momentum must also be zero. Since all four particles have the same mass and speed, their momenta must cancel out. Let's see. \n\nSuppose each of the four particles has momentum p. To have total momentum zero, the vectors must cancel. For instance, two moving in the +x direction and two in the -x, each with momentum p. Then total momentum would be (2p - 2p) = 0. But in that case, each pair's momentum cancels. \n\nIn that case, each particle's momentum is p = gamma m_A v. Since they are moving in opposite directions. \n\nBut in this scenario, the total energy would indeed be 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems okay. \n\nSo the velocity would be approximately 0.768c, which is 0.77c, so the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) 0.77c, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma? Let me re-calculate the numbers. \n\n1876 divided by 1200: \n\nLet me compute 1200 * 1.5 = 1800. \n\n1876 - 1800 = 76. \n\nSo 76/1200 = 0.063333... \n\nSo total is 1.563333... \n\nYes. \n\nThen 1/gamma is 0.64, so sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is 0.64, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \n\nsqrt(0.5904) is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904). \n\nWell sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746. Since 0.5904 is less than 0.6, the sqrt would be a bit less. Let me compute 0.77 squared: 0.77^2 = 0.5929, which is very close to 0.5904. \n\nHmm, so 0.77 squared is 0.5929, which is just a bit higher than 0.5904. So sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.768. \n\nSo 0.768c is approximately 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.86 and 0.91. Did I maybe miscalculate the initial energy? Let's check. \n\nWait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. But the proton's velocity? Is the proton also at rest? The problem says \"Consider this annihilation process p + \\bar{p} \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b\". The antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate their initial kinetic energy as negligible. \n\nWait, but the proton's rest mass is same as the antiproton's. So even if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So the total initial energy is still approximately (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2 = 2*(938) MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, the kinetic energy is negligible. So the initial energy is still ~ 2*938. \n\nTherefore, the calculation holds. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option B at 0.96? That would be a much higher velocity. Maybe I missed a factor?\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the invariant quantity. The initial invariant mass squared is (E_initial/c\u00b2)^2 - (p_initial)^2c\u00b2. Since the initial momentum is negligible, this is (2m_pc\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe final invariant mass squared must also be the same. The final energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. The final momentum: since all four particles have momentum vectors that cancel, the total momentum is zero. \n\nThus, the invariant mass squared is (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 - 0 = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSetting equal to initial invariant mass squared:\n\n(2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 \n\nTaking square roots:\n\n2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \n\nThus, 2 m_p = 4 gamma m_A \n\nSo gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A) \n\nWait, this is a different approach. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me see. \n\nWait, the invariant mass squared for the initial system is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2. Since p_initial is zero (approx), that's (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe final system's invariant mass squared is (E_final)^2 - (p_final c)^2. Since p_final is zero (because all momenta cancel), that's (E_final)^2. \n\nSo equate them:\n\n(2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 = (E_final)^2 \n\nThus, E_final = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nBut the final energy is also 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, this is a different result than before. \n\nHmm, so according to this method, gamma is m_p/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. Which one is correct? \n\nWait, this seems conflicting with the energy conservation approach earlier. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered that the total initial energy (rest energy) is equal to the total final energy (sum of the particles' energies). That is correct. But according to the invariant approach, the same result is obtained. Let me check with numbers. \n\nLet me compute gamma via the invariant approach. \n\nGiven m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\ngamma = (938)/(2*300) = 938/600 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nAh! Wait, that's the same gamma as before! \n\nSo that's the same value. So gamma is 1.5633. \n\nSo the two approaches agree. \n\nTherefore, the velocity calculation is the same. \n\nSo that gives v \u2248 0.768c \u2192 0.77c (option A). \n\nHmm, so why does the problem have other options? Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their momentum must be considered in the invariant mass calculation? Wait no, the invariant approach already accounts for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me re-calculate. \n\ngamma = 1.5633 \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \u2192 \n\n1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/(gamma)^2 \n\n1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.443) \u2248 0.409 \n\nThus, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.409 \u2248 0.591 \n\nTaking square root gives sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769 \n\nSo v \u2248 0.769c \u2192 0.77c. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. So why is there an option B (0.96c)? Maybe I made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is also moving? Or perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. Wait, but even if the antiproton has a small velocity, its kinetic energy would be negligible compared to its rest mass. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proton and antiproton annihilate into four particles, but in reality, in annihilation, sometimes photons are produced, but here the particles are massive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for kinetic energy? Wait, no, because the total energy includes rest and kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the kinetic energy per particle and then find the velocity. \n\nWait, let's try that approach. \n\nThe total kinetic energy available is the initial energy minus the rest mass energy of the products. \n\nInitial energy: 2*(938) = 1876 MeV \n\nRest energy of products: 4*(300) = 1200 MeV \n\nSo the kinetic energy available is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nThis is distributed equally among the four particles. So each particle has kinetic energy of 676 /4 = 169 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is (gamma -1) m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, (gamma -1)*300 = 169 \u2192 gamma -1 = 169/300 \u2248 0.5633 \u2192 gamma \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSame gamma as before. So same result. \n\nThus, the velocity is still 0.77c. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in a different frame? Like, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. If the proton is at rest in the lab frame, then the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's slowly moving, maybe we can take the initial momentum as negligible, so the center of mass frame is approximately the lab frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider relativistic momentum conservation. Let's try that. \n\nWait, let's suppose that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity v_pbar. But since it's moving slowly, v_pbar << c, so its momentum is approximately m_pbar v_pbar. \n\nThe initial momentum is then approximately m_pbar v_pbar. The final momentum must equal this. Since the four particles have momenta adding up to m_pbar v_pbar. \n\nBut since v_pbar is small, maybe the momentum is negligible, so we can approximate as before. \n\nAlternatively, if the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is not at rest, perhaps they are moving towards each other? \n\nWait, the problem says \"Consider this annihilation process p + \\bar{p} \u2192 ...\". The antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. \n\nIn that case, the total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the proton at rest. The antiproton has a small velocity v. \n\nInitial momentum is (mass of antiproton)*v \u2248 (938 MeV/c\u00b2)(v/c)*c (since p = gamma m v, but since v is small, gamma \u22481). \n\nSo initial momentum p_initial \u2248 (938 MeV/c\u00b2)(v/c)*c = 938*(v/c) MeV*s/c. \n\nThe final momentum must equal this. \n\nThe final momentum is the sum of the four particles' momenta. \n\nAssuming that the four particles are emitted symmetrically to conserve momentum. \n\nSuppose the antiproton and proton annihilate, producing four particles. The total momentum must be equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton. \n\nBut the problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". Since it's moving slowly, the initial momentum is small, so the final particles must also have a small net momentum. \n\nHowever, the question is asking for the velocity of particle A. Perhaps the velocity is determined by the energy, and the momentum's effect is negligible? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore the initial momentum (since it's slow) and proceed as before. \n\nIn that case, the velocity is 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question's setup. Let me check the mass again. The problem states m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So each A has rest mass energy 300 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the proton mass. Wait, the proton rest mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, yes. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute beta (v/c) via gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\nGiven gamma \u22481.5633, 1/gamma \u22480.64, so 1/(1.5633)^2 \u22480.4096, so 1-0.4096 =0.5904, so beta = sqrt(0.5904)= ~0.768, which is 0.77. \n\nSo the calculation seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A) 0.77c. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is considering that the antiproton and proton have kinetic energy? Since they are moving, even if slowly. \n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is stationary, then the initial kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m_pbar c\u00b2 for the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, then gamma \u2248 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2), so kinetic energy is about (1/2) m v\u00b2. \n\nLet me see. Suppose the antiproton has speed v. Its kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 ( (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2) ) m_p c\u00b2 = 0.5 m_p v\u00b2. \n\nIf the antiproton is moving slowly, this kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. \n\nThe total initial energy would then be m_p c\u00b2 (proton rest) + m_p c\u00b2 (antiproton rest) + kinetic energy of antiproton. \n\nBut if the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then the initial energy is still ~2*938. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm. The options given include A as 0.77c, which matches the calculation. \n\nPerhaps the answer is indeed A. I think I've considered possible errors, and the calculations consistently lead to option A. So I'll go with that.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, the question is about annihilation of a proton and antiproton producing two positive and two negative particles A. The mass energy of A is 300 MeV, and we need to find the velocity of particle A. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can assume it's at rest? Wait, the problem says \"slowly moving,\" but in annihilation reactions, if one is moving slowly, perhaps we can consider the center-of-mass frame?\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle annihilation processes like matter-antimatter reactions, the total energy before and after must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So, the total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. \n\nThe proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So total rest mass energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, the problem gives mA*c\u00b2 as 300 MeV. So each A particle has that rest mass. \n\nThe reaction produces 2 A+ and 2 A-. So total particles produced are four, each with mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The total rest mass energy of the products would be 4*(300) = 1200 MeV. \n\nBut the initial energy (from proton and antiproton) is 1876 MeV. Since energy is conserved, the excess energy must go into the kinetic energy of the particles A. \n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is approximately zero. So the total momentum after the reaction must also be zero. That means the particles must be emitted symmetrically. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions in pairs. \n\nAssuming all four particles have the same speed (since they are produced symmetrically), their momenta must cancel out. Let me think. Let's suppose each pair (like A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions. But since there are two of each, maybe each pair has opposite momenta. Wait, but all four particles would need their momenta to sum to zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all four move in such a way that their total momentum cancels. Since the proton and antiproton are at rest (since antiproton is slow and proton is presumably at rest?), their initial momentum is zero. So the final momentum must also be zero. Thus, the four particles must have momenta that sum to zero. \n\nIf all four particles have the same speed and mass, their momenta would have to be arranged such that the vectors cancel. The simplest case would be that they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two particles going in one direction and two in the opposite. But since they are all moving at the same speed, the total momentum would be zero only if the number in each direction is equal. Since there are two positive and two negative, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions, but with equal and opposite momenta. Wait, but each has the same mass, so their velocities must be the same in magnitude. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the four particles moves in a different direction such that their vectors cancel. But maybe it's simpler to assume that all four have the same speed and their directions are arranged to cancel momentum. \n\nLet me think about energy first. The total energy after annihilation must equal the total energy before. Since the initial particles are at rest (or nearly so), the initial energy is just their rest mass energy. \n\nTotal initial energy E_initial = (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2 = 2*(938 MeV) = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. \n\nSo total final energy is 4*gamma*(300 MeV). \n\nSetting equal: 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \n\nSolving for gamma: gamma = 1876 / (4*300) \n\nLet me compute that. 4*300 = 1200. 1876/1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo gamma \u2248 1.5633. \n\nNow, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So, \n\n1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1.5633 \n\nTake reciprocal: sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64 \n\nSquaring both sides: 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u2248 (0.64)^2 = 0.4096 \n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \n\nTaking square root: v/c \u2248 sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768 \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 0.77c. Which is option A. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the calculations again. Let me compute 1876 divided by 1200 exactly. 1876 divided by 1200. Let me see: 1200*1.5 is 1800. 1876-1800 is 76. So 1.5 + 76/1200. 76/1200 = 0.063333..., so total is 1.563333... So that part is correct. \n\nThen reciprocal of 1.563333 is 1/1.563333. Let me compute that: 1 divided by approximately 1.5633. Let me think, 1/1.5 is 0.666..., but 1.56 is a bit higher, so reciprocal is lower. Let me compute 1.563333 squared: 1.5633^2 = approx (1.5)^2 + 2*1.5*0.0633 + (0.0633)^2 = 2.25 + 0.19 + 0.004 = ~2.443. Wait, no, that's not needed. Wait, I need to compute 1/1.563333. Let me approximate. \n\nLet me write 1.563333 \u2248 1.5633. Let me use calculator steps. Let me think of it as 1 / 1.5633. Let's see, 1.5633 * 0.64 = 1.5633 * 0.6 + 1.5633*0.04 = 0.93798 + 0.062532 = ~0.9995, so that's very close to 1. So 0.64 gives us approximately 1. So sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2248 0.64, so v/c \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.64^2) ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, the steps were correct earlier. Let me retrace. \n\nThe calculation: \n\ngamma = E_rest_initial / (4 * m_A c\u00b2) \n\nWait, no, actually, the total energy of the products is 4*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2). The initial energy is 2*(m_p c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but m_p is the proton mass, which is 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So initial energy is 2*(938) = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final energy is 4*(gamma * 300 MeV). \n\nThus, 4*gamma*300 = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876/(4*300) = 1876/1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSo then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \u2192 sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/gamma \u2248 0.64 \n\nSo (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768, so 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have 0.77c as option A. However, let me check if I made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait a second, I assumed that all four particles have the same speed and that their total energy is 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. But is that valid? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the particles are moving at different speeds, but since the problem says \"velocity of particle A\", perhaps they all have the same speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that all four have the same gamma. But since the problem states \"velocity of particle A\", it's implied that all A particles have the same velocity, so the calculation should hold. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. The momentum must also be zero. Since all four particles have the same mass and speed, their momenta must cancel out. Let's see. \n\nSuppose each of the four particles has momentum p. To have total momentum zero, the vectors must cancel. For instance, two moving in the +x direction and two in the -x, each with momentum p. Then total momentum would be (2p - 2p) = 0. But in that case, each pair's momentum cancels. \n\nIn that case, each particle's momentum is p = gamma m_A v. Since they are moving in opposite directions. \n\nBut in this scenario, the total energy would indeed be 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems okay. \n\nSo the velocity would be approximately 0.768c, which is 0.77c, so the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) 0.77c, B)0.96, C)0.91, D)0.86. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma? Let me re-calculate the numbers. \n\n1876 divided by 1200: \n\nLet me compute 1200 * 1.5 = 1800. \n\n1876 - 1800 = 76. \n\nSo 76/1200 = 0.063333... \n\nSo total is 1.563333... \n\nYes. \n\nThen 1/gamma is 0.64, so sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) is 0.64, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - (0.64)^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \n\nsqrt(0.5904) is sqrt(0.5904). Let me compute sqrt(0.5904). \n\nWell sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746. Since 0.5904 is less than 0.6, the sqrt would be a bit less. Let me compute 0.77 squared: 0.77^2 = 0.5929, which is very close to 0.5904. \n\nHmm, so 0.77 squared is 0.5929, which is just a bit higher than 0.5904. So sqrt(0.5904) is approximately 0.768. \n\nSo 0.768c is approximately 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 0.86 and 0.91. Did I maybe miscalculate the initial energy? Let's check. \n\nWait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. But the proton's velocity? Is the proton also at rest? The problem says \"Consider this annihilation process p + \\bar{p} \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b\". The antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate their initial kinetic energy as negligible. \n\nWait, but the proton's rest mass is same as the antiproton's. So even if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So the total initial energy is still approximately (m_p + m_pbar)c\u00b2 = 2*(938) MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, the kinetic energy is negligible. So the initial energy is still ~ 2*938. \n\nTherefore, the calculation holds. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option B at 0.96? That would be a much higher velocity. Maybe I missed a factor?\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think about the invariant quantity. The initial invariant mass squared is (E_initial/c\u00b2)^2 - (p_initial)^2c\u00b2. Since the initial momentum is negligible, this is (2m_pc\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe final invariant mass squared must also be the same. The final energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. The final momentum: since all four particles have momentum vectors that cancel, the total momentum is zero. \n\nThus, the invariant mass squared is (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 - 0 = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2. \n\nSetting equal to initial invariant mass squared:\n\n(2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 = (4 gamma m_A c\u00b2)^2 \n\nTaking square roots:\n\n2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 \n\nThus, 2 m_p = 4 gamma m_A \n\nSo gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A) \n\nWait, this is a different approach. Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me see. \n\nWait, the invariant mass squared for the initial system is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2. Since p_initial is zero (approx), that's (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2. \n\nThe final system's invariant mass squared is (E_final)^2 - (p_final c)^2. Since p_final is zero (because all momenta cancel), that's (E_final)^2. \n\nSo equate them:\n\n(2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 = (E_final)^2 \n\nThus, E_final = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nBut the final energy is also 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = m_p/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, this is a different result than before. \n\nHmm, so according to this method, gamma is m_p/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. Which one is correct? \n\nWait, this seems conflicting with the energy conservation approach earlier. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered that the total initial energy (rest energy) is equal to the total final energy (sum of the particles' energies). That is correct. But according to the invariant approach, the same result is obtained. Let me check with numbers. \n\nLet me compute gamma via the invariant approach. \n\nGiven m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, m_A is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\ngamma = (938)/(2*300) = 938/600 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nAh! Wait, that's the same gamma as before! \n\nSo that's the same value. So gamma is 1.5633. \n\nSo the two approaches agree. \n\nTherefore, the velocity calculation is the same. \n\nSo that gives v \u2248 0.768c \u2192 0.77c (option A). \n\nHmm, so why does the problem have other options? Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so their momentum must be considered in the invariant mass calculation? Wait no, the invariant approach already accounts for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me re-calculate. \n\ngamma = 1.5633 \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \u2192 \n\n1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/(gamma)^2 \n\n1/(1.5633)^2 \u2248 1/(2.443) \u2248 0.409 \n\nThus, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.409 \u2248 0.591 \n\nTaking square root gives sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769 \n\nSo v \u2248 0.769c \u2192 0.77c. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. So why is there an option B (0.96c)? Maybe I made a wrong assumption. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is also moving? Or perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some small kinetic energy. Wait, but even if the antiproton has a small velocity, its kinetic energy would be negligible compared to its rest mass. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the proton and antiproton annihilate into four particles, but in reality, in annihilation, sometimes photons are produced, but here the particles are massive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for kinetic energy? Wait, no, because the total energy includes rest and kinetic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the kinetic energy per particle and then find the velocity. \n\nWait, let's try that approach. \n\nThe total kinetic energy available is the initial energy minus the rest mass energy of the products. \n\nInitial energy: 2*(938) = 1876 MeV \n\nRest energy of products: 4*(300) = 1200 MeV \n\nSo the kinetic energy available is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. \n\nThis is distributed equally among the four particles. So each particle has kinetic energy of 676 /4 = 169 MeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is (gamma -1) m_A c\u00b2. \n\nThus, (gamma -1)*300 = 169 \u2192 gamma -1 = 169/300 \u2248 0.5633 \u2192 gamma \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSame gamma as before. So same result. \n\nThus, the velocity is still 0.77c. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in a different frame? Like, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. If the proton is at rest in the lab frame, then the antiproton has some small velocity. But since it's slowly moving, maybe we can take the initial momentum as negligible, so the center of mass frame is approximately the lab frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider relativistic momentum conservation. Let's try that. \n\nWait, let's suppose that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity v_pbar. But since it's moving slowly, v_pbar << c, so its momentum is approximately m_pbar v_pbar. \n\nThe initial momentum is then approximately m_pbar v_pbar. The final momentum must equal this. Since the four particles have momenta adding up to m_pbar v_pbar. \n\nBut since v_pbar is small, maybe the momentum is negligible, so we can approximate as before. \n\nAlternatively, if the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is not at rest, perhaps they are moving towards each other? \n\nWait, the problem says \"Consider this annihilation process p + \\bar{p} \u2192 ...\". The antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. \n\nIn that case, the total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the proton at rest. The antiproton has a small velocity v. \n\nInitial momentum is (mass of antiproton)*v \u2248 (938 MeV/c\u00b2)(v/c)*c (since p = gamma m v, but since v is small, gamma \u22481). \n\nSo initial momentum p_initial \u2248 (938 MeV/c\u00b2)(v/c)*c = 938*(v/c) MeV*s/c. \n\nThe final momentum must equal this. \n\nThe final momentum is the sum of the four particles' momenta. \n\nAssuming that the four particles are emitted symmetrically to conserve momentum. \n\nSuppose the antiproton and proton annihilate, producing four particles. The total momentum must be equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton. \n\nBut the problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". Since it's moving slowly, the initial momentum is small, so the final particles must also have a small net momentum. \n\nHowever, the question is asking for the velocity of particle A. Perhaps the velocity is determined by the energy, and the momentum's effect is negligible? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore the initial momentum (since it's slow) and proceed as before. \n\nIn that case, the velocity is 0.77c. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question's setup. Let me check the mass again. The problem states m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So each A has rest mass energy 300 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the proton mass. Wait, the proton rest mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2, yes. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute beta (v/c) via gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). \n\nGiven gamma \u22481.5633, 1/gamma \u22480.64, so 1/(1.5633)^2 \u22480.4096, so 1-0.4096 =0.5904, so beta = sqrt(0.5904)= ~0.768, which is 0.77. \n\nSo the calculation seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A) 0.77c. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is considering that the antiproton and proton have kinetic energy? Since they are moving, even if slowly. \n\nWait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is stationary, then the initial kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m_pbar c\u00b2 for the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, then gamma \u2248 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2), so kinetic energy is about (1/2) m v\u00b2. \n\nLet me see. Suppose the antiproton has speed v. Its kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m_p c\u00b2 \u2248 ( (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2) ) m_p c\u00b2 = 0.5 m_p v\u00b2. \n\nIf the antiproton is moving slowly, this kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. \n\nThe total initial energy would then be m_p c\u00b2 (proton rest) + m_p c\u00b2 (antiproton rest) + kinetic energy of antiproton. \n\nBut if the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, then the initial energy is still ~2*938. So the previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm. The options given include A as 0.77c, which matches the calculation. \n\nPerhaps the answer is indeed A. I think I've considered possible errors, and the calculations consistently lead to option A. So I'll go with that.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the annihilation of a proton and antiproton producing four particles (2A\u207a and 2A\u207b). The key steps are:\n\n1. **Initial Energy Calculation**:  \n   The proton and antiproton each have a rest mass energy of \\( m_p c^2 = 938 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is negligible. Thus, the total initial energy is:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Final Energy Conservation**:  \n   The total energy after annihilation must equal the initial energy. Each particle \\( A \\) has a rest mass energy \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). Let \\( \\gamma \\) be the Lorentz factor for each particle \\( A \\). The total final energy is:  \n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n   \\]  \n   Setting \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}} \\):  \n   \\[\n   1876 = 4 \\gamma \\times 300 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relating \\( \\gamma \\) to Velocity**:  \n   Using \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1.5633} \\approx 0.64 \\implies 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.4096 \\implies \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.5904.\n   \\]  \n   Taking the square root:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{v}{c} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5904} \\approx 0.768 \\implies v \\approx 0.77c.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   The velocity of particle \\( A \\) is approximately \\( 0.77c \\), corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
