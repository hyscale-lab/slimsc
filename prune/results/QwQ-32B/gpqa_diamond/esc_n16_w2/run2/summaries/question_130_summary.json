      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds in deep space that can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The key here is understanding the Lyman alpha wavelength and how redshift affects its observability from Earth. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet wavelengths because the Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV light. So, the wavelength observed must be in the optical range for the telescope to detect it. The optical range is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, right? \n\nThe problem is about redshift. Redshift causes the wavelength of light to stretch. So the original Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 \u00c5) gets shifted to a longer wavelength when the object is moving away from us. The question is asking for the lower limit of redshift where this shifted wavelength is still within the optical window. The lower limit would mean the smallest redshift where the wavelength is just entering the optical range. Wait, actually, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the clouds are absorbing the light from quasars. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of 1216 \u00c5. But when the cloud is moving away from us, the absorption line gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest*(1+z). We need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range (say, above 300 nm or 3000 \u00c5?) Wait, the optical range is visible light, which is about 4000-7000 \u00c5 (since 1 nm is 10 \u00c5). So 400 nm is 4000 \u00c5, 700 nm is 7000 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to 3000 \u00c5? No, because the atmosphere blocks UV, so the telescope can't detect wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). Wait, actually, the atmosphere's cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) for UV. So the observed wavelength must be above that to be detectable. \n\nWait the question says \"optical ground-based telescopes\", so the wavelength must be in the optical range. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff. Let me confirm: the Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so any light with wavelength shorter than that can't reach the ground. Therefore, the observed wavelength of the absorption line must be above 3000 \u00c5 to be detectable. \n\nThe original wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs = 1216*(1+z). We need this to be \u2265 3000 \u00c5. So solving for z: \n\n1216*(1+z) \u2265 3000 \n\nDivide both sides by 1216:\n\n1 + z \u2265 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.466\n\nSubtract 1:\n\nz \u2265 ~1.466\n\nHmm, so the lower limit would be around 1.47. The options given are B) 1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9, A)3. Wait, but 1.466 is approximately 1.5. The closest lower limit would be the smallest z where the observed wavelength is just over 3000 \u00c5. Since the options include 1.2 and 1.9, perhaps the answer is B or D. Wait but 1.2 would give 1216*(2.2)= 2675 \u00c5, which is below 3000. So that's not enough. So 1.2 would be too low. The next is D) 1.9: 1 +1.9 = 2.9. 1216 *2.9 = 1216*3 minus 1216*0.1. 1216*3=3648, minus 121.6 gives 3526.4 \u00c5. That's above 3000. So z=1.9 would work. But the lower limit is the minimum z such that it's just detectable. The calculated value was ~1.466. The options don't have 1.46, but the next higher option is B is 1.2 which is lower than that, so that's too low. The next option is D)1.9, which is higher than the required minimum. Wait, but the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". The lower limit would be the smallest z where the absorption line is observable. So the minimum z needed is ~1.466. The options given are B (1.2) which is below that, so too low, so the lower limit must be higher than that. So the smallest z that meets the condition is 1.466, so the lower limit is that. The options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the optical range is considered starting at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me check again.\n\nIf the optical window starts at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), then the cutoff is higher. Let's see: 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So (1+z)=4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z \u22482.29. Then the lower limit would be ~2.3, which is option C (2.4). Hmm, that's close. But I thought the cutoff was at 3000 \u00c5. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the exact cutoff. \n\nThe Earth's atmosphere's ozone layer absorbs most UV below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so any wavelength shorter than that is blocked. So to observe the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. Therefore, the correct cutoff is 3000 \u00c5. So then the required z is ~1.466. Since the options don't have that, but the options are B (1.2), D (1.9). The lower limit is the minimal z needed, so the first option that is above that is D (1.9). But wait, 1.466 is the lower limit. So the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit is the minimal redshift required. So the answer should be the smallest z where the observed wavelength is just above 3000 \u00c5. Since that z is ~1.47, the lower limit is around 1.5. Since the options don't have that, but option B is 1.2 (too low), so the correct answer must be the next possible option which is D)1.9. Wait but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate:\n\n3000 /1216 = 2.466... So 1+z is that, so z=1.466. So the lower limit is z\u22481.47. The options are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo the lower limit is the smallest z that allows detection. So the minimal z required is ~1.47. The options given must have an answer that's higher than that. The first option that is above this is D)1.9. However, the question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit would be the minimal z where the object is detectable. So the answer should be the first option that meets or exceeds that z. But the options don't have 1.47. The closest is D)1.9, but perhaps the question is considering a different cutoff? Maybe the optical window is considered to start at 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm). Let me try that. Then 4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z=2.29. Then the lower limit would be ~2.3, which is close to option C (2.4). So depending on the cutoff, the answer could be either 2.4 or 1.9. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check standard values. I recall that the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra with redshifts z > 2. Because at lower redshifts, the Lyman-alpha line would be in the UV. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. \n\nThe Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at the rest frame wavelength of 1216 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 \u00c5. To observe this with a ground telescope, the observed wavelength must be longer than ~3000 \u00c5 (since below that, the atmosphere is opaque). Therefore, solving 1216*(1+z) \u2265 3000 gives z \u2265 (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.466. So the minimal redshift is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, the answer must be the next possible option. The options given are B (1.2) is too low, so the minimal possible z that works is D (1.9), which is higher than 1.47. But the question is asking for the lower limit. That is, the smallest z where detection is possible. Since the calculated value is ~1.47, then the lower limit is that. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the question expects us to use a different cutoff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optical window is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me try that. Then:\n\n1216*(1+z) = 4000 \u2192 1+z = 4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z\u22482.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3. The closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, so there's ambiguity here. Which cutoff is correct? I think the key is that the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5). Therefore, the required wavelength is above that. So the calculation would give z\u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters? Let me check the question again. \n\nThe question says \"neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom\". So the absorption occurs at the rest frame wavelength. The observed wavelength would be redshifted by the cloud's redshift. The telescope must detect this. Since the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5), then the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5. \n\nThus, solving for z gives (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.466. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. The options are B:1.2, D:1.9. Since 1.2 is below the required z, so the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer must be the next possible option which is D:1.9. But wait, that's not exactly correct. The lower limit is the minimum z required, so the answer should be the smallest z in the options that is equal or higher than 1.47. So between B (1.2) and D (1.9), D is higher. But the question asks for the lower limit, which would be the minimal required z. Since the options don't have 1.47, perhaps the answer is B is wrong because it's below, so the minimal possible is D? Or maybe I made a mistake in the cutoff wavelength?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is at 4000 \u00c5. Let me see. For example, if the telescope can only see up to 4000 \u00c5, but that would not make sense because visible light starts at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So perhaps the question is considering that the optical instruments can't observe below 4000 \u00c5. Wait, but that's the visible range. The atmosphere allows some UV up to ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5). But ground-based telescopes can't observe below that. So the required wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. So the calculation is correct. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 1.2 is too low, so the lower limit is the next possible option, which would be D)1.9. But the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit is the minimum redshift needed. Since that's ~1.47, the answer must be the first option that is equal or higher than that. The options given are B (1.2) which is lower than 1.47, so it's not enough, so the lower limit is higher. So the minimal z in the options where detection is possible is D)1.9. But that's not the exact lower limit, but the question might be expecting that. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me recalculate with that:\n\n4000/1216 \u22483.29. So z\u22482.29. Closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, so which cutoff is correct? I think the standard cutoff for ground-based observations is that wavelengths below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5) are blocked by the atmosphere. So the required wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. Hence, the correct calculation gives z\u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, but D is 1.9 which is higher than that. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the smallest z possible where the object is detectable. Since the calculated z is ~1.47, the options must have an answer that is the minimal z where it's possible. Since 1.2 is below, the answer must be the next possible, which is D)1.9. But that's the first option where it's detectable. Wait, but the lower limit is the minimum z required. So the answer should be the minimal z that meets the condition. Since that's ~1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the optical window, which starts at 4000 \u00c5. Let me see. If that's the case, then the answer would be C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me check the math again. 3000 divided by 1216. Let me compute that precisely. 1216 * 2 = 2432. 3000 - 2432 = 568. 568/1216 = ~0.466. So total is 2.466, so z=1.466. So yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, the options given are B)1.2, D)1.9. The question might be expecting us to round up to the next possible option. Since 1.466 is approximately 1.5, which is between B and D. The options don't have 1.5, so the next higher is D (1.9). Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different approach. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the quasars themselves have their own redshift. The absorption occurs at the redshift of the cloud. The quasar's redshift must be higher than that of the cloud for the absorption to occur. Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the clouds. The quasar's light is passing through the cloud, so the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the cloud's redshift so that the absorption line is detectable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quasar's emission is in the UV, but the absorption is shifted into the optical. Wait, but the Lyman-alpha is part of the quasar's emission? No, the quasar emits across the spectrum, and the absorption occurs when the light from the quasar passes through the intergalactic medium (the HI clouds). The absorption line's wavelength in the quasar's spectrum is at the rest wavelength of 1216 \u00c5, but shifted by the cloud's redshift. \n\nWait, the key point is that the observed wavelength (after redshift) must be in the optical. So the calculation is correct. \n\nGiven that the options are B (1.2) and D (1.9), the lower limit is the minimal z where the observed wavelength is above 3000 \u00c5. So the minimal z is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me try that. \n\nIf the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then:\n\nz = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3, so the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure which cutoff is correct. The problem says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical spectrum is from 400-700 nm (4000-7000 \u00c5). But the atmosphere allows some UV down to 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the telescope can observe from 3000 \u00c5 upwards. Hence, the correct cutoff is 3000 \u00c5. Therefore, the required z is ~1.47, which is not listed. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps I made an error in units? The question states the Lyman alpha wavelength is ~1216 Angstrom. Let me confirm the units. Angstrom is correct. 1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm. So 3000 \u00c5 is 300 nm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the observed wavelength must be in the visible range (400-700 nm). Then the minimal wavelength is 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). In that case, the required z is (4000/1216 -1) \u2248 2.29, so ~2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4. \n\nThis is conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps I should recall that the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2. Because at lower redshifts, the Lyman-alpha line is in the UV and can't be observed from the ground. Wait, if the forest is observed at z >2, then the lower limit would be 2. So the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, I might have to check some standard knowledge. From what I remember, the Lyman-alpha forest refers to absorption lines at redshifts between z=2 and z=6, but the lower end is around z=2 because below that the wavelength would be in the UV. So the lower limit would be z=2, but the options have C)2.4, which is higher. Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. \n\nWait let's calculate with the 4000 \u00c5 cutoff. 4000/1216 = 3.29. So 1+z =3.29 \u2192 z=2.29. So rounding up, the lower limit is ~2.3. The closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses 3000 \u00c5 as cutoff. So then the lower limit is ~1.47, but the options don't have that. The next higher option is D)1.9. \n\nHmm, but why would the answer be 1.9? Let's see: 1.9 gives 1216*(2.9) = 1216*3=3648 minus 121.6 = 3526.4 \u00c5, which is above 3000. So that works. But the minimal z is ~1.47, so 1.9 is higher than that. So the lower limit is the minimal required, so the answer is the first option that is above 1.47. Since B is 1.2 (too low), D is the first option above. \n\nBut the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. That is, the smallest z where detection is possible. Since the calculation gives ~1.47, but that's not an option, so perhaps the options are approximated. The closest is between B and D. Since 1.47 is closer to 1.5, and the options have D at 1.9. Alternatively, maybe the question's options are designed with a cutoff at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nIf the cutoff is 3000 \u00c5, then z is (3000/1216 -1) = (2.466 -1)=1.466. \n\nIf the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then z is 2.29. \n\nThe options given are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo if the cutoff is 3000 \u00c5, then the lower limit is ~1.47. The options have D)1.9 which is higher than that, so the minimal required z is 1.47, which is not an option, so perhaps the question expects us to round up to the nearest option. But the question says \"lower limit\", so the minimal z possible. Since B is below that, then the minimal possible z that is possible is the next option, which is D. But that's not exactly right. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the quasar's own redshift. Wait, the absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The quasar must have a higher redshift than the cloud, so that the light passes through the cloud. But the question is about the cloud's redshift. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the lower limit for the quasar's redshift, but that's not stated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 1216 Angstrom is the rest frame wavelength. The observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216. To be in the optical range (say, above 300 nm (3000 \u00c5)), so:\n\n(1+z)*1216 \u2265 3000\n\nz \u2265 (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.466. \n\nThus the lower limit is ~1.47. The options don't have that, so the closest higher option is D (1.9). Since the question asks for the lower limit, that would be the minimal required z. Since B is too low, the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cutoff is 3200 \u00c5, then:\n\n3200/1216 \u2248 2.63 \u2192 z\u22481.63, so the lower limit is ~1.63. The closest option is D (1.9). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the answer to be 2.4. Let me think why. If we use the optical window starting at 4000 \u00c5 (visible light), then the calculation gives 2.29, so ~2.3. The option C is 2.4, which is very close. So perhaps the standard approach uses that cutoff. \n\nIn many textbooks, the Lyman-alpha absorption is considered observable in the optical when the observed wavelength is in the visible, so starting at ~4000 \u00c5. For example, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed at redshifts z > 2 because below that the wavelength is in the UV. So for z=2, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(3)=3648 \u00c5, which is just into the optical. Wait, that's 3648 \u00c5, which is 364.8 nm, which is in the UV part of the atmosphere's transmittance? Wait, 364 nm is in the near-UV, which might still be blocked. Wait, the atmosphere's cutoff is around 300 nm. So 364 nm (3648 \u00c5) is above that. So it's detectable. \n\nWait, so for z=2, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2)=3648 \u00c5. Which is above 3000 \u00c5. So that's detectable. So the lower limit would be z=2? \n\nWait, then 1+z=3 \u2192 z=2. So the lower limit is z=2. So the options have C)2.4. But why is the lower limit 2? Because at z=2, it's exactly at 3648 \u00c5 which is detectable. So the lower limit would be z=2. But the options don't have 2. The closest is C)2.4. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the lower limit such that the absorption can be detected in the optical. So the minimal z is where the wavelength is just in the optical. So z=2. \n\nBut since the options don't have 2, then the next option is C (2.4). Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the question's options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) but that's different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the telescope can only observe up to 7000 \u00c5, but that's not the issue here. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equation. \n\nThe observed wavelength must be \u22653000 \u00c5. So (1+z)*1216 \u22653000 \u2192 z\u2265 (3000/1216)-1\u22481.466. \n\nThe options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Since 1.466 is between B and D, the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is just above that. The first option that meets the condition is D (1.9). So the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5. Then z\u22482.29. The closest option is C. \n\nHmm. Given that the options include 2.4, which is close to 2.29, and that Lyman alpha forest is typically observed at z>2, I think the intended answer is C)2.4. \n\nBut why does that discrepancy exist? Let me think again. \n\nIf the atmosphere allows up to 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), then the observed wavelength must be \u22653000 \u00c5. So for z=1.466, the observed wavelength is 3000 \u00c5. So the lower limit is z\u22481.47. \n\nBut in reality, ground-based observations of Lyman-alpha absorption are possible when the observed wavelength is in the optical, which starts at ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Because even though the atmosphere allows down to 3000 \u00c5, the optical instruments are designed for visible light. Maybe the question assumes that the optical is considered starting at 400 nm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) but that's not relevant here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:\n\n3000 divided by 1216. Let me do it step by step:\n\n1216 \u00d7 2 = 2432.\n\n3000 - 2432 = 568.\n\n568 / 1216 = 0.466...\n\nSo yes, 2.466, so z=1.466. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, and the closest higher options are D (1.9) and C (2.4). \n\nGiven that the question is from an exam, perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4. Maybe the question assumes that the optical window starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, the question says \"the redshift of these objects\" (the clouds). \n\nHmm. This is a tough one. Since the options don't have 1.47, but the Lyman-alpha forest is usually observed at z>2, I'm more inclined to think that the answer is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the following approach: the Lyman alpha line at 1216 \u00c5 must be shifted into the optical, which is 400 nm to 700 nm. So the observed wavelength must be at least 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So:\n\n(1+z)*1216 \u00c5 = 4000 \u00c5 \u2192 z=(4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. \n\nRounding to one decimal, that's ~2.3.

      "full_content": "Okay, so the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds in deep space that can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The key here is understanding the Lyman alpha wavelength and how redshift affects its observability from Earth. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet wavelengths because the Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV light. So, the wavelength observed must be in the optical range for the telescope to detect it. The optical range is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, right? \n\nThe problem is about redshift. Redshift causes the wavelength of light to stretch. So the original Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 \u00c5) gets shifted to a longer wavelength when the object is moving away from us. The question is asking for the lower limit of redshift where this shifted wavelength is still within the optical window. The lower limit would mean the smallest redshift where the wavelength is just entering the optical range. Wait, actually, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the clouds are absorbing the light from quasars. The absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of 1216 \u00c5. But when the cloud is moving away from us, the absorption line gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest*(1+z). We need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range (say, above 300 nm or 3000 \u00c5?) Wait, the optical range is visible light, which is about 4000-7000 \u00c5 (since 1 nm is 10 \u00c5). So 400 nm is 4000 \u00c5, 700 nm is 7000 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to 3000 \u00c5? No, because the atmosphere blocks UV, so the telescope can't detect wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). Wait, actually, the atmosphere's cutoff is around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) for UV. So the observed wavelength must be above that to be detectable. \n\nWait the question says \"optical ground-based telescopes\", so the wavelength must be in the optical range. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff. Let me confirm: the Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so any light with wavelength shorter than that can't reach the ground. Therefore, the observed wavelength of the absorption line must be above 3000 \u00c5 to be detectable. \n\nThe original wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs = 1216*(1+z). We need this to be \u2265 3000 \u00c5. So solving for z: \n\n1216*(1+z) \u2265 3000 \n\nDivide both sides by 1216:\n\n1 + z \u2265 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.466\n\nSubtract 1:\n\nz \u2265 ~1.466\n\nHmm, so the lower limit would be around 1.47. The options given are B) 1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9, A)3. Wait, but 1.466 is approximately 1.5. The closest lower limit would be the smallest z where the observed wavelength is just over 3000 \u00c5. Since the options include 1.2 and 1.9, perhaps the answer is B or D. Wait but 1.2 would give 1216*(2.2)= 2675 \u00c5, which is below 3000. So that's not enough. So 1.2 would be too low. The next is D) 1.9: 1 +1.9 = 2.9. 1216 *2.9 = 1216*3 minus 1216*0.1. 1216*3=3648, minus 121.6 gives 3526.4 \u00c5. That's above 3000. So z=1.9 would work. But the lower limit is the minimum z such that it's just detectable. The calculated value was ~1.466. The options don't have 1.46, but the next higher option is B is 1.2 which is lower than that, so that's too low. The next option is D)1.9, which is higher than the required minimum. Wait, but the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". The lower limit would be the smallest z where the absorption line is observable. So the minimum z needed is ~1.466. The options given are B (1.2) which is below that, so too low, so the lower limit must be higher than that. So the smallest z that meets the condition is 1.466, so the lower limit is that. The options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the optical range is considered starting at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me check again.\n\nIf the optical window starts at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), then the cutoff is higher. Let's see: 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So (1+z)=4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z \u22482.29. Then the lower limit would be ~2.3, which is option C (2.4). Hmm, that's close. But I thought the cutoff was at 3000 \u00c5. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the exact cutoff. \n\nThe Earth's atmosphere's ozone layer absorbs most UV below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so any wavelength shorter than that is blocked. So to observe the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. Therefore, the correct cutoff is 3000 \u00c5. So then the required z is ~1.466. Since the options don't have that, but the options are B (1.2), D (1.9). The lower limit is the minimal z needed, so the first option that is above that is D (1.9). But wait, 1.466 is the lower limit. So the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit is the minimal redshift required. So the answer should be the smallest z where the observed wavelength is just above 3000 \u00c5. Since that z is ~1.47, the lower limit is around 1.5. Since the options don't have that, but option B is 1.2 (too low), so the correct answer must be the next possible option which is D)1.9. Wait but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate:\n\n3000 /1216 = 2.466... So 1+z is that, so z=1.466. So the lower limit is z\u22481.47. The options are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo the lower limit is the smallest z that allows detection. So the minimal z required is ~1.47. The options given must have an answer that's higher than that. The first option that is above this is D)1.9. However, the question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit would be the minimal z where the object is detectable. So the answer should be the first option that meets or exceeds that z. But the options don't have 1.47. The closest is D)1.9, but perhaps the question is considering a different cutoff? Maybe the optical window is considered to start at 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm). Let me try that. Then 4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z=2.29. Then the lower limit would be ~2.3, which is close to option C (2.4). So depending on the cutoff, the answer could be either 2.4 or 1.9. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check standard values. I recall that the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra with redshifts z > 2. Because at lower redshifts, the Lyman-alpha line would be in the UV. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. \n\nThe Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at the rest frame wavelength of 1216 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216 \u00c5. To observe this with a ground telescope, the observed wavelength must be longer than ~3000 \u00c5 (since below that, the atmosphere is opaque). Therefore, solving 1216*(1+z) \u2265 3000 gives z \u2265 (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.466. So the minimal redshift is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, the answer must be the next possible option. The options given are B (1.2) is too low, so the minimal possible z that works is D (1.9), which is higher than 1.47. But the question is asking for the lower limit. That is, the smallest z where detection is possible. Since the calculated value is ~1.47, then the lower limit is that. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the question expects us to use a different cutoff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optical window is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me try that. Then:\n\n1216*(1+z) = 4000 \u2192 1+z = 4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z\u22482.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3. The closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, so there's ambiguity here. Which cutoff is correct? I think the key is that the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5). Therefore, the required wavelength is above that. So the calculation would give z\u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters? Let me check the question again. \n\nThe question says \"neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom\". So the absorption occurs at the rest frame wavelength. The observed wavelength would be redshifted by the cloud's redshift. The telescope must detect this. Since the atmosphere blocks below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5), then the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5. \n\nThus, solving for z gives (3000/1216)-1 \u2248 1.466. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. The options are B:1.2, D:1.9. Since 1.2 is below the required z, so the minimal z is ~1.47, so the answer must be the next possible option which is D:1.9. But wait, that's not exactly correct. The lower limit is the minimum z required, so the answer should be the smallest z in the options that is equal or higher than 1.47. So between B (1.2) and D (1.9), D is higher. But the question asks for the lower limit, which would be the minimal required z. Since the options don't have 1.47, perhaps the answer is B is wrong because it's below, so the minimal possible is D? Or maybe I made a mistake in the cutoff wavelength?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is at 4000 \u00c5. Let me see. For example, if the telescope can only see up to 4000 \u00c5, but that would not make sense because visible light starts at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So perhaps the question is considering that the optical instruments can't observe below 4000 \u00c5. Wait, but that's the visible range. The atmosphere allows some UV up to ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5). But ground-based telescopes can't observe below that. So the required wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. So the calculation is correct. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 1.2 is too low, so the lower limit is the next possible option, which would be D)1.9. But the question says \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit is the minimum redshift needed. Since that's ~1.47, the answer must be the first option that is equal or higher than that. The options given are B (1.2) which is lower than 1.47, so it's not enough, so the lower limit is higher. So the minimal z in the options where detection is possible is D)1.9. But that's not the exact lower limit, but the question might be expecting that. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me recalculate with that:\n\n4000/1216 \u22483.29. So z\u22482.29. Closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, so which cutoff is correct? I think the standard cutoff for ground-based observations is that wavelengths below ~300 nm (3000 \u00c5) are blocked by the atmosphere. So the required wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5. Hence, the correct calculation gives z\u22481.47. Since the options don't have that, but D is 1.9 which is higher than that. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the smallest z possible where the object is detectable. Since the calculated z is ~1.47, the options must have an answer that is the minimal z where it's possible. Since 1.2 is below, the answer must be the next possible, which is D)1.9. But that's the first option where it's detectable. Wait, but the lower limit is the minimum z required. So the answer should be the minimal z that meets the condition. Since that's ~1.47, but the options don't have that. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the optical window, which starts at 4000 \u00c5. Let me see. If that's the case, then the answer would be C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me check the math again. 3000 divided by 1216. Let me compute that precisely. 1216 * 2 = 2432. 3000 - 2432 = 568. 568/1216 = ~0.466. So total is 2.466, so z=1.466. So yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, the options given are B)1.2, D)1.9. The question might be expecting us to round up to the next possible option. Since 1.466 is approximately 1.5, which is between B and D. The options don't have 1.5, so the next higher is D (1.9). Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different approach. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the quasars themselves have their own redshift. The absorption occurs at the redshift of the cloud. The quasar's redshift must be higher than that of the cloud for the absorption to occur. Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the clouds. The quasar's light is passing through the cloud, so the cloud's redshift must be less than the quasar's. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the cloud's redshift so that the absorption line is detectable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quasar's emission is in the UV, but the absorption is shifted into the optical. Wait, but the Lyman-alpha is part of the quasar's emission? No, the quasar emits across the spectrum, and the absorption occurs when the light from the quasar passes through the intergalactic medium (the HI clouds). The absorption line's wavelength in the quasar's spectrum is at the rest wavelength of 1216 \u00c5, but shifted by the cloud's redshift. \n\nWait, the key point is that the observed wavelength (after redshift) must be in the optical. So the calculation is correct. \n\nGiven that the options are B (1.2) and D (1.9), the lower limit is the minimal z where the observed wavelength is above 3000 \u00c5. So the minimal z is ~1.47. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me try that. \n\nIf the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then:\n\nz = (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3, so the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure which cutoff is correct. The problem says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical spectrum is from 400-700 nm (4000-7000 \u00c5). But the atmosphere allows some UV down to 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the telescope can observe from 3000 \u00c5 upwards. Hence, the correct cutoff is 3000 \u00c5. Therefore, the required z is ~1.47, which is not listed. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps I made an error in units? The question states the Lyman alpha wavelength is ~1216 Angstrom. Let me confirm the units. Angstrom is correct. 1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm. So 3000 \u00c5 is 300 nm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the observed wavelength must be in the visible range (400-700 nm). Then the minimal wavelength is 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). In that case, the required z is (4000/1216 -1) \u2248 2.29, so ~2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4. \n\nThis is conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps I should recall that the Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2. Because at lower redshifts, the Lyman-alpha line is in the UV and can't be observed from the ground. Wait, if the forest is observed at z >2, then the lower limit would be 2. So the closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, I might have to check some standard knowledge. From what I remember, the Lyman-alpha forest refers to absorption lines at redshifts between z=2 and z=6, but the lower end is around z=2 because below that the wavelength would be in the UV. So the lower limit would be z=2, but the options have C)2.4, which is higher. Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. \n\nWait let's calculate with the 4000 \u00c5 cutoff. 4000/1216 = 3.29. So 1+z =3.29 \u2192 z=2.29. So rounding up, the lower limit is ~2.3. The closest option is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses 3000 \u00c5 as cutoff. So then the lower limit is ~1.47, but the options don't have that. The next higher option is D)1.9. \n\nHmm, but why would the answer be 1.9? Let's see: 1.9 gives 1216*(2.9) = 1216*3=3648 minus 121.6 = 3526.4 \u00c5, which is above 3000. So that works. But the minimal z is ~1.47, so 1.9 is higher than that. So the lower limit is the minimal required, so the answer is the first option that is above 1.47. Since B is 1.2 (too low), D is the first option above. \n\nBut the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. That is, the smallest z where detection is possible. Since the calculation gives ~1.47, but that's not an option, so perhaps the options are approximated. The closest is between B and D. Since 1.47 is closer to 1.5, and the options have D at 1.9. Alternatively, maybe the question's options are designed with a cutoff at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nIf the cutoff is 3000 \u00c5, then z is (3000/1216 -1) = (2.466 -1)=1.466. \n\nIf the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then z is 2.29. \n\nThe options given are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo if the cutoff is 3000 \u00c5, then the lower limit is ~1.47. The options have D)1.9 which is higher than that, so the minimal required z is 1.47, which is not an option, so perhaps the question expects us to round up to the nearest option. But the question says \"lower limit\", so the minimal z possible. Since B is below that, then the minimal possible z that is possible is the next option, which is D. But that's not exactly right. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the quasar's own redshift. Wait, the absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The quasar must have a higher redshift than the cloud, so that the light passes through the cloud. But the question is about the cloud's redshift. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the lower limit for the quasar's redshift, but that's not stated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 1216 Angstrom is the rest frame wavelength. The observed wavelength is (1+z)*1216. To be in the optical range (say, above 300 nm (3000 \u00c5)), so:\n\n(1+z)*1216 \u2265 3000\n\nz \u2265 (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.466. \n\nThus the lower limit is ~1.47. The options don't have that, so the closest higher option is D (1.9). Since the question asks for the lower limit, that would be the minimal required z. Since B is too low, the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cutoff is 3200 \u00c5, then:\n\n3200/1216 \u2248 2.63 \u2192 z\u22481.63, so the lower limit is ~1.63. The closest option is D (1.9). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the answer to be 2.4. Let me think why. If we use the optical window starting at 4000 \u00c5 (visible light), then the calculation gives 2.29, so ~2.3. The option C is 2.4, which is very close. So perhaps the standard approach uses that cutoff. \n\nIn many textbooks, the Lyman-alpha absorption is considered observable in the optical when the observed wavelength is in the visible, so starting at ~4000 \u00c5. For example, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed at redshifts z > 2 because below that the wavelength is in the UV. So for z=2, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(3)=3648 \u00c5, which is just into the optical. Wait, that's 3648 \u00c5, which is 364.8 nm, which is in the UV part of the atmosphere's transmittance? Wait, 364 nm is in the near-UV, which might still be blocked. Wait, the atmosphere's cutoff is around 300 nm. So 364 nm (3648 \u00c5) is above that. So it's detectable. \n\nWait, so for z=2, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2)=3648 \u00c5. Which is above 3000 \u00c5. So that's detectable. So the lower limit would be z=2? \n\nWait, then 1+z=3 \u2192 z=2. So the lower limit is z=2. So the options have C)2.4. But why is the lower limit 2? Because at z=2, it's exactly at 3648 \u00c5 which is detectable. So the lower limit would be z=2. But the options don't have 2. The closest is C)2.4. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the lower limit such that the absorption can be detected in the optical. So the minimal z is where the wavelength is just in the optical. So z=2. \n\nBut since the options don't have 2, then the next option is C (2.4). Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the question's options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) but that's different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the telescope can only observe up to 7000 \u00c5, but that's not the issue here. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equation. \n\nThe observed wavelength must be \u22653000 \u00c5. So (1+z)*1216 \u22653000 \u2192 z\u2265 (3000/1216)-1\u22481.466. \n\nThe options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Since 1.466 is between B and D, the minimal z is ~1.47, so the lower limit is just above that. The first option that meets the condition is D (1.9). So the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5. Then z\u22482.29. The closest option is C. \n\nHmm. Given that the options include 2.4, which is close to 2.29, and that Lyman alpha forest is typically observed at z>2, I think the intended answer is C)2.4. \n\nBut why does that discrepancy exist? Let me think again. \n\nIf the atmosphere allows up to 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), then the observed wavelength must be \u22653000 \u00c5. So for z=1.466, the observed wavelength is 3000 \u00c5. So the lower limit is z\u22481.47. \n\nBut in reality, ground-based observations of Lyman-alpha absorption are possible when the observed wavelength is in the optical, which starts at ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Because even though the atmosphere allows down to 3000 \u00c5, the optical instruments are designed for visible light. Maybe the question assumes that the optical is considered starting at 400 nm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) but that's not relevant here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:\n\n3000 divided by 1216. Let me do it step by step:\n\n1216 \u00d7 2 = 2432.\n\n3000 - 2432 = 568.\n\n568 / 1216 = 0.466...\n\nSo yes, 2.466, so z=1.466. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, and the closest higher options are D (1.9) and C (2.4). \n\nGiven that the question is from an exam, perhaps the intended answer is C)2.4. Maybe the question assumes that the optical window starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, the question says \"the redshift of these objects\" (the clouds). \n\nHmm. This is a tough one. Since the options don't have 1.47, but the Lyman-alpha forest is usually observed at z>2, I'm more inclined to think that the answer is C)2.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses the following approach: the Lyman alpha line at 1216 \u00c5 must be shifted into the optical, which is 400 nm to 700 nm. So the observed wavelength must be at least 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So:\n\n(1+z)*1216 \u00c5 = 4000 \u00c5 \u2192 z=(4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. \n\nRounding to one decimal, that's ~2.3. The closest option is C)2.4. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C)2.4. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C)2.4.\n\n\nThe Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. To be detectable by ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must exceed the atmospheric cutoff of ~3000 \u00c5 (300 nm). The observed wavelength is given by \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1+z) \\). Setting \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\geq 3000 \\) \u00c5:\n\n\\[\n1216 \\times (1+z) \\geq 3000 \\implies 1+z \\geq \\frac{3000}{1216} \\approx 2.466 \\implies z \\geq 1.466\n\\]\n\nSince the options do not include 1.47, we consider the next possible cutoff of 4000 \u00c5 (400 nm), which is within the visible range. Recalculating:\n\n\\[\n1216 \\times (1+z) \\geq 4000 \\implies 1+z \\geq \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.29 \\implies z \\geq 2.29\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to 2.29 is **C) 2.4**, which aligns with typical observations of the Lyman-alpha forest requiring \\( z > 2 \\). Thus, the lower limit is **C) 2.4**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, the question mentions that the absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is an ultraviolet line, right? Because the Lyman series is in the UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the Earth's atmosphere blocks it. Oh right, so the key here is that the observed wavelength must be in the optical range for the telescope to detect it. \n\nSo the idea is that the original wavelength of Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms (which is UV), but when the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets redshifted. The redshift z causes the observed wavelength to be lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). \n\nThe optical window for ground telescopes is roughly from about 3000 Angstroms to around 11000 Angstroms (or maybe up to 1 micron, which is 10,000 angstroms). Wait, but the exact range might be considered here. Since the atmosphere blocks most UV, the optical part that can be observed starts at around 300 nm (3000 angstroms), so the observed wavelength after redshift must be above that. \n\nSo the absorption line's wavelength when observed must be in the optical range. The original Lyman alpha is 1216 \u00c5, so to get into the optical (say, 3000 \u00c5 or higher), the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >= 3000. Let me write that equation:\n\n1216*(1 + z) \u2265 3000\n\nSolving for z:\n\n1 + z \u2265 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.466\n\nSo z \u2265 ~1.466. \n\nLooking at the options, the lower limit would be the smallest z that meets this. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. \n\nWait, 1.466 is approximately 1.5. So the lower limit is around 1.5. So the options given have B as 1.2 which is lower, so that's too low. D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.5. The question asks for the lower limit such that they CAN be detected. So if z is at least 1.5, then the wavelength would be in the optical. So the minimal z needed is ~1.5. So the lower limit would be 1.5. But the options don't have 1.5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the maximum wavelength that can be observed. Wait, the atmosphere is transparent in the optical, but up to about 1 micron (10000 \u00c5). But the problem is the original Lyman alpha is at 1216 \u00c5, which is UV. The absorption is observed when the wavelength is redshifted into the optical. So the redshift has to be enough so that the original 1216 \u00c5 is shifted into the optical range (so that the telescope can see it). \n\nAlternatively, the absorption occurs at the rest-frame Lyman alpha wavelength, but because of redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff. \n\nThe cutoff for UV is around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5. \n\nSo solving 1216*(1+z) = 3000 gives z \u2248 (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.466. So any z above that would work. The question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal z where it's just possible. So the lower limit is approximately 1.466. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value than this is 1.9 (D) or 2.4 (C). Wait, but the lower limit would be the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer must be the smallest z that meets the condition. The options given have B as 1.2 which is below that, so the minimal z required is ~1.5. So the lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer is the first option that is equal or higher than 1.466. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), so the minimal possible answer here is 1.9? Wait, but that's higher than needed. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit would be the smallest redshift that allows detection. So if the required z is ~1.5, then any z above that can be detected. The lower limit is 1.5, so the minimal redshift needed is ~1.5. The options given don't have that exactly, so which one is the first option that is above that? The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), so 1.9 is higher than 1.5, so the lower limit is 1.5. But since the options are given, maybe the answer is D (1.9) is the lower limit? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher? Let me check the optical window again. The Earth's atmosphere blocks all wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so the optical starts at around 300 nm. But maybe the exact cutoff is a bit lower? For example, maybe some UV is visible near 300 nm but not much. So the calculation is correct. The required z is ~1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47, so any z above that is okay. The question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the minimal z required is ~1.5. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Wait, but 1.2 is below the required z, so that would not be detected. The first option that meets the requirement is 1.9 (since 1.9 is higher than 1.47). So the lower limit is 1.9? Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection. The minimal z is 1.47. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering another cutoff?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Lyman alpha line is actually at 1215.67 \u00c5. Let me recalculate with that. 1215.67*(1+z) = 3000. So 3000/1215.67 \u2248 2.467, so z \u22481.467. So the same as before. So the minimal z is ~1.467. The options given are 1.2 (B) and 1.9 (D). So the lower limit must be the smallest z value that is acceptable, so the minimal possible z that allows detection is ~1.467. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is looking for the smallest among the given options that is higher than this value. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So D is 1.9 which is higher than 1.467, so that would be a possible lower limit. Wait, but the lower limit would be the minimal z required, so the correct answer must be the first option that is above the required value. Since 1.9 is the first one above 1.47, so D is the correct answer. But the options also have C)2.4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is higher? Let me think again. Maybe the atmosphere allows some UV down to 300 nm, but maybe for practical purposes, the optical telescopes can go down to like 320 nm (3200 \u00c5) or so. Let me see. Suppose the cutoff is 3200 \u00c5. Then 3200/1216 \u2248 2.63, so z\u22481.63. So the minimal z is ~1.63. Then the answer would still be D (1.9) as the first option above that. Alternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is at 3650 \u00c5 (like the hydrogen Lyman limit?), but that's higher. Wait, the Lyman limit is at 912 \u00c5, but that's the point where the atmosphere is completely opaque. But the atmosphere starts to let some light through at longer wavelengths. The exact cutoff for ground-based observations might be around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the telescope can only observe up to a certain wavelength. Wait, no, the problem is that the original line is in UV. The redshifted wavelength must be in the optical. So the minimal z is 1.46. The options given are B (1.2) which is below, so that's insufficient. The next is D (1.9). So the lower limit must be 1.9? Wait, but the lower limit is the minimum redshift required. So the minimal z is ~1.46, so any z above that can be detected. The question is asking for the lower limit such that they CAN be detected. So the lower limit is the minimal z where it's possible. Since the options don't have 1.46, but D is 1.9 which is higher than that. Wait, but the answer options might be using a different cutoff. For instance, maybe the optical is considered up to 1 micron, but the question is about the lower limit. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, redshift formula: the observed wavelength is (1+z) times the emitted wavelength. Wait, the quasars emit the light, and the clouds are in between, so the absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen (Lyman alpha 1216 \u00c5) but redshifted by the cloud's redshift. Wait, actually, the redshift here is the redshift of the absorbing cloud. Because the absorption happens when the light from the quasar passes through the cloud. The quasar's light has its own redshift, but the absorption is at the rest frame of the cloud. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z_cloud) times the rest wavelength (1216 \u00c5). \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range (above 3000 \u00c5) to be detected. So the calculation is correct. So the minimal z_cloud is ~1.466. The options given are B (1.2) which is too low, D (1.9) is higher. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the minimal z needed. Since the options don't have 1.5, perhaps the answer is the smallest option that is above this value. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), C (2.4). So D is the first one above 1.46. So the lower limit would be D. Because if the cloud's redshift is 1.9, then it can be detected. But a cloud with z=1.5 would also be detected, but since that's not an option, the minimal among the options given would be D. Wait, but the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of the objects such that they can be detected\". The lower limit is the smallest redshift that allows detection. But in that case, the correct lower limit is ~1.46, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest wavelength. Wait, the Lyman alpha is the emission line of the quasar? Or the absorption line from the cloud. The question says \"neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom\". So the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud's rest frame. So the observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if the question is about the redshift of the quasar or the cloud. The question says \"the redshift of this objects\" (probably a typo, should be \"objects\" but maybe \"object\", referring to the clouds). So the redshift of the cloud must be such that their absorption line is in the optical. Therefore, the minimal z_cloud is ~1.46. The options given don't have that, so the next possible is D (1.9). But why is 2.4 an option? Let me see. Let's see what 2.4 would give: 1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4=4134.4 \u00c5, which is in the optical. But the minimal required is ~1.46. So the lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection. Since 1.9 is higher than the required, but the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z where detection is possible. The lower limit would be the minimal z, so the correct answer is the smallest z among the options that is above 1.46. The options are B (1.2 <1.46), D (1.9>1.46), so D is the first one. Therefore the answer is D)1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the quasar's redshift? Wait, the quasar is the background object. The absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216. So the calculation is correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is higher? Like 4000 angstroms? Let's see: 4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z\u22482.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be higher? Because maybe the atmosphere is more opaque below 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me check the atmospheric transmission. The Earth's atmosphere allows some UV down to about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), but the transmission is not great. However, ground-based observations of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies are done in the optical when the redshift is sufficient. For example, Lyman alpha at 1216 \u00c5 needs to be shifted into the optical (say, ~350 nm is still UV but maybe detectable with some filters?), but perhaps the standard optical telescopes are limited to ~4000 \u00c5? Wait, no, 400 nm is 4000 \u00c5. So the cutoff is around there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the optical is from 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5. Let's see: if the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then z = (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. So then the minimal z is ~2.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be 4000? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, but the quasar's redshift would be higher than the cloud's, since the cloud is between us and the quasar. The absorption redshift z_cloud is less than the quasar's redshift z_qso. But the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) so that they can be detected. So the cloud's redshift must be such that their absorption line is in the optical. So the calculation remains as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be within the optical window of the telescope's instruments. For example, if the telescope can only observe down to 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), then the required z would be (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). \n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The standard optical window is considered to start at around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the calculation gives z ~1.46. The options have 1.9 and 2.4. Since 1.9 is higher than 1.46, but 2.4 is even higher. So why is 2.4 an option? Maybe the problem is using the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) as the rest wavelength? Wait, no. The absorption is at Lyman alpha. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the entire Lyman series is blocked except for Lyman alpha? Or maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 \u00c5, but when redshifted, the observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff (say 3000 \u00c5). So the calculation is correct. So the minimal z is ~1.46. Since the options are given, perhaps the answer is D (1.9) because the question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the minimal z where it can be detected. Since 1.2 is too low (can't be detected), the lower limit would be the next one which is 1.9? Or is the lower limit the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer should be the first option that meets the requirement. Since 1.46 is the actual lower limit, but since it's not listed, the next possible answer is D (1.9). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate 3000 divided by 1216:\n\n3000 / 1216 = ?\n\n1216 * 2 = 2432. 3000 - 2432 = 568. 568 / 1216 = ~0.466. So total is 2.466. So z = 1.466. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the minimal z is ~1.46. The options given are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo the closest lower limit that is higher than 1.46 is D (1.9). Since the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected, that would be the minimal z required. Since 1.46 isn't an option, perhaps the question expects the next possible value, which is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed, so the observed wavelength of the quasar must also be in the optical. Wait, but the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The quasar's own redshift would be higher than the cloud's, but that doesn't affect the absorption line's detectability. The absorption line's observed wavelength must be in the optical, which is determined by the cloud's redshift. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D)1.9. But wait, the calculation gives ~1.46. Let me see the options again. The options include 1.9 and 2.4. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the smallest z where it can be detected, so if 1.46 is the minimum, then any z above that can be detected. Therefore, the lower limit is 1.46. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering the optical to start at a higher wavelength. Let's see what 1.9 gives: 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 \u00c5, which is in the optical. So that works. If the question is asking for the lower limit, the minimal z that allows detection, then the correct answer is the first option that meets the condition. Since 1.9 is the first option above the required 1.46, then D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me see: 4000 /1216 \u22483.29, so z=2.29. Then the closest option is C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be 4000? Maybe I should think that the optical is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), which is more standard. Let me check: the optical spectrum is typically considered from ~400 nm (violet) to ~700 nm (red). But the atmosphere allows some UV down to ~300 nm. However, many ground-based telescopes have instruments that are optimized for the visible spectrum starting at around 400 nm. So perhaps the question assumes that the optical starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nIn that case, the required z would be (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. So the answer would be C (2.4). \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. I need to think which is more likely. \n\nThe problem says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical window for ground-based observations includes wavelengths from about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) to 1 micron (10000 \u00c5). But some sources say that the visible spectrum is 400-700 nm. However, in astronomy, the optical can sometimes be considered to include near-UV (300-400 nm) as well, depending on the telescope's capabilities. \n\nIf the problem uses 3000 \u00c5 as the cutoff, then the answer is D (1.9). If it uses 4000 \u00c5, then C (2.4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook problem that uses 4000 \u00c5. Let me think of standard problems. For example, the Lyman alpha forest: the absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at high redshift. The Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra. The forest is seen at redshifts z < z_qso. The observed wavelength must be in the optical. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. So to get into the optical (say, 3000 \u00c5), then (1+z)=3000/1216 \u2192 z\u22481.5. So the minimal redshift of the cloud is ~1.5. Therefore the lower limit is about 1.5. The options given have D as 1.9, which is higher than that. \n\nPerhaps the question expects the answer to be 1.9 because 1+z = 3000/1216 \u22482.466, so z\u22481.466, which rounds to ~1.5, but since that's not an option, the closest higher option is 1.9? Or maybe the question uses a different wavelength cutoff. Wait, maybe the question is using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me see:\n\nIf cutoff is 4000:\n\n4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z=2.29 \u2192 closest is 2.4 (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using 5000 \u00c5 as the cutoff (500 nm), then:\n\n5000/1216\u22484.11 \u2192 z\u22483.11 \u2192 which is close to A)3. \n\nHmm, but then why would the cutoff be 5000?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Earth's atmosphere is completely opaque below 3650 \u00c5 (the ozone layer cutoff?), but that's 365 nm. \n\nWait, the ozone layer absorbs wavelengths below 290 nm, but allows some UV through above that. The exact cutoff for practical observations might vary. For example, the IUE satellite observed from 1150\u20133200 \u00c5. Ground-based observations can go down to about 3000 \u00c5 with some difficulty. \n\nSo if 3000 is the cutoff, then z ~1.46. The options have 1.9 as the first possible answer. Since 1.46 is the lower limit, but not an option, the answer must be D (1.9) because it's the first option where the cloud's redshift is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's emission has to be in the optical as well? But that's not necessary. The quasar could be at a much higher redshift. The key is the absorption line's observed wavelength. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of redshift. Let me confirm the formula. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = (1+z) * \u03bb_rest. The rest wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength must be \u2265 3000 \u00c5. So solving for z gives the required minimum z. \n\nYes, that's right. So the answer must be D)1.9. \n\nWait, but why is option B)1.2 present? If someone thought the cutoff is higher, like 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2=2675 \u00c5, which is below 3000, so that's not in the optical. So 1.2 is too low. \n\nSo the correct answer is D)1.9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using 1+z = 3000/1216 \u22482.466, so z\u22481.466, which is approximately 1.5, but the closest option is 1.9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength must be in the optical. So yes, the calculation is right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D)1.9.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their absorption at Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, the question mentions that the absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is an ultraviolet line, right? Because the Lyman series is in the UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the Earth's atmosphere blocks it. Oh right, so the key here is that the observed wavelength must be in the optical range for the telescope to detect it. \n\nSo the idea is that the original wavelength of Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms (which is UV), but when the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets redshifted. The redshift z causes the observed wavelength to be lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). \n\nThe optical window for ground telescopes is roughly from about 3000 Angstroms to around 11000 Angstroms (or maybe up to 1 micron, which is 10,000 angstroms). Wait, but the exact range might be considered here. Since the atmosphere blocks most UV, the optical part that can be observed starts at around 300 nm (3000 angstroms), so the observed wavelength after redshift must be above that. \n\nSo the absorption line's wavelength when observed must be in the optical range. The original Lyman alpha is 1216 \u00c5, so to get into the optical (say, 3000 \u00c5 or higher), the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >= 3000. Let me write that equation:\n\n1216*(1 + z) \u2265 3000\n\nSolving for z:\n\n1 + z \u2265 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.466\n\nSo z \u2265 ~1.466. \n\nLooking at the options, the lower limit would be the smallest z that meets this. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. \n\nWait, 1.466 is approximately 1.5. So the lower limit is around 1.5. So the options given have B as 1.2 which is lower, so that's too low. D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.5. The question asks for the lower limit such that they CAN be detected. So if z is at least 1.5, then the wavelength would be in the optical. So the minimal z needed is ~1.5. So the lower limit would be 1.5. But the options don't have 1.5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the maximum wavelength that can be observed. Wait, the atmosphere is transparent in the optical, but up to about 1 micron (10000 \u00c5). But the problem is the original Lyman alpha is at 1216 \u00c5, which is UV. The absorption is observed when the wavelength is redshifted into the optical. So the redshift has to be enough so that the original 1216 \u00c5 is shifted into the optical range (so that the telescope can see it). \n\nAlternatively, the absorption occurs at the rest-frame Lyman alpha wavelength, but because of redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff. \n\nThe cutoff for UV is around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the observed wavelength must be at least 3000 \u00c5. \n\nSo solving 1216*(1+z) = 3000 gives z \u2248 (3000/1216) -1 \u2248 1.466. So any z above that would work. The question asks for the lower limit. So the minimal z where it's just possible. So the lower limit is approximately 1.466. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value than this is 1.9 (D) or 2.4 (C). Wait, but the lower limit would be the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer must be the smallest z that meets the condition. The options given have B as 1.2 which is below that, so the minimal z required is ~1.5. So the lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer is the first option that is equal or higher than 1.466. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), so the minimal possible answer here is 1.9? Wait, but that's higher than needed. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". So the lower limit would be the smallest redshift that allows detection. So if the required z is ~1.5, then any z above that can be detected. The lower limit is 1.5, so the minimal redshift needed is ~1.5. The options given don't have that exactly, so which one is the first option that is above that? The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), so 1.9 is higher than 1.5, so the lower limit is 1.5. But since the options are given, maybe the answer is D (1.9) is the lower limit? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher? Let me check the optical window again. The Earth's atmosphere blocks all wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so the optical starts at around 300 nm. But maybe the exact cutoff is a bit lower? For example, maybe some UV is visible near 300 nm but not much. So the calculation is correct. The required z is ~1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47, so any z above that is okay. The question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So the minimal z required is ~1.5. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9). Wait, but 1.2 is below the required z, so that would not be detected. The first option that meets the requirement is 1.9 (since 1.9 is higher than 1.47). So the lower limit is 1.9? Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection. The minimal z is 1.47. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering another cutoff?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Lyman alpha line is actually at 1215.67 \u00c5. Let me recalculate with that. 1215.67*(1+z) = 3000. So 3000/1215.67 \u2248 2.467, so z \u22481.467. So the same as before. So the minimal z is ~1.467. The options given are 1.2 (B) and 1.9 (D). So the lower limit must be the smallest z value that is acceptable, so the minimal possible z that allows detection is ~1.467. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is looking for the smallest among the given options that is higher than this value. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So D is 1.9 which is higher than 1.467, so that would be a possible lower limit. Wait, but the lower limit would be the minimal z required, so the correct answer must be the first option that is above the required value. Since 1.9 is the first one above 1.47, so D is the correct answer. But the options also have C)2.4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is higher? Let me think again. Maybe the atmosphere allows some UV down to 300 nm, but maybe for practical purposes, the optical telescopes can go down to like 320 nm (3200 \u00c5) or so. Let me see. Suppose the cutoff is 3200 \u00c5. Then 3200/1216 \u2248 2.63, so z\u22481.63. So the minimal z is ~1.63. Then the answer would still be D (1.9) as the first option above that. Alternatively, maybe the atmospheric cutoff is at 3650 \u00c5 (like the hydrogen Lyman limit?), but that's higher. Wait, the Lyman limit is at 912 \u00c5, but that's the point where the atmosphere is completely opaque. But the atmosphere starts to let some light through at longer wavelengths. The exact cutoff for ground-based observations might be around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the telescope can only observe up to a certain wavelength. Wait, no, the problem is that the original line is in UV. The redshifted wavelength must be in the optical. So the minimal z is 1.46. The options given are B (1.2) which is below, so that's insufficient. The next is D (1.9). So the lower limit must be 1.9? Wait, but the lower limit is the minimum redshift required. So the minimal z is ~1.46, so any z above that can be detected. The question is asking for the lower limit such that they CAN be detected. So the lower limit is the minimal z where it's possible. Since the options don't have 1.46, but D is 1.9 which is higher than that. Wait, but the answer options might be using a different cutoff. For instance, maybe the optical is considered up to 1 micron, but the question is about the lower limit. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nWait, redshift formula: the observed wavelength is (1+z) times the emitted wavelength. Wait, the quasars emit the light, and the clouds are in between, so the absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of the hydrogen (Lyman alpha 1216 \u00c5) but redshifted by the cloud's redshift. Wait, actually, the redshift here is the redshift of the absorbing cloud. Because the absorption happens when the light from the quasar passes through the cloud. The quasar's light has its own redshift, but the absorption is at the rest frame of the cloud. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z_cloud) times the rest wavelength (1216 \u00c5). \n\nTherefore, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range (above 3000 \u00c5) to be detected. So the calculation is correct. So the minimal z_cloud is ~1.466. The options given are B (1.2) which is too low, D (1.9) is higher. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the minimal z needed. Since the options don't have 1.5, perhaps the answer is the smallest option that is above this value. The options are B (1.2), D (1.9), C (2.4). So D is the first one above 1.46. So the lower limit would be D. Because if the cloud's redshift is 1.9, then it can be detected. But a cloud with z=1.5 would also be detected, but since that's not an option, the minimal among the options given would be D. Wait, but the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of the objects such that they can be detected\". The lower limit is the smallest redshift that allows detection. But in that case, the correct lower limit is ~1.46, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest wavelength. Wait, the Lyman alpha is the emission line of the quasar? Or the absorption line from the cloud. The question says \"neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength ~1216 Angstrom\". So the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength of the cloud's rest frame. So the observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. So the observed wavelength must be in the optical. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check if the question is about the redshift of the quasar or the cloud. The question says \"the redshift of this objects\" (probably a typo, should be \"objects\" but maybe \"object\", referring to the clouds). So the redshift of the cloud must be such that their absorption line is in the optical. Therefore, the minimal z_cloud is ~1.46. The options given don't have that, so the next possible is D (1.9). But why is 2.4 an option? Let me see. Let's see what 2.4 would give: 1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4=4134.4 \u00c5, which is in the optical. But the minimal required is ~1.46. So the lower limit is the minimal z that allows detection. Since 1.9 is higher than the required, but the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z where detection is possible. The lower limit would be the minimal z, so the correct answer is the smallest z among the options that is above 1.46. The options are B (1.2 <1.46), D (1.9>1.46), so D is the first one. Therefore the answer is D)1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects using the quasar's redshift? Wait, the quasar is the background object. The absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216. So the calculation is correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is higher? Like 4000 angstroms? Let's see: 4000/1216 \u22483.29, so z\u22482.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be higher? Because maybe the atmosphere is more opaque below 400 nm (4000 \u00c5). Let me check the atmospheric transmission. The Earth's atmosphere allows some UV down to about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), but the transmission is not great. However, ground-based observations of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies are done in the optical when the redshift is sufficient. For example, Lyman alpha at 1216 \u00c5 needs to be shifted into the optical (say, ~350 nm is still UV but maybe detectable with some filters?), but perhaps the standard optical telescopes are limited to ~4000 \u00c5? Wait, no, 400 nm is 4000 \u00c5. So the cutoff is around there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the optical is from 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5. Let's see: if the cutoff is 4000 \u00c5, then z = (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. So then the minimal z is ~2.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be 4000? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. Wait, but the quasar's redshift would be higher than the cloud's, since the cloud is between us and the quasar. The absorption redshift z_cloud is less than the quasar's redshift z_qso. But the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the clouds) so that they can be detected. So the cloud's redshift must be such that their absorption line is in the optical. So the calculation remains as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the observed wavelength must be within the optical window of the telescope's instruments. For example, if the telescope can only observe down to 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), then the required z would be (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. Then the answer would be C (2.4). \n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The standard optical window is considered to start at around 300 nm (3000 \u00c5). So the calculation gives z ~1.46. The options have 1.9 and 2.4. Since 1.9 is higher than 1.46, but 2.4 is even higher. So why is 2.4 an option? Maybe the problem is using the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5) as the rest wavelength? Wait, no. The absorption is at Lyman alpha. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the entire Lyman series is blocked except for Lyman alpha? Or maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 \u00c5, but when redshifted, the observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff (say 3000 \u00c5). So the calculation is correct. So the minimal z is ~1.46. Since the options are given, perhaps the answer is D (1.9) because the question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the minimal z where it can be detected. Since 1.2 is too low (can't be detected), the lower limit would be the next one which is 1.9? Or is the lower limit the minimal z that allows detection, so the answer should be the first option that meets the requirement. Since 1.46 is the actual lower limit, but since it's not listed, the next possible answer is D (1.9). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate 3000 divided by 1216:\n\n3000 / 1216 = ?\n\n1216 * 2 = 2432. 3000 - 2432 = 568. 568 / 1216 = ~0.466. So total is 2.466. So z = 1.466. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the minimal z is ~1.46. The options given are:\n\nA)3\n\nB)1.2\n\nC)2.4\n\nD)1.9\n\nSo the closest lower limit that is higher than 1.46 is D (1.9). Since the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected, that would be the minimal z required. Since 1.46 isn't an option, perhaps the question expects the next possible value, which is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is being observed, so the observed wavelength of the quasar must also be in the optical. Wait, but the absorption is at the cloud's redshift. The quasar's own redshift would be higher than the cloud's, but that doesn't affect the absorption line's detectability. The absorption line's observed wavelength must be in the optical, which is determined by the cloud's redshift. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D)1.9. But wait, the calculation gives ~1.46. Let me see the options again. The options include 1.9 and 2.4. The question asks for the lower limit. The lower limit is the smallest z where it can be detected, so if 1.46 is the minimum, then any z above that can be detected. Therefore, the lower limit is 1.46. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is considering the optical to start at a higher wavelength. Let's see what 1.9 gives: 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526.4 \u00c5, which is in the optical. So that works. If the question is asking for the lower limit, the minimal z that allows detection, then the correct answer is the first option that meets the condition. Since 1.9 is the first option above the required 1.46, then D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me see: 4000 /1216 \u22483.29, so z=2.29. Then the closest option is C (2.4). But why would the cutoff be 4000? Maybe I should think that the optical is considered to start at 400 nm (4000 \u00c5), which is more standard. Let me check: the optical spectrum is typically considered from ~400 nm (violet) to ~700 nm (red). But the atmosphere allows some UV down to ~300 nm. However, many ground-based telescopes have instruments that are optimized for the visible spectrum starting at around 400 nm. So perhaps the question assumes that the optical starts at 4000 \u00c5. \n\nIn that case, the required z would be (4000/1216)-1 \u2248 2.29. So the answer would be C (2.4). \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. I need to think which is more likely. \n\nThe problem says \"optical ground-based telescopes\". The optical window for ground-based observations includes wavelengths from about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5) to 1 micron (10000 \u00c5). But some sources say that the visible spectrum is 400-700 nm. However, in astronomy, the optical can sometimes be considered to include near-UV (300-400 nm) as well, depending on the telescope's capabilities. \n\nIf the problem uses 3000 \u00c5 as the cutoff, then the answer is D (1.9). If it uses 4000 \u00c5, then C (2.4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook problem that uses 4000 \u00c5. Let me think of standard problems. For example, the Lyman alpha forest: the absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at high redshift. The Lyman alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra. The forest is seen at redshifts z < z_qso. The observed wavelength must be in the optical. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. So to get into the optical (say, 3000 \u00c5), then (1+z)=3000/1216 \u2192 z\u22481.5. So the minimal redshift of the cloud is ~1.5. Therefore the lower limit is about 1.5. The options given have D as 1.9, which is higher than that. \n\nPerhaps the question expects the answer to be 1.9 because 1+z = 3000/1216 \u22482.466, so z\u22481.466, which rounds to ~1.5, but since that's not an option, the closest higher option is 1.9? Or maybe the question uses a different wavelength cutoff. Wait, maybe the question is using 4000 \u00c5 as the cutoff. Let me see:\n\nIf cutoff is 4000:\n\n4000/1216 \u22483.29 \u2192 z=2.29 \u2192 closest is 2.4 (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using 5000 \u00c5 as the cutoff (500 nm), then:\n\n5000/1216\u22484.11 \u2192 z\u22483.11 \u2192 which is close to A)3. \n\nHmm, but then why would the cutoff be 5000?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Earth's atmosphere is completely opaque below 3650 \u00c5 (the ozone layer cutoff?), but that's 365 nm. \n\nWait, the ozone layer absorbs wavelengths below 290 nm, but allows some UV through above that. The exact cutoff for practical observations might vary. For example, the IUE satellite observed from 1150\u20133200 \u00c5. Ground-based observations can go down to about 3000 \u00c5 with some difficulty. \n\nSo if 3000 is the cutoff, then z ~1.46. The options have 1.9 as the first possible answer. Since 1.46 is the lower limit, but not an option, the answer must be D (1.9) because it's the first option where the cloud's redshift is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the quasar's emission has to be in the optical as well? But that's not necessary. The quasar could be at a much higher redshift. The key is the absorption line's observed wavelength. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of redshift. Let me confirm the formula. The observed wavelength \u03bb_obs = (1+z) * \u03bb_rest. The rest wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength must be \u2265 3000 \u00c5. So solving for z gives the required minimum z. \n\nYes, that's right. So the answer must be D)1.9. \n\nWait, but why is option B)1.2 present? If someone thought the cutoff is higher, like 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2=2675 \u00c5, which is below 3000, so that's not in the optical. So 1.2 is too low. \n\nSo the correct answer is D)1.9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using 1+z = 3000/1216 \u22482.466, so z\u22481.466, which is approximately 1.5, but the closest option is 1.9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The absorption occurs at the cloud's redshift. The observed wavelength must be in the optical. So yes, the calculation is right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D)1.9.\n\n\nThe question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their absorption at Lyman alpha (1216 \u00c5) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths longer than ~3000 \u00c5 (300 nm), as shorter wavelengths are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere. The observed wavelength of the absorption line must therefore be at least 3000 \u00c5. \n\nUsing the redshift formula, the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z) \\), we set \\( \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\geq 3000 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\):\n\n\\[\n1216 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\times (1 + z) \\geq 3000 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + z \\geq \\frac{3000}{1216} \\approx 2.466 \\implies z \\geq 1.466\n\\]\n\nThe calculated lower limit is approximately \\( z = 1.47 \\). Among the options, the smallest value greater than this limit is **D) 1.9**. Options B (1.2) and lower are insufficient, while options C (2.4) and A (3) are higher but not the minimal required.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Hmm, right, Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum because 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nanometers, which is UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV because of the Earth's atmosphere absorbing it. So the idea is that the absorption line has to be redshifted into the visible range for the telescope to detect it.\n\nSo the key here is figuring out the minimum redshift required so that the original wavelength (1216 \u00c5) gets redshifted into the optical window. The visible light range for telescopes is roughly 400-700 nm (or 4000-7000 Angstroms). So the redshifted wavelength (lambda_observed) must be at least 4000 Angstroms to be detectable.\n\nThe formula for redshift z is given by (lambda_observed - lambda_rest)/lambda_rest = z. So rearranged, lambda_observed = lambda_rest*(1+z). We need lambda_observed >= 4000 \u00c5. The rest wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: 4000 = 1216*(1+z). Solving for z: (4000/1216) -1 = z. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 times 3 is 3648. 4000 minus 3648 is 352, so 352/1216 is approximately 0.289. So total z would be 3 + 0.289? Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, 4000/1216 is exactly?\n\nLet me compute 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see:\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000-3648 = 352. So 352/1216 = 0.2896. So the total is 3.2896? Wait no, wait. Wait, the division is 4000/1216 = 3.2896? Wait, 1216 \u00d7 3.2896 \u2248 4000. So then z = (4000/1216) -1 = 3.2896 -1 = 2.2896. Approximately 2.29. So the lower limit would be around 2.29. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So the closest would be 2.4 (option C) as the lower limit? Because the calculation gives about 2.29, so the lower limit is just over 2.29. So the minimum z needed is about 2.29, so the lower limit must be that. So the question is asking for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So if the redshift is at least that value, then the absorption line would be in the optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. The options given are 2.4 (C), which is higher than that. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optical window is considered to start at 300 nm? Wait, no. The atmosphere blocks most UV below around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), so visible light starts at ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So the calculation is correct. Let me check again: 1216*(1+z) >= 4000. So (1+z) >= 4000/1216 \u2248 3.289. So z \u2248 2.289. So the lower limit is z \u22482.29. The options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.29 is between B and C. The question asks for the lower limit. So if the redshift must be at least ~2.29, then the lower limit is 2.29. But since the options are discrete, the next possible option is C)2.4. Because 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so that's the lower limit. Because if the redshift is 2.4, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(3.4) = 1216*3.4. Let me check that: 1216*3 is 3648, plus 1216*0.4 = 486.4, so total 4134.4 \u00c5. That's within the optical. So at z=2.4, it's detectable. But if the redshift is 2.29, the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 \u00c5. But maybe the telescope's optical capability is up to, say, 4000 \u00c5? Or maybe they need a bit more? Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Let me compute 4000/1216 exactly. Let me compute 4000 divided by 1216.\n\nLet me do this division more precisely. 1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 = (352 \u00f7 1216) = 0.2896. So the total is 3.2896, so z = 2.2896. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. The options given are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). Since the question is about the lower limit, the minimum z needed is ~2.29. So the lower limit must be that. Since 2.29 is less than 2.4, but the options don't have 2.3 or something. Wait, but perhaps the question is phrased as \"lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected\"\u2014so the redshift must be at least that lower limit. So if the lower limit is ~2.29, then the smallest z that works is just above that. So the options must have the first one that is equal or higher. The options given are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So 2.4 is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4? Or maybe the question expects the calculation to be done with the upper edge of the optical window?\n\nWait, maybe I considered the lower end of the optical (4000 \u00c5), but perhaps the telescope can go a bit lower? Wait, the atmosphere blocks UV below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), so visible light starts at ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So the lower limit is indeed 4000 \u00c5. So the calculation holds. Since the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, meaning the smallest z that allows detection, the minimal z is ~2.29. Since the options are given, the answer must be the first option that is equal or higher than this. So between the options given, the options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). Since 1.9 would give a wavelength of 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9= 3526.4 \u00c5, which is below 4000, so not detectable. 2.4 gives 4134, which is above. So the lower limit must be 2.4? Wait, but the actual required z is ~2.29, so the lower limit would be 2.29. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is looking for an approximate value. Let me see the options again.\n\nThe options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest to the calculated value. So the answer should be C. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the atmospheric cutoff at 3000 \u00c5? Wait, if that were the case, then the required wavelength would be 3000. Let me check that scenario. If the observed wavelength must be above 3000 \u00c5, then 3000/1216 = 2.466, so z =1.466? But that's not an option. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the optical window up to 700 nm (7000 \u00c5), but that's the upper end. The lower end is the critical part here. Since the absorption has to be shifted into the visible, so the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is at the lower end of visible (4000 \u00c5). So the calculation is correct. So the answer is C)2.4. Because 2.4 is the first option higher than the required z of ~2.29. Hence, the lower limit would be 2.4, because anything below that (like 2.2) would not reach the visible range. Wait, no. Wait, if the required z is 2.29, then the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal z needed is ~2.29. The options don't have that, so the answer is the next possible option which is 2.4. So the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The absorption occurs at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. Hmm, right, Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum because 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nanometers, which is UV. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV because of the Earth's atmosphere absorbing it. So the idea is that the absorption line has to be redshifted into the visible range for the telescope to detect it.\n\nSo the key here is figuring out the minimum redshift required so that the original wavelength (1216 \u00c5) gets redshifted into the optical window. The visible light range for telescopes is roughly 400-700 nm (or 4000-7000 Angstroms). So the redshifted wavelength (lambda_observed) must be at least 4000 Angstroms to be detectable.\n\nThe formula for redshift z is given by (lambda_observed - lambda_rest)/lambda_rest = z. So rearranged, lambda_observed = lambda_rest*(1+z). We need lambda_observed >= 4000 \u00c5. The rest wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: 4000 = 1216*(1+z). Solving for z: (4000/1216) -1 = z. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 times 3 is 3648. 4000 minus 3648 is 352, so 352/1216 is approximately 0.289. So total z would be 3 + 0.289? Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, 4000/1216 is exactly?\n\nLet me compute 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see:\n\n1216 \u00d7 3 = 3648. 4000-3648 = 352. So 352/1216 = 0.2896. So the total is 3.2896? Wait no, wait. Wait, the division is 4000/1216 = 3.2896? Wait, 1216 \u00d7 3.2896 \u2248 4000. So then z = (4000/1216) -1 = 3.2896 -1 = 2.2896. Approximately 2.29. So the lower limit would be around 2.29. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So the closest would be 2.4 (option C) as the lower limit? Because the calculation gives about 2.29, so the lower limit is just over 2.29. So the minimum z needed is about 2.29, so the lower limit must be that. So the question is asking for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So if the redshift is at least that value, then the absorption line would be in the optical. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. The options given are 2.4 (C), which is higher than that. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optical window is considered to start at 300 nm? Wait, no. The atmosphere blocks most UV below around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), so visible light starts at ~400 nm (4000 \u00c5). So the calculation is correct. Let me check again: 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds in deep space that can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The question mentions that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall what redshift means here. Redshift (z) is a measure of how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. The higher the redshift, the further away the object is, and the more the wavelength has been stretched.\n\nThe key here is the Lyman alpha wavelength. Lyman alpha is the transition of an electron from the first excited state to the ground state in a hydrogen atom, right? The rest wavelength for Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. But since the cloud is moving away from us, the absorption line will be redshifted. The absorption occurs at a wavelength lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). \n\nNow, the problem is about detecting these clouds with ground-based optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can typically observe light in the visible spectrum, which is roughly from about 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). But maybe the upper limit is a bit more? Wait, maybe I should confirm the exact range. Oh, right, the visible spectrum is approximately 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms since 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So the telescope can see up to around 7000 Angstroms. \n\nBut the absorption line's observed wavelength must be within the visible range for the telescope to detect it. The original Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet. Since the Earth's atmosphere blocks most UV light, ground-based telescopes can't observe it directly unless it's redshifted into the visible range. So the absorption line must have a wavelength longer than about 4000 Angstroms (the start of the visible spectrum) when observed. Wait, but maybe the question is considering the lower limit of the telescope's optical capability. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So we need the smallest z such that the absorption line is still within the observable range. Wait, actually, the lower limit would correspond to the minimal redshift where the absorption line is just entering the visible range. Because if the redshift is smaller than that, then the absorption line would be in the UV and not detectable. So the minimal z needed is when the observed wavelength is just at the lower end of what's observable. But perhaps the question is about the upper end? Wait no, maybe the cutoff is at the lower end of visible? Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the absorption occurs at the redshifted Lyman alpha wavelength. The original wavelength is 1216 \u00c5. To be detectable, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range (4000-7000 \u00c5). Therefore, the observed wavelength must be >= 4000 \u00c5 (since anything lower would be UV and blocked by the atmosphere). So solving for z when lambda_observed = 4000 \u00c5:\n\nlambda_observed = 1216*(1+z) = 4000\n\nSo 1+z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. Then z \u2248 2.29. Hmm, but the options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. Wait, 2.29 is closest to 2.4 (option C). But let me check my math again.\n\nLet me calculate 4000 divided by 1216:\n\n4000 / 1216 = let's see: 1216 * 3 = 3648, subtract that from 4000: 352 left. 352/1216 is ~0.289. So total is 3.289. So z = 2.289. So approximately 2.29. The closest option is C) 2.4. But why is that the lower limit?\n\nWait, the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". Wait, lower limit would mean the smallest redshift needed so that the absorption line is just entering the visible range. Because if the redshift were smaller than that, the wavelength would be shorter (UV) and not detectable. So the minimal z required is 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the answer would be C) 2.4. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is at the upper end of the optical range? Like, if the observed wavelength is beyond 7000, then it's infrared, but maybe the telescope can still detect up to longer? But usually, ground-based optical telescopes can go up to around 1 micron (10,000 Angstroms) maybe? Wait, but the question says \"optical\" so probably up to 7000 or 9000? Wait, perhaps the upper limit for optical is 1 micron (10,000 \u00c5). Wait, but that's near-infrared. Maybe the question is considering the visible part only. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere blocks UV below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), but allows optical (400-700 nm). So to be detectable, the absorption must be in the visible or near-IR? Wait, but the question says \"optical\" telescopes, so perhaps the limit is the visible spectrum. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at the lower end of visible (4000 \u00c5). \n\nSo my calculation gives z \u2248 2.29, so the answer should be C) 2.4. Let me check the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another consideration. Wait, the Lyman alpha line itself is at 1216 \u00c5, which is in the UV. For the absorption to be observed, the line must have been redshifted beyond the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5), which is the point where the hydrogen ionizing radiation starts. Wait, but that might not be directly relevant here. Alternatively, the absorption is in the quasar's light. The quasar's light is coming from behind the cloud. The cloud is between us and the quasar. The cloud absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but in the rest frame of the cloud. Since the cloud is moving, the absorption occurs at a redshifted wavelength. Wait, the quasar's light is coming from a higher redshift. The cloud is at a certain redshift, so the absorption occurs at (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength here is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. But the quasar's emitted light has its own redshift. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the absorption occurs at a redshift corresponding to the cloud's own redshift. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. To be detectable by optical telescopes, this wavelength must be in the optical range (4000-7000 \u00c5). So the minimal z_cloud would be when (1+z) * 1216 = 4000. Solving for z gives z \u2248 (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3, so the closest answer is C) 2.4. Therefore, the answer should be C. \n\nAnother way: Let me check the numbers again. 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So 1+z = 4000/1216. Let me compute that exactly. 1216 \u00d7 3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 = 0.289. So 3.289. So z=2.289. So the lower limit is about 2.29, which rounds to 2.3, so the closest option is C (2.4). \n\nYes, that makes sense. The options given don't have 2.3, but 2.4 is the next. So the answer must be C.\n",

So solving for z when lambda_observed = 4000 \u00c5:\n\nlambda_observed = 1216*(1+z) = 4000\n\nSo 1+z = 4000/1216 \u2248 3.29. Then z \u2248 2.29. Hmm, but the options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. Wait, 2.29 is closest to 2.4 (option C). But let me check my math again.\n\nLet me calculate 4000 divided by 1216:\n\n4000 / 1216 = let's see: 1216 * 3 = 3648, subtract that from 4000: 352 left. 352/1216 is ~0.289. So total is 3.289. So z = 2.289. So approximately 2.29. The closest option is C) 2.4. But why is that the lower limit?\n\nWait, the question says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected\". Wait, lower limit would mean the smallest redshift needed so that the absorption line is just entering the visible range. Because if the redshift were smaller than that, the wavelength would be shorter (UV) and not detectable. So the minimal z required is 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the answer would be C) 2.4. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cutoff is at the upper end of the optical range? Like, if the observed wavelength is beyond 7000, then it's infrared, but maybe the telescope can still detect up to longer? But usually, ground-based optical telescopes can go up to around 1 micron (10,000 Angstroms) maybe? Wait, but the question says \"optical\" so probably up to 7000 or 9000? Wait, perhaps the upper limit for optical is 1 micron (10,000 \u00c5). Wait, but that's near-infrared. Maybe the question is considering the visible part only. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of the atmospheric cutoff. The Earth's atmosphere blocks UV below about 300 nm (3000 \u00c5), but allows optical (400-700 nm). So to be detectable, the absorption must be in the visible or near-IR? Wait, but the question says \"optical\" telescopes, so perhaps the limit is the visible spectrum. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is at the lower end of visible (4000 \u00c5). \n\nSo my calculation gives z \u2248 2.29, so the answer should be C) 2.4. Let me check the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.4 is the closest. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another consideration. Wait, the Lyman alpha line itself is at 1216 \u00c5, which is in the UV. For the absorption to be observed, the line must have been redshifted beyond the Lyman limit (912 \u00c5), which is the point where the hydrogen ionizing radiation starts. Wait, but that might not be directly relevant here. Alternatively, the absorption is in the quasar's light. The quasar's light is coming from behind the cloud. The cloud is between us and the quasar. The cloud absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but in the rest frame of the cloud. Since the cloud is moving, the absorption occurs at a redshifted wavelength. Wait, the quasar's light is coming from a higher redshift. The cloud is at a certain redshift, so the absorption occurs at (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. The observed wavelength here is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. But the quasar's emitted light has its own redshift. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the absorption occurs at a redshift corresponding to the cloud's own redshift. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1+z_cloud)*1216 \u00c5. To be detectable by optical telescopes, this wavelength must be in the optical range (4000-7000 \u00c5). So the minimal z_cloud would be when (1+z) * 1216 = 4000. Solving for z gives z \u2248 (4000/1216) -1 \u2248 2.29. So the lower limit is ~2.3, so the closest answer is C) 2.4. Therefore, the answer should be C. \n\nAnother way: Let me check the numbers again. 1216*(1+z) = 4000. So 1+z = 4000/1216. Let me compute that exactly. 1216 \u00d7 3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 = 0.289. So 3.289. So z=2.289. So the lower limit is about 2.29, which rounds to 2.3, so the closest option is C (2.4). \n\nYes, that makes sense. The options given don't have 2.3, but 2.4 is the next. So the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detectable with optical telescopes, we consider the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 \u00c5) redshifted into the visible spectrum (4000\u20137000 \u00c5). The observed wavelength must be at least 4000 \u00c5 to avoid atmospheric absorption of ultraviolet light. Using the redshift formula:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{observed}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z)\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(\\lambda_{\\text{observed}} = 4000\\) \u00c5 and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} = 1216\\) \u00c5:\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{4000}{1216} \\approx 3.289 \\implies z \\approx 2.289\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to 2.29 is **C) 2.4**. This represents the minimal redshift required for the absorption line to enter the optical range. \n\nAnswer: C",
