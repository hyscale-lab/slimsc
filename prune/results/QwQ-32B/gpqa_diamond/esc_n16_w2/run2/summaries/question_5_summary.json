      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators for particles like muons (which are spin-1/2 particles) are similar to those for electrons. The operators P_x, P_y, P_z are probably analogous to the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. Let me check the given matrices to confirm.\n\nThe problem states that P_x is (\u0127/2) times a matrix with first row [0 1] and second row [1 0]. That looks exactly like the Pauli-X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli-Y matrix (since the off-diagonal elements are 0, -i and i, 0), and P_z is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli-Z matrix. So the operator P here is the Pauli spin operator scaled by \u0127/2, right?\n\nThe question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Let me recall how to find eigenvectors for such operators along an arbitrary direction. \n\nAn arbitrary direction in the x-z plane can be represented by a unit vector n with angles \u03b8 and \u03c6, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 might be fixed? Wait, actually in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. But since it's in the x-z plane, the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So \u03c6 would be either 0 or \u03c0/2? Wait, maybe \u03c6 is fixed here. Let me think: in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be written as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So the direction is determined by \u03b8. \n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction n would be given by the dot product of P (the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2) with the unit vector n. So the operator P_n is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, P_n = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.\n\nGiven that, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2)(n_x * \u03c3_x + n_z * \u03c3_z). We need to find its eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nLet me write this operator explicitly. Let me denote n_x and n_z. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, we have n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me let \u03b8 be the angle between the direction and the z-axis, so n_z = cos\u03b8 and n_x = sin\u03b8 (since the angle from z-axis is \u03b8). So substituting, the operator becomes (\u0127/2)(sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x + cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z).\n\nNow, the eigenvectors of \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z are known. But here it's a combination. To find the eigenvectors of this operator, perhaps I can write the matrix form and then solve the eigenvalue equation.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo substituting into the operator P_n:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute the matrix:\n\nFirst term (sin\u03b8 * \u03c3_x):\n\nsin\u03b8 * [0 1; 1 0] = [ [0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0] ]\n\nSecond term (cos\u03b8 * \u03c3_z):\n\ncos\u03b8 * [1 0; 0 -1] = [ [cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nThen multiply by \u0127/2, so the full operator matrix is (\u0127/2) times that matrix.\n\nWe need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let me set up the equation:\n\n(P_n - \u03bb I) v = 0, where \u03bb is \u0127/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nThe matrix (\u0127/2)( [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]) - (\u0127/2) * I = (\u0127/2)[ [cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1] ]\n\nSet determinant to zero, but since we already know the eigenvalue is correct, perhaps we can just find the eigenvectors.\n\nLet me write the equation (P_n - (\u0127/2)I) v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix part is:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8)\n\n(sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1)\n\nLet me factor out the \u0127/2, which doesn't affect the eigenvector direction. So the matrix equation is:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1] ] * [v1; v2] = 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v2 = 0\n\nThese are two equations but they should be dependent, so we can use one of them. Let me take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \u2192 sin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \u2192 v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1\n\nHmm, let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8. Recall that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2). So substituting:\n\n(2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1; tan(\u03b8/2) v1] = v1 [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is v1\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = v1\u00b2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So set this to 1, so |v1| = cos(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)], since tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2). So multiplying by cos(\u03b8/2) gives the components as cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nSuppose the eigenvector is [v1; v2]. From above, v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1. Let me compute that:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)]/[2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2). So v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is proportional to [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is (1)^2 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 + tan\u00b2 = sec\u00b2, so the norm is sec(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized vector is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBecause:\n\n[1 / sec(\u03b8/2); tan(\u03b8/2)/sec(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is option C. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Wait, but the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 isn't mentioned here. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, maybe the phase could be involved. Wait, but in our calculation, there's no phase because the direction is in x-z plane, so maybe the eigenvector is real?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The operator P_n we constructed has real entries because the direction is along x-z. Because \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z are real matrices, so when combined with real coefficients (since n_x and n_z are real), the resulting matrix is real. Therefore, the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. So the eigenvector components would be real numbers. Therefore, the option C is real, and B has a phase factor e^{i\u03c6}, which might not be necessary here. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\". The direction in the x-z plane doesn't have a y-component, so the angle \u03c6 (the azimuthal angle) is either 0 or \u03c0, but since it's arbitrary in the x-z plane, perhaps the angle \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, so \u03c6 is fixed here. Therefore, the eigenvector should not have any phase factor, so option C is correct.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Hmm, but \u03b8 here might not be the same as the angle I used. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle definitions. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is parameterized differently. Let me think again. Suppose the direction vector is in the x-z plane. Let me represent it as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Then, when constructing the operator P_n, the components are n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. So my earlier approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option C. But wait, another thought: in some conventions, the eigenvectors for the spin along an arbitrary direction might be written with a different parameterization. Let me recall that for spin-1/2, the eigenstate along a direction n can be written as:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the direction. But in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so e^{i\u03c6} would be 1 or -1. However, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is fixed to 0 (if in the x-z plane and above the x-axis) or \u03c0 (if pointing in the negative x direction?), but maybe the problem just uses \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis, so the \u03c6 is zero. In that case, the phase would be 1, so the eigenvector would indeed be [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem uses a different parameterization where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis, but I don't think so. Since the problem states \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\", and typically \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, so the standard parametrization holds. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C. Let me check the options again. Option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B has a phase factor e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, but \u03b8 there might be a different angle. Since the problem doesn't mention \u03c6, but the direction is in x-z plane, so the phase isn't needed here. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by plugging into the matrix equation.\n\nSuppose the eigenvector is [a; b] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]. Let's plug into the equation (P_n - \u0127/2 I) v = 0.\n\nThe matrix of P_n - \u0127/2 I is (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]]. Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is P_n v = (\u0127/2) v. So:\n\nLet me compute P_n v = (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] [a; b]\n\nWhich should equal (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nSo:\n\nFirst component: (\u0127/2)( cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b ) = (\u0127/2)a \u2192 cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1)a + sin\u03b8 b =0\n\nSecond component: (\u0127/2)( sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b ) = (\u0127/2) b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0\n\nSo these equations must hold. Let me substitute a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nFirst equation: (cos\u03b8 -1) cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) ?\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ncos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[ -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] * cos(\u03b8/2) + [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] * sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\nFirst term: -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond term: 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nAdding them: (-2 + 2) sin\u00b2 cos = 0. So that works.\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nAgain, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\n= 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 0.\n\nPerfect, so it works. So the eigenvector is indeed [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)] which is option C. So I think that's correct. The other options either have incorrect factors of \u0127, which the question mentions the eigenvector elements, but the options A and D have \u0127 terms, but the eigenvectors should be dimensionless (since they're normalized vectors in Hilbert space). The question says \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\" so the answer must not have \u0127. So options A and D can be eliminated. Option B has a phase, which we don't need here since the direction is in x-z plane. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.

So substituting:\n\n(2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as [v1; tan(\u03b8/2) v1] = v1 [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is v1\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = v1\u00b2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2). So set this to 1, so |v1| = cos(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)], since tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2). So multiplying by cos(\u03b8/2) gives the components as cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nSuppose the eigenvector is [v1; v2]. From above, v2 = ( (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ) v1. Let me compute that:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)]/[2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2). So v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is proportional to [1; tan(\u03b8/2)].\n\nTo normalize, the norm squared is (1)^2 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1 + tan\u00b2 = sec\u00b2, so the norm is sec(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized vector is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nBecause:\n\n[1 / sec(\u03b8/2); tan(\u03b8/2)/sec(\u03b8/2)] = [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)].\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which is option C. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Wait, but the problem mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so \u03c6 isn't mentioned here. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, maybe the phase could be involved. Wait, but in our calculation, there's no phase because the direction is in x-z plane, so maybe the eigenvector is real?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The operator P_n we constructed has real entries because the direction is along x-z. Because \u03c3_x and \u03c3_z are real matrices, so when combined with real coefficients (since n_x and n_z are real), the resulting matrix is real. Therefore, the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. So the eigenvector components would be real numbers. Therefore, the option C is real, and B has a phase factor e^{i\u03c6}, which might not be necessary here. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\". The direction in the x-z plane doesn't have a y-component, so the angle \u03c6 (the azimuthal angle) is either 0 or \u03c0, but since it's arbitrary in the x-z plane, perhaps the angle \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, so \u03c6 is fixed here. Therefore, the eigenvector should not have any phase factor, so option C is correct.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). Hmm, but \u03b8 here might not be the same as the angle I used. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle definitions. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is parameterized differently. Let me think again. Suppose the direction vector is in the x-z plane. Let me represent it as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Then, when constructing the operator P_n, the components are n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. So my earlier approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option C. But wait, another thought: in some conventions, the eigenvectors for the spin along an arbitrary direction might be written with a different parameterization. Let me recall that for spin-1/2, the eigenstate along a direction n can be written as:\n\n|+> = [ cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2) ]\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the direction. But in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so e^{i\u03c6} would be 1 or -1. However, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is fixed to 0 (if in the x-z plane and above the x-axis) or \u03c0 (if pointing in the negative x direction?), but maybe the problem just uses \u03b8 as the angle from the z-axis, so the \u03c6 is zero. In that case, the phase would be 1, so the eigenvector would indeed be [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem uses a different parameterization where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis, but I don't think so. Since the problem states \"arbitrary direction in the x-z plane\", and typically \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, so the standard parametrization holds. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C. Let me check the options again. Option C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches. Option B has a phase factor e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, but \u03b8 there might be a different angle. Since the problem doesn't mention \u03c6, but the direction is in x-z plane, so the phase isn't needed here. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by plugging into the matrix equation.\n\nSuppose the eigenvector is [a; b] = [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]. Let's plug into the equation (P_n - \u0127/2 I) v = 0.\n\nThe matrix of P_n - \u0127/2 I is (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[cos\u03b8 -1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 -1]]. Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is P_n v = (\u0127/2) v. So:\n\nLet me compute P_n v = (\u0127/2) [ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] [a; b]\n\nWhich should equal (\u0127/2) [a; b]\n\nSo:\n\nFirst component: (\u0127/2)( cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b ) = (\u0127/2)a \u2192 cos\u03b8 a + sin\u03b8 b = a \u2192 (cos\u03b8 -1)a + sin\u03b8 b =0\n\nSecond component: (\u0127/2)( sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b ) = (\u0127/2) b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - cos\u03b8 b = b \u2192 sin\u03b8 a - (cos\u03b8 +1) b =0\n\nSo these equations must hold. Let me substitute a = cos(\u03b8/2), b = sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nFirst equation: (cos\u03b8 -1) cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) ?\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\ncos\u03b8 -1 = -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[ -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] * cos(\u03b8/2) + [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) ] * sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\nFirst term: -2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond term: 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nAdding them: (-2 + 2) sin\u00b2 cos = 0. So that works.\n\nSecond equation: sin\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) - (cos\u03b8 +1) sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nAgain, sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\ncos\u03b8 +1 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) - 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) * sin(\u03b8/2 )\n\n= 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) - 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 0.\n\nPerfect, so it works. So the eigenvector is indeed [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)] which is option C. So I think that's correct. The other options either have incorrect factors of \u0127, which the question mentions the eigenvector elements, but the options A and D have \u0127 terms, but the eigenvectors should be dimensionless (since they're normalized vectors in Hilbert space). The question says \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\" so the answer must not have \u0127. So options A and D can be eliminated. Option B has a phase, which we don't need here since the direction is in x-z plane. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$, we start by noting that the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ correspond to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\\hbar/2$. Since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its components are $n_x = \\sin\\theta$ and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is:\n\n\\[\nP_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z \\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$, the matrix form of $P_n$ becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe seek the eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ satisfying $P_n \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This leads to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\cos\\theta - 1 \\right)v_1 + \\sin\\theta v_2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$, we find $v_2 = \\tan(\\theta/2) v_1$. Normalizing the eigenvector, we set $v_1 = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $v_2 = \\sin(\\theta/2)$, yielding the normalized eigenvector:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis matches **Option C**. Options A and D include $\\hbar$, which is incorrect as eigenvectors are dimensionless. Option B introduces a phase $e^{i\\phi}$, unnecessary here since $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (no azimuthal angle $\\phi$).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The question gives me the matrices for the X, Y, and Z components of P. Hmm, let me start by recalling some quantum mechanics here.\n\nFirst, I remember that operators like this, especially in the context of spin, often use the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2. Let me check the given components. The P_x matrix is (0 1;1 0) times \u0127/2. That's exactly the Pauli-X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_y is (0 -i; i 0) scaled by \u0127/2, which is the Pauli-Y. And P_z is diagonal (1, -1) scaled by \u0127/2, so Pauli-Z. So P must be the spin operator for the muon, analogous to the electron's spin operators. So the problem is about finding the eigenstate of the spin component along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSince the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) might be zero or something, but maybe it's better to define it properly. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, a direction in x-z plane would have phi = 0 (along x) or phi = \u03c0 (along -x), but generally, since it's in x-z, maybe the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, but without phi component. Wait, maybe I should parametrize the direction n in terms of theta, where theta is the angle between n and the z-axis. Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction can be specified by theta, the polar angle, and phi=0 or pi, but maybe we can just consider theta as the angle from z-axis, so the direction vector n would have components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the operator P along direction n would be a combination of P_x and P_z, since the y-component is zero?\n\nRight. The general operator for spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u0127/2)|v>. \n\nLet me denote the direction vector n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. So the operator P_n becomes:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(P_x) + (cos\u03b8)(P_z)\n\nSubstituting the given matrices:\n\nEach P component is already multiplied by \u0127/2, so let me write them out.\n\nP_x = (\u0127/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nP_z = (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2)[ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute the matrix inside the brackets first. \n\nThe matrix for P_n would be:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nCalculating each element:\n\nTop left: 0*sin\u03b8 + 1*cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8\n\nTop right: 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom left: 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom right: 0*sin\u03b8 + (-1)*cos\u03b8 = -cos\u03b8\n\nSo the entire P_n matrix is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the matrix:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2)*M * v = (\u0127/2)*v, where M is the matrix above. Wait, actually the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So the equation is:\n\nP_n * v = (+\u0127/2) * v\n\nDividing both sides by \u0127/2, we get:\n\nM * v = v \n\nWait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2 M) v = (\u0127/2) v. So indeed, (M v) = v. So the eigenvalue for the matrix M (without the \u0127/2 factor) is 1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of matrix M with eigenvalue 1. \n\nSo let's write the matrix equation:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = 1 * [v1; v2]\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange both equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1\n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + (sin\u03b8) v2 = 0\n\n2. (sin\u03b8)v1 + (- (cos\u03b8 +1)) v2 =0\n\nWe can write this as a homogeneous system. Since the equations must be consistent, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero (but since we already know it's an eigenvalue, that's satisfied). \n\nWe can solve one of the equations. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nLet me solve for v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\n=> v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nHmm, note that (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 is equal to tan(\u03b8/2). Because using the identity:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)]\n\nAlternatively, let me write the eigenvector as [v1; tan(\u03b8/2) v1]. To normalize it, the magnitude should be 1. Let me compute the normalization factor.\n\nLet the vector be [v1, v2]^T, with v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. Then:\n\n|v1|\u00b2 + |v2|\u00b2 = |v1|\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = |v1|\u00b2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) =1 \n\nSo |v1| = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus, choosing v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nWait, that's exactly option C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2))\n\nOption B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8), but phi is not mentioned here. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but maybe the phase could be involved. Wait, the problem didn't specify any phase, but since the y-component is zero, perhaps the eigenvector doesn't have a phase factor. Alternatively, maybe in the general case, if the direction had a y-component, there would be a phase. But here, since n is in x-z plane, phi=0, so e^{i phi} would be 1, so option B would become (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). But the answer I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. \n\nHmm, let me verify again. Let me go through the steps once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the matrix M:\n\n[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8\n\n sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]\n\nWe set up (M - I) v =0:\n\nFirst row: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2=0\n\nIf I take the first equation, and express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nv2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1 = tan(theta/2) v1. \n\nThen the eigenvector is [v1, tan(theta/2) v1]^T. Normalizing:\n\nThe norm squared is v1^2 (1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)) = v1^2 sec\u00b2(theta/2) \n\nSet equal to 1, so v1 = cos(theta/2). Therefore, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if the other option B could also be possible. The question mentions \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so theta here is the angle from z-axis. But sometimes the parametrization uses theta as the angle from the north pole (z-axis), so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard parametrization for spin uses a different angle. Wait, sometimes the spin eigenstates along an axis are given in terms of theta/2. For example, the standard spin-up along the z-axis is [1;0], which would correspond to theta=0 here. Plugging theta=0 into option C gives [cos(0), sin(0)] = [1,0], which is correct. If theta is 180 degrees (pi), then the direction is opposite z. Then theta/2 is pi/2, so cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the eigenvector would be [0,1], which is the spin-down state along z, but since we are looking for eigenvalue +\u0127/2, that's correct for the direction pointing opposite to z. Wait, actually, if the direction is opposite z (theta=pi), then the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the state [0,1], which matches. \n\nAnother test case: suppose theta = 90 degrees (pi/2). So direction is along x-axis. Then theta/2 is pi/4. cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T, which is indeed the eigenstate of P_x with +\u0127/2. That checks out. \n\nTherefore, option C is correct. Let me check the other options. \n\nOption B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i phi} sin theta). Since in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. If phi is 0, then e^{i0}=1, so (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). But for theta=pi/2 (along x), that would be (0,1). But the correct state along x is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)), so that doesn't match. So option B is incorrect. \n\nOption C works for the test cases. Option D has some factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't come into play here.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The question gives me the matrices for the X, Y, and Z components of P. Hmm, let me start by recalling some quantum mechanics here.\n\nFirst, I remember that operators like this, especially in the context of spin, often use the Pauli matrices scaled by \u0127/2. Let me check the given components. The P_x matrix is (0 1;1 0) times \u0127/2. That's exactly the Pauli-X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly, P_y is (0 -i; i 0) scaled by \u0127/2, which is the Pauli-Y. And P_z is diagonal (1, -1) scaled by \u0127/2, so Pauli-Z. So P must be the spin operator for the muon, analogous to the electron's spin operators. So the problem is about finding the eigenstate of the spin component along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSince the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) might be zero or something, but maybe it's better to define it properly. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, a direction in x-z plane would have phi = 0 (along x) or phi = \u03c0 (along -x), but generally, since it's in x-z, maybe the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, but without phi component. Wait, maybe I should parametrize the direction n in terms of theta, where theta is the angle between n and the z-axis. Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction can be specified by theta, the polar angle, and phi=0 or pi, but maybe we can just consider theta as the angle from z-axis, so the direction vector n would have components (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). Because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the operator P along direction n would be a combination of P_x and P_z, since the y-component is zero?\n\nRight. The general operator for spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+\u0127/2)|v>. \n\nLet me denote the direction vector n as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin\u03b8, n_z = cos\u03b8. So the operator P_n becomes:\n\nP_n = (sin\u03b8)(P_x) + (cos\u03b8)(P_z)\n\nSubstituting the given matrices:\n\nEach P component is already multiplied by \u0127/2, so let me write them out.\n\nP_x = (\u0127/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nP_z = (\u0127/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nTherefore, P_n = (\u0127/2)[ sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]\n\nLet me compute the matrix inside the brackets first. \n\nThe matrix for P_n would be:\n\nsin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] \n\nCalculating each element:\n\nTop left: 0*sin\u03b8 + 1*cos\u03b8 = cos\u03b8\n\nTop right: 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom left: 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nBottom right: 0*sin\u03b8 + (-1)*cos\u03b8 = -cos\u03b8\n\nSo the entire P_n matrix is (\u0127/2) multiplied by the matrix:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2)*M * v = (\u0127/2)*v, where M is the matrix above. Wait, actually the eigenvalue is +\u0127/2. So the equation is:\n\nP_n * v = (+\u0127/2) * v\n\nDividing both sides by \u0127/2, we get:\n\nM * v = v \n\nWait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (\u0127/2 M) v = (\u0127/2) v. So indeed, (M v) = v. So the eigenvalue for the matrix M (without the \u0127/2 factor) is 1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of matrix M with eigenvalue 1. \n\nSo let's write the matrix equation:\n\n[ [cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n  [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8] ] * [v1; v2] = 1 * [v1; v2]\n\nSo setting up equations:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange both equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1\n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 \n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0 \n\nSo now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + (sin\u03b8) v2 = 0\n\n2. (sin\u03b8)v1 + (- (cos\u03b8 +1)) v2 =0\n\nWe can write this as a homogeneous system. Since the equations must be consistent, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero (but since we already know it's an eigenvalue, that's satisfied). \n\nWe can solve one of the equations. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0 \n\nLet me solve for v2 in terms of v1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1 \n\n=> v2 = [ (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 ] v1 \n\nHmm, note that (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 is equal to tan(\u03b8/2). Because using the identity:\n\n1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nsin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = (2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2))/(2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1 \n\nSo the eigenvector can be written as v1 multiplied by [1; tan(\u03b8/2)]\n\nAlternatively, let me write the eigenvector as [v1; tan(\u03b8/2) v1]. To normalize it, the magnitude should be 1. Let me compute the normalization factor.\n\nLet the vector be [v1, v2]^T, with v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1. Then:\n\n|v1|\u00b2 + |v2|\u00b2 = |v1|\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = |v1|\u00b2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ) =1 \n\nSo |v1| = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nThus, choosing v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]^T. \n\nWait, that's exactly option C: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)). Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2))\n\nOption B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8), but phi is not mentioned here. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi, but maybe the phase could be involved. Wait, the problem didn't specify any phase, but since the y-component is zero, perhaps the eigenvector doesn't have a phase factor. Alternatively, maybe in the general case, if the direction had a y-component, there would be a phase. But here, since n is in x-z plane, phi=0, so e^{i phi} would be 1, so option B would become (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). But the answer I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. \n\nHmm, let me verify again. Let me go through the steps once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the matrix M:\n\n[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8\n\n sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]\n\nWe set up (M - I) v =0:\n\nFirst row: (cos\u03b8 -1)v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 =0\n\nSecond row: sin\u03b8 v1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1)v2=0\n\nIf I take the first equation, and express v2 in terms of v1:\n\nv2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1 = tan(theta/2) v1. \n\nThen the eigenvector is [v1, tan(theta/2) v1]^T. Normalizing:\n\nThe norm squared is v1^2 (1 + tan\u00b2(theta/2)) = v1^2 sec\u00b2(theta/2) \n\nSet equal to 1, so v1 = cos(theta/2). Therefore, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if the other option B could also be possible. The question mentions \"arbitrary direction in x-z plane\", so theta here is the angle from z-axis. But sometimes the parametrization uses theta as the angle from the north pole (z-axis), so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard parametrization for spin uses a different angle. Wait, sometimes the spin eigenstates along an axis are given in terms of theta/2. For example, the standard spin-up along the z-axis is [1;0], which would correspond to theta=0 here. Plugging theta=0 into option C gives [cos(0), sin(0)] = [1,0], which is correct. If theta is 180 degrees (pi), then the direction is opposite z. Then theta/2 is pi/2, so cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the eigenvector would be [0,1], which is the spin-down state along z, but since we are looking for eigenvalue +\u0127/2, that's correct for the direction pointing opposite to z. Wait, actually, if the direction is opposite z (theta=pi), then the eigenvalue +\u0127/2 would correspond to the state [0,1], which matches. \n\nAnother test case: suppose theta = 90 degrees (pi/2). So direction is along x-axis. Then theta/2 is pi/4. cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector would be [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T, which is indeed the eigenstate of P_x with +\u0127/2. That checks out. \n\nTherefore, option C is correct. Let me check the other options. \n\nOption B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i phi} sin theta). Since in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi. If phi is 0, then e^{i0}=1, so (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). But for theta=pi/2 (along x), that would be (0,1). But the correct state along x is (1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)), so that doesn't match. So option B is incorrect. \n\nOption C works for the test cases. Option D has some factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't come into play here. The normalization is already accounted for by using cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so their squares add up to 1. \n\nSo the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \\(\\vec{P}\\) along an arbitrary direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\), we start by constructing the operator \\(\\vec{P}_n\\).
