      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, specifically looking at the para-isomer yield for different benzene derivatives. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a benzene ring undergoes electrophilic substitution, the substituents can be directing groups either activating or deactivating. Activating groups like -NH2, -OH, -O-, or -OR direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions (ortho/para directing), while deactivating groups like -NO2, -NR3+, -CF3, -SO3H, etc., are meta directing. Wait, but here the substituents are different. Let's list out each substance and their substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene, the methyl group. Methyl is an activating group and ortho/para directing. So bromine would go to o or p positions.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The ester group (-COOR) is a deactivating group. I think esters are meta directing, right? Because the carbonyl oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so it would direct the incoming group to the meta position. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Acyl groups like -COOR are meta directing.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Chloro benzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group. Wait, but is it meta or ortho/para? Hmm, I think halo groups like Cl and Br are ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. The halogens are considered deactivating because they withdraw electrons through inductive effect but have a +M (mesomeric) effect which is electron donating. So their overall effect is activating? Wait, no. Wait, the halogens: the inductive effect is -I (electron-withdrawing), but the mesomeric effect is +M (electron-donating). So which effect is stronger? For halogens, the inductive effect is weaker than the mesomeric, so overall they are activating? Wait, no, I think the halogens are actually deactivating but ortho/para directing. Because the mesomeric effect allows them to direct to ortho and para, but overall the inductive effect is stronger in making them deactivating. Wait, maybe I should recall the order. For example, substituents like -Cl, -Br are deactivating but ortho/para directing. So in the case of Cl, the substituent directs to o/p positions. So in this case, bromine would form o and p isomers, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but the question states that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. Wait, maybe because there's an excess of bromine, so maybe the reaction goes to completion but only one isomer is formed. Wait, perhaps the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only one position is favored. Or maybe in some cases, the substituent is such that the major isomer is para, but others have a different ratio. Hmm, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So we need to rank them from least to most para isomer.\n\nWait, the problem says \"arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.\" So the one with the smallest fraction of para (i.e., the substituent directs mostly to ortho, so para is low) comes first, and the one with highest para comes last.\n\nSo let me go through each substituent and note their directing effects and the degree to which they favor para.\n\n1. Toluene (methyl group): -CH3 is an activating group, ortho/para directing. So the bromine will go to ortho and para. Since there are two ortho positions and one para, but maybe the para is favored more? Wait, sometimes for strong activating groups like -CH3, the para isomer is more favored than ortho? Wait, I remember that in some cases, like with the methyl group, the para isomer is actually more predominant than ortho. Wait, maybe because the methyl group's +M effect allows for better stabilization of the para position. Hmm, but I might be mixing up with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ortho and para are equally favored, but in some cases, maybe the para is more stable. Let me think. For example, when you have a methyl group on benzene, the nitration gives more para product than ortho. Wait, maybe in nitration, the methyl group directs to ortho and para, but the para isomer is more stable. So perhaps the para isomer is the major one here. So for toluene, the bromination would give more para than ortho. But since the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe in the problem's scenario, they mean that the reaction only forms the major isomer? Or perhaps it's a question about the ratio, but the problem states that only one monobromo is formed. Wait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps they are assuming that each reaction leads to a single product, so maybe the directing group is so strong that only the favored position is taken. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relative directing effects where in some cases, the meta directing groups can't form para, so their para isomer is zero? Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed,\" which might mean that in each case, only one isomer is formed (so maybe the directing group is so strong that only the major position is formed). For example, if a meta directing group is present, then only the meta isomer is formed. But then, for para directing groups, maybe the bromine goes to para and ortho, but maybe in this case, the para isomer is the only one formed? Wait, maybe the question is assuming that when a group is ortho/para directing, the bromine will go equally to ortho and para, so the para fraction would be 1/3 (since there are two ortho and one para), so 33% para. But if the directing group strongly prefers para, maybe higher. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to consider the relative directing strengths, so that the activating groups (like methyl, which is ortho/para) would have a higher proportion of para compared to other ortho/para directing groups like Cl (which is deactivating but ortho/para directing).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is based on the fact that some substituents are ortho/para directing but the activating strength affects the degree to which the substituent directs. Wait, maybe I should recall the order of directing groups and their effects on the position.\n\nLet me list each substituent and their directing effect and activating/deactivating:\n\n1. -CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine will go to ortho and para. Since activating groups usually favor para over ortho? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, maybe the key here is the meta directing vs ortho/para directing. For meta directing groups (like -NO2, -COOR, -COOH, etc.), the substitution occurs mainly in the meta position, so the para isomer would have a low fraction (since meta is the only one formed). For ortho/para directing groups, the bromine can go to ortho or para. So the para fraction would be 1/3 (since there's one para and two ortho positions). Unless the substituent strongly prefers para over ortho, in which case the fraction would be higher than 1/3.\n\nSo for each substituent, we need to figure out the direction and then calculate the para fraction.\n\nLet me go through each substance:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): ortho/para directing, activating. So the bromine can go to ortho or para. The question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that's confusing. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, then there should be two possible positions (ortho and para). But the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Hmm. Maybe this is a trick. Wait, maybe when there are two substituents, but here each has only one substituent. Wait, each of the substances is a benzene ring with one substituent. So when bromine adds, it can go to ortho or para. But the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". That implies that the substituent is so directing that only one position is favored. For example, a meta directing group would only allow the meta position, so only one product. For ortho/para directing groups, perhaps the directing effect is strong enough that only the para isomer forms, so that ortho isn't formed? But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that when a group is meta directing, the para isomer is not formed, so their weight fraction is 0. Whereas for ortho/para directing groups, the para isomer would be a certain fraction. Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that for ortho/para directing substituents, the bromine can form either ortho or para, so the para isomer would be (number of para positions)/(total possible positions). Since there are three possible positions (two ortho, one para), the para fraction would be 1/3 (about 33%). However, if the substituent is strongly directing to para, maybe the para fraction is higher. Conversely, for a meta directing group, the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para fraction is 0. Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so perhaps in all cases, the substituent directs so strongly that only one isomer is formed. For example, if it's meta directing, then the product is only meta. If it's ortho directing, only ortho, etc. But wait, ortho/para directing groups would have two positions (ortho and para). So maybe the question is considering that the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only the major isomer is formed. So in that case, for example, a meta directing group would have 0% para (since it's meta only). For an ortho/para directing group, the major isomer could be either ortho or para. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that certain substituents have different directing effects and the degree to which they direct to para. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) is a strong meta director, so the bromine would only go meta, so para fraction is 0. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is also a meta director. The ester (-COOR) is also meta directing. The chlorine (-Cl) is ortho/para directing but deactivating, while the methyl (-CH3) is ortho/para and activating. \n\nWait, let me clarify each substituent's directing effect:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl, -CH3): activating, ortho/para directing. The methyl group is an ortho/para director, so the bromine will go to ortho and para positions. Since the methyl is activating, maybe the para isomer is more favored than ortho? Or perhaps equally? I think in some cases, like when the substituent is an activating group, the para isomer is more stable because the substituent and the new group can be in a more stable arrangement. For example, in nitration of toluene, the para product is the major one. So perhaps here, the para isomer would be the major product, so the weight fraction of para would be higher than ortho. So if only the major isomer is formed, then the para fraction would be 100% for this case. Wait, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", which might mean that in each case, only the major isomer is formed, so the para fraction would be 100% for toluene. Hmm, but then for other substituents, maybe the meta directing groups have 0% para. Let me check each:\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate, ester group): The ester group is a meta director. So bromine would go to meta position only. So the para fraction is 0.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para directing. The question is, when bromine substitutes, does it go to ortho or para? The directing effect here is ortho/para. Since Cl is a weak ortho/para director (because it's deactivating), maybe the para isomer is favored over ortho? Or maybe they are about equal? But since the question says only one product is formed, perhaps the major isomer is either ortho or para. Wait, in the case of chlorobenzene, when brominating, the para product is actually the major one. Because the chlorine's +M effect allows the electrophile to attack para. I think that in chlorobenzene's bromination, the major product is the para isomer. So if only the major isomer is formed, then the para fraction here would be 100%. Wait, but then how does that compare to others? Hmm, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that ortho/para directing groups have a certain ratio. For example, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the bromine can go to ortho or para. The para isomer would be (1/(2+1)) = 1/3 if they are equally favored. But if the directing group prefers para, then higher than 1/3. \n\nWait, maybe the answer hinges on the relative directing strengths. For example:\n\n- Strong ortho/para directors (like -CH3, -NH2) would have higher para fractions than weaker ones like Cl.\n\nWait, but let me think of each substituent:\n\nSubstances:\n\n1. -CH3 (toluene): ortho/para directing, activating. Since activating groups usually favor para more than ortho (like in nitration), maybe the para fraction here is high, say 70% or so. \n\n2. -COOC2H5 (ester): meta directing, so para fraction is 0.\n\n3. -Cl (chlorine): ortho/para directing, deactivating. Since Cl is a weak director, maybe the para fraction is lower than for toluene. For example, maybe 50% (if equally between o and p), but perhaps more towards ortho? Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall: in the case of chlorobenzene, when brominated, the para product is actually the major one. Because the chlorine's +M effect allows the attack at para. Wait, but maybe the ortho is also possible, but para is more stable. Let me check my notes. For example, in the bromination of toluene, the para isomer is major. In chlorobenzene, the bromination would give more para than ortho. So maybe for both, the para is the major, but which one has a higher percentage? Since the methyl group is a stronger activator than Cl (which is deactivating), the methyl group would lead to a higher para yield. So the para fraction for toluene would be higher than chlorobenzene. \n\nWait, but chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but when it does occur, the directing effect is still ortho/para. So the para isomer would still be the major one, but perhaps the ratio between ortho and para is different. For example, maybe in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is still the majority, but maybe 60%, whereas in toluene it's 75%? So the para fraction for toluene is higher than Cl. \n\n4. C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): nitro is a strong meta director. So bromine would go meta only. So para fraction is 0.\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is also an activating ortho/para director. So similar to toluene, the para isomer would be major. So the para fraction here would be similar to toluene. Wait, but maybe slightly different? Since ethyl is a larger group, maybe the para isomer is even more favored? Or perhaps it's the same. So maybe the para fraction for ethylbenzene is similar to toluene, so maybe they are grouped together?\n\n6. C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxylic acid group is a strong meta director. So bromine goes meta only. So para fraction is 0.\n\nWait, so let's list each substituent's para fraction:\n\nSubstance | Substituent | Directing Effect | Para Fraction\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n1. Toluene (CH3) | -CH3 | ortho/para (activating) | High (maybe ~70%)\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5) | -COOC2H5 | meta | 0\n3. Chlorobenzene (Cl) | -Cl | ortho/para (deactivating) | Moderate (~50-60%)\n4. Nitrobenzene (NO2) | -NO2 | meta | 0\n5. Ethylbenzene (C2H5) | -C2H5 | ortho/para (activating) | High (similar to 1)\n6. Benzoic acid (COOH) | -COOH | meta | 0\n\nWait, but in the options given, the order is to be arranged from increasing (so smallest to largest para fraction). \n\nThe substances with 0% para are 2, 4, 6. Then the next would be chlorobenzene (3) with moderate, then toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5) with higher, and maybe something else? Wait, but in the options, for instance, option A says 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5. Wait, but according to this, 4 (nitrobenzene) has 0, 2 (ethyl benzoate) also 0, so their order between them would be equal, but the options have them in order. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nWait, for the substances:\n\nSubstance 2: ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5) is ester, which is a meta director. So para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 6: benzoic acid (COOH) is also a meta director, so para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro (NO2) is also meta, so 0.\n\nSo all three (2,4,6) have 0. So their order can be any? But in the options, they must be ordered. So maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning here. Wait, perhaps the question isn't considering meta directing groups as 0, but maybe in some cases, meta directing groups can have some para isomer? Wait, that can't be. If the substituent is a meta director, the bromine can only go to meta. So the para isomer would have 0% yield. So substances 2,4,6 have 0. So their order can be any, but in the options, they are ordered as 4 < 2 <6 in option A, but that might not be correct. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substituents. Let me recheck the substances:\n\nSubstance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5 is ethyl benzoate (ester group: -O-CO-C2H5). Correct, that's meta directing.\n\nSubstance 6: C6H5-COOH is benzoic acid, which is -COOH. Carboxylic acid is a strong meta director. So yes, para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro (NO2), which is a meta director. So all three (2,4,6) have 0. So the question must have some other consideration here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". Maybe for the meta directing groups, the reaction cannot form the para isomer, so their para fraction is 0, and for ortho/para directing groups, the para fraction is between 0 and 100%. \n\nIn that case, the order would start with the meta directing groups (2,4,6) with 0. But the options have them in different orders. Let's see the options again:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that among the ortho/para directing groups, the deactivating ones (like Cl) have lower para fractions than activating ones (like CH3 and C2H5). \n\nSo for ortho/para directing groups:\n\n- The activating groups (CH3, C2H5) would have higher para fractions (because activating groups favor para more? Or perhaps because they are stronger directors, leading to higher selectivity). \n\n- The deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) would have a lower para fraction than the activating ones. \n\nSo the para fractions for the ortho/para directing groups:\n\nCl (substance 3) < toluene (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nBetween toluene and ethyl: since both are activating, maybe they are similar, but perhaps ethyl is slightly better? Or maybe they are the same. \n\nSo the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:\n\nmeta (0%) first, then Cl (maybe 30-50%), then toluene and ethyl (70-80%). \n\nSo the order would be: \n\nmeta (0%) substances (4,2,6) first, then substance 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nBut the problem is the meta ones all have 0, so how are they ordered? The options list them in different orders. For instance, in option A, it's 4 < 2 <6, but since all are 0, perhaps the question considers some other factor. Maybe the question is actually about the relative rates of reaction? Or maybe the para isomer's yield is considered in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the meta directing groups.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the question is about the relative rates of substitution leading to different yields. Wait, but the question specifies that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in cases where the directing group is meta, only the meta isomer is formed (so para fraction is zero). For ortho/para directing groups, maybe the reaction can only form the para isomer (if the substituent directs strongly to para). For example, activating groups like -CH3 direct strongly to para, so only the para isomer forms, so 100% para. Deactivating ortho/para groups like Cl might direct less strongly, so maybe the product is a mixture, but the question states only one is formed. Hmm, maybe the question is implying that the directing effect is so strong that only the favored position is formed. \n\nWait, for example, in nitrobenzene (substance4), the nitro group is a meta director, so only the meta bromo product is formed. So para fraction is 0. \n\nIn toluene (substance1), the methyl group is a strong ortho/para director, so the bromine goes to para (major) and maybe ortho is minor. But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so maybe in this case, only the para isomer is formed. So the para fraction is 100% here. \n\nSimilarly, chlorobenzene (substance3): the Cl is a weaker ortho/para director. Since it's deactivating, maybe the reaction is slower, but when it does proceed, the directing effect is towards para (like in nitration, chlorobenzene gives more para than ortho). So perhaps here the para isomer is the only one formed (100%), but maybe the directing is weaker so that maybe ortho is formed instead? Wait, but if only one is formed, then perhaps the major is the only one. \n\nWait, but then for toluene and chlorobenzene, both would have 100% para? Then they would be tied. But in the options, they are separated. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to refer to the typical major products for each substituent:\n\nLet me recall specific examples:\n\n- Toluene (methyl benzene) bromination: the major product is para-bromo toluene. So if only the major is formed, then para fraction is 100%.\n\n- Chlorobenzene bromination: The major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. Because the +M effect of Cl allows the electrophile to attack para. So again, para is the major, so 100%.\n\n- Nitrobenzene: bromine goes meta, so 0% para.\n\n- Benzoic acid: meta, so 0%.\n\n- Ethylbenzene (substance5): similar to toluene, the para isomer is major (100%).\n\n- Ester (substance2, ethyl benzoate): bromine goes meta, so 0%.\n\nWait, but then the para fractions for toluene, chlorobenzene, and ethylbenzene would all be 100%, so how are they ordered? The options have them in different orders. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question considers that the activating groups (CH3 and C2H5) lead to higher yield of para compared to deactivating ortho/para directors like Cl. But if all are 100%, then they can't be ordered. So maybe my assumption that they form only the major isomer is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that for ortho/para directing groups, the para isomer is the only one formed (so 100%), and for meta directing groups, 0. So the order would be:\n\nmeta (0%) substances first (4,2,6), then the others (3,1,5) all at 100%. But the options don't have that. The options have varying orders. \n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption A) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThis orders the meta ones (4,2,6) first, then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nOption B) 6<2<4<5<1<3: here the meta ones are ordered as 6,2,4, then 5 and 1, then 3.\n\nOption C)4<6<2<1<5<3: meta ordered 4,6,2 then 1 and 5, then 3.\n\nOption D)3<5<1<6<2<4: here 3 (Cl) is first, then 5 and 1 (para 100%), then the meta ones.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the question is not about whether meta or ortho/para directing, but about the relative directing effects for ortho/para directing substituents. For example, between ortho/para directing groups, some favor para more than others. \n\nWait, perhaps the weight fraction of para isomer among the ortho/para directing substituents can be compared. For example, between toluene (CH3) and chlorobenzene (Cl), which has a higher para fraction?\n\nIn the case of nitration of toluene vs chlorobenzene:\n\nToluene (activating): major product is para nitro toluene.\n\nChlorobenzene (deactivating but ortho/para): major product is also para nitro chlorobenzene. \n\nSo the para isomer is major in both. But which one has a higher proportion? \n\nIn the case of toluene, the activating group makes the reaction faster, so perhaps the directing effect is stronger, leading to a higher selectivity for para. \n\nAlternatively, the directing effect's strength might be such that stronger activating groups (like CH3) have a higher preference for para than weaker ones (like Cl). \n\nSo between toluene and chlorobenzene, the para fraction would be higher for toluene than Cl. \n\nSimilarly, between toluene and ethylbenzene (which is also activating), perhaps ethyl is even better, so higher para fraction. \n\nSo ordering the para fractions among the ortho/para directing groups (substances 1,3,5):\n\npara fraction order: 3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)\n\nSo for all ortho/para directing, the order is Cl < CH3 < ethyl.\n\nSo the overall order from smallest to largest para fraction would be:\n\nmeta (0%) first (substances 2,4,6), then Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nNow, among the meta directing groups (substances 2,4,6), which has the highest para fraction? Well, all are 0, so their order is irrelevant? But the options have them in different orders. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that among meta directing groups, their meta directing strength affects something else? Or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that for the meta directing groups, even though they can't form para, maybe the question is about the possibility of other isomers, but no. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the ester group. Let me recheck:\n\nEthyl benzoate (substance2): the substituent is -O-CO-C2H5. Ester groups are indeed meta directing. So the bromine would only go meta, so para fraction 0. \n\nBenzoic acid (substance6): -COOH is also meta directing. \n\nNitro (substance4): meta directing. \n\nSo all three (2,4,6) have 0. \n\nNow, the question is to arrange all 6 substances in order of increasing para fraction. So the first three would be 2,4,6 in any order, then next is 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 this fits, because 4,2,6 (all 0) are first, then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 same as A except the order of 4,6,2. Doesn't matter since they are all 0. \n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4 \u2192 no, because 3 (Cl) would come after the 0s, but D starts with 3. \n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 also starts with the 0s, but ends with 3 after 5 and 1, which contradicts. \n\nSo the correct order would be the one where the meta directing groups (4,2,6) come first, followed by Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nLooking at the options, option A has the order 4<2<6<3<1<5. The order of the first three (4,2,6) can be any since they are equal, but the rest follow. So option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, option C has 4<6<2<1<5<3. The last part (1 and 5 before 3?) No, wait option C's last is 3. So after 1 and 5 comes 3? No. Wait, in option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 so after the first three (4,6,2), then comes 1 (CH3), then 5 (ethyl), then 3 (Cl). But Cl has a lower para fraction than CH3 and ethyl. So that would be wrong. \n\nWait, the correct order after the meta directing group is Cl (para fraction ~ let's say 60%), then CH3 (70%), then ethyl (75%). So the order between Cl and the others must have Cl first. \n\nSo the correct order would be the meta group (0), then Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nSo the options that have 4,2,6 first, followed by 3, then 1 and 5 are option A and C. \n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 correct. \n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 the last item is 3, which is wrong because Cl should be before CH3 and ethyl. \n\nSo option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. \n\nThe question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. \n\nFor substances with meta directing groups (2,4,6), the para fraction is 0. \n\nFor Cl (3), the para fraction is higher than 0 but less than the activating groups. \n\nFor activating groups (CH3 (1), C2H5 (5)), the para fraction is higher than Cl. \n\nTherefore, the order from least to most is:\n\nmeta (0) < Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). \n\nSo among all 6 substances, the order is:\n\n4,2,6 (all 0) < 3 <1 <5. \n\nSo the correct option is A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. \n\nAnother check: the options given include option A. So the answer should be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, specifically looking at the para-isomer yield for different benzene derivatives. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a benzene ring undergoes electrophilic substitution, the substituents can be directing groups either activating or deactivating. Activating groups like -NH2, -OH, -O-, or -OR direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions (ortho/para directing), while deactivating groups like -NO2, -NR3+, -CF3, -SO3H, etc., are meta directing. Wait, but here the substituents are different. Let's list out each substance and their substituents:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene, the methyl group. Methyl is an activating group and ortho/para directing. So bromine would go to o or p positions.\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The ester group (-COOR) is a deactivating group. I think esters are meta directing, right? Because the carbonyl oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so it would direct the incoming group to the meta position. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Acyl groups like -COOR are meta directing.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl: Chloro benzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group. Wait, but is it meta or ortho/para? Hmm, I think halo groups like Cl and Br are ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. The halogens are considered deactivating because they withdraw electrons through inductive effect but have a +M (mesomeric) effect which is electron donating. So their overall effect is activating? Wait, no. Wait, the halogens: the inductive effect is -I (electron-withdrawing), but the mesomeric effect is +M (electron-donating). So which effect is stronger? For halogens, the inductive effect is weaker than the mesomeric, so overall they are activating? Wait, no, I think the halogens are actually deactivating but ortho/para directing. Because the mesomeric effect allows them to direct to ortho and para, but overall the inductive effect is stronger in making them deactivating. Wait, maybe I should recall the order. For example, substituents like -Cl, -Br are deactivating but ortho/para directing. So in the case of Cl, the substituent directs to o/p positions. So in this case, bromine would form o and p isomers, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but the question states that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. Wait, maybe because there's an excess of bromine, so maybe the reaction goes to completion but only one isomer is formed. Wait, perhaps the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only one position is favored. Or maybe in some cases, the substituent is such that the major isomer is para, but others have a different ratio. Hmm, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So we need to rank them from least to most para isomer.\n\nWait, the problem says \"arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.\" So the one with the smallest fraction of para (i.e., the substituent directs mostly to ortho, so para is low) comes first, and the one with highest para comes last.\n\nSo let me go through each substituent and note their directing effects and the degree to which they favor para.\n\n1. Toluene (methyl group): -CH3 is an activating group, ortho/para directing. So the bromine will go to ortho and para. Since there are two ortho positions and one para, but maybe the para is favored more? Wait, sometimes for strong activating groups like -CH3, the para isomer is more favored than ortho? Wait, I remember that in some cases, like with the methyl group, the para isomer is actually more predominant than ortho. Wait, maybe because the methyl group's +M effect allows for better stabilization of the para position. Hmm, but I might be mixing up with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ortho and para are equally favored, but in some cases, maybe the para is more stable. Let me think. For example, when you have a methyl group on benzene, the nitration gives more para product than ortho. Wait, maybe in nitration, the methyl group directs to ortho and para, but the para isomer is more stable. So perhaps the para isomer is the major one here. So for toluene, the bromination would give more para than ortho. But since the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, maybe in the problem's scenario, they mean that the reaction only forms the major isomer? Or perhaps it's a question about the ratio, but the problem states that only one monobromo is formed. Wait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps they are assuming that each reaction leads to a single product, so maybe the directing group is so strong that only the favored position is taken. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relative directing effects where in some cases, the meta directing groups can't form para, so their para isomer is zero? Wait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed,\" which might mean that in each case, only one isomer is formed (so maybe the directing group is so strong that only the major position is formed). For example, if a meta directing group is present, then only the meta isomer is formed. But then, for para directing groups, maybe the bromine goes to para and ortho, but maybe in this case, the para isomer is the only one formed? Wait, maybe the question is assuming that when a group is ortho/para directing, the bromine will go equally to ortho and para, so the para fraction would be 1/3 (since there are two ortho and one para), so 33% para. But if the directing group strongly prefers para, maybe higher. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to consider the relative directing strengths, so that the activating groups (like methyl, which is ortho/para) would have a higher proportion of para compared to other ortho/para directing groups like Cl (which is deactivating but ortho/para directing).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is based on the fact that some substituents are ortho/para directing but the activating strength affects the degree to which the substituent directs. Wait, maybe I should recall the order of directing groups and their effects on the position.\n\nLet me list each substituent and their directing effect and activating/deactivating:\n\n1. -CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para directing. So the bromine will go to ortho and para. Since activating groups usually favor para over ortho? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, maybe the key here is the meta directing vs ortho/para directing. For meta directing groups (like -NO2, -COOR, -COOH, etc.), the substitution occurs mainly in the meta position, so the para isomer would have a low fraction (since meta is the only one formed). For ortho/para directing groups, the bromine can go to ortho or para. So the para fraction would be 1/3 (since there's one para and two ortho positions). Unless the substituent strongly prefers para over ortho, in which case the fraction would be higher than 1/3.\n\nSo for each substituent, we need to figure out the direction and then calculate the para fraction.\n\nLet me go through each substance:\n\n1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): ortho/para directing, activating. So the bromine can go to ortho or para. The question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that's confusing. If the substituent is ortho/para directing, then there should be two possible positions (ortho and para). But the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Hmm. Maybe this is a trick. Wait, maybe when there are two substituents, but here each has only one substituent. Wait, each of the substances is a benzene ring with one substituent. So when bromine adds, it can go to ortho or para. But the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". That implies that the substituent is so directing that only one position is favored. For example, a meta directing group would only allow the meta position, so only one product. For ortho/para directing groups, perhaps the directing effect is strong enough that only the para isomer forms, so that ortho isn't formed? But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that when a group is meta directing, the para isomer is not formed, so their weight fraction is 0. Whereas for ortho/para directing groups, the para isomer would be a certain fraction. Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that for ortho/para directing substituents, the bromine can form either ortho or para, so the para isomer would be (number of para positions)/(total possible positions). Since there are three possible positions (two ortho, one para), the para fraction would be 1/3 (about 33%). However, if the substituent is strongly directing to para, maybe the para fraction is higher. Conversely, for a meta directing group, the bromine can only go to the meta position, so the para fraction is 0. Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so perhaps in all cases, the substituent directs so strongly that only one isomer is formed. For example, if it's meta directing, then the product is only meta. If it's ortho directing, only ortho, etc. But wait, ortho/para directing groups would have two positions (ortho and para). So maybe the question is considering that the substituent's directing effect is so strong that only the major isomer is formed. So in that case, for example, a meta directing group would have 0% para (since it's meta only). For an ortho/para directing group, the major isomer could be either ortho or para. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that certain substituents have different directing effects and the degree to which they direct to para. For example, the nitro group (-NO2) is a strong meta director, so the bromine would only go meta, so para fraction is 0. The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is also a meta director. The ester (-COOR) is also meta directing. The chlorine (-Cl) is ortho/para directing but deactivating, while the methyl (-CH3) is ortho/para and activating. \n\nWait, let me clarify each substituent's directing effect:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl, -CH3): activating, ortho/para directing. The methyl group is an ortho/para director, so the bromine will go to ortho and para positions. Since the methyl is activating, maybe the para isomer is more favored than ortho? Or perhaps equally? I think in some cases, like when the substituent is an activating group, the para isomer is more stable because the substituent and the new group can be in a more stable arrangement. For example, in nitration of toluene, the para product is the major one. So perhaps here, the para isomer would be the major product, so the weight fraction of para would be higher than ortho. So if only the major isomer is formed, then the para fraction would be 100% for this case. Wait, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", which might mean that in each case, only the major isomer is formed, so the para fraction would be 100% for toluene. Hmm, but then for other substituents, maybe the meta directing groups have 0% para. Let me check each:\n\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate, ester group): The ester group is a meta director. So bromine would go to meta position only. So the para fraction is 0.\n\n3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para directing. The question is, when bromine substitutes, does it go to ortho or para? The directing effect here is ortho/para. Since Cl is a weak ortho/para director (because it's deactivating), maybe the para isomer is favored over ortho? Or maybe they are about equal? But since the question says only one product is formed, perhaps the major isomer is either ortho or para. Wait, in the case of chlorobenzene, when brominating, the para product is actually the major one. Because the chlorine's +M effect allows the electrophile to attack para. I think that in chlorobenzene's bromination, the major product is the para isomer. So if only the major isomer is formed, then the para fraction here would be 100%. Wait, but then how does that compare to others? Hmm, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that ortho/para directing groups have a certain ratio. For example, when a substituent is ortho/para directing, the bromine can go to ortho or para. The para isomer would be (1/(2+1)) = 1/3 if they are equally favored. But if the directing group prefers para, then higher than 1/3. \n\nWait, maybe the answer hinges on the relative directing strengths. For example:\n\n- Strong ortho/para directors (like -CH3, -NH2) would have higher para fractions than weaker ones like Cl.\n\nWait, but let me think of each substituent:\n\nSubstances:\n\n1. -CH3 (toluene): ortho/para directing, activating. Since activating groups usually favor para more than ortho (like in nitration), maybe the para fraction here is high, say 70% or so. \n\n2. -COOC2H5 (ester): meta directing, so para fraction is 0.\n\n3. -Cl (chlorine): ortho/para directing, deactivating. Since Cl is a weak director, maybe the para fraction is lower than for toluene. For example, maybe 50% (if equally between o and p), but perhaps more towards ortho? Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall: in the case of chlorobenzene, when brominated, the para product is actually the major one. Because the chlorine's +M effect allows the attack at para. Wait, but maybe the ortho is also possible, but para is more stable. Let me check my notes. For example, in the bromination of toluene, the para isomer is major. In chlorobenzene, the bromination would give more para than ortho. So maybe for both, the para is the major, but which one has a higher percentage? Since the methyl group is a stronger activator than Cl (which is deactivating), the methyl group would lead to a higher para yield. So the para fraction for toluene would be higher than chlorobenzene. \n\nWait, but chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the reaction is slower, but when it does occur, the directing effect is still ortho/para. So the para isomer would still be the major one, but perhaps the ratio between ortho and para is different. For example, maybe in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is still the majority, but maybe 60%, whereas in toluene it's 75%? So the para fraction for toluene is higher than Cl. \n\n4. C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): nitro is a strong meta director. So bromine would go meta only. So para fraction is 0.\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): similar to toluene. The ethyl group is also an activating ortho/para director. So similar to toluene, the para isomer would be major. So the para fraction here would be similar to toluene. Wait, but maybe slightly different? Since ethyl is a larger group, maybe the para isomer is even more favored? Or perhaps it's the same. So maybe the para fraction for ethylbenzene is similar to toluene, so maybe they are grouped together?\n\n6. C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): carboxylic acid group is a strong meta director. So bromine goes meta only. So para fraction is 0.\n\nWait, so let's list each substituent's para fraction:\n\nSubstance | Substituent | Directing Effect | Para Fraction\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n1. Toluene (CH3) | -CH3 | ortho/para (activating) | High (maybe ~70%)\n2. Ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5) | -COOC2H5 | meta | 0\n3. Chlorobenzene (Cl) | -Cl | ortho/para (deactivating) | Moderate (~50-60%)\n4. Nitrobenzene (NO2) | -NO2 | meta | 0\n5. Ethylbenzene (C2H5) | -C2H5 | ortho/para (activating) | High (similar to 1)\n6. Benzoic acid (COOH) | -COOH | meta | 0\n\nWait, but in the options given, the order is to be arranged from increasing (so smallest to largest para fraction). \n\nThe substances with 0% para are 2, 4, 6. Then the next would be chlorobenzene (3) with moderate, then toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5) with higher, and maybe something else? Wait, but in the options, for instance, option A says 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5. Wait, but according to this, 4 (nitrobenzene) has 0, 2 (ethyl benzoate) also 0, so their order between them would be equal, but the options have them in order. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nWait, for the substances:\n\nSubstance 2: ethyl benzoate (COOC2H5) is ester, which is a meta director. So para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 6: benzoic acid (COOH) is also a meta director, so para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro (NO2) is also meta, so 0.\n\nSo all three (2,4,6) have 0. So their order can be any? But in the options, they must be ordered. So maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning here. Wait, perhaps the question isn't considering meta directing groups as 0, but maybe in some cases, meta directing groups can have some para isomer? Wait, that can't be. If the substituent is a meta director, the bromine can only go to meta. So the para isomer would have 0% yield. So substances 2,4,6 have 0. So their order can be any, but in the options, they are ordered as 4 < 2 <6 in option A, but that might not be correct. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substituents. Let me recheck the substances:\n\nSubstance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5 is ethyl benzoate (ester group: -O-CO-C2H5). Correct, that's meta directing.\n\nSubstance 6: C6H5-COOH is benzoic acid, which is -COOH. Carboxylic acid is a strong meta director. So yes, para fraction 0.\n\nSubstance 4: nitro (NO2), which is a meta director. So all three (2,4,6) have 0. So the question must have some other consideration here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". Maybe for the meta directing groups, the reaction cannot form the para isomer, so their para fraction is 0, and for ortho/para directing groups, the para fraction is between 0 and 100%. \n\nIn that case, the order would start with the meta directing groups (2,4,6) with 0. But the options have them in different orders. Let's see the options again:\n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that among the ortho/para directing groups, the deactivating ones (like Cl) have lower para fractions than activating ones (like CH3 and C2H5). \n\nSo for ortho/para directing groups:\n\n- The activating groups (CH3, C2H5) would have higher para fractions (because activating groups favor para more? Or perhaps because they are stronger directors, leading to higher selectivity). \n\n- The deactivating ortho/para director (Cl) would have a lower para fraction than the activating ones. \n\nSo the para fractions for the ortho/para directing groups:\n\nCl (substance 3) < toluene (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nBetween toluene and ethyl: since both are activating, maybe they are similar, but perhaps ethyl is slightly better? Or maybe they are the same. \n\nSo the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:\n\nmeta (0%) first, then Cl (maybe 30-50%), then toluene and ethyl (70-80%). \n\nSo the order would be: \n\nmeta (0%) substances (4,2,6) first, then substance 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nBut the problem is the meta ones all have 0, so how are they ordered? The options list them in different orders. For instance, in option A, it's 4 < 2 <6, but since all are 0, perhaps the question considers some other factor. Maybe the question is actually about the relative rates of reaction? Or maybe the para isomer's yield is considered in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the meta directing groups.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the question is about the relative rates of substitution leading to different yields. Wait, but the question specifies that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps in cases where the directing group is meta, only the meta isomer is formed (so para fraction is zero). For ortho/para directing groups, maybe the reaction can only form the para isomer (if the substituent directs strongly to para). For example, activating groups like -CH3 direct strongly to para, so only the para isomer forms, so 100% para. Deactivating ortho/para groups like Cl might direct less strongly, so maybe the product is a mixture, but the question states only one is formed. Hmm, maybe the question is implying that the directing effect is so strong that only the favored position is formed. \n\nWait, for example, in nitrobenzene (substance4), the nitro group is a meta director, so only the meta bromo product is formed. So para fraction is 0. \n\nIn toluene (substance1), the methyl group is a strong ortho/para director, so the bromine goes to para (major) and maybe ortho is minor. But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so maybe in this case, only the para isomer is formed. So the para fraction is 100% here. \n\nSimilarly, chlorobenzene (substance3): the Cl is a weaker ortho/para director. Since it's deactivating, maybe the reaction is slower, but when it does proceed, the directing effect is towards para (like in nitration, chlorobenzene gives more para than ortho). So perhaps here the para isomer is the only one formed (100%), but maybe the directing is weaker so that maybe ortho is formed instead? Wait, but if only one is formed, then perhaps the major is the only one. \n\nWait, but then for toluene and chlorobenzene, both would have 100% para? Then they would be tied. But in the options, they are separated. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to refer to the typical major products for each substituent:\n\nLet me recall specific examples:\n\n- Toluene (methyl benzene) bromination: the major product is para-bromo toluene. So if only the major is formed, then para fraction is 100%.\n\n- Chlorobenzene bromination: The major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. Because the +M effect of Cl allows the electrophile to attack para. So again, para is the major, so 100%.\n\n- Nitrobenzene: bromine goes meta, so 0% para.\n\n- Benzoic acid: meta, so 0%.\n\n- Ethylbenzene (substance5): similar to toluene, the para isomer is major (100%).\n\n- Ester (substance2, ethyl benzoate): bromine goes meta, so 0%.\n\nWait, but then the para fractions for toluene, chlorobenzene, and ethylbenzene would all be 100%, so how are they ordered? The options have them in different orders. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question considers that the activating groups (CH3 and C2H5) lead to higher yield of para compared to deactivating ortho/para directors like Cl. But if all are 100%, then they can't be ordered. So maybe my assumption that they form only the major isomer is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that for ortho/para directing groups, the para isomer is the only one formed (so 100%), and for meta directing groups, 0. So the order would be:\n\nmeta (0%) substances first (4,2,6), then the others (3,1,5) all at 100%. But the options don't have that. The options have varying orders. \n\nWait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption A) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nThis orders the meta ones (4,2,6) first, then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nOption B) 6<2<4<5<1<3: here the meta ones are ordered as 6,2,4, then 5 and 1, then 3.\n\nOption C)4<6<2<1<5<3: meta ordered 4,6,2 then 1 and 5, then 3.\n\nOption D)3<5<1<6<2<4: here 3 (Cl) is first, then 5 and 1 (para 100%), then the meta ones.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the question is not about whether meta or ortho/para directing, but about the relative directing effects for ortho/para directing substituents. For example, between ortho/para directing groups, some favor para more than others. \n\nWait, perhaps the weight fraction of para isomer among the ortho/para directing substituents can be compared. For example, between toluene (CH3) and chlorobenzene (Cl), which has a higher para fraction?\n\nIn the case of nitration of toluene vs chlorobenzene:\n\nToluene (activating): major product is para nitro toluene.\n\nChlorobenzene (deactivating but ortho/para): major product is also para nitro chlorobenzene. \n\nSo the para isomer is major in both. But which one has a higher proportion? \n\nIn the case of toluene, the activating group makes the reaction faster, so perhaps the directing effect is stronger, leading to a higher selectivity for para. \n\nAlternatively, the directing effect's strength might be such that stronger activating groups (like CH3) have a higher preference for para than weaker ones (like Cl). \n\nSo between toluene and chlorobenzene, the para fraction would be higher for toluene than Cl. \n\nSimilarly, between toluene and ethylbenzene (which is also activating), perhaps ethyl is even better, so higher para fraction. \n\nSo ordering the para fractions among the ortho/para directing groups (substances 1,3,5):\n\npara fraction order: 3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5)\n\nSo for all ortho/para directing, the order is Cl < CH3 < ethyl.\n\nSo the overall order from smallest to largest para fraction would be:\n\nmeta (0%) first (substances 2,4,6), then Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nNow, among the meta directing groups (substances 2,4,6), which has the highest para fraction? Well, all are 0, so their order is irrelevant? But the options have them in different orders. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that among meta directing groups, their meta directing strength affects something else? Or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that for the meta directing groups, even though they can't form para, maybe the question is about the possibility of other isomers, but no. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with the ester group. Let me recheck:\n\nEthyl benzoate (substance2): the substituent is -O-CO-C2H5. Ester groups are indeed meta directing. So the bromine would only go meta, so para fraction 0. \n\nBenzoic acid (substance6): -COOH is also meta directing. \n\nNitro (substance4): meta directing. \n\nSo all three (2,4,6) have 0. \n\nNow, the question is to arrange all 6 substances in order of increasing para fraction. So the first three would be 2,4,6 in any order, then next is 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 \u2192 this fits, because 4,2,6 (all 0) are first, then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. \n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 same as A except the order of 4,6,2. Doesn't matter since they are all 0. \n\nOption D:3<5<1<6<2<4 \u2192 no, because 3 (Cl) would come after the 0s, but D starts with 3. \n\nOption B:6<2<4<5<1<3 \u2192 also starts with the 0s, but ends with 3 after 5 and 1, which contradicts. \n\nSo the correct order would be the one where the meta directing groups (4,2,6) come first, followed by Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nLooking at the options, option A has the order 4<2<6<3<1<5. The order of the first three (4,2,6) can be any since they are equal, but the rest follow. So option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, option C has 4<6<2<1<5<3. The last part (1 and 5 before 3?) No, wait option C's last is 3. So after 1 and 5 comes 3? No. Wait, in option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 so after the first three (4,6,2), then comes 1 (CH3), then 5 (ethyl), then 3 (Cl). But Cl has a lower para fraction than CH3 and ethyl. So that would be wrong. \n\nWait, the correct order after the meta directing group is Cl (para fraction ~ let's say 60%), then CH3 (70%), then ethyl (75%). So the order between Cl and the others must have Cl first. \n\nSo the correct order would be the meta group (0), then Cl (3), then CH3 (1), then ethyl (5). \n\nSo the options that have 4,2,6 first, followed by 3, then 1 and 5 are option A and C. \n\nOption A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 \u2192 correct. \n\nOption C:4<6<2<1<5<3 \u2192 the last item is 3, which is wrong because Cl should be before CH3 and ethyl. \n\nSo option A is correct. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. \n\nThe question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. \n\nFor substances with meta directing groups (2,4,6), the para fraction is 0. \n\nFor Cl (3), the para fraction is higher than 0 but less than the activating groups. \n\nFor activating groups (CH3 (1), C2H5 (5)), the para fraction is higher than Cl. \n\nTherefore, the order from least to most is:\n\nmeta (0) < Cl (3) < CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5). \n\nSo among all 6 substances, the order is:\n\n4,2,6 (all 0) < 3 <1 <5. \n\nSo the correct option is A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. \n\nAnother check: the options given include option A. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n1. **Meta Directing Groups (para fraction = 0%)**:\n   - **Substance 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5)**: Ester group (-COOC2H5) is a meta director.\n   - **Substance 4 (C6H5-NO2)**: Nitro group (-NO2) is a meta director.\n   - **Substance 6 (C6H5-COOH)**: Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is a meta director.\n   These three substances cannot form para-isomers, so their para fraction is 0%.\n\n2. **Ortho/Para Directing Groups**:\n   - **Substance 3 (C6H5-Cl)**: Chlorine (-Cl) is a deactivating ortho/para director. While it directs to ortho/para positions, its weaker directing effect compared to activating groups results in a moderate para fraction (~50-60%).\n   - **Substance 1 (C6H5-CH3)** and **5 (C6H5-C2H5)**: Methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-C2H5) groups are activating ortho/para directors. Their strong directing effect strongly favors the para-isomer, resulting in a high para fraction (~70-80%).\n\n**Ordering**:\n- The meta directing groups (4, 2, 6) have the lowest para fraction (0%).\n- Next is the deactivating ortho/para director (3, Cl) with moderate para fraction.\n- Finally, the activating ortho/para directors (1 and 5) have the highest para fractions.\n\nThe correct order from increasing to decreasing para fraction is **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I need to remember how substituents on the benzene ring affect the direction of substitution. \n\nFirst, I recall that the nature of the substituent determines whether the next substitution is more likely to occur in the ortho/para positions (activating groups) or meta (deactivating). But here, the question is specifically about the ratio between ortho and para, since only the para isomer's yield is considered. Wait, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe the substituent is such that it directs only to para? Or perhaps the substituents are such that ortho and para are the only possible, and the meta isn't formed because the substituent is deactivating? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe the substituents have different directing effects, leading to different ratios of ortho and para. For example, some groups might direct strongly to para, others might allow both but with different preferences. The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each substance, when bromine adds, how much of the product is the para isomer? The order should be from least to most para.\n\nLet me list the substances:\n\n1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n2) Phenyl acetate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\nWait, the substituents here are:\n\n1. Methyl (activating, ortho/para directing)\n2. Ester (COOR group, which is deactivating? Or is it meta directing? Wait, esters are usually considered deactivating and meta directing. Because the oxygen is electron-withdrawing via resonance.\n3. Chloro (Cl is ortho/para directing but weakly activating? Wait, Cl is actually a deactivating group. Wait, no: Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating. But does it direct to ortho/para or meta? Hmm. Wait, the halogens (Cl, Br) are considered ortho/para directors, even though they are deactivating. So they direct the next substitution to ortho and para positions. Wait, yes. So Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para directing group.\n4. Nitro group (NO2) is a strong deactivating group and meta directing. Because it's strongly electron-withdrawing via resonance, so it directs the incoming group to the meta position.\n5. Ethyl group (like methyl, an activating group, ortho/para directing)\n6. Carboxylic acid (COOH) is a strong deactivating group, meta directing. Because the carboxyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing through resonance, so it directs meta.\n\nSo the key here is that for each substituent, when bromine is added, where does it go?\n\nBut the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Let's see:\n\nSubstituents that direct to meta (like nitro, carboxylic acid, ester? Wait, wait, ester (COOR) is similar to the nitro group in being deactivating and meta directing? Wait, maybe I need to confirm the directing effects again.\n\nLet me list the directing effects:\n\nActivating groups (ortho/para directors):\n\n- alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, etc.)\n- -OH (phenol), -OCH3 (methoxy), -NH2, -NHR, -NHCOCH3 (anilino groups?), etc.\n\nDeactivating groups (meta directors):\n\n- nitro (-NO2), sulfonic acid (-SO3H), carboxylic acid (-COOH), esters (-COOR), amide (-CONH2?), etc.\n\nWait, so the ester group (COOR) here in substance 2 (phenyl acetate) is deactivating and meta directing. Chloro (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the halogens (Cl, Br, I) are deactivating but they are ortho/para directors. Because they have a +M (mesomeric) effect? Wait, actually, the halogens have both inductive and mesomeric effects. The inductive effect is electron-withdrawing, but the mesomeric effect (resonance) is electron-donating. The overall effect is that for halogens, the resonance effect is stronger than the inductive in directing the incoming group. So they are ortho/para directors, even though they are deactivating.\n\nSo, for Cl (substance 3), it directs to ortho and para. So when bromine adds, the product will have two isomers: ortho and para. The question is, which one is more predominant?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, that's confusing. Maybe that means that in each case, only one substitution occurs, but the substituent's directing effect determines the position. Wait, perhaps in some cases the substituent prevents ortho or meta? Or maybe the question is assuming that only one isomer forms, but that can't be. Wait, the wording says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe the substituent is such that the bromine can only go in one position? Like meta or para?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. The question says \"arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So for each substance, when you brominate, you get a mixture of ortho and para (if the directing group allows both), but the question wants the proportion of para in that mixture. For example, if a group directs equally to ortho and para, then the para fraction would be 50%. If it directs more to para, then higher fraction.\n\nSo for each substituent:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl group): activating, ortho/para directing. Since methyl is an activating group, the substitution is favored in ortho and para. But between ortho and para, which is more favored? Wait, I think for alkyl groups, the methyl group tends to direct more to para than ortho? Or is it that they are equally possible? Wait, actually, for alkyl groups, the ortho and para positions are both activated, so the product is a mixture of ortho and para, but the ratio can depend on steric factors or electronic effects. Wait, but in the case of toluene (methyl benzene), the methyl group is in the para position? Wait, no, the methyl is on the benzene ring, so when bromine is added, the positions are relative to the methyl. Wait, the question says the original substituent is on the benzene ring, and then bromine is added. For example, in toluene, the methyl is on the benzene ring, so when bromine adds, the possible positions are ortho, meta, or para relative to the methyl.\n\nWait, but methyl is an ortho/para director, so bromine can go to ortho or para. The meta position is deactivated, so it's less likely. But between ortho and para, which is more favored? I think that for alkyl groups, the para isomer is more predominant than ortho. Because the ortho position is closer to the methyl group, but maybe the para allows better resonance stabilization? Wait, perhaps the methyl group's electron-donating effect makes the para position more activated than the ortho? Or is it the other way around?\n\nHmm, maybe I should recall specific examples. For example, when toluene undergoes nitration, the major product is the para isomer, with some ortho. So the para is more than ortho. So in that case, the para fraction would be higher than 50%. So for substance 1 (toluene), the para fraction would be higher than ortho.\n\nSimilarly for ethylbenzene (substance 5), same as toluene, so same ratio.\n\nSubstance 3 is chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group, but ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go to ortho or para positions. Which is more favored here?\n\nWait, the chlorine is electron-withdrawing via inductive effect, but the resonance effect (since Cl can donate electrons via resonance?) Wait, the Cl has a lone pair, but in benzene rings, halogens are ortho/para directors because of the resonance effect (the lone pair can interact with the ring). Wait, perhaps in this case, the directing is similar to methyl but with a deactivating group. So the bromine can go to ortho or para, but which is more favored? Maybe in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions are more activated? Or maybe the para is still more favored?\n\nWait, in chlorobenzene, the major product upon nitration is para, but I think the ortho is also present. Let me think: when chlorobenzene is nitrated, the major product is the para-nitrochlorobenzene, but there's also some ortho. So the para is more than ortho. So the para fraction would be higher than 50%.\n\nWait, but the activating power of Cl is weaker than methyl. But in terms of directing, since both are ortho/para directors, but the methyl is more activating. Hmm, but the directing preference between ortho and para might be similar. So maybe the para is still more than ortho for Cl as well.\n\nNow, substance 2 is phenyl acetate (C6H5-COOC2H5). The ester group (COOR) is a deactivating, meta directing group. So when bromine is added, it can only go to the meta position? Wait, meta directing groups direct the incoming group to the meta position. So in this case, the bromine would go to the meta position only. Because it's a meta director. So the product is only the meta isomer. Therefore, the para fraction here would be 0%? Wait, but the question states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe in such cases, the substituent directs exclusively to meta, so no para isomer is formed. Therefore, the weight fraction of para would be zero. So substance 2 would have 0% para.\n\nWait, but the question says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer.\" So if some have 0, others have higher.\n\nSimilarly, substance 4 is nitrobenzene (NO2 group). Nitro is a meta director. So bromine would go to the meta position. So again, only meta isomer, so para fraction is 0%. Wait, but wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director. So yes, only meta would form. Hence, para fraction is 0% for substance 4.\n\nWait but wait, the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so for substances with meta directing groups, that derivative would be the meta, so the para fraction is zero. So substances 2 and 4 would have 0% para.\n\nSubstance 6 is benzoic acid (COOH group). Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. So same as nitro, bromine would go to meta, so para fraction is 0%.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. Let me confirm: substances with meta directing groups (like nitro, COOH, COOR) will direct to meta, so the bromine only forms the meta isomer. Therefore, their para fractions are 0%. So substances 2,4,6 have 0% para. But the options given include these in the order. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. So 4 is first (lowest), then 2, then 6. But if all three (4,2,6) have 0% para, then their order among themselves can't be determined, but maybe the question is considering that perhaps there's some other effect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the meta directing groups do allow some para product? Wait, no, meta directors should direct exclusively to meta, so the para would not form. But the problem statement says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, maybe the question is assuming that in each case, the directing group directs to a single position, so that only one isomer is formed. For example, meta directors would lead to only meta, so the para fraction is 0. Ortho/para directors would lead to only para? Or perhaps they can form both ortho and para, so the para fraction is the fraction of the total between the two.\n\nWait the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe in each case, the substituent directs so that only one isomer is possible. For example, a meta director would direct to meta, so only the meta isomer is formed. For ortho/para directors, maybe the substituent is such that ortho is blocked (like steric hindrance?), but the question says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Hmm, perhaps the question is simplifying and assuming that for meta directing groups, only meta is formed (so para fraction 0), and for ortho/para directing groups, the substituent directs equally to ortho and para, but since the question says only one isomer is formed, maybe it's considering that in some cases, the substituent prefers one position over the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when a meta director is present, the para isomer is not formed, so its fraction is zero, while for ortho/para directors, the substituent directs to both positions, so the para fraction would depend on the directing strength.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. The problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, perhaps that's a translation issue. Maybe it means that only one substitution occurs (i.e., only one bromine is added, not multiple), so that each substance gives a monosubstituted product. So each case gives a monobrominated product, but the position depends on the substituent.\n\nBut then, for meta directing groups, the product is only the meta isomer. So their para fraction is zero. For ortho/para directing substituents (like methyl, ethyl, Cl), the bromine can go to ortho or para. But the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in such cases, the substituent directs to only one of ortho or para, making only one isomer? Or maybe the question is assuming that the substituent directs to one position, so only one isomer is formed. For example, maybe the methyl group directs more to para than ortho, so in the case of toluene, the product is only the para isomer, so the fraction is 100%? That would make sense with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming that each substituent directs to either ortho, meta, or para, and thus only one isomer is formed. Because the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". So perhaps the question is considering that substituents have a strong directing effect, so that the reaction gives only the major isomer, and the other is not formed. For example, in toluene, the major isomer is para, so the product is only the para, so the fraction is 100% para. In chlorobenzene, maybe the major is para, so that's the only one formed. For meta directing groups, only meta is formed, so 0% para.\n\nWait, that would make sense with the options. Let me check again:\n\nSubstance 1: Toluene (methyl, ortho/para directing). Major product is para, so only para is formed (assuming the question takes the major product as the only one). So para fraction is 100%.\n\nSubstance 2: Phenyl acetate (COOR, meta directing). Only meta, so 0% para.\n\nSubstance 3: Chlorobenzene (Cl, ortho/para). Major product is para (as in nitration example), so 100% para?\n\nSubstance4: Nitro (meta directing), so 0% para.\n\nSubstance5: Ethylbenzene (same as toluene, so major is para, 100%).\n\nSubstance6: Benzoic acid (meta directing, 0% para).\n\nWait, but then the para fractions would be:\n\n1: 100%, 3: 100%, 5: 100%, so they are the same. But looking at the options, this can't be right. Let me see the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB)6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC)4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD)3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe for ortho/para directors, the directing is such that the para isomer is not the only one, but the question wants the proportion. Wait, but the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in those cases, only one isomer is formed. For example, maybe the substituent directs to only one position. For instance:\n\nMethyl group directs to para (so only para), Cl also directs to para (so only para?), but perhaps in some cases, the substituent directs to ortho?\n\nWait, maybe the halogens (Cl) direct to ortho and para, but in some cases, the ortho is sterically hindered? For example, in chlorobenzene, the chlorine is on the ring, so the ortho positions are adjacent to Cl. But the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in some cases, only one position is possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the meta directing groups as giving 0% para, and the ortho/para directors as giving 100% para. But then substances 1,3,5 would have 100%, so their order can't be determined. But in the options, they are ordered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para directing preference isn't 100%. Let me think again. For example, in toluene (methyl), the ratio of ortho to para is about 20:80? So the para fraction is 80%. For chlorobenzene (Cl), maybe the ratio is different, like 30:70, so 70% para. So the order would be based on which substituent gives higher or lower para fraction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects knowledge of the directing preferences and the extent of each. For instance, strong activating groups (like methyl) will have a higher proportion of para, while weaker activating groups (like Cl, which is deactivating) would have less?\n\nAlternatively, maybe substituents that are strong ortho/para directors (like methyl) give more para, and substituents that are weaker (like Cl) give less? Or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, the nitro group is a meta director (so 0% para), ester (COOR) is meta (0%), carboxylic acid (COOH) meta (0%). Then, for the ortho/para directors:\n\nMethyl (1) and ethyl (5) are activating groups. The more activating the group, the more the substitution is favored, but does that affect the ratio between ortho and para? Or does the directing preference remain the same?\n\nWait, perhaps the directing to para is stronger with activating groups. For example, methyl is a strong activator, so the para is more favored. Whereas Cl is a weaker activator (since it's deactivating), so maybe the ortho and para are closer in ratio?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro group's meta direction gives 0% para, ester same, carboxylic acid same. Then for the ortho/para directors:\n\nThe question is, which of the ortho/para directing groups gives the highest proportion of para. \n\nLet me think of specific examples:\n\nToluene (methyl) undergoes bromination. The major product is para-bromotoluene, but ortho is also present. The ratio is about 20% ortho and 80% para. So the para fraction is 80%.\n\nChlorobenzene (Cl): When brominated, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. I think the ratio here might be lower. For example, in nitration of chlorobenzene, the para product is about 70-80%? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Cl (a deactivating group) reduces the activation, but the directing to para is still there. Maybe the para fraction here is lower than toluene's 80%?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the directing effect of Cl is weaker, so the ortho is more favored than in toluene. For example, maybe chlorobenzene's bromination gives 50% para?\n\nWait, perhaps the stronger the activating group (like methyl), the more the directing effect is towards para, so the higher the para fraction. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe the para fraction is lower than methyl. So the order would be:\n\nNitro (0), ester (0), carboxylic acid (0), then Cl (maybe 50?), then methyl and ethyl (higher, like 80%). \n\nBut the options have some ordering between the ortho/para directing groups. Let's look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. The order is nitro (4) < ester (2) < carboxylic acid (6) < Cl (3) < toluene (1) < ethyl (5). Since nitro, ester, and carboxylic all have 0% para, they come first. Then Cl (3) has some small fraction? Then toluene and ethyl, which have higher. So this could be possible.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3. Hmm, 6 (COOH) is after 2 and 4? But they all have 0% so that might not be.\n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3. Wait, nitro (4) is first, then carboxylic (6), then ester (2). Then 1 and 5 (both ortho/para), then Cl (3). \n\nOption D: 3 (Cl) is first, then ethyl, etc. No, that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the order for the ortho/para directing groups (Cl, methyl, ethyl) is based on their directing efficiency towards para. \n\nMethyl and ethyl are activating groups (ortho/para directors) with methyl being a stronger activator than ethyl? Or ethyl is similar. Wait, ethyl is also an alkyl group, so similar to methyl in directing. So maybe their para fractions are similar. \n\nCl is a deactivating group (ortho/para director). The deactivating effect might mean that the para directing is weaker, so the ortho and para are more balanced. For example, maybe Cl gives a lower para fraction than methyl. \n\nSo the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be: \n\n0% (nitro, ester, COOH) < Cl (3) < methyl (1) and ethyl (5) (which are higher). \n\nBut in the options, Cl is in different positions. Let me see option A: the order after 0% groups is 3 (Cl) next, then 1 and 5. So that would fit. \n\nThe options given have:\n\nOption A lists 4<2<6 (the three 0% ones), then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. So the order is increasing: 0%, then Cl (some small value), then higher. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe the para directing efficiency is stronger in Cl than in methyl? That would reverse things, but I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nitro group is considered as meta, so 0%, then the ester (COOR) is also meta (0%). Carboxylic acid (COOH) is also 0%. \n\nThen the Cl (ortho/para director) would have a certain para fraction. The methyl and ethyl (activating, so stronger directing to para) would have higher. \n\nTherefore the order of the non-zero para fractions would be Cl < methyl/ethyl. \n\nThus, the overall order would be:\n\n0% (4,2,6) < Cl (3) < toluene (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nSo in the options, option A has 4<2<6<3<1<5. But the three zero are ordered as 4<2<6. But since all are zero, their order among themselves might not matter, but the problem requires to arrange all substances. So the first three must be the three with 0% in some order. The options A and C have the first three as 4<2<6 and 4<6<2 respectively. \n\nWait, but why would the order between 4,2,6 matter? Since all have 0%, perhaps the question considers that some meta directing groups are stronger than others, leading to perhaps a different order? Or maybe I made a mistake in assuming all meta directing groups give 0% para. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester (COOR) is a stronger meta director than nitro or carboxylic acid? Or maybe they are all same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that for the meta directing groups, there's some minor ortho or para product, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". So maybe the question is wrong in that, but according to the options, we must proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the directing effects. Let me recheck:\n\nEster group (COOR): meta directing. So bromine goes meta only. \n\nNitro (NO2): meta directing. \n\nCarboxylic acid (COOH): meta directing. \n\nThus their para fractions are 0. \n\nFor Cl (Cl): ortho/para directing. The directing effect here is such that the major product is para. The question states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so maybe in this case, only the major isomer is considered. So Cl would have 100% para? Wait, but then Cl's para fraction is same as methyl's. \n\nWait, but in that case, the order between Cl and methyl would be same. But the options have them in order. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is considering the directing efficiency, so the para directing is stronger for methyl than Cl. For example, in nitration of toluene, para is major, while in chlorobenzene, para is also major, but maybe the ratio is less. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the activating groups (methyl, ethyl) lead to a higher yield of para compared to the deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl). \n\nIf so, then the order among the ortho/para directing groups is Cl (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). \n\nThus the overall order would be the three meta directing groups (0%) first, then Cl (3) with some lower value than methyl, then methyl and ethyl. \n\nSo the correct order would be 4 (nitro), 2 (ester), 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (toluene), then 5 (ethyl). \n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. That's exactly this order. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n1. **Meta-Directing Groups (0% para-isomer):**\n   - **Nitrobenzene (4):** NO\u2082 is a strong deactivating meta-director, so bromine adds only to the meta position.\n   - **Phenyl Acetate (2):** The ester group (COOR) is deactivating and meta-directing, leading to only the meta isomer.\n   - **Benzoic Acid (6):** The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is deactivating and meta-directing, resulting in only the meta isomer.\n\n2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Non-zero para fraction):**\n   - **Chlorobenzene (3):** Cl is a weakly activating ortho/para director.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I need to remember how substituents on the benzene ring affect the direction of substitution. \n\nFirst, I recall that the nature of the substituent determines whether the next substitution is more likely to occur in the ortho/para positions (activating groups) or meta (deactivating). But here, the question is specifically about the ratio between ortho and para, since only the para isomer's yield is considered. Wait, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe the substituent is such that it directs only to para? Or perhaps the substituents are such that ortho and para are the only possible, and the meta isn't formed because the substituent is deactivating? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, maybe the substituents have different directing effects, leading to different ratios of ortho and para. For example, some groups might direct strongly to para, others might allow both but with different preferences. The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each substance, when bromine adds, how much of the product is the para isomer? The order should be from least to most para.\n\nLet me list the substances:\n\n1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n2) Phenyl acetate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n\nWait, the substituents here are:\n\n1. Methyl (activating, ortho/para directing)\n2. Ester (COOR group, which is deactivating? Or is it meta directing? Wait, esters are usually considered deactivating and meta directing. Because the oxygen is electron-withdrawing via resonance.\n3. Chloro (Cl is ortho/para directing but weakly activating? Wait, Cl is actually a deactivating group. Wait, no: Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating. But does it direct to ortho/para or meta? Hmm. Wait, the halogens (Cl, Br) are considered ortho/para directors, even though they are deactivating. So they direct the next substitution to ortho and para positions. Wait, yes. So Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para directing group.\n4. Nitro group (NO2) is a strong deactivating group and meta directing. Because it's strongly electron-withdrawing via resonance, so it directs the incoming group to the meta position.\n5. Ethyl group (like methyl, an activating group, ortho/para directing)\n6. Carboxylic acid (COOH) is a strong deactivating group, meta directing. Because the carboxyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing through resonance, so it directs meta.\n\nSo the key here is that for each substituent, when bromine is added, where does it go?\n\nBut the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Let's see:\n\nSubstituents that direct to meta (like nitro, carboxylic acid, ester? Wait, wait, ester (COOR) is similar to the nitro group in being deactivating and meta directing? Wait, maybe I need to confirm the directing effects again.\n\nLet me list the directing effects:\n\nActivating groups (ortho/para directors):\n\n- alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, etc.)\n- -OH (phenol), -OCH3 (methoxy), -NH2, -NHR, -NHCOCH3 (anilino groups?), etc.\n\nDeactivating groups (meta directors):\n\n- nitro (-NO2), sulfonic acid (-SO3H), carboxylic acid (-COOH), esters (-COOR), amide (-CONH2?), etc.\n\nWait, so the ester group (COOR) here in substance 2 (phenyl acetate) is deactivating and meta directing. Chloro (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the halogens (Cl, Br, I) are deactivating but they are ortho/para directors. Because they have a +M (mesomeric) effect? Wait, actually, the halogens have both inductive and mesomeric effects. The inductive effect is electron-withdrawing, but the mesomeric effect (resonance) is electron-donating. The overall effect is that for halogens, the resonance effect is stronger than the inductive in directing the incoming group. So they are ortho/para directors, even though they are deactivating.\n\nSo, for Cl (substance 3), it directs to ortho and para. So when bromine adds, the product will have two isomers: ortho and para. The question is, which one is more predominant?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, that's confusing. Maybe that means that in each case, only one substitution occurs, but the substituent's directing effect determines the position. Wait, perhaps in some cases the substituent prevents ortho or meta? Or maybe the question is assuming that only one isomer forms, but that can't be. Wait, the wording says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe the substituent is such that the bromine can only go in one position? Like meta or para?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. The question says \"arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer\". So for each substance, when you brominate, you get a mixture of ortho and para (if the directing group allows both), but the question wants the proportion of para in that mixture. For example, if a group directs equally to ortho and para, then the para fraction would be 50%. If it directs more to para, then higher fraction.\n\nSo for each substituent:\n\n1. Toluene (methyl group): activating, ortho/para directing. Since methyl is an activating group, the substitution is favored in ortho and para. But between ortho and para, which is more favored? Wait, I think for alkyl groups, the methyl group tends to direct more to para than ortho? Or is it that they are equally possible? Wait, actually, for alkyl groups, the ortho and para positions are both activated, so the product is a mixture of ortho and para, but the ratio can depend on steric factors or electronic effects. Wait, but in the case of toluene (methyl benzene), the methyl group is in the para position? Wait, no, the methyl is on the benzene ring, so when bromine is added, the positions are relative to the methyl. Wait, the question says the original substituent is on the benzene ring, and then bromine is added. For example, in toluene, the methyl is on the benzene ring, so when bromine adds, the possible positions are ortho, meta, or para relative to the methyl.\n\nWait, but methyl is an ortho/para director, so bromine can go to ortho or para. The meta position is deactivated, so it's less likely. But between ortho and para, which is more favored? I think that for alkyl groups, the para isomer is more predominant than ortho. Because the ortho position is closer to the methyl group, but maybe the para allows better resonance stabilization? Wait, perhaps the methyl group's electron-donating effect makes the para position more activated than the ortho? Or is it the other way around?\n\nHmm, maybe I should recall specific examples. For example, when toluene undergoes nitration, the major product is the para isomer, with some ortho. So the para is more than ortho. So in that case, the para fraction would be higher than 50%. So for substance 1 (toluene), the para fraction would be higher than ortho.\n\nSimilarly for ethylbenzene (substance 5), same as toluene, so same ratio.\n\nSubstance 3 is chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating group, but ortho/para directing. So the bromine can go to ortho or para positions. Which is more favored here?\n\nWait, the chlorine is electron-withdrawing via inductive effect, but the resonance effect (since Cl can donate electrons via resonance?) Wait, the Cl has a lone pair, but in benzene rings, halogens are ortho/para directors because of the resonance effect (the lone pair can interact with the ring). Wait, perhaps in this case, the directing is similar to methyl but with a deactivating group. So the bromine can go to ortho or para, but which is more favored? Maybe in chlorobenzene, the ortho positions are more activated? Or maybe the para is still more favored?\n\nWait, in chlorobenzene, the major product upon nitration is para, but I think the ortho is also present. Let me think: when chlorobenzene is nitrated, the major product is the para-nitrochlorobenzene, but there's also some ortho. So the para is more than ortho. So the para fraction would be higher than 50%.\n\nWait, but the activating power of Cl is weaker than methyl. But in terms of directing, since both are ortho/para directors, but the methyl is more activating. Hmm, but the directing preference between ortho and para might be similar. So maybe the para is still more than ortho for Cl as well.\n\nNow, substance 2 is phenyl acetate (C6H5-COOC2H5). The ester group (COOR) is a deactivating, meta directing group. So when bromine is added, it can only go to the meta position? Wait, meta directing groups direct the incoming group to the meta position. So in this case, the bromine would go to the meta position only. Because it's a meta director. So the product is only the meta isomer. Therefore, the para fraction here would be 0%? Wait, but the question states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe in such cases, the substituent directs exclusively to meta, so no para isomer is formed. Therefore, the weight fraction of para would be zero. So substance 2 would have 0% para.\n\nWait, but the question says \"arrange in order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer.\" So if some have 0, others have higher.\n\nSimilarly, substance 4 is nitrobenzene (NO2 group). Nitro is a meta director. So bromine would go to the meta position. So again, only meta isomer, so para fraction is 0%. Wait, but wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director. So yes, only meta would form. Hence, para fraction is 0% for substance 4.\n\nWait but wait, the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so for substances with meta directing groups, that derivative would be the meta, so the para fraction is zero. So substances 2 and 4 would have 0% para.\n\nSubstance 6 is benzoic acid (COOH group). Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. So same as nitro, bromine would go to meta, so para fraction is 0%.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. Let me confirm: substances with meta directing groups (like nitro, COOH, COOR) will direct to meta, so the bromine only forms the meta isomer. Therefore, their para fractions are 0%. So substances 2,4,6 have 0% para. But the options given include these in the order. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. So 4 is first (lowest), then 2, then 6. But if all three (4,2,6) have 0% para, then their order among themselves can't be determined, but maybe the question is considering that perhaps there's some other effect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the meta directing groups do allow some para product? Wait, no, meta directors should direct exclusively to meta, so the para would not form. But the problem statement says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, maybe the question is assuming that in each case, the directing group directs to a single position, so that only one isomer is formed. For example, meta directors would lead to only meta, so the para fraction is 0. Ortho/para directors would lead to only para? Or perhaps they can form both ortho and para, so the para fraction is the fraction of the total between the two.\n\nWait the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so maybe in each case, the substituent directs so that only one isomer is possible. For example, a meta director would direct to meta, so only the meta isomer is formed. For ortho/para directors, maybe the substituent is such that ortho is blocked (like steric hindrance?), but the question says \"it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Hmm, perhaps the question is simplifying and assuming that for meta directing groups, only meta is formed (so para fraction 0), and for ortho/para directing groups, the substituent directs equally to ortho and para, but since the question says only one isomer is formed, maybe it's considering that in some cases, the substituent prefers one position over the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when a meta director is present, the para isomer is not formed, so its fraction is zero, while for ortho/para directors, the substituent directs to both positions, so the para fraction would depend on the directing strength.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think again. The problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". Wait, perhaps that's a translation issue. Maybe it means that only one substitution occurs (i.e., only one bromine is added, not multiple), so that each substance gives a monosubstituted product. So each case gives a monobrominated product, but the position depends on the substituent.\n\nBut then, for meta directing groups, the product is only the meta isomer. So their para fraction is zero. For ortho/para directing substituents (like methyl, ethyl, Cl), the bromine can go to ortho or para. But the problem says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in such cases, the substituent directs to only one of ortho or para, making only one isomer? Or maybe the question is assuming that the substituent directs to one position, so only one isomer is formed. For example, maybe the methyl group directs more to para than ortho, so in the case of toluene, the product is only the para isomer, so the fraction is 100%? That would make sense with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming that each substituent directs to either ortho, meta, or para, and thus only one isomer is formed. Because the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". So perhaps the question is considering that substituents have a strong directing effect, so that the reaction gives only the major isomer, and the other is not formed. For example, in toluene, the major isomer is para, so the product is only the para, so the fraction is 100% para. In chlorobenzene, maybe the major is para, so that's the only one formed. For meta directing groups, only meta is formed, so 0% para.\n\nWait, that would make sense with the options. Let me check again:\n\nSubstance 1: Toluene (methyl, ortho/para directing). Major product is para, so only para is formed (assuming the question takes the major product as the only one). So para fraction is 100%.\n\nSubstance 2: Phenyl acetate (COOR, meta directing). Only meta, so 0% para.\n\nSubstance 3: Chlorobenzene (Cl, ortho/para). Major product is para (as in nitration example), so 100% para?\n\nSubstance4: Nitro (meta directing), so 0% para.\n\nSubstance5: Ethylbenzene (same as toluene, so major is para, 100%).\n\nSubstance6: Benzoic acid (meta directing, 0% para).\n\nWait, but then the para fractions would be:\n\n1: 100%, 3: 100%, 5: 100%, so they are the same. But looking at the options, this can't be right. Let me see the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nB)6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nC)4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nD)3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe for ortho/para directors, the directing is such that the para isomer is not the only one, but the question wants the proportion. Wait, but the problem states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in those cases, only one isomer is formed. For example, maybe the substituent directs to only one position. For instance:\n\nMethyl group directs to para (so only para), Cl also directs to para (so only para?), but perhaps in some cases, the substituent directs to ortho?\n\nWait, maybe the halogens (Cl) direct to ortho and para, but in some cases, the ortho is sterically hindered? For example, in chlorobenzene, the chlorine is on the ring, so the ortho positions are adjacent to Cl. But the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\"\u2014so perhaps in some cases, only one position is possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the meta directing groups as giving 0% para, and the ortho/para directors as giving 100% para. But then substances 1,3,5 would have 100%, so their order can't be determined. But in the options, they are ordered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the para directing preference isn't 100%. Let me think again. For example, in toluene (methyl), the ratio of ortho to para is about 20:80? So the para fraction is 80%. For chlorobenzene (Cl), maybe the ratio is different, like 30:70, so 70% para. So the order would be based on which substituent gives higher or lower para fraction.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects knowledge of the directing preferences and the extent of each. For instance, strong activating groups (like methyl) will have a higher proportion of para, while weaker activating groups (like Cl, which is deactivating) would have less?\n\nAlternatively, maybe substituents that are strong ortho/para directors (like methyl) give more para, and substituents that are weaker (like Cl) give less? Or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, the nitro group is a meta director (so 0% para), ester (COOR) is meta (0%), carboxylic acid (COOH) meta (0%). Then, for the ortho/para directors:\n\nMethyl (1) and ethyl (5) are activating groups. The more activating the group, the more the substitution is favored, but does that affect the ratio between ortho and para? Or does the directing preference remain the same?\n\nWait, perhaps the directing to para is stronger with activating groups. For example, methyl is a strong activator, so the para is more favored. Whereas Cl is a weaker activator (since it's deactivating), so maybe the ortho and para are closer in ratio?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro group's meta direction gives 0% para, ester same, carboxylic acid same. Then for the ortho/para directors:\n\nThe question is, which of the ortho/para directing groups gives the highest proportion of para. \n\nLet me think of specific examples:\n\nToluene (methyl) undergoes bromination. The major product is para-bromotoluene, but ortho is also present. The ratio is about 20% ortho and 80% para. So the para fraction is 80%.\n\nChlorobenzene (Cl): When brominated, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. I think the ratio here might be lower. For example, in nitration of chlorobenzene, the para product is about 70-80%? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Cl (a deactivating group) reduces the activation, but the directing to para is still there. Maybe the para fraction here is lower than toluene's 80%?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the directing effect of Cl is weaker, so the ortho is more favored than in toluene. For example, maybe chlorobenzene's bromination gives 50% para?\n\nWait, perhaps the stronger the activating group (like methyl), the more the directing effect is towards para, so the higher the para fraction. Since Cl is deactivating, maybe the para fraction is lower than methyl. So the order would be:\n\nNitro (0), ester (0), carboxylic acid (0), then Cl (maybe 50?), then methyl and ethyl (higher, like 80%). \n\nBut the options have some ordering between the ortho/para directing groups. Let's look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. The order is nitro (4) < ester (2) < carboxylic acid (6) < Cl (3) < toluene (1) < ethyl (5). Since nitro, ester, and carboxylic all have 0% para, they come first. Then Cl (3) has some small fraction? Then toluene and ethyl, which have higher. So this could be possible.\n\nOption B: 6<2<4<5<1<3. Hmm, 6 (COOH) is after 2 and 4? But they all have 0% so that might not be.\n\nOption C: 4<6<2<1<5<3. Wait, nitro (4) is first, then carboxylic (6), then ester (2). Then 1 and 5 (both ortho/para), then Cl (3). \n\nOption D: 3 (Cl) is first, then ethyl, etc. No, that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the order for the ortho/para directing groups (Cl, methyl, ethyl) is based on their directing efficiency towards para. \n\nMethyl and ethyl are activating groups (ortho/para directors) with methyl being a stronger activator than ethyl? Or ethyl is similar. Wait, ethyl is also an alkyl group, so similar to methyl in directing. So maybe their para fractions are similar. \n\nCl is a deactivating group (ortho/para director). The deactivating effect might mean that the para directing is weaker, so the ortho and para are more balanced. For example, maybe Cl gives a lower para fraction than methyl. \n\nSo the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be: \n\n0% (nitro, ester, COOH) < Cl (3) < methyl (1) and ethyl (5) (which are higher). \n\nBut in the options, Cl is in different positions. Let me see option A: the order after 0% groups is 3 (Cl) next, then 1 and 5. So that would fit. \n\nThe options given have:\n\nOption A lists 4<2<6 (the three 0% ones), then 3 (Cl), then 1 and 5. So the order is increasing: 0%, then Cl (some small value), then higher. \n\nAnother possibility: maybe the para directing efficiency is stronger in Cl than in methyl? That would reverse things, but I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nitro group is considered as meta, so 0%, then the ester (COOR) is also meta (0%). Carboxylic acid (COOH) is also 0%. \n\nThen the Cl (ortho/para director) would have a certain para fraction. The methyl and ethyl (activating, so stronger directing to para) would have higher. \n\nTherefore the order of the non-zero para fractions would be Cl < methyl/ethyl. \n\nThus, the overall order would be:\n\n0% (4,2,6) < Cl (3) < toluene (1) and ethyl (5). \n\nSo in the options, option A has 4<2<6<3<1<5. But the three zero are ordered as 4<2<6. But since all are zero, their order among themselves might not matter, but the problem requires to arrange all substances. So the first three must be the three with 0% in some order. The options A and C have the first three as 4<2<6 and 4<6<2 respectively. \n\nWait, but why would the order between 4,2,6 matter? Since all have 0%, perhaps the question considers that some meta directing groups are stronger than others, leading to perhaps a different order? Or maybe I made a mistake in assuming all meta directing groups give 0% para. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester (COOR) is a stronger meta director than nitro or carboxylic acid? Or maybe they are all same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that for the meta directing groups, there's some minor ortho or para product, but the question says \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\". So maybe the question is wrong in that, but according to the options, we must proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the directing effects. Let me recheck:\n\nEster group (COOR): meta directing. So bromine goes meta only. \n\nNitro (NO2): meta directing. \n\nCarboxylic acid (COOH): meta directing. \n\nThus their para fractions are 0. \n\nFor Cl (Cl): ortho/para directing. The directing effect here is such that the major product is para. The question states \"only one monobromo derivative is formed\", so maybe in this case, only the major isomer is considered. So Cl would have 100% para? Wait, but then Cl's para fraction is same as methyl's. \n\nWait, but in that case, the order between Cl and methyl would be same. But the options have them in order. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is considering the directing efficiency, so the para directing is stronger for methyl than Cl. For example, in nitration of toluene, para is major, while in chlorobenzene, para is also major, but maybe the ratio is less. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the activating groups (methyl, ethyl) lead to a higher yield of para compared to the deactivating ortho/para directors (Cl). \n\nIf so, then the order among the ortho/para directing groups is Cl (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). \n\nThus the overall order would be the three meta directing groups (0%) first, then Cl (3) with some lower value than methyl, then methyl and ethyl. \n\nSo the correct order would be 4 (nitro), 2 (ester), 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (toluene), then 5 (ethyl). \n\nLooking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. That's exactly this order. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n1. **Meta-Directing Groups (0% para-isomer):**\n   - **Nitrobenzene (4):** NO\u2082 is a strong deactivating meta-director, so bromine adds only to the meta position.\n   - **Phenyl Acetate (2):** The ester group (COOR) is deactivating and meta-directing, leading to only the meta isomer.\n   - **Benzoic Acid (6):** The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is deactivating and meta-directing, resulting in only the meta isomer.\n\n2. **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups (Non-zero para fraction):**\n   - **Chlorobenzene (3):** Cl is a weakly activating ortho/para director. Bromine primarily adds to the para position, but the deactivating nature of Cl reduces the para preference compared to stronger activating groups.\n   - **Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** Both have activating alkyl groups (\u2013CH\u2083 and \u2013C\u2082H\u2085), which strongly direct bromine to the para position. Toluene and ethylbenzene have higher para fractions than chlorobenzene due to stronger activation.\n\n**Ordering:** \n- The three meta-directing groups (4, 2, 6) all have 0% para fraction and are ordered first. \n- Among ortho/para directors, chlorobenzene (3) has the lowest para fraction, followed by toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5). \n\nThe correct order is **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**, matching option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
