      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this physics problem about a supernova ejecta and reference frames. Hmm. The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The given speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s towards the center. But since both frames are inertial, I should consider relativity here, right? Like time dilation?\n\nWait, the problem mentions that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed? Or is there a difference because of relative velocity?\n\nOh wait, in special relativity, if two objects are moving towards each other at speed v in each other's frames, that's a classic case where you have to use the relativistic velocity addition. But maybe here, since the speed is given from the ejecta's frame, we can compute the time dilation effect.\n\nThe key point here is that the time measured in the ejecta's frame (50 seconds) is different from the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. Because of time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would then be the speed (in Galaxy's frame) multiplied by that dilated time.\n\nWait, but first, what's the speed in the Galaxy's frame? Since the ejecta is moving towards the center at some speed, which from its own frame, it's stationary and the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed must be such that when you switch frames, the velocities add appropriately. Wait, but in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v, so in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at v. Wait, that's actually correct in classical mechanics. But since the speeds here are a significant fraction of the speed of light?\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s. Let me check the speed of light: c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So that's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects will be noticeable here. So we can't ignore time dilation.\n\nSo, the problem is about time dilation. The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame would be gamma times that. Then the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the Galaxy's time.\n\nWait, but what's the speed v in the Galaxy's frame? Since the ejecta is moving at v towards the center in the Galaxy's frame, so the speed v is 60,000 km/s? Wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nIf in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be moving towards the center at the same speed. Because in inertial frames, if two objects are moving towards each other with speed v in each other's frames, then their speed in the other's frame is not simply v (classically it would be 2v, but relativistically it's different). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up here.\n\nWait, actually, in special relativity, if an object is moving at speed u relative to frame S, then in the object's frame S', the frame S is moving at -u. So in this case, the ejecta's frame (S') is moving at v (towards the center) relative to the Galaxy frame (S). Therefore, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at v. So the given speed of 60,000 km/s is v. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta's speed is v = 60,000 km/s. That makes sense. So the speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer because of time dilation. The proper time (the time measured in the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds. The formula for time dilation is \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394\u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo first, let's compute \u03b3. The Lorentz factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute v/c first. v is 6e4 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2. Therefore, (v/c)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 0.9798. Wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. Therefore, \u03b3 = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Wait, let me compute that more precisely.\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0206. Let me confirm with calculator steps:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s. c = 3e5 km/s. v/c = 0.2. So (v/c)^2 = 0.04. 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.9798. So \u03b3 \u2248 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. So \u03b3 is approximately 1.0206.\n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394\u03c4 = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s. Let me calculate that:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. Then 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800. So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options are 3,060,000 (D) or 3,000,000 (B). Hmm. Wait, maybe my approximation for gamma is leading to inaccuracies here. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximating. Let me see:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute the exact value:\n\nv = 6e4 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2, so squared is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/sqrt(25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5. So sqrt(6) is approximately 2.44949. So sqrt(24) is 2.44949 * 2 = 4.89898. So sqrt(0.96) is 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.020620726.\n\nSo \u03b3 is approximately 1.020620726. So \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 50 * 1.020620726. Let's calculate that:\n\n50 * 1.020620726 = 51.0310363 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 = ?\n\n60,000 * 1 = 60,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0310363 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.0010363 \u2248 62.178. So total 1,800 +62.178 = 1,862.178. So total for 1.0310363 is 60,000 + 1,862.178 = 61,862.178. So adding that to 3,000,000 gives 3,061,862.178 km. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. But maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider length contraction? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, their own clock measures 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta would have been moving for that longer time. Therefore, distance is v * (gamma * t).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think of the spacetime interval.\n\nThe proper time \u0394\u03c4 is related to the coordinate time \u0394t via \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Wait, actually the formula is \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Wait, no, actually the correct formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394\u03c4, so \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t / \u03b3. So if \u0394\u03c4 is the proper time (the time measured in the ejecta's frame, which is moving), then yes. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is 60,000 km/s, and over the time \u0394t in that frame, the distance would be v * \u0394t. So my calculation seems right.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm. The value I got was approximately 3,061,862 km. So the closest is D, 3,060,000. That would be the answer. But maybe I made a miscalculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not have used time dilation, but another approach. Wait, maybe the question is simpler. Because maybe they are considering that in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the center is shorter due to length contraction, but that might complicate things. Wait, the question is about the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect to use classical time, but that would give 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option B). But that would ignore time dilation. But the problem states that both are inertial frames and to consider relativity. So probably need to use the relativistic approach, which gives D. But why is there an option B?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me check again.\n\nv = 0.2c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. Let's compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's see: 0.98 squared is 0.9604. Oh, wait! Wait a minute! Wait, 0.98^2 is (0.98)*(0.98) = 0.9604. That's very close to 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, but actually, since 0.98 squared is 0.9604, then sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let me consider f(x) = sqrt(x). At x=0.9604, f(x)=0.98. We want f(0.96). The difference is delta_x = -0.0004. The derivative f\u2019(x)= (1/(2 sqrt(x))). So f\u2019(0.9604)=1/(2*0.98) \u2248 0.5102. So delta_f \u2248 f\u2019 * delta_x \u2248 0.5102 * (-0.0004) \u2248 -0.0002. Therefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 -0.0002 = 0.9798. So that's consistent with previous.\n\nTherefore, 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So the gamma is correct.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. Then the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Wait, let me think again. The problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\".\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, so in 50 seconds, the center would move 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. But that's in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nWait, but the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be different because of length contraction. Wait, maybe that's the confusion here. Let me think.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that time (which we calculated as ~3,061,862 km). Alternatively, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center moves is 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, that distance would be length-contracted by a factor of 1/gamma?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the distance in the ejecta's frame is the contracted length. Hmm, getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe distance between the ejecta and the center in the ejecta's frame would be the distance that the center moves in 50 seconds, which is 60,000 *50 = 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the distance between them would be longer due to length contraction? Wait, no. The proper length is in the frame where the two objects are at rest. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance between the ejecta and the center is not a rest length. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394\u03c4. The distance is v * \u0394t. Which gives us the same result as before. So that would be 60,000 * 1.0206 *50 \u2248 3,061,800, which is option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. The options given have D as 3,060,000, which is close. Maybe I approximated gamma too much? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use classical physics, but that would give 3,000,000 (B). But the problem mentions both are inertial frames, so it's likely expecting relativity. Since the speed is 0.2c, time dilation is non-negligible, so the answer must be D.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the options. The difference between B and D is 60,000 km. The calculation gives about 3,061,862, which rounds to 3,060,000 if they are using approximate gamma. Let me see, if gamma is exactly 1.0206207, then 1.0206207*50 is 51.031035. 60,000 *51.031035 = 60,000 *51.031035.\n\nWait, 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.031035 is 1,862.1, so total 3,061,862.1. So if the question expects to use gamma as 1.02 (maybe they approximate sqrt(0.96) as 0.98, then 1/0.98 is 1.0204, so gamma is approximately 1.0204, then 1.0204*50 = 51.02 seconds. Then 60,000 *51.02 = 60,000*51 = 3,060,000 plus 60,000*0.02 = 1,200 \u2192 total 3,061,200. Still close to 3,060,000. So maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest 10,000 km. So the answer would be D.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n",

The formula for time dilation is \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394\u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo first, let's compute \u03b3. The Lorentz factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute v/c first. v is 6e4 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2. Therefore, (v/c)^2 = 0.04. So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 0.9798. Wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. Therefore, \u03b3 = 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Wait, let me compute that more precisely.\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0206.

So \u03b3 is approximately 1.0206.\n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394\u03c4 = 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nThen the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.

Wait, maybe my approximation for gamma is leading to inaccuracies here. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximating. Let me see:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)).\n\nLet me compute the exact value:\n\nv = 6e4 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2, so squared is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/sqrt(25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5. So sqrt(6) is approximately 2.44949. So sqrt(24) is 2.44949 * 2 = 4.89898. So sqrt(0.96) is 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.020620726.\n\nSo \u03b3 is approximately 1.020620726. So \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 50 * 1.020620726. Let's calculate that:\n\n50 * 1.020620726 = 51.0310363 seconds.\n\nSo the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 = ?\n\n60,000 * 1 = 60,000.\n\n60,000 * 0.0310363 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.0010363 \u2248 62.178. So total 1,800 +62.178 = 1,862.178. So total for 1.0310363 is 60,000 + 1,862.178 = 61,862.178. So adding that to 3,000,000 gives 3,061,862.178 km. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. But maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider length contraction? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, their own clock measures 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the ejecta would have been moving for that longer time. Therefore, distance is v * (gamma * t).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think of the spacetime interval.\n\nThe proper time \u0394\u03c4 is related to the coordinate time \u0394t via \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Wait, actually the formula is \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t * sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Wait, no, actually the correct formula is \u0394t = \u03b3 \u0394\u03c4, so \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t / \u03b3. So if \u0394\u03c4 is the proper time (the time measured in the ejecta's frame, which is moving), then yes. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. The ejecta is moving towards the center, so from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is 60,000 km/s, and over the time \u0394t in that frame, the distance would be v * \u0394t. So my calculation seems right.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km.\n\nB) 3,000,000 km.\n\nC) 2,880,000 km.\n\nD) 3,060,000 km.\n\nHmm. The value I got was approximately 3,061,862 km. So the closest is D, 3,060,000. That would be the answer. But maybe I made a miscalculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not have used time dilation, but another approach. Wait, maybe the question is simpler. Because maybe they are considering that in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the center is shorter due to length contraction, but that might complicate things. Wait, the question is about the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's time. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect to use classical time, but that would give 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option B). But that would ignore time dilation. But the problem states that both are inertial frames and to consider relativity. So probably need to use the relativistic approach, which gives D. But why is there an option B?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me check again.\n\nv = 0.2c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. Let's compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's see: 0.98 squared is 0.9604. Oh, wait! Wait a minute! Wait, 0.98^2 is (0.98)*(0.98) = 0.9604. That's very close to 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, but actually, since 0.98 squared is 0.9604, then sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use linear approximation. Let me consider f(x) = sqrt(x). At x=0.9604, f(x)=0.98. We want f(0.96). The difference is delta_x = -0.0004. The derivative f\u2019(x)= (1/(2 sqrt(x))). So f\u2019(0.9604)=1/(2*0.98) \u2248 0.5102. So delta_f \u2248 f\u2019 * delta_x \u2248 0.5102 * (-0.0004) \u2248 -0.0002. Therefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 -0.0002 = 0.9798. So that's consistent with previous.\n\nTherefore, 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So the gamma is correct.\n\nSo the calculation is correct. Then the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Wait, let me think again. The problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\".\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, so in 50 seconds, the center would move 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. But that's in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nWait, but the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be different because of length contraction. Wait, maybe that's the confusion here. Let me think.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that time (which we calculated as ~3,061,862 km). Alternatively, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center moves is 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, that distance would be length-contracted by a factor of 1/gamma?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the distance in the ejecta's frame is the contracted length. Hmm, getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe distance between the ejecta and the center in the ejecta's frame would be the distance that the center moves in 50 seconds, which is 60,000 *50 = 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the distance between them would be longer due to length contraction? Wait, no. The proper length is in the frame where the two objects are at rest. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance between the ejecta and the center is not a rest length. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is \u0394t = \u03b3 * \u0394\u03c4. The distance is v * \u0394t. Which gives us the same result as before. So that would be 60,000 * 1.0206 *50 \u2248 3,061,800, which is option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. The options given have D as 3,060,000, which is close. Maybe I approximated gamma too much? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use classical physics, but that would give 3,000,000 (B). But the problem mentions both are inertial frames, so it's likely expecting relativity. Since the speed is 0.2c, time dilation is non-negligible, so the answer must be D.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the options. The difference between B and D is 60,000 km. The calculation gives about 3,061,862, which rounds to 3,060,000 if they are using approximate gamma. Let me see, if gamma is exactly 1.0206207, then 1.0206207*50 is 51.031035. 60,000 *51.031035 = 60,000 *51.031035.\n\nWait, 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.031035 is 1,862.1, so total 3,061,862.1. So if the question expects to use gamma as 1.02 (maybe they approximate sqrt(0.96) as 0.98, then 1/0.98 is 1.0204, so gamma is approximately 1.0204, then 1.0204*50 = 51.02 seconds. Then 60,000 *51.02 = 60,000*51 = 3,060,000 plus 60,000*0.02 = 1,200 \u2192 total 3,061,200. Still close to 3,060,000. So maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest 10,000 km. So the answer would be D.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the distance traveled by supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s (0.2c). Using time dilation from special relativity, the proper time (ejecta's frame) is related to the dilated time (Galaxy's frame) by \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394\u03c4. \n\nThe Lorentz factor \u03b3 is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\nThe dilated time is:\n\\[\n\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta\\tau = 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\nThe distance in the Galaxy's frame is then:\n\\[\nd = v \\times \\Delta t = 60,000 \\text{ km/s} \\times 51.03 \\text{ s} \\approx 3,061,862 \\text{ km}\n\\]\nThe closest option to this value is **D) 3,060,000 km**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the galactic center. The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The given speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s towards them. Wait, but since both are inertial frames, we need to consider relativity here, probably time dilation?\n\nRight, because the frames are moving relative to each other, so there's a relativistic effect. The ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c.\n\nThe problem is about time dilation. The time measured in the ejecta's frame (their proper time) is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the speed of the ejecta in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame. But how do we relate the times?\n\nWait, actually, let me think. The ejecta's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy. The speed given (60,000 km/s) is the speed of the galaxy center relative to the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, but we need to confirm that. Wait, velocity addition? Wait no, because if the ejecta is moving towards the center at v in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at v. So maybe the speed is the same in both frames? Wait, no, that can't be right because velocities don't just directly transfer in relativity. Wait, maybe I need to use the velocity addition formula here?\n\nWait, but perhaps since both are inertial frames, and the relative velocity is v, then the speed in each frame is the same? Wait, no, that's only if the direction is considered. Let me think again. Let me denote the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as v. Then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So that's correct. So the speed given is v = 0.2c.\n\nThe problem is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so distance is v * t (Galaxy's time).\n\nBut since the ejecta's time is the proper time, right? Because the 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's rest frame. So the proper time \u0394\u03c4 is 50 s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame \u0394t would be \u03b3\u0394\u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but actually, the proper time is the time between two events that occur at the same place in the rest frame. In this case, the two events could be, say, the ejecta's clock starting and stopping at 50 seconds. So those events happen at the same location in the ejecta's frame, so the proper time is indeed 50 s. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute that. Since v is 0.2c:\n\nv/c = 0.2, so (v/c)^2 = 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately... Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Wait, so gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo the time in the Galaxy's frame would be \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4 \u2248 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t. The velocity v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that:\n\n60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, and 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total would be 3,000,000 +61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options are A) 2,940,000, B) 3,000,000, C) 2,880,000, D)3,060,000.\n\nWait, but my calculation gives approx 3,061,800 which is close to D) 3,060,000. But maybe I made an approximation error. Let's check the exact value.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. Let's see:\n\nv = 0.2c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 (2*2.44949)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. So gamma is 1/0.9797958976 \u2248 1.020620726.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. Multiply by 50 seconds gives:\n\n1.020620726 *50 = 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 *51.0310363.\n\nLet me calculate that precisely:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0310363 = 60,000 *1 + 60,000 *0.0310363\n\n= 60,000 + (60,000 *0.0310363)\n\n60,000 *0.0310363 = 60,000 *0.03 is 1,800, and 0.0010363 *60,000 is 62.18. So total is 1,800 +62.18 = 1,862.18. So total for the 1.031 part is 60,000 +1,862.18 = 61,862.18.\n\nAdding to the 3,000,000 gives 3,061,862.18 km. Which is approximately 3,061,862 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000. Hmm, but maybe the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects? Wait, but the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can't ignore relativity here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question is simpler. Let me read again. The question says, \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is just v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, but adjusted by length contraction? Wait no. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time in that frame. Since in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but that's proper time, so the Galaxy frame's time is longer. Therefore, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v*(gamma*50). \n\nWait that's what I did earlier. So that gives the ~3.06 million, which is option D. But why is that not matching some of the options?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the velocity wrong? Wait, the problem says the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. The ejecta sees the center moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed? Wait, no. Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. In the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them at velocity v. So in that case, the speed is the same in both frames? But that can't be right in relativity. \n\nWait, hold on, velocity isn't the same in different frames. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again. \n\nThe speed given is the speed of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame. Let me denote the speed in the Galaxy's frame as u. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the speed in the ejecta's frame (which is moving at speed u towards the galaxy in the Galaxy's frame) would be?\n\nWait, the velocity addition formula says that if S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame moving at speed u relative to S towards the center (so in the S' frame, the center is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s). So the velocity of the center in S' is v = (u + v')/(1 + (u*v')/c\u00b2 ), but maybe I'm mixing variables here.\n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame (S') is given as v = 60,000 km/s. So in S (Galaxy frame), the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving at speed u. Then, according to S', the center's speed is v. So using the Lorentz transformation for velocity, the velocity in S' is v = (u + 0)/(1 + 0) )? Wait, no. Wait, the velocity addition formula is needed here.\n\nThe formula for velocity in the S' frame (moving at speed u relative to S) is:\n\nv' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but in this case, in the S frame (Galaxy), the center is at rest (v = 0), so the velocity of the center in S' is:\n\nv' = (0 - u)/(1 - 0) ) = -u. \n\nWait, that's right. So the velocity of the center in S' is -u (since S' is moving at u towards the center). But according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that's positive in their frame. So the velocity of the center in S' is +60,000 km/s. Wait, but according to the above calculation, that velocity is -u. Wait, maybe the sign is flipped based on direction. Let me clarify directions.\n\nLet me set coordinates: in the Galaxy frame (S), the center is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it with velocity u (positive direction towards the center). So in S', the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them with velocity v = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe velocity transformation equation for S' moving at u relative to S (so S' is moving in the positive direction at speed u from S's perspective). Wait, actually, if S' is the ejecta's frame, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (let's say the positive direction), so S' is moving at velocity u in the +x direction (towards the center). Then, the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) in S' is given by:\n\nv' = (v - u)/ (1 - (v u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, v (velocity of the center in S) is 0, so:\n\nv' = ( -u ) / (1 - 0 ) = -u. \n\nBut according to the problem, the center is moving towards the ejecta at +v' (positive direction in S'). So perhaps the sign is an issue here. Let me think: in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta, so the velocity is positive in S', but according to the formula, it's -u. So perhaps u is negative in the S frame? Wait no, perhaps I need to be careful with directions. Let me set the coordinate system such that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving in the positive x direction towards the center. Then in S', which is the ejecta's frame, the center is moving in the positive x direction (towards the ejecta's frame). \n\nWait, then in S', the center has velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. According to the velocity transformation, since in S, the center is at rest (v =0), and S' is moving at u (speed towards the center, so u is positive in S). Then the velocity of the center in S' is v' = (0 - u)/ (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u. So that would mean v' = -u. But according to the problem, v' is +60,000 km/s. So that would require that -u = +60,000 \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s? But that would mean in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving in the negative direction, which contradicts the problem's statement. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is that the frames are moving towards each other, so the velocity in each other's frames is the same? Wait, perhaps in relativity, when two objects are moving towards each other at speed v in each other's frames, that's only possible if v is less than c, but the actual velocity in one frame would be different. Wait, maybe I need to set up the problem correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the speed given is the speed in the ejecta's frame, and we can take that as the same speed in the Galaxy's frame? But that would be non-relativistic. However, the problem mentions both are inertial frames, so we have to consider relativity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where since they are inertial frames, the distance is simply speed multiplied by time in the ejecta's frame, but that would be non-relativistic. Wait, but the ejecta's frame's time is different from the galaxy's. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the ejecta's frame, the distance traveled by the center is v*t_ejecta = 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km. But in the galaxy's frame, that distance would be length contracted. Wait, but length contraction is along the direction of motion. Wait, but the distance between the ejecta and the center in the galaxy's frame is different. \n\nAlternatively, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is just the speed in the galaxy's frame multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. Since in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed u (which would be equal to the given 60,000 km/s?), but no, that's conflicting with the earlier velocity transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic? Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a relativistic speed, but maybe the question expects using classical physics?\n\nWait, the problem says \"both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference.\" So we can't ignore relativity here. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial approach was correct, and the answer is D) 3,060,000 km. Because the calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 which rounds to 3,060,000 (if they took gamma as exactly 1.02062, then 50*1.02062 = 51.031, so 60,000 *51.031 is 3,061,860 which is very close to D's 3,060,000. But why is the answer not exactly 3,061,860? Maybe they used an approximate gamma?\n\nWait, let me check the gamma calculation again. Let me compute gamma precisely:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c (since c is 3e5 km/s). So v/c = 0.2. \n\nThen gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96) precisely:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6)=4*2.449489743=9.797958974. So sqrt(0.96)=9.797958974/10\u22480.9797958974. Thus 1/0.9797958974 \u22481.020620726.\n\nSo gamma is exactly that. \n\nThus, the time in the galaxy frame is 50 * 1.020620726 \u224851.0310363 seconds. \n\nMultiply by velocity 6e4 km/s:\n\n6e4 *51.0310363 = 6e4 *51.0310363.\n\nCalculate 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 *0.0310363 \u2248 60,000 *0.03 = 1,800, plus 60,000 *0.0010363 = ~62.18. So total 1,800 +62.18 = 1,862.18. So total distance is 3,060,000 +1,862.18 \u22483,061,862 km. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06 million. The calculation gives ~3.06186 million, so the closest is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the time in the galaxy frame is just 50 seconds, leading to 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 (option B). But that would ignore time dilation, which contradicts the problem's mention of inertial frames. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the time dilation direction. Let me think again: the proper time is the shortest time. The time in the moving frame (ejecta) is shorter. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more. So the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the longer time. So that would be the correct approach, leading to D. \n\nThus, the answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the galactic center. The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The given speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s towards them. Wait, but since both are inertial frames, we need to consider relativity here, probably time dilation?\n\nRight, because the frames are moving relative to each other, so there's a relativistic effect. The ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.2c.\n\nThe problem is about time dilation. The time measured in the ejecta's frame (their proper time) is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the speed of the ejecta in that frame multiplied by the time elapsed in that frame. But how do we relate the times?\n\nWait, actually, let me think. The ejecta's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy. The speed given (60,000 km/s) is the speed of the galaxy center relative to the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, but we need to confirm that. Wait, velocity addition? Wait no, because if the ejecta is moving towards the center at v in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at v. So maybe the speed is the same in both frames? Wait, no, that can't be right because velocities don't just directly transfer in relativity. Wait, maybe I need to use the velocity addition formula here?\n\nWait, but perhaps since both are inertial frames, and the relative velocity is v, then the speed in each frame is the same? Wait, no, that's only if the direction is considered. Let me think again. Let me denote the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame as v. Then in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So that's correct. So the speed given is v = 0.2c.\n\nThe problem is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so distance is v * t (Galaxy's time).\n\nBut since the ejecta's time is the proper time, right? Because the 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's rest frame. So the proper time \u0394\u03c4 is 50 s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame \u0394t would be \u03b3\u0394\u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, but actually, the proper time is the time between two events that occur at the same place in the rest frame. In this case, the two events could be, say, the ejecta's clock starting and stopping at 50 seconds. So those events happen at the same location in the ejecta's frame, so the proper time is indeed 50 s. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer by a factor of gamma.\n\nSo gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let's compute that. Since v is 0.2c:\n\nv/c = 0.2, so (v/c)^2 = 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is approximately... Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. Wait, so gamma is approximately 1.0206.\n\nSo the time in the Galaxy's frame would be \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4 \u2248 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t. The velocity v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that:\n\n60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 *51.03 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, and 60,000 *1.03 = 61,800. So total would be 3,000,000 +61,800 = 3,061,800 km. Hmm, but the options are A) 2,940,000, B) 3,000,000, C) 2,880,000, D)3,060,000.\n\nWait, but my calculation gives approx 3,061,800 which is close to D) 3,060,000. But maybe I made an approximation error. Let's check the exact value.\n\nLet me compute gamma more accurately. Let's see:\n\nv = 0.2c, so v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04. So 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 \u2248 (2*2.44949)/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 = 0.9797958976. So gamma is 1/0.9797958976 \u2248 1.020620726.\n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.020620726. Multiply by 50 seconds gives:\n\n1.020620726 *50 = 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 *51.0310363.\n\nLet me calculate that precisely:\n\n60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.\n\n60,000 *1.0310363 = 60,000 *1 + 60,000 *0.0310363\n\n= 60,000 + (60,000 *0.0310363)\n\n60,000 *0.0310363 = 60,000 *0.03 is 1,800, and 0.0010363 *60,000 is 62.18. So total is 1,800 +62.18 = 1,862.18. So total for the 1.031 part is 60,000 +1,862.18 = 61,862.18.\n\nAdding to the 3,000,000 gives 3,061,862.18 km. Which is approximately 3,061,862 km. The closest option is D) 3,060,000. Hmm, but maybe the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects? Wait, but the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can't ignore relativity here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question is simpler. Let me read again. The question says, \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is just v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, but adjusted by length contraction? Wait no. Wait, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity in that frame multiplied by the time in that frame. Since in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but that's proper time, so the Galaxy frame's time is longer. Therefore, the distance in the Galaxy frame is v*(gamma*50). \n\nWait that's what I did earlier. So that gives the ~3.06 million, which is option D. But why is that not matching some of the options?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the velocity wrong? Wait, the problem says the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. The ejecta sees the center moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed? Wait, no. Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. In the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them at velocity v. So in that case, the speed is the same in both frames? But that can't be right in relativity. \n\nWait, hold on, velocity isn't the same in different frames. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again. \n\nThe speed given is the speed of the galaxy's center in the ejecta's frame. Let me denote the speed in the Galaxy's frame as u. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the speed in the ejecta's frame (which is moving at speed u towards the galaxy in the Galaxy's frame) would be?\n\nWait, the velocity addition formula says that if S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame moving at speed u relative to S towards the center (so in the S' frame, the center is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s). So the velocity of the center in S' is v = (u + v')/(1 + (u*v')/c\u00b2 ), but maybe I'm mixing variables here.\n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the center in the ejecta's frame (S') is given as v = 60,000 km/s. So in S (Galaxy frame), the center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving at speed u. Then, according to S', the center's speed is v. So using the Lorentz transformation for velocity, the velocity in S' is v = (u + 0)/(1 + 0) )? Wait, no. Wait, the velocity addition formula is needed here.\n\nThe formula for velocity in the S' frame (moving at speed u relative to S) is:\n\nv' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but in this case, in the S frame (Galaxy), the center is at rest (v = 0), so the velocity of the center in S' is:\n\nv' = (0 - u)/(1 - 0) ) = -u. \n\nWait, that's right. So the velocity of the center in S' is -u (since S' is moving at u towards the center). But according to the problem, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So that's positive in their frame. So the velocity of the center in S' is +60,000 km/s. Wait, but according to the above calculation, that velocity is -u. Wait, maybe the sign is flipped based on direction. Let me clarify directions.\n\nLet me set coordinates: in the Galaxy frame (S), the center is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it with velocity u (positive direction towards the center). So in S', the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards them with velocity v = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe velocity transformation equation for S' moving at u relative to S (so S' is moving in the positive direction at speed u from S's perspective). Wait, actually, if S' is the ejecta's frame, then in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center (let's say the positive direction), so S' is moving at velocity u in the +x direction (towards the center). Then, the velocity of the center (which is at rest in S) in S' is given by:\n\nv' = (v - u)/ (1 - (v u)/c\u00b2 )\n\nHere, v (velocity of the center in S) is 0, so:\n\nv' = ( -u ) / (1 - 0 ) = -u. \n\nBut according to the problem, the center is moving towards the ejecta at +v' (positive direction in S'). So perhaps the sign is an issue here. Let me think: in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta, so the velocity is positive in S', but according to the formula, it's -u. So perhaps u is negative in the S frame? Wait no, perhaps I need to be careful with directions. Let me set the coordinate system such that in S (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving in the positive x direction towards the center. Then in S', which is the ejecta's frame, the center is moving in the positive x direction (towards the ejecta's frame). \n\nWait, then in S', the center has velocity v' = 60,000 km/s. According to the velocity transformation, since in S, the center is at rest (v =0), and S' is moving at u (speed towards the center, so u is positive in S). Then the velocity of the center in S' is v' = (0 - u)/ (1 - (0 * u)/c\u00b2 ) = -u. So that would mean v' = -u. But according to the problem, v' is +60,000 km/s. So that would require that -u = +60,000 \u2192 u = -60,000 km/s? But that would mean in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving in the negative direction, which contradicts the problem's statement. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is that the frames are moving towards each other, so the velocity in each other's frames is the same? Wait, perhaps in relativity, when two objects are moving towards each other at speed v in each other's frames, that's only possible if v is less than c, but the actual velocity in one frame would be different. Wait, maybe I need to set up the problem correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the speed given is the speed in the ejecta's frame, and we can take that as the same speed in the Galaxy's frame? But that would be non-relativistic. However, the problem mentions both are inertial frames, so we have to consider relativity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where since they are inertial frames, the distance is simply speed multiplied by time in the ejecta's frame, but that would be non-relativistic. Wait, but the ejecta's frame's time is different from the galaxy's. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the ejecta's frame, the distance traveled by the center is v*t_ejecta = 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km. But in the galaxy's frame, that distance would be length contracted. Wait, but length contraction is along the direction of motion. Wait, but the distance between the ejecta and the center in the galaxy's frame is different. \n\nAlternatively, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is just the speed in the galaxy's frame multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. Since in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed u (which would be equal to the given 60,000 km/s?), but no, that's conflicting with the earlier velocity transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic? Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a relativistic speed, but maybe the question expects using classical physics?\n\nWait, the problem says \"both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference.\" So we can't ignore relativity here. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial approach was correct, and the answer is D) 3,060,000 km. Because the calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 which rounds to 3,060,000 (if they took gamma as exactly 1.02062, then 50*1.02062 = 51.031, so 60,000 *51.031 is 3,061,860 which is very close to D's 3,060,000. But why is the answer not exactly 3,061,860? Maybe they used an approximate gamma?\n\nWait, let me check the gamma calculation again. Let me compute gamma precisely:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c (since c is 3e5 km/s). So v/c = 0.2. \n\nThen gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96) precisely:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96) is sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6)=4*2.449489743=9.797958974. So sqrt(0.96)=9.797958974/10\u22480.9797958974. Thus 1/0.9797958974 \u22481.020620726.\n\nSo gamma is exactly that. \n\nThus, the time in the galaxy frame is 50 * 1.020620726 \u224851.0310363 seconds. \n\nMultiply by velocity 6e4 km/s:\n\n6e4 *51.0310363 = 6e4 *51.0310363.\n\nCalculate 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 *0.0310363 \u2248 60,000 *0.03 = 1,800, plus 60,000 *0.0010363 = ~62.18. So total 1,800 +62.18 = 1,862.18. So total distance is 3,060,000 +1,862.18 \u22483,061,862 km. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06 million. The calculation gives ~3.06186 million, so the closest is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the time in the galaxy frame is just 50 seconds, leading to 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 (option B). But that would ignore time dilation, which contradicts the problem's mention of inertial frames. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the time dilation direction. Let me think again: the proper time is the shortest time. The time in the moving frame (ejecta) is shorter. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the galaxy's clock shows more. So the distance in the galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the longer time. So that would be the correct approach, leading to D. \n\nThus, the answer should be D.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Since both frames are inertial and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c), relativistic effects must be considered. \n\nFirst, compute the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) using v = 0.2c:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\n\nThe time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (\u0394t) is the proper time (\u0394\u03c4 = 50 s) multiplied by \u03b3:\n\\[\n\\Delta t = \\gamma \\cdot \\Delta\\tau \\approx 1.0206 \\cdot 50 \\approx 51.03\\ \\text{seconds}\n\\]\n\nThe distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = v \\cdot \\Delta t = 60,000\\ \\text{km/s} \\cdot 51.03\\ \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,862\\ \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **D) 3,060,000 km**.\n\nAnswer: D",
