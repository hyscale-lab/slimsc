      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. But then they mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that must relate to their peak emission wavelengths, right? Oh right, Wien's Law! Because Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength (\u03bb_max) is inversely proportional to the star's temperature. So if both stars have the same \u03bb_max, their temperatures must be the same. \n\nWait, so their temperatures are equal. Then, luminosity for a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio would depend on the square of their radii. \n\nStar_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. That would make the luminosity ratio 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options include other numbers like 2.32 or 2.35. Did I miss something here?\n\nWait, the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 is 0 km/s, Star_2 is 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, so radial velocity shouldn't directly affect it. Unless there's a relativistic effect? But maybe they're talking about the Doppler shift affecting the measured wavelength? Wait, but the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So even with the Doppler shift, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. \n\nWait, let's think again. The Doppler effect would shift the wavelength we observe. For example, if a star is moving away, its light is redshifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their observed \u03bb_max) are the same. So maybe the intrinsic temperatures are different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed peak is same. Hmm, that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the actual temperatures (so intrinsic, not observed) are the same? Because the question says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" But if one is moving, the Doppler shift would change the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So that implies that their intrinsic peak wavelengths (without any Doppler shift) must differ such that when one is shifted, the observed peaks become the same. \n\nSo let me think again. Let's denote the intrinsic \u03bb_max for Star_1 as \u03bb1 and Star_2 as \u03bb2. But the observed \u03bb_max for both is the same. \n\nThe Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: \n\n\u03bb_observed = \u03bb_emitted * sqrt((c + v)/(c - v)) \n\nBut for velocities much smaller than c (which 700 km/s is, since c is ~3e5 km/s), we can approximate this as a linear term. The formula can be approximated as:\n\n\u03bb_observed \u2248 \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c)\n\nWait, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift for small velocities (non-relativistic) is approximately:\n\n\u03bb_observed \u2248 \u03bb_emitted (1 + v/c) \n\nWait, but direction matters. For radial velocity, if the star is moving away (positive v), then the observed wavelength is longer. \n\nSuppose Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me assume that \"radial velocity\" here refers to the speed relative to the observer. So, if Star_2 is moving away, then its emitted light is redshifted, so the observed \u03bb_max would be longer than its intrinsic \u03bb_max. \n\nThe problem states that the observed \u03bb_max for both stars are the same. Therefore:\n\n\u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs \n\nBut \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1 (intrinsic) * (1 + v1/c) \n\nSimilarly for Star_2: \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2 * (1 + v2/c) \n\nWait, but Star_1's velocity is 0, so v1 =0, so \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1. Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s, but the direction is important. If the velocity is away from us, then v is positive, so \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). If it's towards us, then v would be negative. The question just says \"radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s\", but doesn't specify direction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the velocity is away from us? Since they just give the speed, maybe it's just the magnitude. But regardless, the Doppler shift would adjust the observed wavelength. \n\nSo, since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c) \n\nBecause Star_1's observed is just \u03bb1, and Star_2's observed is \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nBut since their intrinsic temperatures are related to their \u03bb_max via Wien's law: \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their intrinsic \u03bb_max differ, their temperatures are different. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...\" So we need to compute L1/L2. \n\nLet me structure this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's note that the observed \u03bb_max for both stars is the same. Let's call this observed value \u03bb. \n\nTherefore:\n\nFor Star 1: \u03bb = \u03bb1*(1 + v1/c) \u2192 since v1=0, so \u03bb = \u03bb1.\n\nFor Star 2: \u03bb = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, \u03bb2 = \u03bb / (1 + v2/c) \n\nBut \u03bb1 = \u03bb, so \u03bb1 = \u03bb. \n\nNow, using Wien's law, \u03bb_max = b / T \u2192 T = b / \u03bb_max. \n\nTherefore, the intrinsic temperatures of the stars are:\n\nT1 = b / \u03bb1 = b / \u03bb \n\nT2 = b / \u03bb2 = b / [ \u03bb / (1 + v2/c) ) ] = b*(1 + v2/c)/\u03bb \n\nSo T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c) \n\nSo the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1? Wait, because if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so T2 would be higher than T1? Wait that can't be. Wait, because the observed wavelength for Star_2 is redshifted. So the intrinsic \u03bb_max (\u03bb2) must be shorter than the observed \u03bb. So \u03bb2 = \u03bb/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, since \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T, then a shorter \u03bb2 (intrinsic) would mean a higher T2. \n\nSo T2 is higher than T1. \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are different. \n\nSo now, the luminosity is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. \n\nWe need L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074)/(R2\u00b2 T2\u2074) \n\nGiven that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. \n\nWe know T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). \n\nSo substituting T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). \n\nSo the ratio becomes (1.5)^2 * [T1^4/( (R2^2)*( (T1*(1 + v2/c))^4 ))] \u2192 wait, perhaps better to write all variables step by step. \n\nLet me plug in T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). So T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c). \n\nThus, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4 \n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \n\n= (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + (v2/c))^4] \n\nNow, we need to compute (v2/c). \n\nv2 is 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v2/c = 700/(3e5) \u2248 0.002333... \n\nSo 1 + v2/c \u2248 1.002333 \n\nSo (1.002333)^4 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + x)^4 where x = 0.002333. \n\nThe binomial expansion for small x: (1+x)^4 \u2248 1 + 4x + 6x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b3 +x^4. \n\nBut since x is small (0.0023), higher terms are negligible. \n\nCalculating:\n\n4x = 4 * 0.002333 \u2248 0.009332 \n\n6x\u00b2 = 6*(0.002333)^2 \u2248 6*(0.00000544) \u2248 0.0000326 \n\n4x\u00b3 \u2248 4*(0.002333)^3 \u2248 negligible \n\nx^4 even smaller. \n\nSo total approximation: 1 + 0.009332 + 0.0000326 \u2248 1.00936. \n\nTherefore, (1.002333)^4 \u2248 approximately 1.00936. \n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute using calculator-like steps. Let me compute 1.002333 squared first. \n\n1.002333^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.00000544 \u2248 1.00467144 \n\nThen square that again: (1.00467144)^2 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(1.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 \n\n= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.0000218 \u2248 1.00936468 \n\nSo yes, approximately 1.00936. \n\nTherefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 \u2248 1.00936. \n\nThus, the term [1/(1 + v2/c)^4] \u2248 1/1.00936 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together: \n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 \n\n1.5 squared is 2.25. \n\n2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0007 is ~0.001575. So total is approximately 2.2275 - 0.001575? Wait, no, wait: 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007. So 2.25*(0.99 +0.0007) = 2.25*0.99 + 2.25*0.0007. \n\n2.25 *0.99 = 2.2275 \n\n2.25 *0.0007=0.001575 \n\nSo total 2.2275 +0.001575 \u2248 2.229. \n\nSo approximately 2.229. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) ~2.23. \n\nWait but let me check if I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. \n\nWait, if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic. So, the intrinsic wavelength is shorter. Therefore, T2 is higher than T1, so T1 is lower than T2. \n\nThus, T1/T2 is less than 1, so when we compute (T1/T2)^4, that term is less than 1, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 multiplied by that term. \n\nWait, but in the calculation above, I think I did that correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula. Let me double-check the Doppler shift. \n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: \n\n\u03bb_observed / \u03bb_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nBut for small velocities (v << c), this can be approximated as 1 + v/c. Wait, let me check. \n\nActually, the non-relativistic approximation is: \n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c) when moving away (v positive). \n\nWait, but the exact formula for small v is: \n\nUsing the relativistic formula, when v is much less than c, the expansion is approximately 1 + v/c. \n\nAlternatively, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the intrinsic wavelength is \u03bb_emitted, then observed is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emitted*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo the earlier approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation gives L1/L2 \u2248 2.229, which rounds to ~2.23, which is option D. \n\nBut wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D)2.23. \n\nHmm, so that would be D. But why is there an option A with 2.25? That would be the case if the velocities didn't matter, which would be if the temperatures were the same. \n\nAh, right! The question is tricky because if you forget to account for the Doppler shift effect on the temperature, you might just say the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 (option A). But because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, leading to different temperatures, you have to adjust for that. \n\nSo the correct answer is D? Let me check the math again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the (1 + v/c)^4 term more accurately. \n\nv2 = 700 km/s. c = 300,000 km/s. \n\nv/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333333... \n\nSo 1 + v/c = 1.002333333 \n\nCompute (1.00233333)^4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using logarithms? \n\nTake natural log of 1.00233333 is approx 0.00233166 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2 +x^3/3... so for x=0.002333, ln(1.002333) \u22480.002333 - (0.002333)^2/2 \u22480.002333 - 0.00000272 \u22480.002330). \n\nMultiply by 4: 0.00932 \n\nExponentiate: e^0.00932 \u2248 1 +0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 + ... \n\nFirst term:1.00932 \n\nSecond term: (0.00932)^2 /2 \u2248 (0.0000868)/2 \u22480.0000434 \n\nThird term: (0.00932)^3 /6 \u2248 negligible. \n\nSo total approx 1.00932 +0.0000434 \u22481.00936, so same as before. \n\nThus, the reciprocal is 1/1.00936\u22480.9907. \n\nSo 2.25 *0.9907 is indeed approximately 2.229. \n\nSo the closest is D) ~2.23. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. \n\nWait but let me check the question again. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. So the Stefan-Boltzmann law is applicable. \n\nYes, and all the steps seem correct. The key was realizing that the Doppler shift affects the apparent temperature, so the temperatures are different. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, we start by noting their radii and velocities.

Wait, because if Star_2 is moving away (v2 positive), then (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so T2 would be higher than T1? Wait that can't be. Wait, because the observed wavelength for Star_2 is redshifted. So the intrinsic \u03bb_max (\u03bb2) must be shorter than the observed \u03bb. So \u03bb2 = \u03bb/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, since \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T, then a shorter \u03bb2 (intrinsic) would mean a higher T2. \n\nSo T2 is higher than T1. \n\nTherefore, the temperatures are different. \n\nSo now, the luminosity is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. \n\nWe need L1/L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074)/(R2\u00b2 T2\u2074) \n\nGiven that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. \n\nWe know T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). \n\nSo substituting T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). \n\nSo the ratio becomes (1.5)^2 * [T1^4/( (R2^2)*( (T1*(1 + v2/c))^4 ))] \u2192 wait, perhaps better to write all variables step by step. \n\nLet me plug in T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). So T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c). \n\nThus, (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v2/c)^4 \n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \n\n= (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + (v2/c))^4] \n\nNow, we need to compute (v2/c). \n\nv2 is 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. \n\nSo v2/c = 700/(3e5) \u2248 0.002333... \n\nSo 1 + v2/c \u2248 1.002333 \n\nSo (1.002333)^4 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me compute (1 + x)^4 where x = 0.002333. \n\nThe binomial expansion for small x: (1+x)^4 \u2248 1 + 4x + 6x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b3 +x^4. \n\nBut since x is small (0.0023), higher terms are negligible. \n\nCalculating:\n\n4x = 4 * 0.002333 \u2248 0.009332 \n\n6x\u00b2 = 6*(0.002333)^2 \u2248 6*(0.00000544) \u2248 0.0000326 \n\n4x\u00b3 \u2248 4*(0.002333)^3 \u2248 negligible \n\nx^4 even smaller. \n\nSo total approximation: 1 + 0.009332 + 0.0000326 \u2248 1.00936. \n\nTherefore, (1.002333)^4 \u2248 approximately 1.00936. \n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute using calculator-like steps. Let me compute 1.002333 squared first. \n\n1.002333^2 = (1 + 0.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.00000544 \u2248 1.00467144 \n\nThen square that again: (1.00467144)^2 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(1.00467144)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 \n\n= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.0000218 \u2248 1.00936468 \n\nSo yes, approximately 1.00936. \n\nTherefore, (1 + v2/c)^4 \u2248 1.00936. \n\nThus, the term [1/(1 + v2/c)^4] \u2248 1/1.00936 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together: \n\nL1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 \n\n1.5 squared is 2.25. \n\n2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0007 is ~0.001575. So total is approximately 2.2275 - 0.001575? Wait, no, wait: 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007. So 2.25*(0.99 +0.0007) = 2.25*0.99 + 2.25*0.0007. \n\n2.25 *0.99 = 2.2275 \n\n2.25 *0.0007=0.001575 \n\nSo total 2.2275 +0.001575 \u2248 2.229. \n\nSo approximately 2.229. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D) ~2.23. \n\nWait but let me check if I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. \n\nWait, if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic. So, the intrinsic wavelength is shorter. Therefore, T2 is higher than T1, so T1 is lower than T2. \n\nThus, T1/T2 is less than 1, so when we compute (T1/T2)^4, that term is less than 1, so the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 multiplied by that term. \n\nWait, but in the calculation above, I think I did that correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula. Let me double-check the Doppler shift. \n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: \n\n\u03bb_observed / \u03bb_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )\n\nBut for small velocities (v << c), this can be approximated as 1 + v/c. Wait, let me check. \n\nActually, the non-relativistic approximation is: \n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emitted * (1 + v/c) when moving away (v positive). \n\nWait, but the exact formula for small v is: \n\nUsing the relativistic formula, when v is much less than c, the expansion is approximately 1 + v/c. \n\nAlternatively, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the intrinsic wavelength is \u03bb_emitted, then observed is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emitted*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo the earlier approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation gives L1/L2 \u2248 2.229, which rounds to ~2.23, which is option D. \n\nBut wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D)2.23. \n\nHmm, so that would be D. But why is there an option A with 2.25? That would be the case if the velocities didn't matter, which would be if the temperatures were the same. \n\nAh, right! The question is tricky because if you forget to account for the Doppler shift effect on the temperature, you might just say the luminosity ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 (option A). But because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, leading to different temperatures, you have to adjust for that. \n\nSo the correct answer is D? Let me check the math again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the (1 + v/c)^4 term more accurately. \n\nv2 = 700 km/s. c = 300,000 km/s. \n\nv/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333333... \n\nSo 1 + v/c = 1.002333333 \n\nCompute (1.00233333)^4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using logarithms? \n\nTake natural log of 1.00233333 is approx 0.00233166 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2 +x^3/3... so for x=0.002333, ln(1.002333) \u22480.002333 - (0.002333)^2/2 \u22480.002333 - 0.00000272 \u22480.002330). \n\nMultiply by 4: 0.00932 \n\nExponentiate: e^0.00932 \u2248 1 +0.00932 + (0.00932)^2/2 + ... \n\nFirst term:1.00932 \n\nSecond term: (0.00932)^2 /2 \u2248 (0.0000868)/2 \u22480.0000434 \n\nThird term: (0.00932)^3 /6 \u2248 negligible. \n\nSo total approx 1.00932 +0.0000434 \u22481.00936, so same as before. \n\nThus, the reciprocal is 1/1.00936\u22480.9907. \n\nSo 2.25 *0.9907 is indeed approximately 2.229. \n\nSo the closest is D) ~2.23. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. \n\nWait but let me check the question again. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies. So the Stefan-Boltzmann law is applicable. \n\nYes, and all the steps seem correct. The key was realizing that the Doppler shift affects the apparent temperature, so the temperatures are different. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, we start by noting their radii and velocities. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and both have the same observed peak wavelength (\u03bb_max). Using Wien's Law (\u03bb_max \u221d 1/T), their intrinsic temperatures must differ due to Doppler shifts caused by their radial velocities. \n\nStar_1 has zero velocity, so its observed \u03bb_max equals its intrinsic \u03bb\u2081. Star_2\u2019s observed \u03bb_max is redshifted (since its velocity is 700 km/s away from us), implying its intrinsic \u03bb\u2082 is shorter. The relationship between their intrinsic temperatures is derived via the Doppler shift formula:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{obs,2}} = \\lambda_2 \\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right) \\implies \\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}\n\\]\n\nUsing Wien's Law, the temperatures are inversely proportional to their intrinsic \u03bb_max:\n\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_1}, \\quad T_2 = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_2} = \\frac{b(1 + \\frac{v}{c})}{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}} \\implies T_2 = T_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe luminosity ratio \\( \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\) uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law (\\( L \\propto R^2 T^4 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{700}{3 \\times 10^5} \\approx 0.00233 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1.5\\right)^2 \\approx 2.25, \\quad \\left(1 + 0.00233\\right)^4 \\approx 1.00936\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times \\frac{1}{1.00936} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.23\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **D**, accounting for the Doppler-induced temperature difference.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem is asking about their luminosities. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nFirst, the question states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Then, through spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. We need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the relevant formulas. Luminosity of a star, when considered as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since they mention the wavelength at which each star is brightest, that's probably referring to Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to the temperature: \u03bb_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant. \n\nThe problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So \u03bb_max1 = \u03bb_max2. Therefore, according to Wien's law, their temperatures must be the same. Because if \u03bb_max is the same, then T1 = T2, since \u03bb_max*T = constant. So their temperatures are equal. \n\nTherefore, if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity depends only on the radius squared. Since Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But wait, the answer options include numbers like ~2.25, which is option A, but also other numbers close to that. Wait a second, but maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, the question mentions the radial velocities. The problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that factor in? Hmm. Because if the stars are moving, does that affect the measured wavelength? Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which they appear brightest, which would be affected by Doppler shift. \n\nWait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. But if one is moving towards us and the other away, their observed wavelengths would be shifted. Wait, the radial velocity of Star_1 is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its actual wavelength. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest to be the same. So that must mean that the actual (intrinsic) wavelengths would be different, but when corrected for Doppler shift, they have the same peak wavelength. Or perhaps the problem is implying that the observed wavelengths are the same, which would mean that the intrinsic temperatures are different. Hmm, this is a key point I might have missed earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine that part. The question says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" So the observed \u03bb_max for both are the same. But if one is moving, then the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. Therefore, their intrinsic \u03bb_max (without redshift) must differ, so that when shifted by their velocities, the observed wavelengths end up equal. Therefore, their actual temperatures might not be the same, which would affect the luminosity calculation. \n\nOh, right! So my initial assumption that T1 equals T2 might be wrong. I need to consider the Doppler shift here. \n\nOkay, let's think again. The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Let me denote the intrinsic (rest frame) peak wavelengths as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. The observed wavelength for Star_1, since it's not moving (radial velocity v1=0), is just \u03bb1. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity v2=700 km/s, the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs2 would be redshifted (assuming it's moving away, since the velocity is positive in the direction considered). The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt((c + v)/(c - v)) \n\nWait, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for motion towards or away. But if the velocity is much smaller than c, maybe they expect the non-relativistic approximation. Let me recall the formula. \n\nAlternatively, in the non-relativistic case, the Doppler shift for radial velocity v is approximately:\n\n\u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest (1 + v/c)\n\nWait, actually, I might have to check the exact formula. Let me think: if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\nBut that's the first-order approximation. Alternatively, for small velocities, the fractional change in wavelength is approximately v/c. Since 700 km/s is 0.7 million meters per second, and c is 3e8 m/s, so 700,000 / 3e8 \u2248 0.00233, so about 0.23% of c. That's small, so the non-relativistic approximation is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic formula, but maybe not. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says that the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both stars. Let's denote the observed wavelength as \u03bb_obs. For Star_1, since v1=0, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb1. For Star_2, \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb2 * (1 + v2/c). But the problem states that \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2. So:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic \u03bb_max of Star_1 is equal to Star_2's intrinsic \u03bb_max multiplied by (1 + v2/c). Since \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so T is inversely proportional to \u03bb_max. Therefore, T1 = T2*(1 + v2/c). \n\nWait, because \u03bb_max \u221d 1/T. So if \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c), then T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). \n\nSo, the temperatures of the two stars are related by this. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. Since we need L1/L2, that would be (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1/R2 squared is 2.25. \n\nThe temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1/(1 + v2/c). Let me compute that. \n\nv2 is 700 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s: 7e5 m/s. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) \u2248 0.0023333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v/c \u2248 1.0023333...\n\nThus, T1 = T2 / 1.0023333...\n\nTherefore, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023333 \u2248 0.997666...\n\nTherefore, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (0.997666)^4. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me compute (1 - 0.002333)^4. Since 0.997666 is approximately 1 - 0.002333. \n\nUsing binomial approximation for small x, (1 - x)^4 \u2248 1 -4x. But 0.002333 is small but maybe the approximation is okay. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute the exact value numerically.\n\n0.997666^4. Let's calculate step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.997666 squared is:\n\n0.997666 * 0.997666 \u2248 (1 - 0.002334)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.004668 + 0.0000054 \u2248 ~0.995337.\n\nThen, squaring that again (since to get the 4th power):\n\n0.995337^2 \u2248 (1 - 0.004663)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.004663 + (0.004663)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.009326 + 0.0000217 \u2248 ~0.990695.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute it directly:\n\nAlternatively, 0.997666^4:\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps. Let me compute 0.997666 squared first:\n\n0.997666 * 0.997666:\n\nLet me compute 0.997666 * 0.997666:\n\nLet me note that (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me take a = 1, b = 0.002334. \n\nWait, 0.997666 is exactly 1 - 0.002334? Let me check:\n\n1 - 0.002334 is 0.997666. Yes. So the first term squared is (1 - 0.002334)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2. \n\nSo that's 1 - 0.004668 + ~0.00000545. So approximately 0.99533645.\n\nThen, squaring that result to get the fourth power:\n\n(0.99533645)^2. Let me compute this as (1 - 0.00466355)^2. \n\nAgain, expanding: 1 - 2*0.00466355 + (0.00466355)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0093271 + 0.00002175 \u2248 0.99069465. \n\nSo approximately 0.990695. So (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nWait, but wait, actually T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v/c). So T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). So when we take (T1/T2)^4, that is [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it as (1 / (1.002333))^4. \n\nLet me compute 1.002333^4 first, then take reciprocal. Let's see:\n\n1.002333^2 = approx 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.00000544 \u2248 1.00467144.\n\nThen squared again: (1.00467144)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 \u2248 1.00934288 + 0.0000218 \u2248 ~1.00936468.\n\nThus, 1/(1.00936468) \u2248 0.9907. So that matches. So (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (0.9907) \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 let me compute that. \n\n2.25 * 0.9907:\n\n2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814, 0.25 *0.9907 = 0.247675. Adding together gives 1.9814 +0.247675 = 2.229075. \n\nSo approximately 2.229. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) ~2.25\n\nB) ~2.32\n\nC) ~2.35\n\nD) ~2.23\n\nHmm, so 2.229 is very close to D) 2.23. So the answer would be D?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because the difference between my approximate calculation and the options is just a few decimal points. Maybe I made an error in the approximation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me try to calculate (1/(1 + v/c))^4 more accurately.\n\nGiven v = 700,000 m/s, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3000) \u2248 0.002333333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c = 1.002333333...\n\nCompute (1.002333333)^4:\n\nFirst, compute (1.002333333)^2:\n\n= 1 + 2*0.002333333 + (0.002333333)^2\n\n= 1 + 0.004666666 + 0.000005444\n\n= 1.00467211.\n\nThen square that:\n\n(1.00467211)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\n(1 + 0.00467211)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467211 + (0.00467211)^2\n\n= 1 + 0.00934422 + (0.00002183)\n\n\u2248 1.00936605.\n\nThus, (1.00233333)^4 \u2248 1.00936605.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1.00936605) \u2248 0.9907 (as before). \n\nSo (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 1 / (1.009366) \u2248 0.9907. \n\nThen L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229. \n\nSo that rounds to approximately 2.23, which is option D. \n\nWait, but why is the answer not exactly 2.25? Because the Doppler shift reduces the temperature ratio, so the luminosity is slightly less than 2.25. \n\nSo the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but let me check if I considered the Doppler shift correctly. \n\nThe observed wavelength is the same, so \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2. \n\nFor Star_1, since it's not moving, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_max1. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, so the observed wavelength is longer. The formula for the observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but this is the relativistic formula. \n\nWait, I might have used the non-relativistic approximation earlier, but perhaps I should use the exact formula here. Let me check that. \n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ), where \u03b2 = v/c. \n\nSince v is positive when moving away. \n\nSo for Star_2, which is moving away, so v is positive. \n\nSo let's compute \u03b2 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.0023333...\n\nThus, (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) = (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.0023333\n\nDenominator: 0.9976667\n\nSo dividing them:\n\n\u2248 (1.0023333) / (0.9976667) \u2248 let's calculate:\n\n1.0023333 / 0.9976667 \u2248 \n\nWell, 0.9976667 * 1.0047 \u2248 0.9976667 *1 + 0.9976667 *0.0047 \u2248 0.9976667 + 0.00469 \u2248 1.0023567. \n\nHmm, so 1.0023333 is very close to that. \n\nTherefore, (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) \u2248 (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) \u2248 1.0047. \n\nWait, but actually, let me compute it more precisely:\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.0023333\n\nDenominator: 0.9976666666...\n\nSo dividing numerator by denominator:\n\nLet me compute 1.0023333 / 0.9976666666. Let me write this as:\n\n(1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333). \n\nLet me denote x = 0.0023333. \n\nThen, the ratio is (1+x)/(1 -x) = (1 + x)/(1 -x). \n\nExpanding this as a Taylor series for small x:\n\n(1+x)/(1 -x) \u2248 (1 + x)(1 + x + x\u00b2 + x\u00b3 + ...) \u2248 1 + 2x + 2x\u00b2 + ... \n\nBut since x is small (x=0.00233), the first two terms would be 1 + 2x. \n\nThus, (1+x)/(1 -x) \u2248 1 + 2x. \n\nSo with x = 0.0023333, 2x is 0.0046666, so the ratio is approximately 1.0046666. \n\nTherefore, the square root of this ratio is sqrt(1.0046666). \n\nSo sqrt(1.0046666) \u2248 1 + 0.5*(0.0046666) (using the approximation sqrt(1 + \u03b5) \u2248 1 + \u03b5/2 for small \u03b5). \n\nThus, sqrt \u2248 1 + 0.0023333 \u2248 1.0023333. \n\nWait, so the relativistic formula gives the same result as the non-relativistic approximation for the observed wavelength? Let me see:\n\nWait, the relativistic formula gives:\n\n\u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) )\n\nBut with \u03b2 small, sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) \u2248 1 + \u03b2 (using binomial expansion):\n\nsqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) = sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)(1 + \u03b2/(1 - \u03b2)) )? Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute sqrt(1 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). Hmm, perhaps better to use the expansion:\n\nsqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) = sqrt( (1 + \u03b2) / (1 - \u03b2) ) \n\nLet me write this as sqrt( (1 + \u03b2) ) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2) \n\nEach term can be expanded as sqrt(1 + \u03b2) \u2248 1 + \u03b2/2, and 1/sqrt(1 - \u03b2) \u2248 1 + \u03b2/2. So multiplying them:\n\n(1 + \u03b2/2)(1 + \u03b2/2) = 1 + \u03b2 + (\u03b2\u00b2)/4. \n\nThus, for small \u03b2, the total is approximately 1 + \u03b2. \n\nSo sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) \u2248 1 + \u03b2. \n\nTherefore, the relativistic Doppler shift formula gives \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest*(1 + \u03b2), which is the same as the non-relativistic approximation. \n\nTherefore, my initial approximation was okay, since the relativistic correction is negligible here. \n\nThus, the calculation leading to L1/L2 \u2248 2.23 is correct, so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the sign? Wait, the Doppler shift for wavelength when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo for Star_2, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So since the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both stars, the intrinsic \u03bb_max of Star_2 must be shorter. \n\nWait, because Star_2's observed wavelength is shifted to a longer value. So to have the observed \u03bb equal to Star_1's observed (which is its intrinsic), the intrinsic \u03bb2 must be shorter. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nStar_1 has observed \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb1. \n\nStar_2 has observed \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nWe have \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2, so \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, \u03bb2 = \u03bb1/(1 + v/c). \n\nSince \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T, then T is proportional to 1/\u03bb_max. \n\nSo T2 = T1 / (\u03bb2/\u03bb1) = T1 / (1/(1 + v/c)) ) = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nWait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me redo this part. \n\nIf \u03bb_max is proportional to 1/T, then T is proportional to 1/\u03bb_max. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = \u03bb2 / \u03bb1. \n\nBecause T1 = constant / \u03bb1, T2 = constant / \u03bb2. \n\nThus, T1 / T2 = (constant / \u03bb1) / (constant / \u03bb2) ) = \u03bb2/\u03bb1. \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2 * (\u03bb2/\u03bb1). \n\nBut from the observed wavelengths, we have \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo \u03bb2 = \u03bb1/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2 * [ (\u03bb1/(1 + v/c)) / \u03bb1 ] = T2 / (1 + v/c). \n\nWait, that's what I had earlier. \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, when calculating L1/L2, which is (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4), the temperature ratio term is (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the factor is (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nPlugging in v = 700,000 m/s, v/c = 0.002333, so (1 + v/c) = 1.002333. \n\n[1/(1.002333)]^4 \u2248 (0.997667)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nMultiply by 2.25 gives 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229, which rounds to 2.23, so D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem is asking about their luminosities. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nFirst, the question states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Then, through spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. We need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the relevant formulas. Luminosity of a star, when considered as a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. Since they mention the wavelength at which each star is brightest, that's probably referring to Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to the temperature: \u03bb_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant. \n\nThe problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So \u03bb_max1 = \u03bb_max2. Therefore, according to Wien's law, their temperatures must be the same. Because if \u03bb_max is the same, then T1 = T2, since \u03bb_max*T = constant. So their temperatures are equal. \n\nTherefore, if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity depends only on the radius squared. Since Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. But wait, the answer options include numbers like ~2.25, which is option A, but also other numbers close to that. Wait a second, but maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, the question mentions the radial velocities. The problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that factor in? Hmm. Because if the stars are moving, does that affect the measured wavelength? Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which they appear brightest, which would be affected by Doppler shift. \n\nWait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. But if one is moving towards us and the other away, their observed wavelengths would be shifted. Wait, the radial velocity of Star_1 is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its actual wavelength. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest to be the same. So that must mean that the actual (intrinsic) wavelengths would be different, but when corrected for Doppler shift, they have the same peak wavelength. Or perhaps the problem is implying that the observed wavelengths are the same, which would mean that the intrinsic temperatures are different. Hmm, this is a key point I might have missed earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine that part. The question says \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" So the observed \u03bb_max for both are the same. But if one is moving, then the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. Therefore, their intrinsic \u03bb_max (without redshift) must differ, so that when shifted by their velocities, the observed wavelengths end up equal. Therefore, their actual temperatures might not be the same, which would affect the luminosity calculation. \n\nOh, right! So my initial assumption that T1 equals T2 might be wrong. I need to consider the Doppler shift here. \n\nOkay, let's think again. The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Let me denote the intrinsic (rest frame) peak wavelengths as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. The observed wavelength for Star_1, since it's not moving (radial velocity v1=0), is just \u03bb1. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity v2=700 km/s, the observed wavelength \u03bb_obs2 would be redshifted (assuming it's moving away, since the velocity is positive in the direction considered). The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt((c + v)/(c - v)) \n\nWait, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) for motion towards or away. But if the velocity is much smaller than c, maybe they expect the non-relativistic approximation. Let me recall the formula. \n\nAlternatively, in the non-relativistic case, the Doppler shift for radial velocity v is approximately:\n\n\u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest (1 + v/c)\n\nWait, actually, I might have to check the exact formula. Let me think: if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + v/c)\n\nBut that's the first-order approximation. Alternatively, for small velocities, the fractional change in wavelength is approximately v/c. Since 700 km/s is 0.7 million meters per second, and c is 3e8 m/s, so 700,000 / 3e8 \u2248 0.00233, so about 0.23% of c. That's small, so the non-relativistic approximation is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic formula, but maybe not. Let's see.\n\nThe problem says that the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both stars. Let's denote the observed wavelength as \u03bb_obs. For Star_1, since v1=0, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb1. For Star_2, \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb2 * (1 + v2/c). But the problem states that \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2. So:\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c)\n\nTherefore, the intrinsic \u03bb_max of Star_1 is equal to Star_2's intrinsic \u03bb_max multiplied by (1 + v2/c). Since \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so T is inversely proportional to \u03bb_max. Therefore, T1 = T2*(1 + v2/c). \n\nWait, because \u03bb_max \u221d 1/T. So if \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v2/c), then T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). \n\nSo, the temperatures of the two stars are related by this. \n\nNow, luminosity is L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074. Since we need L1/L2, that would be (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). \n\nWe know R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1/R2 squared is 2.25. \n\nThe temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1/(1 + v2/c). Let me compute that. \n\nv2 is 700 km/s. Let's convert that to m/s: 7e5 m/s. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) \u2248 0.0023333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v/c \u2248 1.0023333...\n\nThus, T1 = T2 / 1.0023333...\n\nTherefore, T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023333 \u2248 0.997666...\n\nTherefore, (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (0.997666)^4. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me compute (1 - 0.002333)^4. Since 0.997666 is approximately 1 - 0.002333. \n\nUsing binomial approximation for small x, (1 - x)^4 \u2248 1 -4x. But 0.002333 is small but maybe the approximation is okay. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute the exact value numerically.\n\n0.997666^4. Let's calculate step by step:\n\nFirst, 0.997666 squared is:\n\n0.997666 * 0.997666 \u2248 (1 - 0.002334)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.004668 + 0.0000054 \u2248 ~0.995337.\n\nThen, squaring that again (since to get the 4th power):\n\n0.995337^2 \u2248 (1 - 0.004663)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.004663 + (0.004663)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.009326 + 0.0000217 \u2248 ~0.990695.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute it directly:\n\nAlternatively, 0.997666^4:\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps. Let me compute 0.997666 squared first:\n\n0.997666 * 0.997666:\n\nLet me compute 0.997666 * 0.997666:\n\nLet me note that (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me take a = 1, b = 0.002334. \n\nWait, 0.997666 is exactly 1 - 0.002334? Let me check:\n\n1 - 0.002334 is 0.997666. Yes. So the first term squared is (1 - 0.002334)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2. \n\nSo that's 1 - 0.004668 + ~0.00000545. So approximately 0.99533645.\n\nThen, squaring that result to get the fourth power:\n\n(0.99533645)^2. Let me compute this as (1 - 0.00466355)^2. \n\nAgain, expanding: 1 - 2*0.00466355 + (0.00466355)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0093271 + 0.00002175 \u2248 0.99069465. \n\nSo approximately 0.990695. So (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nWait, but wait, actually T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v/c). So T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). So when we take (T1/T2)^4, that is [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute it as (1 / (1.002333))^4. \n\nLet me compute 1.002333^4 first, then take reciprocal. Let's see:\n\n1.002333^2 = approx 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 \u2248 1.004666 + 0.00000544 \u2248 1.00467144.\n\nThen squared again: (1.00467144)^2 \u2248 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2 \u2248 1.00934288 + 0.0000218 \u2248 ~1.00936468.\n\nThus, 1/(1.00936468) \u2248 0.9907. So that matches. So (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nTherefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (0.9907) \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 let me compute that. \n\n2.25 * 0.9907:\n\n2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814, 0.25 *0.9907 = 0.247675. Adding together gives 1.9814 +0.247675 = 2.229075. \n\nSo approximately 2.229. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) ~2.25\n\nB) ~2.32\n\nC) ~2.35\n\nD) ~2.23\n\nHmm, so 2.229 is very close to D) 2.23. So the answer would be D?\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because the difference between my approximate calculation and the options is just a few decimal points. Maybe I made an error in the approximation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me try to calculate (1/(1 + v/c))^4 more accurately.\n\nGiven v = 700,000 m/s, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nv/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3000) \u2248 0.002333333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c = 1.002333333...\n\nCompute (1.002333333)^4:\n\nFirst, compute (1.002333333)^2:\n\n= 1 + 2*0.002333333 + (0.002333333)^2\n\n= 1 + 0.004666666 + 0.000005444\n\n= 1.00467211.\n\nThen square that:\n\n(1.00467211)^2 = ?\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\n(1 + 0.00467211)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00467211 + (0.00467211)^2\n\n= 1 + 0.00934422 + (0.00002183)\n\n\u2248 1.00936605.\n\nThus, (1.00233333)^4 \u2248 1.00936605.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1.00936605) \u2248 0.9907 (as before). \n\nSo (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 1 / (1.009366) \u2248 0.9907. \n\nThen L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229. \n\nSo that rounds to approximately 2.23, which is option D. \n\nWait, but why is the answer not exactly 2.25? Because the Doppler shift reduces the temperature ratio, so the luminosity is slightly less than 2.25. \n\nSo the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but let me check if I considered the Doppler shift correctly. \n\nThe observed wavelength is the same, so \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2. \n\nFor Star_1, since it's not moving, \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_max1. \n\nFor Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, so the observed wavelength is longer. The formula for the observed wavelength is \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but this is the relativistic formula. \n\nWait, I might have used the non-relativistic approximation earlier, but perhaps I should use the exact formula here. Let me check that. \n\nThe relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ), where \u03b2 = v/c. \n\nSince v is positive when moving away. \n\nSo for Star_2, which is moving away, so v is positive. \n\nSo let's compute \u03b2 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.0023333...\n\nThus, (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) = (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.0023333\n\nDenominator: 0.9976667\n\nSo dividing them:\n\n\u2248 (1.0023333) / (0.9976667) \u2248 let's calculate:\n\n1.0023333 / 0.9976667 \u2248 \n\nWell, 0.9976667 * 1.0047 \u2248 0.9976667 *1 + 0.9976667 *0.0047 \u2248 0.9976667 + 0.00469 \u2248 1.0023567. \n\nHmm, so 1.0023333 is very close to that. \n\nTherefore, (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) \u2248 (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) \u2248 1.0047. \n\nWait, but actually, let me compute it more precisely:\n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.0023333\n\nDenominator: 0.9976666666...\n\nSo dividing numerator by denominator:\n\nLet me compute 1.0023333 / 0.9976666666. Let me write this as:\n\n(1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333). \n\nLet me denote x = 0.0023333. \n\nThen, the ratio is (1+x)/(1 -x) = (1 + x)/(1 -x). \n\nExpanding this as a Taylor series for small x:\n\n(1+x)/(1 -x) \u2248 (1 + x)(1 + x + x\u00b2 + x\u00b3 + ...) \u2248 1 + 2x + 2x\u00b2 + ... \n\nBut since x is small (x=0.00233), the first two terms would be 1 + 2x. \n\nThus, (1+x)/(1 -x) \u2248 1 + 2x. \n\nSo with x = 0.0023333, 2x is 0.0046666, so the ratio is approximately 1.0046666. \n\nTherefore, the square root of this ratio is sqrt(1.0046666). \n\nSo sqrt(1.0046666) \u2248 1 + 0.5*(0.0046666) (using the approximation sqrt(1 + \u03b5) \u2248 1 + \u03b5/2 for small \u03b5). \n\nThus, sqrt \u2248 1 + 0.0023333 \u2248 1.0023333. \n\nWait, so the relativistic formula gives the same result as the non-relativistic approximation for the observed wavelength? Let me see:\n\nWait, the relativistic formula gives:\n\n\u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) )\n\nBut with \u03b2 small, sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) \u2248 1 + \u03b2 (using binomial expansion):\n\nsqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) = sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)(1 + \u03b2/(1 - \u03b2)) )? Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute sqrt(1 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b2\u00b2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2\u00b2). Hmm, perhaps better to use the expansion:\n\nsqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) = sqrt( (1 + \u03b2) / (1 - \u03b2) ) \n\nLet me write this as sqrt( (1 + \u03b2) ) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2) \n\nEach term can be expanded as sqrt(1 + \u03b2) \u2248 1 + \u03b2/2, and 1/sqrt(1 - \u03b2) \u2248 1 + \u03b2/2. So multiplying them:\n\n(1 + \u03b2/2)(1 + \u03b2/2) = 1 + \u03b2 + (\u03b2\u00b2)/4. \n\nThus, for small \u03b2, the total is approximately 1 + \u03b2. \n\nSo sqrt( (1 + \u03b2)/(1 - \u03b2) ) \u2248 1 + \u03b2. \n\nTherefore, the relativistic Doppler shift formula gives \u03bb_obs \u2248 \u03bb_rest*(1 + \u03b2), which is the same as the non-relativistic approximation. \n\nTherefore, my initial approximation was okay, since the relativistic correction is negligible here. \n\nThus, the calculation leading to L1/L2 \u2248 2.23 is correct, so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the sign? Wait, the Doppler shift for wavelength when moving away is \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo for Star_2, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. So since the observed \u03bb_max is the same for both stars, the intrinsic \u03bb_max of Star_2 must be shorter. \n\nWait, because Star_2's observed wavelength is shifted to a longer value. So to have the observed \u03bb equal to Star_1's observed (which is its intrinsic), the intrinsic \u03bb2 must be shorter. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nStar_1 has observed \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb1. \n\nStar_2 has observed \u03bb_obs2 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nWe have \u03bb_obs1 = \u03bb_obs2, so \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, \u03bb2 = \u03bb1/(1 + v/c). \n\nSince \u03bb_max is inversely proportional to T, then T is proportional to 1/\u03bb_max. \n\nSo T2 = T1 / (\u03bb2/\u03bb1) = T1 / (1/(1 + v/c)) ) = T1*(1 + v/c). \n\nWait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me redo this part. \n\nIf \u03bb_max is proportional to 1/T, then T is proportional to 1/\u03bb_max. \n\nSo T1 / T2 = \u03bb2 / \u03bb1. \n\nBecause T1 = constant / \u03bb1, T2 = constant / \u03bb2. \n\nThus, T1 / T2 = (constant / \u03bb1) / (constant / \u03bb2) ) = \u03bb2/\u03bb1. \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2 * (\u03bb2/\u03bb1). \n\nBut from the observed wavelengths, we have \u03bb1 = \u03bb2*(1 + v/c). \n\nSo \u03bb2 = \u03bb1/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2 * [ (\u03bb1/(1 + v/c)) / \u03bb1 ] = T2 / (1 + v/c). \n\nWait, that's what I had earlier. \n\nTherefore, T1 = T2/(1 + v/c). \n\nThus, T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c). \n\nTherefore, when calculating L1/L2, which is (R1\u00b2/R2\u00b2) * (T1^4 / T2^4), the temperature ratio term is (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nTherefore, my previous calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the factor is (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4. \n\nPlugging in v = 700,000 m/s, v/c = 0.002333, so (1 + v/c) = 1.002333. \n\n[1/(1.002333)]^4 \u2248 (0.997667)^4 \u2248 0.9907. \n\nMultiply by 2.25 gives 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229, which rounds to 2.23, so D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and considering Doppler shifts. Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, implying their intrinsic temperatures differ due to radial velocity. \n\n1. **Radii and Mass**: Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so the radius ratio \\( \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \\). \n2. **Temperature via Wien's Law**: The observed peak wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}\\)) is the same for both stars. For Star_1 (no velocity), \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max1}}\\). For Star_2 (700 km/s radial velocity), \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs2}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max2}} \\cdot (1 + \\frac{v}{c})\\). Setting \\(\\lambda_{\\text{obs1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs2}}\\) gives \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max1}} = \\lambda_{\\text{max2}} \\cdot (1 + \\frac{v}{c})\\). Since \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\frac{1}{T}\\), the temperature ratio is \\( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}} \\).\n3. **Luminosity Calculation**: Using \\( L \\propto R^2 T^4 \\), the luminosity ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}\\right)^4\n   \\]\n4. **Numerical Evaluation**: \n   - \\( \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{700,000}{3 \\times 10^8} \\approx 0.00233 \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{1 + 0.00233} \\approx 0.99767 \\)\n   - \\( (0.99767)^4 \\approx 0.9907 \\)\n   - \\( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\)\n   - Multiplying gives \\( 2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.229 \\), which rounds to **2.23**.\n\nThe closest option is **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",
