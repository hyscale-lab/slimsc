      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about the probability of an atom decaying within the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, right, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? Because each nucleus has a constant probability of decaying at any moment, independent of time. So the key here is that the decay process is memoryless. That means the probability of decay in the next time interval doesn't depend on how long it's already been around. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes starting from time zero. Now, after 50 minutes, since it hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, the total time from the start would then be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the question is phrased as \"the next 150 minutes\" after the 50 minutes. So maybe I should approach this using the survival function and the exponential decay formula.\n\nLet me recall that the probability of decay by time t is given by 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. The problem says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\n1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68 \u2192 so \u03bb*100 = -ln(0.68). Let me compute that. \n\nWait, but perhaps I can use ratios here. Since the process is memoryless, the probability of surviving the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of surviving 150 minutes from any starting point. Wait, no, the memoryless property says that the probability of surviving an additional time t given that it has already survived s is equal to the probability of surviving t. So, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (after the initial 50) is equal to 1 minus the probability of surviving those 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, let me structure this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's find the decay constant \u03bb. \n\nGiven that P(decay in 100 minutes) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). So, solving for \u03bb:\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \u2192 take natural log of both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100.\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68). Let me see, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me use calculator approximation. Let's see, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So \u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. \n\nBut maybe I don't need to compute it numerically. Let's see. Let me see what the problem is asking. \n\nWe want the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived 50 minutes. Since it's memoryless, the conditional probability is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from now. \n\nWait, no, actually the memoryless property says that P(T \u2264 t + s | T > s) = P(T \u2264 t). So here, after surviving s =50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next t=150 minutes is equal to the probability of decaying in t minutes from the start. \n\nWait, but the original data was given for 100 minutes. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe I can express the survival probability after time t as S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). \n\nSo, the probability that the atom survives 50 minutes is S(50) = e^(-\u03bb*50). Then, the probability that it survives another 150 minutes (so total time 200) is S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*200). Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is 1 - S(200)/S(50). Because given that it has survived the first 50 minutes (so the conditional probability is 1/S(50) times the probability of surviving up to 200?), wait, maybe better to think in terms of conditional probability:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 minutes | no decay by 50 minutes) = [P(no decay by 200) - P(no decay by 50)] / P(no decay by 50) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Let me denote T as the time of decay. We need P(T \u2264 200 | T > 50) = P(T \u2264 200 and T>50)/P(T>50) = P(50 < T \u2264200)/P(T>50). \n\nBut the memoryless property tells us that this is equal to P(T \u2264 150)/P(T>50)? Wait, no. Wait, the memoryless property states that P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t). Therefore, P(T \u2264 s + t | T > s) = 1 - P(T > s + t | T> s) = 1 - P(T> t) = P(T \u2264 t). \n\nAh, right. So in this case, s is 50 and t is 150. So the conditional probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes (so within 50+150=200 total) given that it has survived up to 50 minutes is equal to the probability that it would decay within 150 minutes starting from time zero. \n\nTherefore, the required probability is equal to P(T \u2264150). \n\nWait, but the original problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which is P(T \u2264100)=0.32. So to find P(T \u2264150), we can use the exponential formula. \n\nLet me set up the equations. Let me denote \u03bb as the decay constant. \n\nWe know that P(T \u2264100) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) =0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68. \n\nWe need P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me express 150 as 1.5*100. \n\nLet me write e^(-\u03bb*150) = [e^(-\u03bb*100)]^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nTherefore, P(T \u2264150) = 1 - (0.68)^(1.5). \n\nHmm, okay, need to compute that. Let me calculate (0.68)^1.5. \n\nAlternatively, 0.68^1.5 is the same as sqrt(0.68^3). Let me compute 0.68^3 first. \n\n0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624. Then, 0.4624 * 0.68 \u2248 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) \u2248 0.5607. Wait, but that would give me (0.68)^1.5 \u2248 0.5607. Wait, but sqrt(0.68^3) is the same as 0.68^(3/2), yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute 0.68^1.5 directly. Let me see. Let me compute ln(0.68) = -0.38566, so 1.5 * ln(0.68) = 1.5*(-0.38566)= -0.57849. Then exponentiating gives e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.578 \u2248 approximately 0.561. So 0.561. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.561 \u2248 0.439, so about 43.9%, which is close to 44%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, since the half-life is not given, but the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, which is less than half, so the half-life must be longer than 100 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the survival probability. \n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let me think of the decay constant \u03bb. \n\nWe have P(decay in 100 minutes) = 0.32 \u2192 so the survival probability after 100 minutes is 0.68. \n\nThe survival probability after t minutes is S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). \n\nSo S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 so S(50) would be sqrt(S(100)) because 50 is half of 100. Wait, because S(50) = e^(-\u03bb*50) = [e^(-\u03bb*100)]^(0.5) = (0.68)^0.5 \u2248 sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nSimilarly, S(200) is S(100 *2) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it survived the first 50. \n\nThe probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from 50 to 200) is equal to 1 - S(200)/S(50). Because given that it's survived up to 50, the conditional probability is (1 - S(200)) / S(50) ? Wait no. Wait, the survival up to 200 is S(200). The survival up to 50 is S(50). The conditional probability that it survives beyond 200 given that it survived 50 is S(200)/S(50). Therefore, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is 1 - [S(200)/S(50)]. \n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nS(200) = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. S(50) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So S(200)/S(50) = 0.4624 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.561. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.561 \u2248 0.439, which is ~43.9%, so 44%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me think of the decay constant again. \n\nWait, another approach: the decay probability per unit time is such that the chance of decaying in any small time interval is the same. So the half-life T1/2 can be found from the given data. \n\nWait, but perhaps not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the probability of surviving 50 minutes is S(50), and surviving 200 minutes is S(200). The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200), and the conditional probability is (S(50) - S(200))/S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50), which is the same as before. \n\nSo yes, the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the exponent for P(T \u2264150). Wait, the time from the start would be 150 minutes. But in the problem, the 150 minutes is after the 50. But according to memoryless property, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now (after 50) is same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from time 0, which is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}. \n\nSo, let me compute that again. Since e^{-\u03bb*100} =0.68, then e^{-\u03bb*150} = e^{-\u03bb*100}^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\n0.68^1.5. Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me compute 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). \n\nsqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64)=0.8, sqrt(0.68) is a bit more. Let me calculate sqrt(0.68):\n\n0.8246^2 = (0.82)^2 = 0.6724, plus 0.0046*(2*0.82 +0.0046) \u2248 roughly, but maybe better to just compute 0.68^1.5:\n\nLet me take logarithms. \n\nln(0.68^1.5) = 1.5 * ln(0.68) \u2248 1.5*(-0.38566) \u2248 -0.57849. \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.57849. Let me compute e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Since 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nLet me compute the value at 0.57849:\n\nLet me see, let's use the Taylor series or linear approximation. \n\nAlternatively, note that 0.57849 is 0.5 + 0.07849. \n\nAlternatively, compute e^-0.57849 \u2248 e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 \u2248 0.6065 * (1 -0.07849 + ...) \u2248 0.6065*(0.9215) \u2248 0.6065 *0.92 = approx 0.6065*0.9=0.54585, plus 0.6065*0.02=0.0121, so total ~0.558. Hmm, but this might not be precise. Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:\n\nLet me use more accurate calculation. \n\nLet me compute 0.68^1.5:\n\nFirst, 0.68^1 = 0.68.\n\n0.68^0.5 is sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.824621125.\n\nThus, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * 0.824621125 \u2248 0.68 *0.824621. \n\nLet me compute 0.68 *0.8 = 0.544, 0.68*0.024621 \u2248 0.68 *0.02=0.0136, plus 0.68*0.004621\u22480.00314. \n\nSo total approx 0.544 +0.0136=0.5576 +0.00314\u22480.5607. \n\nSo 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, so ~43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using a different method? Let me see the options. The options are 44, 40, 52,48. \n\nHmm, 44 is option A. So that's the closest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the probability is P(T \u2264150). Wait, the question says after 50 minutes, so the time from now is 150 minutes. But according to memoryless, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting fresh. \n\nWait, but the original 32% was over 100 minutes. So if I can compute the decay constant, then compute the probability over 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute the half-life. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the half-life is T1/2. Then, the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability is 68%. \n\nThe survival probability is (1/2)^(100 / T1/2) = 0.68. \n\nTaking log2 of both sides: (100 / T1/2) * ln(2) = ln(1/0.68). \n\nWait, maybe easier with natural logs: \n\nln(0.68) = (100 / T1/2) * ln(0.5). \n\nThus, T1/2 = 100 * ln(0.5) / ln(0.68). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nln(0.5) \u2248 -0.6931, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. \n\nThus, T1/2 = 100 * (-0.6931)/ (-0.38566) \u2248 100 * (0.6931/0.38566) \u2248 100 * 1.797 \u2248 179.7 minutes. \n\nSo the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. \n\nThen, the decay probability over 150 minutes would be 1 - (0.5)^(150 / 180) \n\n= 1 - (0.5)^(5/6). \n\nLet me compute (0.5)^(5/6). Let me see: \n\nTake natural log: ln(0.5^(5/6)) = (5/6) * ln(0.5) \u2248 (5/6)*(-0.6931) \u2248 -0.5776. \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.5776 \u2248 0.561. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is again ~43.9%. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)44%. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me read the question again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes\". So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes (starting now, after 50), so the time period is 150 minutes, not the total 200. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what we computed. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is equal to the probability of decaying in the first 150 minutes, which is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the decay probability is linear, which is a common misconception. Like, if 32% decay in 100 minutes, then in 150 minutes, it's 32% * 1.5 = 48%, but that's wrong because decay is exponential. \n\nBut the options include 48% (D). So that's a possible trap. \n\nAlternatively, someone might think that since 50 minutes have passed, and the half-life is about 180 minutes, then after 50 minutes, the remaining probability over 150 is like 150/180 = 5/6 of a half-life, so the decay probability is 1 - (1/2)^(5/6) \u2248 44%, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb can be found from the given data. \n\nWe have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). \n\nLet me solve for \u03bb. \n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. \n\nThen, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \n\n= 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) \n\nCompute exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849 \n\nSo e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.561, so 1 -0.561=0.439 \u219243.9% \u219244%. \n\nSo all methods lead to A. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is A)44%.\n",

Then, the probability that it survives another 150 minutes (so total time 200) is S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*200). Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is 1 - S(200)/S(50).

Let me clarify. Let me denote T as the time of decay. We need P(T \u2264 200 | T > 50) = P(T \u2264 200 and T>50)/P(T>50) = P(50 < T \u2264200)/P(T>50). \n\nBut the memoryless property tells us that this is equal to P(T \u2264 150)/P(T>50)? Wait, no.

So in this case, s is 50 and t is 150. So the conditional probability that it decays within the next 150 minutes (so within 50+150=200 total) given that it has survived up to 50 minutes is equal to the probability that it would decay within 150 minutes starting from time zero. \n\nTherefore, the required probability is equal to P(T \u2264150). \n\nWait, but the original problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which is P(T \u2264100)=0.32. So to find P(T \u2264150), we can use the exponential formula. \n\nLet me set up the equations. Let me denote \u03bb as the decay constant. \n\nWe know that P(T \u2264100) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100) =0.32 \u2192 e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68. \n\nWe need P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let me express 150 as 1.5*100. \n\nLet me write e^(-\u03bb*150) = [e^(-\u03bb*100)]^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\nTherefore, P(T \u2264150) = 1 - (0.68)^(1.5). \n\nHmm, okay, need to compute that. Let me calculate (0.68)^1.5. \n\nAlternatively, 0.68^1.5 is the same as sqrt(0.68^3). Let me compute 0.68^3 first. \n\n0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624. Then, 0.4624 * 0.68 \u2248 0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432) \u2248 0.5607. Wait, but that would give me (0.68)^1.5 \u2248 0.5607. Wait, but sqrt(0.68^3) is the same as 0.68^(3/2), yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute 0.68^1.5 directly. Let me see. Let me compute ln(0.68) = -0.38566, so 1.5 * ln(0.68) = 1.5*(-0.38566)= -0.57849. Then exponentiating gives e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.578 \u2248 approximately 0.561. So 0.561. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.561 \u2248 0.439, so about 43.9%, which is close to 44%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, since the half-life is not given, but the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, which is less than half, so the half-life must be longer than 100 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the survival probability. \n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let me think of the decay constant \u03bb. \n\nWe have P(decay in 100 minutes) = 0.32 \u2192 so the survival probability after 100 minutes is 0.68. \n\nThe survival probability after t minutes is S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt). \n\nSo S(100) = 0.68 \u2192 so S(50) would be sqrt(S(100)) because 50 is half of 100. Wait, because S(50) = e^(-\u03bb*50) = [e^(-\u03bb*100)]^(0.5) = (0.68)^0.5 \u2248 sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. \n\nSimilarly, S(200) is S(100 *2) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it survived the first 50. \n\nThe probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from 50 to 200) is equal to 1 - S(200)/S(50). Because given that it's survived up to 50, the conditional probability is (1 - S(200)) / S(50) ? Wait no. Wait, the survival up to 200 is S(200). The survival up to 50 is S(50). The conditional probability that it survives beyond 200 given that it survived 50 is S(200)/S(50). Therefore, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is 1 - [S(200)/S(50)]. \n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\nS(200) = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. S(50) = sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.8246. So S(200)/S(50) = 0.4624 / 0.8246 \u2248 0.561. \n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.561 \u2248 0.439, which is ~43.9%, so 44%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me think of the decay constant again. \n\nWait, another approach: the decay probability per unit time is such that the chance of decaying in any small time interval is the same. So the half-life T1/2 can be found from the given data. \n\nWait, but perhaps not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the probability of surviving 50 minutes is S(50), and surviving 200 minutes is S(200). The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200), and the conditional probability is (S(50) - S(200))/S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50), which is the same as before. \n\nSo yes, the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the exponent for P(T \u2264150). Wait, the time from the start would be 150 minutes. But in the problem, the 150 minutes is after the 50. But according to memoryless property, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from now (after 50) is same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes from time 0, which is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^{-\u03bb*150}. \n\nSo, let me compute that again. Since e^{-\u03bb*100} =0.68, then e^{-\u03bb*150} = e^{-\u03bb*100}^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. \n\n0.68^1.5. Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nLet me compute 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). \n\nsqrt(0.68) is approximately sqrt(0.64)=0.8, sqrt(0.68) is a bit more. Let me calculate sqrt(0.68):\n\n0.8246^2 = (0.82)^2 = 0.6724, plus 0.0046*(2*0.82 +0.0046) \u2248 roughly, but maybe better to just compute 0.68^1.5:\n\nLet me take logarithms. \n\nln(0.68^1.5) = 1.5 * ln(0.68) \u2248 1.5*(-0.38566) \u2248 -0.57849. \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.57849. Let me compute e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Since 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. \n\nLet me compute the value at 0.57849:\n\nLet me see, let's use the Taylor series or linear approximation. \n\nAlternatively, note that 0.57849 is 0.5 + 0.07849. \n\nAlternatively, compute e^-0.57849 \u2248 e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 \u2248 0.6065 * (1 -0.07849 + ...) \u2248 0.6065*(0.9215) \u2248 0.6065 *0.92 = approx 0.6065*0.9=0.54585, plus 0.6065*0.02=0.0121, so total ~0.558. Hmm, but this might not be precise. Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:\n\nLet me use more accurate calculation. \n\nLet me compute 0.68^1.5:\n\nFirst, 0.68^1 = 0.68.\n\n0.68^0.5 is sqrt(0.68) \u2248 0.824621125.\n\nThus, 0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * 0.824621125 \u2248 0.68 *0.824621. \n\nLet me compute 0.68 *0.8 = 0.544, 0.68*0.024621 \u2248 0.68 *0.02=0.0136, plus 0.68*0.004621\u22480.00314. \n\nSo total approx 0.544 +0.0136=0.5576 +0.00314\u22480.5607. \n\nSo 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, so ~43.93%, which rounds to 44%, so the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using a different method? Let me see the options. The options are 44, 40, 52,48. \n\nHmm, 44 is option A. So that's the closest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the probability is P(T \u2264150). Wait, the question says after 50 minutes, so the time from now is 150 minutes. But according to memoryless, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting fresh. \n\nWait, but the original 32% was over 100 minutes. So if I can compute the decay constant, then compute the probability over 150 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute the half-life. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the half-life is T1/2. Then, the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival probability is 68%. \n\nThe survival probability is (1/2)^(100 / T1/2) = 0.68. \n\nTaking log2 of both sides: (100 / T1/2) * ln(2) = ln(1/0.68). \n\nWait, maybe easier with natural logs: \n\nln(0.68) = (100 / T1/2) * ln(0.5). \n\nThus, T1/2 = 100 * ln(0.5) / ln(0.68). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nln(0.5) \u2248 -0.6931, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. \n\nThus, T1/2 = 100 * (-0.6931)/ (-0.38566) \u2248 100 * (0.6931/0.38566) \u2248 100 * 1.797 \u2248 179.7 minutes. \n\nSo the half-life is approximately 180 minutes. \n\nThen, the decay probability over 150 minutes would be 1 - (0.5)^(150 / 180) \n\n= 1 - (0.5)^(5/6). \n\nLet me compute (0.5)^(5/6). Let me see: \n\nTake natural log: ln(0.5^(5/6)) = (5/6) * ln(0.5) \u2248 (5/6)*(-0.6931) \u2248 -0.5776. \n\nExponentiate: e^-0.5776 \u2248 0.561. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is again ~43.9%. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)44%. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me read the question again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes\". So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes (starting now, after 50), so the time period is 150 minutes, not the total 200. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what we computed. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is equal to the probability of decaying in the first 150 minutes, which is P(T \u2264150) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the decay probability is linear, which is a common misconception. Like, if 32% decay in 100 minutes, then in 150 minutes, it's 32% * 1.5 = 48%, but that's wrong because decay is exponential. \n\nBut the options include 48% (D). So that's a possible trap. \n\nAlternatively, someone might think that since 50 minutes have passed, and the half-life is about 180 minutes, then after 50 minutes, the remaining probability over 150 is like 150/180 = 5/6 of a half-life, so the decay probability is 1 - (1/2)^(5/6) \u2248 44%, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe decay constant \u03bb can be found from the given data. \n\nWe have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). \n\nLet me solve for \u03bb. \n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68 \u2192 -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2192 \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. \n\nThen, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb *150) \n\n= 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) \n\nCompute exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849 \n\nSo e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.561, so 1 -0.561=0.439 \u219243.9% \u219244%. \n\nSo all methods lead to A. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is A)44%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of an atom decaying in the next 150 minutes after already surviving 50 minutes, given a 32% decay probability over 100 minutes. Radioactive decay follows an exponential model, which is memoryless. This means the probability of decay in the next time interval depends only on the current time and not on prior survival.\n\nFirst, we calculate the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\). The given decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\\[\n1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.32 \\implies e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes (after surviving 50 minutes) equals the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting fresh. We compute this as:\n\\[\nP(T \\leq 150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\lambda \\):\n\\[\ne^{-150\\lambda} = (e^{-100\\lambda})^{1.5} = (0.68)^{1.5}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 0.561 \\), we find:\n\\[\nP(T \\leq 150) = 1 - 0.561 \\approx 0.439 \\approx 44\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A) 44%**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about radioactive decay probability. Hmm, so the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, so the total time after the 50 minutes is 150, making the total time from the start 200 minutes? Or is the next 150 starting from the 50-minute mark?\n\nRight, the problem states that 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we want the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the time period we're looking at is from 50 to 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes. \n\nSince radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability of decay in a given time interval depends on the half-life or the decay constant. But the problem gives a probability over 100 minutes. Let me recall that the probability of decay in time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. \n\nWait, the problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so that would be P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). From that, we can solve for \u03bb. Let me do that first.\n\nLet me write the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). Therefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher. Let me calculate it more accurately. Maybe using a calculator in mind. Let's see, e^-0.4 is about 0.67, right? Because e^-0.4 \u2248 1 -0.4 +0.08/2 - ... Hmm, maybe better to just proceed with the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Wait, no, the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next time interval, given that it hasn't decayed yet, depends only on the time interval, not on how long it's been since the start. Wait, so perhaps the 50 minutes already passed don't affect the future probability. But that can't be right here because the question gives the 32% over 100 minutes, but maybe the problem is structured so that we need to find the probability from time 50 to 200 (since 50+150=200) given that it survived until 50. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the memoryless property of exponential decay means that the probability of surviving an additional time t, given that it has already survived time T, is the same as the probability of surviving t time from the start. So the survival probability after T + t is S(T + t) = S(T) * S(t). So, the conditional probability of surviving t more time given that it survived T is S(t). Therefore, the probability of decay in the next t minutes after time T is 1 - S(t). \n\nBut in the problem, we need to compute the probability that it decays between time 50 and 200 (150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed by 50. So that would be 1 - S(150), where S is the survival function. However, we need to find S(150). But we know S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Since S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), so S(100) = e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150\u03bb) = [e^(-100\u03bb)]^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. So 1 - (0.68)^1.5 would be the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 (since 150 minutes after 50).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \u03bb in terms of the given data. Let me compute \u03bb first. Let me do that step by step. \n\nGiven that 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32, so e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68). \n\nHmm, ln(0.68) \u2248 let's see. Let me recall that ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less. Let me approximate. Let me use the Taylor series around 0.7? Alternatively, perhaps use ln(0.68) = ln(0.7) - ln(0.68/0.7). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, let me remember that ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.7) is -0.3567, so 0.68 is between them. Let me see, maybe approximate:\n\nLet me note that 0.68 = 0.7 * (68/70) = 0.7*(0.9714). So ln(0.68) = ln(0.7) + ln(0.9714). The ln(0.9714) is approximately -0.029 (since ln(1 - x) \u2248 -x for small x, here x=0.0286). So ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so total is -0.3567 -0.029 \u2248 -0.3857. Let's say approximately -0.38. Let me check with calculator-like steps:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute it more accurately. Let me think of ln(0.68):\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) = ln(68) - ln(100) = ln(68) - 4.60517.\n\nln(68): 68 is e^4. Let me see, e^4 is about 54.598, e^4.2 is e^4 * e^0.2 \u2248 54.598 * 1.2214 \u2248 66.6. Close to 68. Let me compute ln(68):\n\nLet me use ln(68) = ln(64) + ln(1.0625). Since 64 is 2^6, ln(64)=4.1589. Then ln(1.0625) \u2248 0.0606 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2..., x=0.0625, so approx 0.0625 - (0.0625)^2/2 \u2248 0.0625 -0.00195 \u2248 0.0605). So total ln(68) \u22484.1589 +0.0605\u22484.2194. Then subtract ln(100)=4.6052, so ln(0.68)=4.2194 -4.6052\u2248-0.3858. So that's about -0.3858. \n\nThus, \u03bb = - (-0.3858)/100 \u22480.003858 per minute. \n\nSo then, to find the probability of decay between time 50 and 200 (150 minutes), given it survived until 50, that's the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute that exponent:\n\n\u03bb *150 = 0.003858 *150 \u22480.5787. \n\nSo e^-0.5787 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5787 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute 0.5787 -0.5 =0.0787. The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1. So 0.0787 is 78.7% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. The e^-0.5 is 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. The difference between them is 0.0577. So 78.7% of 0.0577 is approx 0.0454. Subtract that from 0.6065: 0.6065 -0.0454\u22480.5611. Wait, but that might be a rough estimate. Alternatively, use a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the Taylor series around x=0.5: Let me think of f(x) = e^{-x}, at x=0.5787. Let me set x =0.5 +0.0787. So f(x)= e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.0787}. We know e^{-0.0787} \u22481 -0.0787 + (0.0787)^2/2 - ... Let's compute that:\n\nFirst term: 1 -0.0787 =0.9213. Second term: (0.0787)^2 /2 \u22480.003097. So total approx 0.9213 +0.0031 \u22480.9244 (Wait, no, the expansion is e^{-y} \u22481 - y + y\u00b2/2 - y\u00b3/6 ...). Wait, actually, e^{-y} = 1 - y + y\u00b2/2 - y\u00b3/6 + ... So for y=0.0787, up to the second term gives 1 -0.0787 =0.9213. Adding the second term (positive since it's + y\u00b2/2): 0.9213 + (0.0787)^2 /2 \u22480.9213 + 0.00309 \u22480.9244. So e^{-0.0787}\u22480.9244. Then multiply by e^{-0.5} \u22480.6065 gives 0.6065 *0.9244 \u2248?\n\n0.6 *0.9244 =0.5546, plus 0.0065*0.9244\u22480.006. Total \u22480.5606. So e^-0.5787 \u22480.5606. So then 1 - that is \u22480.4394, so about 44%. \n\nHmm, so the probability would be approximately 44%, which is option A. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Wait, but the problem states that after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed. The memoryless property says that the remaining lifetime is the same as starting over. Wait, no, the memoryless property states that the probability of surviving an additional time t given that it has already survived T is equal to the probability of surviving t from the start. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150), where S(150) = (S(100))^{1.5} ?\n\nWait, S(t) = e^{-\u03bb t}, so S(150) = [S(100)]^{150/100} = (0.68)^1.5. Let me compute that. 0.68^1.5. Let me compute sqrt(0.68^3). Wait 1.5 is 3/2. So (0.68)^3 = 0.68 *0.68*0.68. Let me compute 0.68*0.68 first: that's 0.4624. Multiply by 0.68: 0.4624 *0.68. Let's see, 0.4*0.68=0.272, 0.0624*0.68= ~0.0424. So total 0.272+0.0424=0.3144. So 0.68^3 is 0.314432. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.314432). Let me compute sqrt(0.3144). The square of 0.56 is 0.3136, which is very close. So sqrt(0.3144) \u22480.5607. So (0.68)^1.5 \u22480.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 \u22480.4393, so ~43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's think in terms of half-lives, but since the given data is 32% in 100 minutes, maybe that's not straightforward. Alternatively, using the formula for the decay probability over a period:\n\nThe probability that it hasn't decayed after T time is S(T) = e^{-\u03bbT}. The probability that it decays between T and T + \u0394t is S(T) * (1 - S(\u0394t)), but no, actually, it's S(T) * (1 - S(\u0394t))? Wait no, the probability that it decays between T and T+\u0394t is S(T) * (1 - S(\u0394t)), because first it must survive until T, then decay in the next \u0394t. But in this problem, we are given that it has already survived until T=50, so we can condition on that. The conditional probability is then (probability of surviving until 50 and then decaying in next 150) divided by probability of surviving until 50. Which is [S(50)*(1 - S(150))]/S(50) = 1 - S(150). So that's the same as before. \n\nWe can compute S(150) as (S(100))^(150/100) = (0.68)^1.5 as above, leading to the same result. So the probability is 1 - (0.68)^1.5 \u2248 44%. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A) 44%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about radioactive decay probability. Hmm, so the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, so the total time after the 50 minutes is 150, making the total time from the start 200 minutes? Or is the next 150 starting from the 50-minute mark?\n\nRight, the problem states that 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we want the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the time period we're looking at is from 50 to 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes. \n\nSince radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability of decay in a given time interval depends on the half-life or the decay constant. But the problem gives a probability over 100 minutes. Let me recall that the probability of decay in time t is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. \n\nWait, the problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so that would be P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100). From that, we can solve for \u03bb. Let me do that first.\n\nLet me write the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). So e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). Therefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... Well, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher. Let me calculate it more accurately. Maybe using a calculator in mind. Let's see, e^-0.4 is about 0.67, right? Because e^-0.4 \u2248 1 -0.4 +0.08/2 - ... Hmm, maybe better to just proceed with the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Wait, no, the memoryless property says that the probability of decaying in the next time interval, given that it hasn't decayed yet, depends only on the time interval, not on how long it's been since the start. Wait, so perhaps the 50 minutes already passed don't affect the future probability. But that can't be right here because the question gives the 32% over 100 minutes, but maybe the problem is structured so that we need to find the probability from time 50 to 200 (since 50+150=200) given that it survived until 50. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the memoryless property of exponential decay means that the probability of surviving an additional time t, given that it has already survived time T, is the same as the probability of surviving t time from the start. So the survival probability after T + t is S(T + t) = S(T) * S(t). So, the conditional probability of surviving t more time given that it survived T is S(t). Therefore, the probability of decay in the next t minutes after time T is 1 - S(t). \n\nBut in the problem, we need to compute the probability that it decays between time 50 and 200 (150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed by 50. So that would be 1 - S(150), where S is the survival function. However, we need to find S(150). But we know S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Since S(t) = e^(-\u03bbt), so S(100) = e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150\u03bb) = [e^(-100\u03bb)]^(1.5) = (0.68)^1.5. So 1 - (0.68)^1.5 would be the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 (since 150 minutes after 50).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \u03bb in terms of the given data. Let me compute \u03bb first. Let me do that step by step. \n\nGiven that 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32, so e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute ln(0.68). \n\nHmm, ln(0.68) \u2248 let's see. Let me recall that ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less. Let me approximate. Let me use the Taylor series around 0.7? Alternatively, perhaps use ln(0.68) = ln(0.7) - ln(0.68/0.7). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, let me remember that ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.7) is -0.3567, so 0.68 is between them. Let me see, maybe approximate:\n\nLet me note that 0.68 = 0.7 * (68/70) = 0.7*(0.9714). So ln(0.68) = ln(0.7) + ln(0.9714). The ln(0.9714) is approximately -0.029 (since ln(1 - x) \u2248 -x for small x, here x=0.0286). So ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so total is -0.3567 -0.029 \u2248 -0.3857. Let's say approximately -0.38. Let me check with calculator-like steps:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute it more accurately. Let me think of ln(0.68):\n\nWe can compute ln(0.68) = ln(68) - ln(100) = ln(68) - 4.60517.\n\nln(68): 68 is e^4. Let me see, e^4 is about 54.598, e^4.2 is e^4 * e^0.2 \u2248 54.598 * 1.2214 \u2248 66.6. Close to 68. Let me compute ln(68):\n\nLet me use ln(68) = ln(64) + ln(1.0625). Since 64 is 2^6, ln(64)=4.1589. Then ln(1.0625) \u2248 0.0606 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2..., x=0.0625, so approx 0.0625 - (0.0625)^2/2 \u2248 0.0625 -0.00195 \u2248 0.0605). So total ln(68) \u22484.1589 +0.0605\u22484.2194. Then subtract ln(100)=4.6052, so ln(0.68)=4.2194 -4.6052\u2248-0.3858. So that's about -0.3858. \n\nThus, \u03bb = - (-0.3858)/100 \u22480.003858 per minute. \n\nSo then, to find the probability of decay between time 50 and 200 (150 minutes), given it survived until 50, that's the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from now, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Let's compute that exponent:\n\n\u03bb *150 = 0.003858 *150 \u22480.5787. \n\nSo e^-0.5787 \u2248 ?\n\nHmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5787 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute 0.5787 -0.5 =0.0787. The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1. So 0.0787 is 78.7% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. The e^-0.5 is 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488. The difference between them is 0.0577. So 78.7% of 0.0577 is approx 0.0454. Subtract that from 0.6065: 0.6065 -0.0454\u22480.5611. Wait, but that might be a rough estimate. Alternatively, use a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the Taylor series around x=0.5: Let me think of f(x) = e^{-x}, at x=0.5787. Let me set x =0.5 +0.0787. So f(x)= e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.0787}. We know e^{-0.0787} \u22481 -0.0787 + (0.0787)^2/2 - ... Let's compute that:\n\nFirst term: 1 -0.0787 =0.9213. Second term: (0.0787)^2 /2 \u22480.003097. So total approx 0.9213 +0.0031 \u22480.9244 (Wait, no, the expansion is e^{-y} \u22481 - y + y\u00b2/2 - y\u00b3/6 ...). Wait, actually, e^{-y} = 1 - y + y\u00b2/2 - y\u00b3/6 + ... So for y=0.0787, up to the second term gives 1 -0.0787 =0.9213. Adding the second term (positive since it's + y\u00b2/2): 0.9213 + (0.0787)^2 /2 \u22480.9213 + 0.00309 \u22480.9244. So e^{-0.0787}\u22480.9244. Then multiply by e^{-0.5} \u22480.6065 gives 0.6065 *0.9244 \u2248?\n\n0.6 *0.9244 =0.5546, plus 0.0065*0.9244\u22480.006. Total \u22480.5606. So e^-0.5787 \u22480.5606. So then 1 - that is \u22480.4394, so about 44%. \n\nHmm, so the probability would be approximately 44%, which is option A. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Wait, but the problem states that after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed. The memoryless property says that the remaining lifetime is the same as starting over. Wait, no, the memoryless property states that the probability of surviving an additional time t given that it has already survived T is equal to the probability of surviving t from the start. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - S(150), where S(150) = (S(100))^{1.5} ?\n\nWait, S(t) = e^{-\u03bb t}, so S(150) = [S(100)]^{150/100} = (0.68)^1.5. Let me compute that. 0.68^1.5. Let me compute sqrt(0.68^3). Wait 1.5 is 3/2. So (0.68)^3 = 0.68 *0.68*0.68. Let me compute 0.68*0.68 first: that's 0.4624. Multiply by 0.68: 0.4624 *0.68. Let's see, 0.4*0.68=0.272, 0.0624*0.68= ~0.0424. So total 0.272+0.0424=0.3144. So 0.68^3 is 0.314432. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.314432). Let me compute sqrt(0.3144). The square of 0.56 is 0.3136, which is very close. So sqrt(0.3144) \u22480.5607. So (0.68)^1.5 \u22480.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 \u22480.4393, so ~43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.
