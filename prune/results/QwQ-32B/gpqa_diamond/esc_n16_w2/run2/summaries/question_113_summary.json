      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas. Let me break down each piece of data step by step.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The very broad peak at around 3000 wavenumbers. Wait, a broad absorption around 3200-3600 is usually O-H, like from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But here it's at 3000. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact positions. Let me think again. Oh, maybe the 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 region is actually for C-H stretching. Wait, the broad peak at 3000 might not be O-H. Wait, maybe the broad peak here is actually a mistake in the question? Or perhaps I need to check the exact values. Alternatively, maybe the very broad peak is from O-H. Wait, maybe the 3000 is a typo? Or perhaps the user meant 3000-3600. Alternatively, maybe the peak at 3000 is a C-H stretch, but the very broad one is elsewhere. Wait, the question says \"a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\". Hmm, that's confusing because O-H stretching is usually around 3200-3600. Maybe the 3000 here is a mistake? Or perhaps it's a different functional group. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is a carboxylic acid O-H (around 3200-3500), but if it's at 3000, maybe it's not. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at other peaks.\n\nThe other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a common carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). The 1650 could be a C=C (alkene) or maybe a conjugated system. Wait, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the OH is a broad peak. If there's a carbonyl at 1700 and a peak at 1650, maybe that's a conjugated system. Wait, maybe it's an ester or amide? Wait, amides have peaks around 1650 but with different features. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with a double bond? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR suggests there's an alkene group (C=C) in the compound. So that would explain the 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak as the C=C stretch. The 1700 would then be a carbonyl group. So combining carbonyl and alkene groups. \n\nPossible functional groups with carbonyl and alkene: maybe an enone (like a ketone with a double bond adjacent, like in conjugation), or maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which would have the carbonyl at 1700 and the C=C at 1650 or so. That makes sense.\n\nNow the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45. What fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. Common fragments: maybe a methyl ketone fragment? Wait, the molecular ion peak would be the molecular weight. The fragment at 45 could be, for example, the acetyl (C2H3O) group? Wait, acetyl is C2H3O, which would be 43 (since 12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a formyl (CHO) group? That's 29, no. Wait, perhaps a fragment like a CH2O group? 12*2 +16 = 40. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a COOH group? Wait, COOH is 45 (12 + 16*2 + 1? Wait, the molecular formula for COOH is CHO2, so molar mass is 12 + 16*2 + 1 = 12+32+1=45. Oh! So a carboxylic acid fragment would give m/z 45. So that suggests there's a carboxylic acid group in the compound.\n\nPutting this together: the FTIR has a broad peak (maybe from -OH of a carboxylic acid?), a carbonyl at 1700 (carboxylic acid's carbonyl), and a C=C at 1650. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid (since COOH is 45). So the compound would have a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a double bond. \n\nNow, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here. So for each formula:\n\nFor C6H12O: DoU = (12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (2)/2 = 1. Wait, wait the formula is C6H12O. So substituting: (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But we have a double bond (from vinyl H's) and a carboxylic acid (which contributes a double bond from the carbonyl). Wait, the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (a double bond) and an -OH. So each carboxylic acid group gives one double bond. So two double bonds? Then that would require 2 DoU. But if the formula has only 1 DoU, that's a problem. \n\nLet me check the other options. Let's see:\n\nC6H10O2: formula is C6H10O2. So DoU calculation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That would fit with one double bond (from the vinyl) and one from the carbonyl (carboxylic acid), so two DoU. That's possible. \n\nC6H10O: DoU = (14-10)/2 = 4/2=2? Wait, let me recalculate. For C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Wait, same as C6H10O2? Wait no, the oxygen here is one. Wait the formula is C6H10O. So substituting into the formula: DoU = (2*6 +2 - H -0)/2. H is 10. So (14 -10)=4, divided by 2 is 2. So same as C6H10O2? Wait no, the oxygen count affects the formula. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, oxygen is subtracted? Wait, no, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens and N is nitrogens. So oxygen isn't part of that equation. So for C6H10O2, the calculation is the same as C6H10O, but the oxygen is part of the functional groups. The degrees of unsaturation are based on the number of hydrogens and carbons, not oxygen. So both C6H10O and C6H10O2 have the same degrees of unsaturation (2). Hmm. Wait, but the oxygen can contribute to the structure. Let's think again.\n\nThe compound has a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH. That contributes two oxygens (since COOH is -CO-OH). So if the formula has two oxygens, like C6H10O2, that would fit a carboxylic acid group. The other option with two oxygens is option A (C6H12O2) but that would have different degrees of unsaturation. Let me check the other options:\n\nOption A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 DoU. That can't be, because we need two (double bond and carbonyl). So that's out.\n\nOption B: C6H10O. The formula here has one O. If it has a carboxylic acid (which requires two O's?), then that's a problem. Wait, carboxylic acid has two oxygen atoms (in COOH). So if the compound has only one O, that can't be. So that would not have a carboxylic acid. But the mass spec fragment at 45 (COOH) suggests that there is a carboxylic acid group. So that would require two oxygens. So option B (C6H10O) can't have a carboxylic acid. So that's out.\n\nOption C: C6H10O2. This has two oxygens. That would allow for a carboxylic acid group. The DoU is 2, which matches two double bonds (carbonyl and the alkene). So that works.\n\nOption D: C6H12O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So only one degree of unsaturation. That would require either a ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (so a double bond) and the carbonyl (another double bond). So two double bonds, needing two DoU. So D can't be.\n\nSo the correct formula must be C6H10O2, which is option C. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the mass spec fragment at m/z 45 is the carboxylic acid group (COOH, molecular weight 45). So the presence of that fragment suggests that the molecular ion would have a mass that includes the rest of the molecule. The molecular formula would need to have at least the COOH group. So, for example, if the compound is something like CH2CH2(COOH) with other groups, but let's see the formulas.\n\nThe options are:\n\nC6H10O2: so the formula has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Let's see if that can form a structure with a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\nSuppose it's something like pent-2-enoic acid. The formula for pent-2-enoic acid would be C5H8O2. Wait, but that's only 5 carbons. We need 6 carbons here. So maybe hex-2-enoic acid? That would be C6H10O2. Let's count the H's. The general formula for an alkene with a carboxylic acid. For a six-carbon chain with one double bond and one carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. For each double bond, subtract 2 H. For each carboxylic acid (which is a functional group that adds -COOH, which has a carbonyl and an -OH. The formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. Wait, let's see. For a six-carbon chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid: \n\nThe base chain would be C6H12 (if no functional groups). But with a double bond, it's C6H10. Then adding the carboxylic acid group (which replaces two H's with -COOH. Wait, the -COOH adds two O's and takes away two H's. Let's see: \n\nLet me think of the formula. Let's take hex-2-enoic acid: the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, maybe I need to structure it properly. Let me think of hex-2-enoic acid: the formula would be C6H10O2. Because:\n\nThe parent chain is 6 carbons with a double bond between C2 and C3. The carboxylic acid is at the end. So the formula would be:\n\nThe general formula for an enoic acid (unsaturated carboxylic acid) would be CnH2n-2O2? Let me check:\n\nTake for example, hex-2-enoic acid: the formula is C6H10O2. Because a straight-chain hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. Adding a double bond reduces two H's, so 12-2=10, so C6H10O2. Exactly. So that matches option C. So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another structure. But the options given have C6H10O2 as option C. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's an alkene. The FTIR has the carbonyl (1700) and the alkene (1650). The carboxylic acid's O-H would give a broad peak, but the question says the very broad peak is at 3000, which is a bit odd because O-H is usually higher. Wait, maybe the broad peak here is not O-H? That could be a problem. Let me think again about the FTIR peaks. \n\nWait, the FTIR's very broad absorption at 3000. Maybe I made a mistake here. The O-H stretch is around 3200-3600. So a broad peak at 3000 is not O-H. Then what could it be? Maybe it's the -CH2-O- group (like in an ether?), but that's around 3300-3500. Wait, maybe the 3000 peak is actually the C-H stretch of an alkane, but broad? Hmm, maybe it's the O-H of an alcohol? But that's higher. Wait, maybe the peak at 3000 is actually the C-O stretch? No, C-O is around 1000-1300. Wait, perhaps the question is indicating a broad peak in the 3000 region, but maybe it's actually a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is the N-H, but the options don't have N. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound has an alcohol group (O-H) but the peak is at 3000? That would be inconsistent. Hmm. Wait, maybe the broad peak is actually the O-H but the question's numbers are off. Because otherwise, the presence of a carboxylic acid (which requires the O-H) would need a broad peak around 3200-3600. So maybe the question's data has a typo and the broad peak is at 3400, but it's written as 3000. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf the carbonyl is part of an ester (which would have a COOR group), then the O-H wouldn't be present. So the broad peak might not be from O-H. But then where would the broad peak come from? Wait, esters have a carbonyl at ~1740 cm\u207b\u00b9, but maybe the 1700 is an ester. But then the fragment peak at m/z 45 wouldn't be from COOH. Hmm, that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alkene. But then the fragment at 45 wouldn't make sense. Wait, 45 is COOH. So the presence of that fragment suggests the molecule has a carboxylic acid group. So the O-H must be present, but then the FTIR should show a broad peak around 3200-3600. The given data shows a broad peak at 3000, which is conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe the 3000 is a mistake and should be 3400. Or maybe the question is correct and I need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group but in a different environment. Wait, maybe the compound is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. Lactones have a carbonyl but no O-H. But then the fragment peak at 45 wouldn't be present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid but the O-H is involved in hydrogen bonding, but the peak is still in the right place. Maybe the question's numbers are off, but I have to go with the given data. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is the N-H, but there's no nitrogen in the options. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to proceed despite the discrepancy. The presence of the fragment at 45 (COOH) suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group. So the formula must have two oxygens (since COOH has two O). So options C or A. \n\nThe DoU for the compound must be 2 (double bond from alkene and carbonyl). \n\nThe options with two oxygens are C (C6H10O2) and A (C6H12O2). \n\nC6H12O2 has DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. That's only one degree of unsaturation. Which can't account for both the double bond and the carbonyl. \n\nC6H10O2 gives DoU of 2, which matches. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nThe NMR has vinyl hydrogens (so alkene present), the carbonyl (carboxylic acid), and the fragment at 45 confirms the COOH group. The formula must be C6H10O2. \n\nTherefore the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows a broad peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 (likely an error for O-H at ~3300-3600), a carbonyl at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 (suggesting a carboxylic acid or ester), and a C=C peak at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look at other peaks.\n\nThe other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a common carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid). The 1650 could be a C=C (alkene) or maybe a conjugated system. Wait, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the OH is a broad peak.

The 1700 would then be a carbonyl group. So combining carbonyl and alkene groups. \n\nPossible functional groups with carbonyl and alkene: maybe an enone (like a ketone with a double bond adjacent, like in conjugation), or maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which would have the carbonyl at 1700 and the C=C at 1650 or so. That makes sense.\n\nNow the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45. What fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. Common fragments: maybe a methyl ketone fragment? Wait, the molecular ion peak would be the molecular weight. The fragment at 45 could be, for example, the acetyl (C2H3O) group? Wait, acetyl is C2H3O, which would be 43 (since 12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe a formyl (CHO) group? That's 29, no. Wait, perhaps a fragment like a CH2O group? 12*2 +16 = 40. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a COOH group? Wait, COOH is 45 (12 + 16*2 + 1? Wait, the molecular formula for COOH is CHO2, so molar mass is 12 + 16*2 + 1 = 12+32+1=45. Oh! So a carboxylic acid fragment would give m/z 45. So that suggests there's a carboxylic acid group in the compound.\n\nPutting this together: the FTIR has a broad peak (maybe from -OH of a carboxylic acid?), a carbonyl at 1700 (carboxylic acid's carbonyl), and a C=C at 1650. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests a carboxylic acid (since COOH is 45). So the compound would have a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a double bond. \n\nNow, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here. So for each formula:\n\nFor C6H12O: DoU = (12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (2)/2 = 1. Wait, wait the formula is C6H12O. So substituting: (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But we have a double bond (from vinyl H's) and a carboxylic acid (which contributes a double bond from the carbonyl). Wait, the carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (a double bond) and an -OH. So each carboxylic acid group gives one double bond. So two double bonds? Then that would require 2 DoU. But if the formula has only 1 DoU, that's a problem. \n\nLet me check the other options. Let's see:\n\nC6H10O2: formula is C6H10O2. So DoU calculation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That would fit with one double bond (from the vinyl) and one from the carbonyl (carboxylic acid), so two DoU. That's possible. \n\nC6H10O: DoU = (14-10)/2 = 4/2=2? Wait, let me recalculate. For C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Wait, same as C6H10O2? Wait no, the oxygen here is one. Wait the formula is C6H10O. So substituting into the formula: DoU = (2*6 +2 - H -0)/2. H is 10. So (14 -10)=4, divided by 2 is 2. So same as C6H10O2? Wait no, the oxygen count affects the formula. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, oxygen is subtracted? Wait, no, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens and N is nitrogens. So oxygen isn't part of that equation. So for C6H10O2, the calculation is the same as C6H10O, but the oxygen is part of the functional groups. The degrees of unsaturation are based on the number of hydrogens and carbons, not oxygen. So both C6H10O and C6H10O2 have the same degrees of unsaturation (2). Hmm. Wait, but the oxygen can contribute to the structure. Let's think again.\n\nThe compound has a carboxylic acid (COOH) which is -COOH. That contributes two oxygens (since COOH is -CO-OH). So if the formula has two oxygens, like C6H10O2, that would fit a carboxylic acid group. The other option with two oxygens is option A (C6H12O2) but that would have different degrees of unsaturation. Let me check the other options:\n\nOption A: C6H12O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 DoU. That can't be, because we need two (double bond and carbonyl). So that's out.\n\nOption B: C6H10O. The formula here has one O. If it has a carboxylic acid (which requires two O's?), then that's a problem. Wait, carboxylic acid has two oxygen atoms (in COOH). So if the compound has only one O, that can't be. So that would not have a carboxylic acid. But the mass spec fragment at 45 (COOH) suggests that there is a carboxylic acid group. So that would require two oxygens. So option B (C6H10O) can't have a carboxylic acid. So that's out.\n\nOption C: C6H10O2. This has two oxygens. That would allow for a carboxylic acid group. The DoU is 2, which matches two double bonds (carbonyl and the alkene). So that works.\n\nOption D: C6H12O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So only one degree of unsaturation. That would require either a ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (so a double bond) and the carbonyl (another double bond). So two double bonds, needing two DoU. So D can't be.\n\nSo the correct formula must be C6H10O2, which is option C. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the mass spec fragment at m/z 45 is the carboxylic acid group (COOH, molecular weight 45). So the presence of that fragment suggests that the molecular ion would have a mass that includes the rest of the molecule. The molecular formula would need to have at least the COOH group. So, for example, if the compound is something like CH2CH2(COOH) with other groups, but let's see the formulas.\n\nThe options are:\n\nC6H10O2: so the formula has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Let's see if that can form a structure with a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\nSuppose it's something like pent-2-enoic acid. The formula for pent-2-enoic acid would be C5H8O2. Wait, but that's only 5 carbons. We need 6 carbons here. So maybe hex-2-enoic acid? That would be C6H10O2. Let's count the H's. The general formula for an alkene with a carboxylic acid. For a six-carbon chain with one double bond and one carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. For each double bond, subtract 2 H. For each carboxylic acid (which is a functional group that adds -COOH, which has a carbonyl and an -OH. The formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. Wait, let's see. For a six-carbon chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid: \n\nThe base chain would be C6H12 (if no functional groups). But with a double bond, it's C6H10. Then adding the carboxylic acid group (which replaces two H's with -COOH. Wait, the -COOH adds two O's and takes away two H's. Let's see: \n\nLet me think of the formula. Let's take hex-2-enoic acid: the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, maybe I need to structure it properly. Let me think of hex-2-enoic acid: the formula would be C6H10O2. Because:\n\nThe parent chain is 6 carbons with a double bond between C2 and C3. The carboxylic acid is at the end. So the formula would be:\n\nThe general formula for an enoic acid (unsaturated carboxylic acid) would be CnH2n-2O2? Let me check:\n\nTake for example, hex-2-enoic acid: the formula is C6H10O2. Because a straight-chain hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. Adding a double bond reduces two H's, so 12-2=10, so C6H10O2. Exactly. So that matches option C. So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another structure. But the options given have C6H10O2 as option C. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's an alkene. The FTIR has the carbonyl (1700) and the alkene (1650). The carboxylic acid's O-H would give a broad peak, but the question says the very broad peak is at 3000, which is a bit odd because O-H is usually higher. Wait, maybe the broad peak here is not O-H? That could be a problem. Let me think again about the FTIR peaks. \n\nWait, the FTIR's very broad absorption at 3000. Maybe I made a mistake here. The O-H stretch is around 3200-3600. So a broad peak at 3000 is not O-H. Then what could it be? Maybe it's the -CH2-O- group (like in an ether?), but that's around 3300-3500. Wait, maybe the 3000 peak is actually the C-H stretch of an alkane, but broad? Hmm, maybe it's the O-H of an alcohol? But that's higher. Wait, maybe the peak at 3000 is actually the C-O stretch? No, C-O is around 1000-1300. Wait, perhaps the question is indicating a broad peak in the 3000 region, but maybe it's actually a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is the N-H, but the options don't have N. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound has an alcohol group (O-H) but the peak is at 3000? That would be inconsistent. Hmm. Wait, maybe the broad peak is actually the O-H but the question's numbers are off. Because otherwise, the presence of a carboxylic acid (which requires the O-H) would need a broad peak around 3200-3600. So maybe the question's data has a typo and the broad peak is at 3400, but it's written as 3000. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf the carbonyl is part of an ester (which would have a COOR group), then the O-H wouldn't be present. So the broad peak might not be from O-H. But then where would the broad peak come from? Wait, esters have a carbonyl at ~1740 cm\u207b\u00b9, but maybe the 1700 is an ester. But then the fragment peak at m/z 45 wouldn't be from COOH. Hmm, that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alkene. But then the fragment at 45 wouldn't make sense. Wait, 45 is COOH. So the presence of that fragment suggests the molecule has a carboxylic acid group. So the O-H must be present, but then the FTIR should show a broad peak around 3200-3600. The given data shows a broad peak at 3000, which is conflicting. \n\nHmm, maybe the 3000 is a mistake and should be 3400. Or maybe the question is correct and I need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group but in a different environment. Wait, maybe the compound is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. Lactones have a carbonyl but no O-H. But then the fragment peak at 45 wouldn't be present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid but the O-H is involved in hydrogen bonding, but the peak is still in the right place. Maybe the question's numbers are off, but I have to go with the given data. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is the N-H, but there's no nitrogen in the options. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to proceed despite the discrepancy. The presence of the fragment at 45 (COOH) suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group. So the formula must have two oxygens (since COOH has two O). So options C or A. \n\nThe DoU for the compound must be 2 (double bond from alkene and carbonyl). \n\nThe options with two oxygens are C (C6H10O2) and A (C6H12O2). \n\nC6H12O2 has DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. That's only one degree of unsaturation. Which can't account for both the double bond and the carbonyl. \n\nC6H10O2 gives DoU of 2, which matches. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nThe NMR has vinyl hydrogens (so alkene present), the carbonyl (carboxylic acid), and the fragment at 45 confirms the COOH group. The formula must be C6H10O2. \n\nTherefore the answer is C.\n\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows a broad peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 (likely an error for O-H at ~3300-3600), a carbonyl at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 (suggesting a carboxylic acid or ester), and a C=C peak at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9. The 1H NMR vinyl hydrogens confirm an alkene. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 corresponds to a carboxylic acid (COOH). \n\nThe compound must contain a carboxylic acid (two oxygen atoms) and an alkene. Calculating degrees of unsaturation:  \n- **C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082**: Degrees of unsaturation = (2\u00d76 + 2 \u2212 10)/2 = 2, matching the two double bonds (alkene and carbonyl).  \n- Other options (e.g., C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2082) have insufficient unsaturation, and C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O lacks the required oxygen for a carboxylic acid.  \n\nAnswer: C  \nAnswer: $C\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options are four different formulas, so I need to analyze each piece of data given and see which formula fits.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum. The question mentions a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Wait, I remember that broad peaks around 3200-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9 are usually from O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But here it's at 3000. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Alternatively, maybe the peak is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe the 3000 is in the wrong region. Wait, wait, maybe I'm confusing the exact numbers. Let me think again. The O-H stretch is typically around 3200-3600. The C-H stretching is around 2800-3000 for alkanes, but a very broad peak at 3000 might not be that. Wait, maybe the 3000 here is actually a typo and should be 3400? Or perhaps the question's numbers are accurate. Alternatively, maybe the peak is a combination? Wait, the problem states \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers\". Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll take it as given. Alternatively, perhaps the 3000 peak is part of an alkene's C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3000-3100. But a broad peak would still suggest O-H. Hmm, maybe the 3000 is actually part of a carboxylic acid's O-H? Wait, maybe the question's numbers are precise. Let's see the other peaks. The FTIR also has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. \n\nThe 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a common carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester). The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C stretch (alkene) or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the C-OH bend is around 1400, but maybe in esters, the carbonyl is similar. Wait, if there's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the 1650 might be the C-H bending? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, if there's a conjugated enone (like a ketone with a double bond adjacent), the peaks might shift. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen. So probably not. Let me think again. The presence of a carbonyl at 1700 and a peak at 1650. If the compound has a conjugated system, like a conjugated diene or an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone), then the 1650 could be the C=C stretch. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CO-R, the carbonyl is at 1700 and the double bond at 1650. That makes sense. So maybe there's a conjugated system here.\n\nNow the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on the double bond. So that suggests there's an alkene group present. So that's consistent with the C=C stretch at 1650. \n\nThe mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, m/z 45. What common fragments give that? Let's think. The molecular ion peak would be the molecular weight, but the fragment here is 45. Common fragments: maybe a ketene (COCH3?) but no. Alternatively, maybe a formyl group (CHO) which is 29? No. Wait, maybe a fragment like CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether) is 46, but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a COOH group? Wait, the molecular ion's mass would be needed. Alternatively, if the fragment is CH3CO (acetyl, 43?), or maybe a different group. Let me think. The fragment m/z 45: possible fragments could be a formate (HCOO-) but that's 45. Wait, formic acid is HCOOH (46), so HCOO- would be 45? Or maybe a methyl group with some oxygen? Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone group? Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O (formaldehyde, 30), no. Hmm, perhaps the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. Wait, if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, then the COOH would have a molecular weight of 45 (C=12, O=16*2, H=2 \u2192 12+32+2=46? Wait, 12 + (16*2) + 2 = 12 +32+2=46. So maybe the fragment is COOH- losing a proton? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a COO- group (44), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a different functional group. Let me think again. Wait, m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of something like CH3CHO (acetaldehyde is 44). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O (formaldehyde plus something?), but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methoxy group (CH3O, which is 31). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a ketone. Let me think of possible structures that could give that fragment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a part of the molecule. Let me think about possible molecular formulas. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me note the degrees of unsaturation for each to see.\n\nThe formula C6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation = (2*C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no N or X here, so (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be one double bond or one ring.\n\nC6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 \u2192 (14-10)/2 = 2. So 2 degrees. That could be two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, etc.\n\nC6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10 -2*1)/2? Wait, O is subtracted? Wait the formula is C6H10O2. So the formula is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10 - (2*2))/2? Wait, the formula is O2, so each O is considered in the formula. The formula for degrees is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Oxygen doesn't affect it. Wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So O is not part of this calculation. So for C6H10O2: \n\n(2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. Wait, same as C6H10O. Wait that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait the correct formula is: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are halogens and nitrogens, which aren't present here. So for each compound:\n\nC6H12O: (2*6 +2 -12) /2 = (14-12)/2 = 1 DoU.\n\nC6H10O: (14 -10)/2 = 4/2 = 2 DoU.\n\nC6H10O2: same as C6H10O because oxygen doesn't affect the count. So DoU is still (14-10)/2 = 2. Wait, but O2 is part of the formula but doesn't change the DoU. So the oxygen atoms are part of functional groups but don't add to the DoU calculation. So C6H10O2 would also have 2 DoU. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. The formula for DoU is (2C + 2 - H + N - X)/2. So oxygen is irrelevant. So all three formulas except the first have 2 DoU? Wait, C6H12O2 would be (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 \u2192 (14-12)/2 = 1 DoU. Wait, but in the options, C6H12O2 has 12 H, so that would be 1 DoU, same as C6H12O. Wait, but the options are:\n\nA) C6H12O2 \u2192 DoU = (14 -12) = 2? Wait, no:\n\nWait let me recalculate properly.\n\nWait the formula is:\n\nDoU = (2C + 2 - H - (number of halogens) + (number of nitrogens)) divided by 2.\n\nSo for each:\n\nA) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12. O is ignored. So DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.\n\nB) C6H10O: (14-10)/2= 2.\n\nC) C6H10O2: same as B, because H is 10. So (14-10)/2=2.\n\nD) C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1.\n\nSo options A and D have 1 DoU each, while B and C have 2 each.\n\nNow, looking back at the data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond. So that indicates at least one double bond, so at least 1 DoU. The FTIR has peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe another double bond or conjugated system). \n\nIf the compound has a carbonyl (like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid) and a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens), that would account for two degrees of unsaturation (one from the double bond, one from the carbonyl). So that would require 2 DoU. So the options with 2 DoU are B and C. So we can eliminate A and D.\n\nSo the formula must be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2). Now, which one?\n\nThe FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. Wait, earlier thought was that O-H is around 3200-3600. The given 3000 is a bit low. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps it's a broad peak from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Let's consider that. \n\nIf there's an O-H group, that would require an oxygen in the formula. So for option C (C6H10O2), the two oxygens could be, say, a carboxylic acid (COOH) and another oxygen, but maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol? Wait, but let's see.\n\nThe mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45. Let's think of possible fragments. Let me think of possible structures. Let's consider the options.\n\nOption B is C6H10O. That would have two degrees of unsaturation. So possibilities include, for example, a ketone and a double bond. Let's say a structure like CH2=CH-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a carbonyl (the ketone) and the double bond. The oxygen is one. The O-H? Wait, but the formula is C6H10O, which doesn't have an O-H unless the oxygen is part of a hydroxyl. Wait, if there's an O-H, then the formula would have to have an extra H. Let me check the formula again. \n\nWait, C6H10O has 10 H. Let's see, if it were an alcohol, like R-OH, then the formula would be C6H11O, but here it's C6H10O. So maybe the oxygen is part of an ether (no O-H) or a ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic structure. \n\nAlternatively, option C (C6H10O2) could have two oxygens, like a carboxylic acid (COOH) which has two oxygens. For example, if the compound is something like CH2=CH-COO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a double bond (from the vinyl group), a carboxylic acid (so O-H, which would account for the broad peak at high wavenumbers). The carbonyl at 1700 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. The 1650 peak could be the C=C stretch. The O-H would give a broad peak in IR. \n\nSo in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since the carboxylic acid has two oxygens). The vinyl hydrogens are present from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 could come from the carboxylic acid group. Wait, the molecular weight would be (assuming that structure):\n\nC6H10O2: molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12=72 + 10*1=10 + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+10=82 +32=114. So molecular ion at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 could be from losing a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group (COOH is 46) so maybe a fragment that's COO- (mass 45, since COOH minus a proton would be 46-1=45? Wait, COOH is 46 (C=12, O2=32, H2O? Wait, COOH is H-COOH? No, the molecular formula for COOH (carboxylic acid group) is C2H4O2? Wait no, wait a carboxylic acid like CH3COOH has formula C2H4O2. Wait, the group itself is -COOH, which has one C, two O, and two H (the H from the -OH and the other H attached to the carbonyl? Wait the actual formula for the group is COOH: the carbonyl (C=O) plus an -OH, so the group has C:1, O:2, H:2 (the H from the -OH and the one on the carbonyl's oxygen? Wait maybe better to think of the entire molecule. \n\nAlternatively, the fragment m/z 45 could be from a formate (HCOO-), which has a molecular weight of 45 (12 + 16*2 +1 = 12+32+1=45). So if the molecule has a formate group (like HCOO-R), then a fragment losing R would leave the formate group as 45. But in the structure I mentioned earlier (like CH2=CH-COO-...), the formate isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from another part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Suppose the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a carbonyl (ester) at 1700, a double bond at 1650. The O in the ester is two oxygens (the ester has two O's). The formula would be C6H10O2. The vinyl hydrogens are there. The IR would have the carbonyl peaks and the double bond. The ester doesn't have an O-H, so the broad peak at 3000 would be confusing. Wait, the problem states a very broad absorption at 3000. If it's an ester, there's no O-H, so maybe that peak is something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, which would have the O-H. So the broad peak would be from the O-H. \n\nSo if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like CH2=CH-COO-CH2-CH2-CH3, then the formula would be C6H10O2. The O-H would give the broad peak around 3300 (but the question says 3000, which is a bit low, but maybe an error in the question's numbers?), the carbonyl at 1700, and the double bond at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be present. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the formate (HCOO-) fragment, which is 45. That would fit. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound were an ester (no O-H), then the broad peak at 3000 might not be explained. So the presence of the O-H suggests an acid or alcohol. Since the formula C6H10O2 would allow for a carboxylic acid (with two O's), that seems better. \n\nNow looking at the options, the correct formula would be C (C6H10O2). But wait, let me check the other possibility. \n\nOption B is C6H10O. Suppose the compound is a ketone with a double bond and an ether. For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have an oxygen in the ether (so total O is 1: the ketone's O and the ether's O? No, a ketone has one O, and an ether has one O. Wait, the formula would then have two O's, so that would be C6H10O2 again. Hmm. So maybe I need to think again. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a ketone. Let's say CH2=CH-CHOH-CH2-COOH? Wait, but that would have more oxygens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Let's see. Suppose the compound is CH2=CH-CHO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would be an aldehyde (CHO group) and a double bond. The formula would be C6H10O (since CHO has one O). The molecular formula would be C6H10O. The carbonyl at 1700 (the aldehyde's C=O) and the double bond at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be present. The broad peak at 3000\u2014if that's from the aldehyde's O-H? Wait, aldehydes have an O-H? No, aldehydes have an -CHO group, which doesn't have an O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 would not be explained here. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the O-H is from an alcohol group. Let's say the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a ketone. For example, CH2=CH-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. The formula would be C6H10O (since the ketone has one O and the alcohol has another O? Wait, O is two then. Wait, that would be two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2. So that's again option C. \n\nHmm, so the presence of an O-H (broad peak) suggests there's an O-H group, which requires at least one O. So the formula must have at least one O for the O-H, plus another O for a carbonyl (as in a carboxylic acid or ester). \n\nSo the formula would need at least two O's. So that points to options A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2). Wait, but earlier analysis of DoU indicated that the DoU must be 2 (since there's a double bond and a carbonyl), so the formula must have 2 DoU. Therefore, options with 2 DoU are B and C. Since the O-H requires at least two O's (carbonyl and O-H?), wait, no. For example, a carboxylic acid has two O's (one in the carbonyl, one in the -OH). So that would need two O's. So the formula would have two O's, so that's option C (C6H10O2) or A (C6H12O2). \n\nWait, but the DoU for A is 1. But the required DoU is 2. So that leaves C as the only possible option. \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\n- The presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond \u2192 1 DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU) gives 2 DoU. So the formula must have 2 DoU \u2192 B or C. \n\n- The broad peak at ~3000 is likely an O-H (carboxylic acid or alcohol). \n\n- If it's a carboxylic acid (O-H present), that requires two O's. So formula is C6H10O2 (option C). \n\n- The mass spec fragment at 45: if the compound is a carboxylic acid like CH2=CH-COO-... then a fragment losing the rest would leave the COOH as 46, but maybe a fragment losing a methyl group or something else to give 45? Wait, the formate (HCOO-) is 45. If the molecule is something like CH2=CH-COO-R, then losing R as a neutral fragment would leave HCOO- as the fragment ion at 45. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the fragment at m/z 45 would be the formate group. \n\nTherefore, the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2. \n\nWait but let me check option C's DoU again. C6H10O2 has 2 DoU (as calculated earlier). So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is option C.\n",

The 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak could be a C=C stretch (alkene) or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the C-OH bend is around 1400, but maybe in esters, the carbonyl is similar. Wait, if there's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the 1650 might be the C-H bending? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, if there's a conjugated enone (like a ketone with a double bond adjacent), the peaks might shift. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen. So probably not. Let me think again. The presence of a carbonyl at 1700 and a peak at 1650. If the compound has a conjugated system, like a conjugated diene or an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone), then the 1650 could be the C=C stretch. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CO-R, the carbonyl is at 1700 and the double bond at 1650. That makes sense. So maybe there's a conjugated system here.\n\nNow the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on the double bond. So that suggests there's an alkene group present. So that's consistent with the C=C stretch at 1650. \n\nThe mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, m/z 45. What common fragments give that? Let's think. The molecular ion peak would be the molecular weight, but the fragment here is 45. Common fragments: maybe a ketene (COCH3?) but no. Alternatively, maybe a formyl group (CHO) which is 29? No. Wait, maybe a fragment like CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether) is 46, but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a COOH group? Wait, the molecular ion's mass would be needed. Alternatively, if the fragment is CH3CO (acetyl, 43?), or maybe a different group. Let me think. The fragment m/z 45: possible fragments could be a formate (HCOO-) but that's 45. Wait, formic acid is HCOOH (46), so HCOO- would be 45? Or maybe a methyl group with some oxygen? Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone group? Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O (formaldehyde, 30), no. Hmm, perhaps the fragment is from a carboxylic acid. Wait, if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, then the COOH would have a molecular weight of 45 (C=12, O=16*2, H=2 \u2192 12+32+2=46? Wait, 12 + (16*2) + 2 = 12 +32+2=46. So maybe the fragment is COOH- losing a proton? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a COO- group (44), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a different functional group. Let me think again. Wait, m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of something like CH3CHO (acetaldehyde is 44). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2O (formaldehyde plus something?), but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methoxy group (CH3O, which is 31). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a ketone. Let me think of possible structures that could give that fragment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a part of the molecule. Let me think about possible molecular formulas. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me note the degrees of unsaturation for each to see.\n\nThe formula C6H12O: Degrees of unsaturation = (2*C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no N or X here, so (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be one double bond or one ring.\n\nC6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 \u2192 (14-10)/2 = 2. So 2 degrees. That could be two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, etc.\n\nC6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10 -2*1)/2? Wait, O is subtracted? Wait the formula is C6H10O2. So the formula is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10 - (2*2))/2? Wait, the formula is O2, so each O is considered in the formula. The formula for degrees is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Oxygen doesn't affect it. Wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So O is not part of this calculation. So for C6H10O2: \n\n(2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. Wait, same as C6H10O. Wait that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait the correct formula is: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are halogens and nitrogens, which aren't present here. So for each compound:\n\nC6H12O: (2*6 +2 -12) /2 = (14-12)/2 = 1 DoU.\n\nC6H10O: (14 -10)/2 = 4/2 = 2 DoU.\n\nC6H10O2: same as C6H10O because oxygen doesn't affect the count. So DoU is still (14-10)/2 = 2. Wait, but O2 is part of the formula but doesn't change the DoU. So the oxygen atoms are part of functional groups but don't add to the DoU calculation. So C6H10O2 would also have 2 DoU. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. The formula for DoU is (2C + 2 - H + N - X)/2. So oxygen is irrelevant. So all three formulas except the first have 2 DoU? Wait, C6H12O2 would be (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 \u2192 (14-12)/2 = 1 DoU. Wait, but in the options, C6H12O2 has 12 H, so that would be 1 DoU, same as C6H12O. Wait, but the options are:\n\nA) C6H12O2 \u2192 DoU = (14 -12) = 2? Wait, no:\n\nWait let me recalculate properly.\n\nWait the formula is:\n\nDoU = (2C + 2 - H - (number of halogens) + (number of nitrogens)) divided by 2.\n\nSo for each:\n\nA) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12. O is ignored. So DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.\n\nB) C6H10O: (14-10)/2= 2.\n\nC) C6H10O2: same as B, because H is 10. So (14-10)/2=2.\n\nD) C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1.\n\nSo options A and D have 1 DoU each, while B and C have 2 each.\n\nNow, looking back at the data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond. So that indicates at least one double bond, so at least 1 DoU. The FTIR has peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe another double bond or conjugated system). \n\nIf the compound has a carbonyl (like a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid) and a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens), that would account for two degrees of unsaturation (one from the double bond, one from the carbonyl). So that would require 2 DoU. So the options with 2 DoU are B and C. So we can eliminate A and D.\n\nSo the formula must be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2). Now, which one?\n\nThe FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. Wait, earlier thought was that O-H is around 3200-3600. The given 3000 is a bit low. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps it's a broad peak from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Let's consider that. \n\nIf there's an O-H group, that would require an oxygen in the formula. So for option C (C6H10O2), the two oxygens could be, say, a carboxylic acid (COOH) and another oxygen, but maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol? Wait, but let's see.\n\nThe mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45. Let's think of possible fragments. Let me think of possible structures. Let's consider the options.\n\nOption B is C6H10O. That would have two degrees of unsaturation. So possibilities include, for example, a ketone and a double bond. Let's say a structure like CH2=CH-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a carbonyl (the ketone) and the double bond. The oxygen is one. The O-H? Wait, but the formula is C6H10O, which doesn't have an O-H unless the oxygen is part of a hydroxyl. Wait, if there's an O-H, then the formula would have to have an extra H. Let me check the formula again. \n\nWait, C6H10O has 10 H. Let's see, if it were an alcohol, like R-OH, then the formula would be C6H11O, but here it's C6H10O. So maybe the oxygen is part of an ether (no O-H) or a ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic structure. \n\nAlternatively, option C (C6H10O2) could have two oxygens, like a carboxylic acid (COOH) which has two oxygens. For example, if the compound is something like CH2=CH-COO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a double bond (from the vinyl group), a carboxylic acid (so O-H, which would account for the broad peak at high wavenumbers). The carbonyl at 1700 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. The 1650 peak could be the C=C stretch. The O-H would give a broad peak in IR. \n\nSo in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since the carboxylic acid has two oxygens). The vinyl hydrogens are present from the double bond. The mass spec fragment at m/z 45 could come from the carboxylic acid group. Wait, the molecular weight would be (assuming that structure):\n\nC6H10O2: molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be 6*12=72 + 10*1=10 + 2*16=32 \u2192 total 72+10=82 +32=114. So molecular ion at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 could be from losing a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group (COOH is 46) so maybe a fragment that's COO- (mass 45, since COOH minus a proton would be 46-1=45? Wait, COOH is 46 (C=12, O2=32, H2O? Wait, COOH is H-COOH? No, the molecular formula for COOH (carboxylic acid group) is C2H4O2? Wait no, wait a carboxylic acid like CH3COOH has formula C2H4O2. Wait, the group itself is -COOH, which has one C, two O, and two H (the H from the -OH and the other H attached to the carbonyl? Wait the actual formula for the group is COOH: the carbonyl (C=O) plus an -OH, so the group has C:1, O:2, H:2 (the H from the -OH and the one on the carbonyl's oxygen? Wait maybe better to think of the entire molecule. \n\nAlternatively, the fragment m/z 45 could be from a formate (HCOO-), which has a molecular weight of 45 (12 + 16*2 +1 = 12+32+1=45). So if the molecule has a formate group (like HCOO-R), then a fragment losing R would leave the formate group as 45. But in the structure I mentioned earlier (like CH2=CH-COO-...), the formate isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from another part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an ester. Suppose the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would have a carbonyl (ester) at 1700, a double bond at 1650. The O in the ester is two oxygens (the ester has two O's). The formula would be C6H10O2. The vinyl hydrogens are there. The IR would have the carbonyl peaks and the double bond. The ester doesn't have an O-H, so the broad peak at 3000 would be confusing. Wait, the problem states a very broad absorption at 3000. If it's an ester, there's no O-H, so maybe that peak is something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, which would have the O-H. So the broad peak would be from the O-H. \n\nSo if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, like CH2=CH-COO-CH2-CH2-CH3, then the formula would be C6H10O2. The O-H would give the broad peak around 3300 (but the question says 3000, which is a bit low, but maybe an error in the question's numbers?), the carbonyl at 1700, and the double bond at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be present. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be the formate (HCOO-) fragment, which is 45. That would fit. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound were an ester (no O-H), then the broad peak at 3000 might not be explained. So the presence of the O-H suggests an acid or alcohol. Since the formula C6H10O2 would allow for a carboxylic acid (with two O's), that seems better. \n\nNow looking at the options, the correct formula would be C (C6H10O2). But wait, let me check the other possibility. \n\nOption B is C6H10O. Suppose the compound is a ketone with a double bond and an ether. For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have an oxygen in the ether (so total O is 1: the ketone's O and the ether's O? No, a ketone has one O, and an ether has one O. Wait, the formula would then have two O's, so that would be C6H10O2 again. Hmm. So maybe I need to think again. \n\nAlternatively, if the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a ketone. Let's say CH2=CH-CHOH-CH2-COOH? Wait, but that would have more oxygens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Let's see. Suppose the compound is CH2=CH-CHO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would be an aldehyde (CHO group) and a double bond. The formula would be C6H10O (since CHO has one O). The molecular formula would be C6H10O. The carbonyl at 1700 (the aldehyde's C=O) and the double bond at 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would be present. The broad peak at 3000\u2014if that's from the aldehyde's O-H? Wait, aldehydes have an O-H? No, aldehydes have an -CHO group, which doesn't have an O-H. So the broad peak at 3000 would not be explained here. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the O-H is from an alcohol group. Let's say the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a ketone. For example, CH2=CH-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. The formula would be C6H10O (since the ketone has one O and the alcohol has another O? Wait, O is two then. Wait, that would be two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2. So that's again option C. \n\nHmm, so the presence of an O-H (broad peak) suggests there's an O-H group, which requires at least one O. So the formula must have at least one O for the O-H, plus another O for a carbonyl (as in a carboxylic acid or ester). \n\nSo the formula would need at least two O's. So that points to options A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2). Wait, but earlier analysis of DoU indicated that the DoU must be 2 (since there's a double bond and a carbonyl), so the formula must have 2 DoU. Therefore, options with 2 DoU are B and C. Since the O-H requires at least two O's (carbonyl and O-H?), wait, no. For example, a carboxylic acid has two O's (one in the carbonyl, one in the -OH). So that would need two O's. So the formula would have two O's, so that's option C (C6H10O2) or A (C6H12O2). \n\nWait, but the DoU for A is 1. But the required DoU is 2. So that leaves C as the only possible option. \n\nSo putting it all together: \n\n- The presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond \u2192 1 DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU) gives 2 DoU. So the formula must have 2 DoU \u2192 B or C. \n\n- The broad peak at ~3000 is likely an O-H (carboxylic acid or alcohol). \n\n- If it's a carboxylic acid (O-H present), that requires two O's. So formula is C6H10O2 (option C). \n\n- The mass spec fragment at 45: if the compound is a carboxylic acid like CH2=CH-COO-... then a fragment losing the rest would leave the COOH as 46, but maybe a fragment losing a methyl group or something else to give 45? Wait, the formate (HCOO-) is 45. If the molecule is something like CH2=CH-COO-R, then losing R as a neutral fragment would leave HCOO- as the fragment ion at 45. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the fragment at m/z 45 would be the formate group. \n\nTherefore, the correct formula is option C: C6H10O2. \n\nWait but let me check option C's DoU again. C6H10O2 has 2 DoU (as calculated earlier). So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is option C.\n\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows a broad peak at ~3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, suggesting an O-H group (e.g., from a carboxylic acid). The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 indicate a carbonyl group (e.g., from a carboxylic acid or ester) and a conjugated double bond (vinyl hydrogens observed in \u00b9H NMR). The molecular formula must account for two degrees of unsaturation (one from the double bond and one from the carbonyl group), which eliminates options A and D (1 DoU each). The presence of an O-H requires at least two oxygen atoms, ruling out option B (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O). Option C (C\u2086H\u2081\u2080O\u2082) has two oxygens, allowing for a carboxylic acid group (explaining the O-H peak) and the observed functional groups. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z 45 aligns with a formate (HCOO\u207b) fragment from a carboxylic acid structure. \n\nAnswer: C",
