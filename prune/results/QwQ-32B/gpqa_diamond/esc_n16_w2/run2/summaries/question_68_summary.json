      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment when the magnetic field direction is suddenly changed. \n\nAlright, let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc which is given by \u03b3 times Sz. Oh right, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio here. The initial magnetic field is in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it, so that means the spin is in the +Z eigenstate, right? So initially, the state is |+z\u27e9.\n\nNow, the problem says that suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment starting to oscillate, and what the frequency of that oscillation is. \n\nHmm, okay. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian will change. The time evolution of the state will depend on the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the time evolution here. \n\nFirst, when the field is along Z, the system is in the +Z state. But when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, that's H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y. Wait, the direction of B is Y, so the Hamiltonian should be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is \u03b3 Sz (from the question's given \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz), so substituting that in, H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y. Wait, but the direction here is important. Let me clarify the components.\n\nWait, actually, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin operator. Wait, the question says \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, but that might be specific to the initial alignment. Wait, perhaps the problem states that \u03bc is equal to \u03b3 times Sz, but actually, the full magnetic moment should depend on the direction. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem defines \u03bc as being along the z-axis initially, but when the field is rotated, the magnetic moment can precess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's wording is that the magnetic moment is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Wait, the standard formula for the magnetic moment of a spin-1/2 particle is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So perhaps in this problem, they might be simplifying it as \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz when the field is along z, but actually, the magnetic moment is a vector, so when the field is in another direction, the component in that direction would matter. But maybe the problem is considering that the magnetic moment is aligned along the spin direction. So when the field is along Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis, leading to oscillations in the z-component. \n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of the time evolution. The key here is that when the magnetic field is changed suddenly, the system remains in the state it was in (since the change is instantaneous), but the Hamiltonian changes, so the state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9. After the magnetic field is turned to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y component? Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment \u03bc is a vector, so \u03bc \u00b7 B would involve the components of \u03bc and B. Let me clarify the notation here.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin angular momentum. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, \u03bc_x = \u03b3 Sx, etc. Therefore, when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is in the Y direction (let's say along +y), then H = -\u03b3 S_y B, because the dot product S\u00b7B would be S_y times B (since B is along y). So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nNow, the initial state is |+z\u27e9. But under the new Hamiltonian, the system will start evolving. To find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time, which is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. So we need to find \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nTo compute this, we can express the initial state |+z\u27e9 in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. So we need to write |+z\u27e9 in terms of these.\n\nThe standard way to write |+z\u27e9 in terms of S_y eigenstates is using the rotation between the bases. Let me recall the relations between the eigenstates of Sx, Sy, Sz. The eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the Sz eigenstates. The eigenstates of S_y are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The eigenstates of S_y are found by solving S_y |y\u00b1\u27e9 = \u00b1(\u0127/2) |y\u00b1\u27e9. The matrix for S_y in the Sz basis (using units where \u0127=1 for simplicity) is:\n\nS_y = (\u0127/2) [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2, and the eigenvectors are:\n\nFor +\u0127/2: solving (S_y - (\u0127/2)I)v = 0,\n\nThe equations would be:\n\n(-i v2, i v1 - (\u0127/2) v2) = 0 ?\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to write the normalized eigenvectors. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is that |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c0/2} |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, since the rotation from z to y involves a phase. So indeed, the coefficients would have an i factor. So yes:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nTherefore, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 + (|+y\u27e9 + i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, no, solving for |+z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 as the basis.\n\nExpress |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet\u2019s write |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nPlugging in the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\na*( (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) + b*( (|+z\u27e9 -i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = |+z\u27e9.\n\nGathering terms:\n\n[ a/\u221a2 + b/\u221a2 ] |+z\u27e9 + [ i a/\u221a2 - i b/\u221a2 ] |-z\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9.\n\nSince |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 are orthogonal, their coefficients must match. So:\n\nCoefficient of |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nCoefficient of |-z\u27e9: (i a - i b)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation: (i(a - b))/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nPlugging into first equation: (2a)/\u221a2 = 1 \u2192 a = \u221a2 / 2 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, a = b = 1/\u221a2. Thus,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but substituting back into the first equation, that gives (a + b)/\u221a2 = (2*(1/\u221a2))/\u221a2 = (2/\u221a2)/\u221a2 = (2)/(2) =1, which works. And the second term: (i*(a - b))/\u221a2 =0 since a =b. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, |+z\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 with equal coefficients.\n\nSo the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my calculation above, the coefficients are both 1/\u221a2, but the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 have a +i and -i term. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me re-express this more carefully. Let me denote the eigenstates:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nSo, to write |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, let me set:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\n\n= a [ (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [a/\u221a2 + b/\u221a2 ] |+z\u27e9 + [ (a i)/\u221a2 - (b i)/\u221a2 ] |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, set coefficients equal to |+z\u27e9 which is 1 for |+z\u27e9 and 0 for |-z\u27e9.\n\nThus,\n\nCoefficient of |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nCoefficient of |-z\u27e9: [ i(a - b) ] /\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThe second equation implies that a = b. Plugging into the first equation gives (2a)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 = 1/\u221a2. So both a and b are 1/\u221a2.\n\nThus, |+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but substituting into the equation, that gives ( (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ) * (1/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait no, sorry, the coefficients are 1/\u221a2 each. Wait the equation says:\n\na and b are each 1/\u221a2, so:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state in the S_y basis is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian with equal coefficients.\n\nNow, since the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y, which is diagonal in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis. The energy eigenvalues are H = - \u03b3 B S_y, so the eigenvalues will be for |+y\u27e9: - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2), and for |-y\u27e9: + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Wait, because S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9. Similarly for the other.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y\u27e9 + b e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y\u27e9,\n\nwhere E_+ is the energy for |+y\u27e9, and E_- for |-y\u27e9. \n\nPlugging in the energies:\n\nE_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2),\n\nE_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) e^{-i [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i [ \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe exponent for the first term is -i * [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * t / \u0127 ] = +i (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nThe exponent for the second term is -i * [ \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * t / \u0127 ] = -i ( \u03b3 B t / 2 ).\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |-y\u27e9.\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t. Since the question asks for \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9, which is \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. So let's compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nFirst, express Sz in terms of the S_y basis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 by expanding the state in the Sz basis.\n\nAlternatively, note that Sz in the S_y basis can be written as a matrix. Let me think of the Sz operator in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nThe Sz operator in the standard Sz basis is diagonal:\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9.\n\nBut we need to express Sz in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let's compute Sz |+y\u27e9 and Sz |-y\u27e9.\n\nFirst, |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. So applying Sz:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * (\u0127/2) for the |+z\u27e9 part, but wait, Sz acts on each term:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, express |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 - i Sz |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nWait, no, Sz |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2 |-z\u27e9, so:\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i ( -\u0127/2 ) |-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nWait, let's do that again:\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\n= [ Sz |+z\u27e9 - i Sz |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nHmm, so the Sz operator in the |+y\u27e9, |-y\u27e9 basis can be represented by a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to write the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let's write |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, as above.\n\nCompute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| = (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8-y|.\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\n= [ (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8-y| ] \n\n * Sz [ (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me compute this term by term.\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| Sz e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| Sz e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| Sz e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| Sz e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 multiplied by the exponents. Since Sz |+y\u27e9 is (from above):\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)(-i) |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ? Wait no, let me recall earlier calculation. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast:\n\nWait, when I calculated Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSimilarly, but perhaps it's better to note that Sz and Sy do not commute, so Sz |+y\u27e9 is not an eigenstate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis, Sz has matrix elements that can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe matrix elements of Sz in the S_y basis can be found using the relations between the Pauli matrices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that in the S_z basis, Sz is diagonal, and S_y is off-diagonal. But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that Sz and Sy are components of the spin operator, so their commutation relations are known. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, and after switching to the Y field, the system evolves under H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The expectation value of Sz(t) can be found using the time evolution. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about oscillation frequency, perhaps I can recall that in such cases, the frequency is related to the Larmor frequency, which is \u03b3 B. However, since the spin is in a superposition when the field is turned to Y, the oscillation might involve the difference in energy levels divided by h-bar. \n\nWait, let's think about the energy eigenvalues. The two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian have energies E_+ and E_-, which are -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and +\u03b3 B (\u0127/2). The difference between them is \u03b3 B \u0127. The frequency associated with the oscillation is the difference in energy divided by h-bar (Planck's constant), but since \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), the frequency would be (\u0394E)/(h) * 2\u03c0. Wait, let me recall that the frequency f is (E2 - E1)/(h), so angular frequency \u03c9 = (E2 - E1)/\u0127. \n\nThe energy difference between |-y\u27e9 and |+y\u27e9 is E_- - E_+ = [\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] - [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] = \u03b3 B \u0127. Therefore, the angular frequency would be (\u0394E)/\u0127 = (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency should be \u03b3 B. But wait, let me see how that connects to the expectation value of Sz.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value of Sz will oscillate at this frequency? Let me check.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is given by the expression above. Let me try to compute it properly.\n\nLet me note that in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis, Sz can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me think of Sz as a Pauli matrix. Let me consider the Pauli matrices:\n\n\u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9,\n\n\u03c3_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nBut the matrix representation of Sz in the S_y basis would be:\n\nIn the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, the Sz operator can be written as:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) [ [\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9, \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9], \n\n           [\u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9, \u27e8-y| Sz |-y\u27e9 ] ]\n\nLet me compute these matrix elements.\n\nFirst, \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nFrom earlier, Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)(-i)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps an easier way is to use the relations between the Pauli matrices. Since \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y satisfy the commutation relations, but maybe it's better to compute them directly.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the |+y\u27e9 basis, the Sz operator can be expressed using the rotation between the coordinate systems. Since |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of Sy, the Sz operator in this basis will have off-diagonal terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the matrix elements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 (from earlier calculation).\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 is (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 is (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9,\n\nThus,\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= (\u0127/2\u221a2) |+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 is the inner product of \u27e8+y| with this vector.\n\n\u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * [ (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nSecond term: \u27e8+z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)) |-z\u27e9 = 0, since |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) = i *0 =0.\n\nFourth term: i \u27e8-z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2) |-z\u27e9 ) = i*(-i) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= ( -i^2 ) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) *1 \n\n= (1)(\u0127/(2\u221a2)).\n\nThus, adding all terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/(2\u221a2),\n\nFourth term: \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nTotal: \u0127/(2\u221a2) + \u0127/(2\u221a2) = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nWait, but this is \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9. So that's (\u0127/\u221a2) ?\n\nHmm, but let me check units. The Sz operator has units of \u0127, so this term is (\u0127/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, but let me see again. Wait the calculation:\n\nThe first term:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * [ (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ]\n\nBreaking down:\n\nThe first term in the product is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by each term in Sz |+y\u27e9.\n\nFirst term of Sz |+y\u27e9 is (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |+z\u27e9:\n\nMultiply with \u27e8+z| gives (\u0127/(2\u221a2))*(1/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, no, sorry. Let me do it step by step again:\n\nThe Sz |+y\u27e9 is:\n\n[ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, no, original Sz |+y\u27e9 was:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, Sz |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2 |-z\u27e9, so that term is i*(-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9. So:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nSo that's (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |+z\u27e9 - i (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by that vector.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [\u27e8+z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) + \u27e8+z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ) ]\n\n+ [i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) + i \u27e8-z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ) ] \n\nAll divided by \u221a2? Wait, no. Wait the initial expression is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by the Sz |+y\u27e9 vector.\n\nSo:\n\nThe first term (from \u27e8+z| part):\n\n\u27e8+z| * (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9) = (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) * \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\n\u27e8+z| * (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9) = 0, since they're orthogonal.\n\nThe second part comes from the i \u27e8-z| term:\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9) = i*(-i) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= (i*(-i)) = 1, so (1)(\u0127/(2\u221a2)) *1 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nAdding both terms:\n\nTotal is (\u0127/(2\u221a2) + \u0127/(2\u221a2)) = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nSo \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nWait but this seems to have units of \u0127, but in the basis where Sz is measured in units of \u0127/2, maybe?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to keep track of the \u0127 factors. Let me see:\n\nActually, the spin operators are usually written as S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. So Sz = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So perhaps I should have considered that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in units. Let me think again. Let me try to recast everything in terms of \u0127/2.\n\nLet me redefine Sz as (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. Then, the eigenvalues of Sz are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when I computed Sz |+y\u27e9, I should have (\u0127/2) times the corresponding terms.\n\nWait, let me re-express all terms with that in mind. Let's say Sz = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So the calculation above would have Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [\u03c3_z acting on |+y\u27e9].\n\nBut maybe this is complicating. Let me instead consider that all the terms have a factor of \u0127/2. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too bogged down. Let me think of the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nThe state is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each evolving with their respective phases.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) can be written as:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of the basis:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y\u27e9 ], where \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2, since the exponents had \u03b3 B t / 2.\n\nWait, the exponents were:\n\nFor the first term: e^{+i (\u03b3 B t / 2)}, since the energy was -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the exponent is -i (E t / \u0127) = -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * t / \u0127) = i (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSimilarly for the second term: exponent is -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * t / \u0127 ) = -i (\u03b3 B t /2 ), so e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)}.\n\nTherefore, the state is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |-y\u27e9 ].\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, let's express Sz in terms of the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, note that Sz and Sy do not commute, so their eigenstates are different. The expectation value of Sz will depend on the interference terms between |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nLet me write Sz in the S_y basis. Let me suppose that in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, the Sz operator has matrix elements:\n\nLet me denote the basis vectors as |1\u27e9 = |+y\u27e9 and |2\u27e9 = |-y\u27e9.\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u27e8-y| Sz |-y\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute these matrix elements using the relationships between the basis states.\n\nEarlier, I computed \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/\u221a2? Wait, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Let me try again, but using the Pauli matrices.\n\nLet me use the Pauli matrices in the standard basis (Sz basis). Let me consider \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y.\n\n\u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\n\u03c3_y is:\n\n[ 0   -i ]\n\n[ i    0 ]\n\nSo, in the Sz basis, the operator Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z, and Sy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which in the Sz basis are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nSo to find Sz in the Sy basis, let's express Sz in terms of the Sy basis vectors.\n\nThe matrix elements of Sz in the Sy basis are:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2 \u27e8+z| - i/\u221a2 \u27e8-z| ) Sz (1/\u221a2 |+z\u27e9 + i/\u221a2 |-z\u27e9 )\n\nWait, no: the first part is \u27e8+y| = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2,\n\nand |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nSz acts on the ket, so:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = Sz ( (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (Sz |-z\u27e9 ) ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSo then,\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * [ ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n\u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = (\u0127/2) * 1,\n\n\u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = i*(i)(-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 = (i\u00b2)(-\u0127/2) = (-1)(-\u0127/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding those terms:\n\n(\u0127/2 + \u0127/2) divided by ( \u221a2 * \u221a2 ) denominator?\n\nWait, the entire expression is multiplied by 1/(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nWait, the outer terms:\n\nThe first part is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2,\n\nthe second part is ( (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) ) /\u221a2,\n\nso the product is (\u27e8+z| term + i \u27e8-z| term ) * ( terms ) all over (\u221a2 * \u221a2).\n\nThus, the total is ( (\u0127/2) + \u0127/2 ) / 2 = ( \u0127 ) / 2.\n\nWait, so \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = ( (1/2 + 1/2 ) \u0127 ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the terms properly.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nThe first term in the product:\n\n\u27e8+z| Sz |+z\u27e9 part:\n\n\u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = (\u0127/2) \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/2 *1 = \u0127/2.\n\nSecond term in the first part (i \u27e8-z|) times the first term in the Sz |+y\u27e9 (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9):\n\ni \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = i*(\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\nThird term from \u27e8+z| times the second term in Sz |+y\u27e9 (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ):\n\n\u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = i*(-\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: i \u27e8-z| times the second term (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ):\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \n\n= i * i * (-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= (i\u00b2)*(-\u0127/2)*1 \n\n= (-1)*(-\u0127/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding all four terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/2,\n\nFourth term: +\u0127/2,\n\nTotal: \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127,\n\nthen divided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 2,\n\nso total \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127 / 2.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because Sz is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3_z, so in the |+y\u27e9 basis, the expectation value for Sz on |+y\u27e9 would be zero?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, but we computed that \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2?\n\nHmm, that can't be right, because |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, so the expectation value of Sz should be zero?\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 with equal coefficients, then \u27e8Sz\u27e9 would be ( (\u0127/2) + (-\u0127/2) ) / 2 = 0. \n\nAh, right! So there must be an error in my calculation. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, let me do this again. Let me compute \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9. The state |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. So the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 \n\n= (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * Sz * (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\nWait, no: \u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2, right?\n\nWait, the conjugate of |+y\u27e9 is \u27e8+y| = (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 because of the complex conjugate. Wait, hold on. The state |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, so its dual vector \u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2. Because when you take the conjugate transpose, the i becomes -i.\n\nAh, there's the mistake! In my earlier calculation, I incorrectly took \u27e8+y| as (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2, but actually it's (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2.\n\nSo let me recalculate \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 with the correct \u27e8+y|:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nFirst, apply Sz to |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = Sz (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSo then, the inner product:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nBreaking this down term by term:\n\nFirst term: \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 (\u0127/2) *1,\n\nSecond term: \u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 0,\n\nThird term: -i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 -i*(\u0127/2)*0 =0,\n\nFourth term: -i \u27e8-z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 -i * i * (-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= -i\u00b2 * (-\u0127/2) *1 \n\n= -(-1)*(-\u0127/2) = - (\u0127/2)\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/2,\n\nFourth term: - \u0127/2,\n\nTotal: (\u0127/2 - \u0127/2) = 0,\n\nthen divided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 2,\n\nso total \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = 0 / 2 = 0. \n\nAh!

So total is \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127. Then divided by 2 (from denominators \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2), so total is \u0127/2.\n\nAh, okay. So \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2).\n\nSimilarly, the other off-diagonal term \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 would be the complex conjugate.

So total is \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127, divided by 2 \u2192 \u0127/2.\n\nYes, so \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = \u0127/2.\n\nSince Sz is Hermitian, \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 must be the complex conjugate of \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9, but since this is real, it's the same, so \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 as well.\n\nTherefore, the matrix representation of Sz in the Sy basis is:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] ?\n\nWait no. Wait the matrix elements are:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 = 0,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u0127/2,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u0127/2,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 = 0,\n\nso in matrix form:\n\n[ 0    \u0127/2 ]\n\n[ \u0127/2  0 ]\n\nSo Sz in the Sy basis is a matrix with off-diagonal terms \u0127/2.\n\nSo now, let's return to the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t):\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y\u27e9 ], where \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2.\n\nLet me write the state in vector form in the Sy basis:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ] \n\nwhere |1\u27e9 is |+y\u27e9, |2\u27e9 is |-y\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in matrix terms:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| + e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| ] * Sz * (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiplying the terms:\n\n= (1/2) [ e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| Sz e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| Sz e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 \n\n+ e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| Sz e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| Sz e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} = \u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 *1 = 0.\n\nSecond term:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} = (\u0127/2) e^{-2i \u03c9 t}.\n\nThird term:\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} = (\u0127/2) e^{+2i \u03c9 t}.\n\nFourth term:\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 0 *1 =0.\n\nTherefore, adding all terms:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)[ 0 + (\u0127/2)e^{-2i \u03c9 t} + (\u0127/2)e^{+2i \u03c9 t} +0 ]\n\n= (\u0127/4)[ e^{+2i \u03c9 t} + e^{-2i \u03c9 t} ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t).\n\nBecause e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t).\n\nBut \u03c9 was defined as (\u03b3 B)/2, so substituting:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) = (\u0127/2) cos( 2*(\u03b3 B /2) t ) = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz oscillates with angular frequency \u03c9_osc = \u03b3 B.\n\nSince the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency (in terms of radians per second), so the answer would be \u03b3 B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nThe key steps were:\n\n1.

Under the new Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the energies of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and +\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), respectively.\n\n3. The time evolution of the state gives each eigenstate a phase factor of e^{i E t / \u0127 }, but since H is -\u03b3 B Sy, the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) for |+y\u27e9 and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) for |-y\u27e9. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. So the energy eigenvalues are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: H |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B Sy |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9 \u2192 E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9, Sy |-y\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9, so H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9 = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 |-y\u27e9 \u2192 E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution for |+y\u27e9 is e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} = e^{-i (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)}.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9: e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } = e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 t)/ \u0127 } = e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)}.\n\nThus, the state is indeed (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |-y\u27e9 ].\n\nThen, when calculating \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t), we found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the angular frequency is \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, which is option B.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment when the magnetic field direction is suddenly changed. \n\nAlright, let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The particle has a magnetic moment \u03bc which is given by \u03b3 times Sz. Oh right, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio here. The initial magnetic field is in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it, so that means the spin is in the +Z eigenstate, right? So initially, the state is |+z\u27e9.\n\nNow, the problem says that suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment starting to oscillate, and what the frequency of that oscillation is. \n\nHmm, okay. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian will change. The time evolution of the state will depend on the new Hamiltonian. Let me think about the time evolution here. \n\nFirst, when the field is along Z, the system is in the +Z state. But when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since the magnetic field is now in the Y direction, that's H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y. Wait, the direction of B is Y, so the Hamiltonian should be H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is \u03b3 Sz (from the question's given \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz), so substituting that in, H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y. Wait, but the direction here is important. Let me clarify the components.\n\nWait, actually, the magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where S is the spin operator. Wait, the question says \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz, but that might be specific to the initial alignment. Wait, perhaps the problem states that \u03bc is equal to \u03b3 times Sz, but actually, the full magnetic moment should depend on the direction. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem defines \u03bc as being along the z-axis initially, but when the field is rotated, the magnetic moment can precess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's wording is that the magnetic moment is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Wait, the standard formula for the magnetic moment of a spin-1/2 particle is \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So perhaps in this problem, they might be simplifying it as \u03bc = \u03b3 Sz when the field is along z, but actually, the magnetic moment is a vector, so when the field is in another direction, the component in that direction would matter. But maybe the problem is considering that the magnetic moment is aligned along the spin direction. So when the field is along Y, the spin will precess around the Y-axis, leading to oscillations in the z-component. \n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of the time evolution. The key here is that when the magnetic field is changed suddenly, the system remains in the state it was in (since the change is instantaneous), but the Hamiltonian changes, so the state will evolve under the new Hamiltonian. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9. After the magnetic field is turned to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since B is along Y, this becomes H = -\u03b3 Sz * B_y component? Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment \u03bc is a vector, so \u03bc \u00b7 B would involve the components of \u03bc and B. Let me clarify the notation here.\n\nThe magnetic moment \u03bc is proportional to the spin angular momentum. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. The magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. So \u03bc_z = \u03b3 Sz, \u03bc_x = \u03b3 Sx, etc. Therefore, when the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B = -\u03b3 S \u00b7 B. Since B is in the Y direction (let's say along +y), then H = -\u03b3 S_y B, because the dot product S\u00b7B would be S_y times B (since B is along y). So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nNow, the initial state is |+z\u27e9. But under the new Hamiltonian, the system will start evolving. To find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time, which is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. So we need to find \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian.\n\nTo compute this, we can express the initial state |+z\u27e9 in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. So we need to write |+z\u27e9 in terms of these.\n\nThe standard way to write |+z\u27e9 in terms of S_y eigenstates is using the rotation between the bases. Let me recall the relations between the eigenstates of Sx, Sy, Sz. The eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the Sz eigenstates. The eigenstates of S_y are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The eigenstates of S_y are found by solving S_y |y\u00b1\u27e9 = \u00b1(\u0127/2) |y\u00b1\u27e9. The matrix for S_y in the Sz basis (using units where \u0127=1 for simplicity) is:\n\nS_y = (\u0127/2) [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nSo the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u0127/2, and the eigenvectors are:\n\nFor +\u0127/2: solving (S_y - (\u0127/2)I)v = 0,\n\nThe equations would be:\n\n(-i v2, i v1 - (\u0127/2) v2) = 0 ?\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to write the normalized eigenvectors. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is that |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + e^{i\u03c0/2} |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, since the rotation from z to y involves a phase. So indeed, the coefficients would have an i factor. So yes:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nTherefore, the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 + (|+y\u27e9 + i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2 ?\n\nWait, no, solving for |+z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 as the basis.\n\nExpress |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\nLet\u2019s write |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nPlugging in the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9:\n\na*( (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) + b*( (|+z\u27e9 -i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = |+z\u27e9.\n\nGathering terms:\n\n[ a/\u221a2 + b/\u221a2 ] |+z\u27e9 + [ i a/\u221a2 - i b/\u221a2 ] |-z\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9.\n\nSince |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 are orthogonal, their coefficients must match. So:\n\nCoefficient of |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nCoefficient of |-z\u27e9: (i a - i b)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation: (i(a - b))/\u221a2 = 0 \u2192 a = b.\n\nPlugging into first equation: (2a)/\u221a2 = 1 \u2192 a = \u221a2 / 2 = 1/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, a = b = 1/\u221a2. Thus,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but substituting back into the first equation, that gives (a + b)/\u221a2 = (2*(1/\u221a2))/\u221a2 = (2/\u221a2)/\u221a2 = (2)/(2) =1, which works. And the second term: (i*(a - b))/\u221a2 =0 since a =b. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, |+z\u27e9 is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 with equal coefficients.\n\nSo the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my calculation above, the coefficients are both 1/\u221a2, but the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 have a +i and -i term. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me re-express this more carefully. Let me denote the eigenstates:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nSo, to write |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, let me set:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9.\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\n\n= a [ (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [a/\u221a2 + b/\u221a2 ] |+z\u27e9 + [ (a i)/\u221a2 - (b i)/\u221a2 ] |-z\u27e9.\n\nNow, set coefficients equal to |+z\u27e9 which is 1 for |+z\u27e9 and 0 for |-z\u27e9.\n\nThus,\n\nCoefficient of |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nCoefficient of |-z\u27e9: [ i(a - b) ] /\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThe second equation implies that a = b. Plugging into the first equation gives (2a)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2 = 1/\u221a2. So both a and b are 1/\u221a2.\n\nThus, |+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9.\n\nWait, but substituting into the equation, that gives ( (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ) * (1/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait no, sorry, the coefficients are 1/\u221a2 each. Wait the equation says:\n\na and b are each 1/\u221a2, so:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)|+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2)|-y\u27e9. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state in the S_y basis is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian with equal coefficients.\n\nNow, since the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y, which is diagonal in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis. The energy eigenvalues are H = - \u03b3 B S_y, so the eigenvalues will be for |+y\u27e9: - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2), and for |-y\u27e9: + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Wait, because S_y |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9, so H |+y\u27e9 = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9. Similarly for the other.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} |+y\u27e9 + b e^{-i E_- t / \u0127} |-y\u27e9,\n\nwhere E_+ is the energy for |+y\u27e9, and E_- for |-y\u27e9. \n\nPlugging in the energies:\n\nE_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2),\n\nE_- = + \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) e^{-i [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i [ \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe exponent for the first term is -i * [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * t / \u0127 ] = +i (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nThe exponent for the second term is -i * [ \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * t / \u0127 ] = -i ( \u03b3 B t / 2 ).\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t / 2)} |-y\u27e9.\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of Sz at time t. Since the question asks for \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9, which is \u03b3 \u27e8Sz\u27e9. So let's compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nFirst, express Sz in terms of the S_y basis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9 by expanding the state in the Sz basis.\n\nAlternatively, note that Sz in the S_y basis can be written as a matrix. Let me think of the Sz operator in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nThe Sz operator in the standard Sz basis is diagonal:\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9.\n\nBut we need to express Sz in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let's compute Sz |+y\u27e9 and Sz |-y\u27e9.\n\nFirst, |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. So applying Sz:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 * (\u0127/2) for the |+z\u27e9 part, but wait, Sz acts on each term:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, express |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 - i Sz |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nWait, no, Sz |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2 |-z\u27e9, so:\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i ( -\u0127/2 ) |-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 \n\nWait, let's do that again:\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\n= [ Sz |+z\u27e9 - i Sz |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nHmm, so the Sz operator in the |+y\u27e9, |-y\u27e9 basis can be represented by a matrix. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express Sz in terms of the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to write the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 as \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let's write |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, as above.\n\nCompute \u27e8\u03c8(t)| = (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8-y|.\n\nSo the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\n= [ (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8+y| + (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} \u27e8-y| ] \n\n * Sz [ (1/\u221a2) e^{+i (\u03b3 B t /2)} |+y\u27e9 + (1/\u221a2) e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me compute this term by term.\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\n= (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| Sz e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8+y| Sz e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| Sz e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} |+y\u27e9 \n\n+ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) e^{+i \u03b3 B t/2} \u27e8-y| Sz e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-y\u27e9 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 multiplied by the exponents. Since Sz |+y\u27e9 is (from above):\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)(-i) |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ? Wait no, let me recall earlier calculation. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast:\n\nWait, when I calculated Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSimilarly, but perhaps it's better to note that Sz and Sy do not commute, so Sz |+y\u27e9 is not an eigenstate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis, Sz has matrix elements that can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe matrix elements of Sz in the S_y basis can be found using the relations between the Pauli matrices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that in the S_z basis, Sz is diagonal, and S_y is off-diagonal. But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that Sz and Sy are components of the spin operator, so their commutation relations are known. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the initial state is |+z\u27e9, and after switching to the Y field, the system evolves under H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The expectation value of Sz(t) can be found using the time evolution. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about oscillation frequency, perhaps I can recall that in such cases, the frequency is related to the Larmor frequency, which is \u03b3 B. However, since the spin is in a superposition when the field is turned to Y, the oscillation might involve the difference in energy levels divided by h-bar. \n\nWait, let's think about the energy eigenvalues. The two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian have energies E_+ and E_-, which are -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and +\u03b3 B (\u0127/2). The difference between them is \u03b3 B \u0127. The frequency associated with the oscillation is the difference in energy divided by h-bar (Planck's constant), but since \u0127 is h/(2\u03c0), the frequency would be (\u0394E)/(h) * 2\u03c0. Wait, let me recall that the frequency f is (E2 - E1)/(h), so angular frequency \u03c9 = (E2 - E1)/\u0127. \n\nThe energy difference between |-y\u27e9 and |+y\u27e9 is E_- - E_+ = [\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] - [ - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) ] = \u03b3 B \u0127. Therefore, the angular frequency would be (\u0394E)/\u0127 = (\u03b3 B \u0127)/\u0127 = \u03b3 B. \n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency should be \u03b3 B. But wait, let me see how that connects to the expectation value of Sz.\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value of Sz will oscillate at this frequency? Let me check.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is given by the expression above. Let me try to compute it properly.\n\nLet me note that in the |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 basis, Sz can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me think of Sz as a Pauli matrix. Let me consider the Pauli matrices:\n\n\u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9,\n\n\u03c3_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nBut the matrix representation of Sz in the S_y basis would be:\n\nIn the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, the Sz operator can be written as:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) [ [\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9, \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9], \n\n           [\u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9, \u27e8-y| Sz |-y\u27e9 ] ]\n\nLet me compute these matrix elements.\n\nFirst, \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nFrom earlier, Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)(-i)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps an easier way is to use the relations between the Pauli matrices. Since \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y satisfy the commutation relations, but maybe it's better to compute them directly.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the |+y\u27e9 basis, the Sz operator can be expressed using the rotation between the coordinate systems. Since |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are eigenstates of Sy, the Sz operator in this basis will have off-diagonal terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the matrix elements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) / \u221a2 (from earlier calculation).\n\nSz |+z\u27e9 is (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9,\n\nSz |-z\u27e9 is (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9,\n\nThus,\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\n= (\u0127/2\u221a2) |+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 is the inner product of \u27e8+y| with this vector.\n\n\u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * [ (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst term: \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nSecond term: \u27e8+z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)) |-z\u27e9 = 0, since |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 are orthogonal.\n\nThird term: i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) = i *0 =0.\n\nFourth term: i \u27e8-z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2) |-z\u27e9 ) = i*(-i) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= ( -i^2 ) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) *1 \n\n= (1)(\u0127/(2\u221a2)).\n\nThus, adding all terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/(2\u221a2),\n\nFourth term: \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nTotal: \u0127/(2\u221a2) + \u0127/(2\u221a2) = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nWait, but this is \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9. So that's (\u0127/\u221a2) ?\n\nHmm, but let me check units. The Sz operator has units of \u0127, so this term is (\u0127/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, but let me see again. Wait the calculation:\n\nThe first term:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * [ (\u0127/2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 - (i \u0127/2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ]\n\nBreaking down:\n\nThe first term in the product is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by each term in Sz |+y\u27e9.\n\nFirst term of Sz |+y\u27e9 is (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |+z\u27e9:\n\nMultiply with \u27e8+z| gives (\u0127/(2\u221a2))*(1/\u221a2) ?\n\nWait, no, sorry. Let me do it step by step again:\n\nThe Sz |+y\u27e9 is:\n\n[ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, no, original Sz |+y\u27e9 was:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nWait, Sz |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2 |-z\u27e9, so that term is i*(-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9. So:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 - i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2 \n\nSo that's (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |+z\u27e9 - i (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) |-z\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by that vector.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [\u27e8+z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) + \u27e8+z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ) ]\n\n+ [i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9 ) + i \u27e8-z| (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9 ) ] \n\nAll divided by \u221a2? Wait, no. Wait the initial expression is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 multiplied by the Sz |+y\u27e9 vector.\n\nSo:\n\nThe first term (from \u27e8+z| part):\n\n\u27e8+z| * (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9) = (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) * \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\n\u27e8+z| * (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9) = 0, since they're orthogonal.\n\nThe second part comes from the i \u27e8-z| term:\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (\u0127/(2\u221a2)|+z\u27e9) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (-i \u0127/(2\u221a2)|-z\u27e9) = i*(-i) (\u0127/(2\u221a2)) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= (i*(-i)) = 1, so (1)(\u0127/(2\u221a2)) *1 = \u0127/(2\u221a2).\n\nAdding both terms:\n\nTotal is (\u0127/(2\u221a2) + \u0127/(2\u221a2)) = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nSo \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nWait but this seems to have units of \u0127, but in the basis where Sz is measured in units of \u0127/2, maybe?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to keep track of the \u0127 factors. Let me see:\n\nActually, the spin operators are usually written as S = (\u0127/2) \u03c3, where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. So Sz = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So perhaps I should have considered that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in units. Let me think again. Let me try to recast everything in terms of \u0127/2.\n\nLet me redefine Sz as (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. Then, the eigenvalues of Sz are \u00b1 \u0127/2. So when I computed Sz |+y\u27e9, I should have (\u0127/2) times the corresponding terms.\n\nWait, let me re-express all terms with that in mind. Let's say Sz = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So the calculation above would have Sz |+y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) [\u03c3_z acting on |+y\u27e9].\n\nBut maybe this is complicating. Let me instead consider that all the terms have a factor of \u0127/2. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too bogged down. Let me think of the time dependence of \u27e8Sz\u27e9.\n\nThe state is a superposition of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, each evolving with their respective phases.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) can be written as:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in terms of the basis:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y\u27e9 ], where \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2, since the exponents had \u03b3 B t / 2.\n\nWait, the exponents were:\n\nFor the first term: e^{+i (\u03b3 B t / 2)}, since the energy was -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the exponent is -i (E t / \u0127) = -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * t / \u0127) = i (\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nSimilarly for the second term: exponent is -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * t / \u0127 ) = -i (\u03b3 B t /2 ), so e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)}.\n\nTherefore, the state is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |-y\u27e9 ].\n\nSo, to compute \u27e8Sz\u27e9, let's express Sz in terms of the S_y basis.\n\nAlternatively, note that Sz and Sy do not commute, so their eigenstates are different. The expectation value of Sz will depend on the interference terms between |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nLet me write Sz in the S_y basis. Let me suppose that in the basis of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, the Sz operator has matrix elements:\n\nLet me denote the basis vectors as |1\u27e9 = |+y\u27e9 and |2\u27e9 = |-y\u27e9.\n\nThen,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u27e8-y| Sz |-y\u27e9.\n\nWe can compute these matrix elements using the relationships between the basis states.\n\nEarlier, I computed \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/\u221a2? Wait, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Let me try again, but using the Pauli matrices.\n\nLet me use the Pauli matrices in the standard basis (Sz basis). Let me consider \u03c3_z and \u03c3_y.\n\n\u03c3_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9.\n\n\u03c3_y is:\n\n[ 0   -i ]\n\n[ i    0 ]\n\nSo, in the Sz basis, the operator Sz is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z, and Sy is (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nThe eigenstates of Sy are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9, which in the Sz basis are:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9),\n\n|-y\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2 (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9).\n\nSo to find Sz in the Sy basis, let's express Sz in terms of the Sy basis vectors.\n\nThe matrix elements of Sz in the Sy basis are:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2 \u27e8+z| - i/\u221a2 \u27e8-z| ) Sz (1/\u221a2 |+z\u27e9 + i/\u221a2 |-z\u27e9 )\n\nWait, no: the first part is \u27e8+y| = (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2,\n\nand |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nSz acts on the ket, so:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = Sz ( (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ) = ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (Sz |-z\u27e9 ) ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSo then,\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * [ ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n\u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = (\u0127/2) * 1,\n\n\u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = 0,\n\ni \u27e8-z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = i*(i)(-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 = (i\u00b2)(-\u0127/2) = (-1)(-\u0127/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding those terms:\n\n(\u0127/2 + \u0127/2) divided by ( \u221a2 * \u221a2 ) denominator?\n\nWait, the entire expression is multiplied by 1/(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nWait, the outer terms:\n\nThe first part is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2,\n\nthe second part is ( (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) ) /\u221a2,\n\nso the product is (\u27e8+z| term + i \u27e8-z| term ) * ( terms ) all over (\u221a2 * \u221a2).\n\nThus, the total is ( (\u0127/2) + \u0127/2 ) / 2 = ( \u0127 ) / 2.\n\nWait, so \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = ( (1/2 + 1/2 ) \u0127 ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the terms properly.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step:\n\nThe first term in the product:\n\n\u27e8+z| Sz |+z\u27e9 part:\n\n\u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = (\u0127/2) \u27e8+z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/2 *1 = \u0127/2.\n\nSecond term in the first part (i \u27e8-z|) times the first term in the Sz |+y\u27e9 (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9):\n\ni \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) = i*(\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\nThird term from \u27e8+z| times the second term in Sz |+y\u27e9 (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ):\n\n\u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = i*(-\u0127/2)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: i \u27e8-z| times the second term (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ):\n\ni \u27e8-z| * (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \n\n= i * i * (-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= (i\u00b2)*(-\u0127/2)*1 \n\n= (-1)*(-\u0127/2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSo adding all four terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/2,\n\nFourth term: +\u0127/2,\n\nTotal: \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127,\n\nthen divided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 2,\n\nso total \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127 / 2.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because Sz is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix \u03c3_z, so in the |+y\u27e9 basis, the expectation value for Sz on |+y\u27e9 would be zero?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, but we computed that \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2?\n\nHmm, that can't be right, because |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, so the expectation value of Sz should be zero?\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Because if |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9 with equal coefficients, then \u27e8Sz\u27e9 would be ( (\u0127/2) + (-\u0127/2) ) / 2 = 0. \n\nAh, right! So there must be an error in my calculation. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, let me do this again. Let me compute \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9. The state |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. So the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 \n\n= (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 * Sz * (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\nWait, no: \u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2, right?\n\nWait, the conjugate of |+y\u27e9 is \u27e8+y| = (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 because of the complex conjugate. Wait, hold on. The state |+y\u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, so its dual vector \u27e8+y| is (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2. Because when you take the conjugate transpose, the i becomes -i.\n\nAh, there's the mistake! In my earlier calculation, I incorrectly took \u27e8+y| as (\u27e8+z| + i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2, but actually it's (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2.\n\nSo let me recalculate \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 with the correct \u27e8+y|:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nFirst, apply Sz to |+y\u27e9:\n\nSz |+y\u27e9 = Sz (|+z\u27e9 +i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= (Sz |+z\u27e9 + i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nSo then, the inner product:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z|)/\u221a2 ] * [ ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nBreaking this down term by term:\n\nFirst term: \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 (\u0127/2) *1,\n\nSecond term: \u27e8+z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 0,\n\nThird term: -i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 -i*(\u0127/2)*0 =0,\n\nFourth term: -i \u27e8-z| (i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 -i * i * (-\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= -i\u00b2 * (-\u0127/2) *1 \n\n= -(-1)*(-\u0127/2) = - (\u0127/2)\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/2,\n\nFourth term: - \u0127/2,\n\nTotal: (\u0127/2 - \u0127/2) = 0,\n\nthen divided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = 2,\n\nso total \u27e8+y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = 0 / 2 = 0. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So the expectation value of Sz in the state |+y\u27e9 is zero. Similarly, \u27e8-y| Sz |-y\u27e9 would also be zero, because it's the same as \u27e8+y| with i replaced by -i, leading to the same cancellation. \n\nTherefore, the diagonal elements of Sz in the Sy basis are zero. \n\nNow, what about the off-diagonal elements?\n\nCompute \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9:\n\nFirst, | -y \u27e9 is (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| - i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * Sz [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nFirst, apply Sz to |-y\u27e9:\n\nSz |-y\u27e9 = Sz (|+z\u27e9 -i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\n= (Sz |+z\u27e9 -i Sz |-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 -i (-\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\n= ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 \n\nThen, the inner product with \u27e8+y|:\n\n\u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = [ (\u27e8+z| -i \u27e8-z| ) /\u221a2 ] * [ ( (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9 + i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) /\u221a2 ]\n\nBreaking down:\n\nFirst term: \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 \u0127/2,\n\nSecond term: \u27e8+z| (i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 0,\n\nThird term: -i \u27e8-z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 0,\n\nFourth term: -i \u27e8-z| (i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) \u2192 -i *i (\u0127/2) \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= -i\u00b2 (\u0127/2) *1 \u2192 -(-1)(\u0127/2) \u2192 \u0127/2.\n\nAdding terms:\n\nFirst term: \u0127/2,\n\nFourth term: + \u0127/2,\n\nTotal: \u0127,\n\ndivided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2 ) = 2,\n\nso \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 / 1 (Wait, total is (\u0127/2 + \u0127/2) = \u0127, divided by 2 \u2192 \u0127/2.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe total of the terms inside is \u0127/2 (from first term) plus (from fourth term):\n\nFourth term: -i * i (\u0127/2) \u2192 since i * -i = -i\u00b2 = +1 \u2192 so that term is + (\u0127/2) *1 (because \u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 is 1). So total is \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127. Then divided by 2 (from denominators \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2), so total is \u0127/2.\n\nAh, okay. So \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = (\u0127/2).\n\nSimilarly, the other off-diagonal term \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 would be the complex conjugate. Since the matrix elements are for Hermitian operators, it should be the conjugate. Let's see:\n\n\u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = conjugate of \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9. Since the calculation for \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 resulted in (\u0127/2), which is real? Wait no, let me see:\n\nWait in the above calculation, the final result was \u0127/2? Let me see again:\n\nWait in the fourth term, the fourth term was:\n\n-i \u27e8-z| (i (\u0127/2)|-z\u27e9 ) = -i*(i)*(\u0127/2)\u27e8-z|-z\u27e9 \n\n= -i\u00b2 (\u0127/2)*1 \u2192 since i squared is -1, so -(-1) = +1, so that term is + (\u0127/2). \n\nThe first term was \u27e8+z| (\u0127/2 |+z\u27e9 ) \u2192 \u0127/2. So total is \u0127/2 + \u0127/2 = \u0127, divided by 2 \u2192 \u0127/2.\n\nYes, so \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9 = \u0127/2.\n\nSince Sz is Hermitian, \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 must be the complex conjugate of \u27e8+y| Sz |-y\u27e9, but since this is real, it's the same, so \u27e8-y| Sz |+y\u27e9 = \u0127/2 as well.\n\nTherefore, the matrix representation of Sz in the Sy basis is:\n\nSz = (\u0127/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] ?\n\nWait no. Wait the matrix elements are:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 = 0,\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 = \u0127/2,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 = \u0127/2,\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 = 0,\n\nso in matrix form:\n\n[ 0    \u0127/2 ]\n\n[ \u0127/2  0 ]\n\nSo Sz in the Sy basis is a matrix with off-diagonal terms \u0127/2.\n\nSo now, let's return to the expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t):\n\nThe state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |-y\u27e9 ], where \u03c9 = (\u03b3 B)/2.\n\nLet me write the state in vector form in the Sy basis:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ] \n\nwhere |1\u27e9 is |+y\u27e9, |2\u27e9 is |-y\u27e9.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8Sz\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| Sz |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nExpressed in matrix terms:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| + e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| ] * Sz * (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiplying the terms:\n\n= (1/2) [ e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| Sz e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03c9 t} \u27e81| Sz e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 \n\n+ e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| Sz e^{i \u03c9 t} |1\u27e9 + e^{i \u03c9 t} \u27e82| Sz e^{-i \u03c9 t} |2\u27e9 ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} = \u27e81| Sz |1\u27e9 *1 = 0.\n\nSecond term:\n\n\u27e81| Sz |2\u27e9 e^{-i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} = (\u0127/2) e^{-2i \u03c9 t}.\n\nThird term:\n\n\u27e82| Sz |1\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{i \u03c9 t} = (\u0127/2) e^{+2i \u03c9 t}.\n\nFourth term:\n\n\u27e82| Sz |2\u27e9 e^{i \u03c9 t} e^{-i \u03c9 t} = 0 *1 =0.\n\nTherefore, adding all terms:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9 = (1/2)[ 0 + (\u0127/2)e^{-2i \u03c9 t} + (\u0127/2)e^{+2i \u03c9 t} +0 ]\n\n= (\u0127/4)[ e^{+2i \u03c9 t} + e^{-2i \u03c9 t} ]\n\n= (\u0127/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t).\n\nBecause e^{i\u03b8} + e^{-i\u03b8} = 2 cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(2 \u03c9 t).\n\nBut \u03c9 was defined as (\u03b3 B)/2, so substituting:\n\n\u27e8Sz\u27e9(t) = (\u0127/2) cos( 2*(\u03b3 B /2) t ) = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of Sz oscillates with angular frequency \u03c9_osc = \u03b3 B.\n\nSince the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the angular frequency (in terms of radians per second), so the answer would be \u03b3 B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) gamma*B/2\n\nB) gamma*B\n\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the correct answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nThe key steps were:\n\n1. The initial state is |+z\u27e9, expressed in the Sy basis as (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\n2. Under the new Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B Sy, the energies of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 are -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and +\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), respectively.\n\n3. The time evolution of the state gives each eigenstate a phase factor of e^{i E t / \u0127 }, but since H is -\u03b3 B Sy, the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) for |+y\u27e9 and E_- = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) for |-y\u27e9. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B Sy. So the energy eigenvalues are:\n\nFor |+y\u27e9: H |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B Sy |+y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2)|+y\u27e9 \u2192 E_+ = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9, Sy |-y\u27e9 = - (\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9, so H |-y\u27e9 = -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2)|-y\u27e9 = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2 |-y\u27e9 \u2192 E_- = + (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2.\n\nTherefore, the time evolution for |+y\u27e9 is e^{-i E_+ t / \u0127} = e^{-i (- \u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 } = e^{i (\u03b3 B t / 2)}.\n\nSimilarly for |-y\u27e9: e^{-i E_- t / \u0127 } = e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2 t)/ \u0127 } = e^{-i (\u03b3 B t /2)}.\n\nThus, the state is indeed (1/\u221a2)[ e^{i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B t/2)} |-y\u27e9 ].\n\nThen, when calculating \u27e8Sz\u27e9(t), we found it to be (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the angular frequency is \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, which is option B.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think the answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves a spin-1/2 particle initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's state evolves under the new Hamiltonian. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The particle is in the |+z\u27e9 state. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\).\n2. **Eigenbasis Transition**: The initial state \\( |+z\\rangle \\) is expressed in the \\( S_y \\) eigenbasis as \\( |+z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+y\\rangle + |-y\\rangle) \\).\n3. **Time Evolution**: The state evolves under the new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent phases for the \\( |+y\\rangle \\) and \\( |-y\\rangle \\) components.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment when the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z to +Y direction. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about spin and magnetic moments in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe problem states that the particle is a spin 1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3*S_z. Here, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S_z is the z-component of the spin. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle's spin is aligned with that field. Since it's a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are \u00b1\u0127/2. Since it's aligned with the field, it's in the +\u0127/2 state, right?\n\nThen, the magnetic field is turned off and immediately replaced by another one along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. Now, when the field direction changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which should cause the state of the particle to evolve in time. The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time. Since the magnetic moment depends on S_z, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 will depend on \u27e8S_z\u27e9 over time.\n\nHmm, so I need to model the time evolution of the system after the field is switched. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, before the field is changed, the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote that state as |+z\u27e9. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H would be -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S. Since the new field is along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, because the direction is Y, so the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y?\n\nYes, so the new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Since the particle's state is initially in |+z\u27e9, which is not an eigenstate of S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state will cause the expectation values of operators like S_z to oscillate.\n\nTo find the average \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time, I need to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the S_z basis. The S_y operator in the S_z basis has matrix elements given by the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrix for S_y (in units where \u0127=1 for simplicity, since the actual units might not matter here) is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] (but with a factor of \u0127/2, but maybe we can ignore that for frequency calculations?)\n\nWait, actually, the spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices are S_x = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, S_z = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So the Hamiltonian H would be -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation: i\u0127 d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is the eigenstate of \u03c3_z with eigenvalue +1 (since S_z |+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9, so \u03c3_z |+z\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9). To find the time evolution, I can diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to \u03c3_y, the eigenstates of \u03c3_y are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the energies will be E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). \n\nThe eigenstates of \u03c3_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of these. Let me recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, actually, let me verify that. The eigenstates of \u03c3_y are different. Since \u03c3_y has eigenvalues \u00b11, and solving (\u03c3_y - \u03bb I)v =0 for \u03bb=1:\n\nFor \u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so subtracting \u03bb=1:\n\nThe matrix becomes [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]. The eigenvector would satisfy -v1 -i v2 =0 and i v1 - v2 =0. Let me take v2 = -i v1, so substituting into first equation: -v1 -i*(-i v1) = -v1 - v1 = -2v1 =0? Hmm, maybe I need to do it more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenstates are (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 and (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. Wait, maybe. Let me think in terms of rotation. The state |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. Let me see: when you rotate the spin about the x-axis by 45 degrees, you get the y-axis. Hmm, perhaps an easier way is to just use the standard expressions.\n\nThe eigenstate of S_y with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write that:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2? Wait, no, let me see. Let me rearrange the equation for |+y\u27e9:\n\nIf |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, then solving for |+z\u27e9:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u221a2 |+y\u27e9 - i \u221a2 |-z\u27e9? Hmm, perhaps better to express |+z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me see:\n\nLet me write:\n\nLet me call |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo to get |+z\u27e9 in terms of |\u00b1y\u27e9, let's add and subtract these equations:\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 = (2|+z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 |+z\u27e9 = (\u221a2/2)(|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 = (2i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 |-z\u27e9 = (\u221a2/(2i))( |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 )\n\nSo the initial state |+z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a(2/2) )? Wait, actually, from the first equation, |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) multiplied by \u221a2/2, since the coefficient is (\u221a2/2) from the equation above. Wait, the first line says:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 rearranged, |+z\u27e9 = \u221a2 |+y\u27e9 - i\u221a2 |-z\u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just express |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9. We can plug in the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9:\n\nSo substituting,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nGather terms:\n\nThe coefficients for |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2,\n\nthe coefficients for |-z\u27e9: (a i - b i)/\u221a2.\n\nSince the left side is |+z\u27e9, which has 1 in |+z\u27e9 and 0 in |-z\u27e9, we can set up equations:\n\n(a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nand (i (a - b))/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThe second equation implies that a = b.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation: (2a)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, a = b = 1/\u221a2. \n\nSo |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2. \n\nTherefore, the initial state can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. \n\nNow, the time evolution of the system is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The eigenvalues are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * 1 and E_- = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)* (-1) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). \n\nWait, let me compute them properly. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y will have eigenvalues E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). So E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * 1 = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2, and E_- = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * (-1) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2. \n\nTherefore, the energy eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 with energy E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2, and |-y\u27e9 with energy E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is given by:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y\u27e9 + b e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y\u27e9 \n\nBut since the initial state is |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, so a = 1/\u221a2, b =1/\u221a2. Therefore,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe first exponent: -i * (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) * t / \u0127 = i \u03b3 B t / 2,\n\nthe second exponent: -i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) * t / \u0127 = -i \u03b3 B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t / 2} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z at time t. \n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nSince S_z is diagonal in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, perhaps it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, then compute the expectation.\n\nAlternatively, since S_z can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's first express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSubstituting these into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\nThe overall factor becomes (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = 1/2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9) + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9) ]\n\nNow, expand the terms:\n\n= 1/2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+z\u27e9 + i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |-z\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |+z\u27e9 - i e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe |+z\u27e9 terms: [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |+z\u27e9,\n\nThe |-z\u27e9 terms: [ i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} - i e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |-z\u27e9.\n\nFactor out terms:\n\nFor |+z\u27e9: 2 cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9,\n\nFor |-z\u27e9: i [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} - e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |-z\u27e9 = i [ 2i sin( \u03b3 B t/2) ] |-z\u27e9 = -2 sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9.\n\nPutting back into the expression:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (1/2) [ 2 cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9 - 2 sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03c8(t) = cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9 - sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9 \n\nNow, compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Since S_z is diagonal in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nThe eigenvalues of S_z for |+z\u27e9 is +\u0127/2, and for |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2. Therefore,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = [cos(\u03b3 B t/2)]\u00b2*(\u0127/2) + [ - sin(\u03b3 B t/2) ]\u00b2*(-\u0127/2) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the state is written as |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9, where A = cos(\u03b3 B t/2) and B = - sin(\u03b3 B t/2). \n\nThe expectation value of S_z is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (A*) (\u0127/2) A + (B*) (-\u0127/2) B \n\nBecause \u27e8+z|S_z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/2, \u27e8-z|S_z|-z\u27e9 = -\u0127/2, and cross terms are zero. Since the coefficients are real (since the phases have been accounted for?), wait, actually, are the coefficients real?\n\nWait, in the expression for \u03c8(t), the coefficients are cos(...) and -sin(...), which are real. So yes, the coefficients are real. Therefore, the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2))*(\u0127/2) + (sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2))*(-\u0127/2)\n\n= (\u0127/2)[ cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2) ]\n\nUsing the identity cos\u00b2 x - sin\u00b2 x = cos(2x), this simplifies to:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nWait a second! Because 2*(\u03b3 B t/2) is \u03b3 B t. So yes, that's right.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8S_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos( \u03b3 B t ), with amplitude \u0127/2. \n\nBut the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment \u03bc_z is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z. So \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z. Therefore, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 would be \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9, so substituting in the expression above:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3*(\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nThe time dependence here is cos(\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Therefore, the frequency is \u03c9/(2\u03c0), but in physics, when we talk about oscillation frequency in such contexts, we usually refer to the angular frequency \u03c9, not the cyclic frequency (which would be \u03c9/(2\u03c0)). The question doesn't specify, but looking at the options, all are in terms of \u03b3 B multiplied by some factor, so likely angular frequency is intended here.\n\nTherefore, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer would be option B. \n\nWait, let me check again. The angular frequency in the cosine term is \u03b3 B. So yes, the frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait but let me confirm the steps again to be sure.\n\nWait, when I found \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the cosine term's argument is \u03b3 B t. So the angular frequency \u03c9 is \u03b3 B. Therefore the oscillation frequency is indeed \u03b3 B, so option B.\n\nHmm, but wait. Let me check the steps again. Let me see:\n\nThe time dependence in the exponent came from the Hamiltonian. The energy eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 and E_- = +\u03b3 B \u0127/2. So the difference between them is E_+ - E_- = -\u03b3 B \u0127. \n\nThe time evolution of the state's phases: the |+y\u27e9 term had an exponent of +i \u03b3 B t/2 and the |-y\u27e9 term had -i \u03b3 B t/2. Wait, actually, when I plugged in the exponents earlier:\n\nThe eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the phase for |+y\u27e9 would be exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9, E_- is \u03b3 B \u0127/2, so exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the exponents were indeed \u00b1i \u03b3 B t /2. \n\nThen when we expressed \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, the coefficients led to the combination that resulted in cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) and -sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ). Then when computing \u27e8S_z\u27e9, the expression ended up being cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait but let me check again the final step. The expectation value of S_z was (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2 - sin\u00b2), which is (\u0127/2) cos(2*(\u03b3 B t/2)) = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t). So the argument is \u03b3 B t. So the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the frequency is indeed B times gamma. So the answer is B. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment when the magnetic field is suddenly changed from the +Z to +Y direction. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about spin and magnetic moments in quantum mechanics.\n\nThe problem states that the particle is a spin 1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03bc = \u03b3*S_z. Here, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S_z is the z-component of the spin. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so the particle's spin is aligned with that field. Since it's a spin 1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are \u00b1\u0127/2. Since it's aligned with the field, it's in the +\u0127/2 state, right?\n\nThen, the magnetic field is turned off and immediately replaced by another one along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. Now, when the field direction changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which should cause the state of the particle to evolve in time. The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment over time. Since the magnetic moment depends on S_z, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 will depend on \u27e8S_z\u27e9 over time.\n\nHmm, so I need to model the time evolution of the system after the field is switched. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, before the field is changed, the particle is in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let's denote that state as |+z\u27e9. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc = \u03b3 S, then H would be -\u03b3 B \u00b7 S. Since the new field is along +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Wait, because the direction is Y, so the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y?\n\nYes, so the new Hamiltonian is H = -\u03b3 B S_y. Since the particle's state is initially in |+z\u27e9, which is not an eigenstate of S_y, the system will start evolving according to the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state will cause the expectation values of operators like S_z to oscillate.\n\nTo find the average \u27e8S_z\u27e9 as a function of time, I need to express the initial state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of S_y are different from those of S_z. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y can be written in terms of the S_z basis. The S_y operator in the S_z basis has matrix elements given by the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrix for S_y (in units where \u0127=1 for simplicity, since the actual units might not matter here) is:\n\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] (but with a factor of \u0127/2, but maybe we can ignore that for frequency calculations?)\n\nWait, actually, the spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices are S_x = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, S_z = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z. So the Hamiltonian H would be -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation: i\u0127 d/dt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = H |\u03c8(t)\u27e9. \n\nThe initial state is |+z\u27e9, which is the eigenstate of \u03c3_z with eigenvalue +1 (since S_z |+z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)|+z\u27e9, so \u03c3_z |+z\u27e9 = |+z\u27e9). To find the time evolution, I can diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Since H is proportional to \u03c3_y, the eigenstates of \u03c3_y are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the energies will be E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). \n\nThe eigenstates of \u03c3_y are |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. The state |+z\u27e9 can be written in terms of these. Let me recall that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nWait, actually, let me verify that. The eigenstates of \u03c3_y are different. Since \u03c3_y has eigenvalues \u00b11, and solving (\u03c3_y - \u03bb I)v =0 for \u03bb=1:\n\nFor \u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so subtracting \u03bb=1:\n\nThe matrix becomes [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]. The eigenvector would satisfy -v1 -i v2 =0 and i v1 - v2 =0. Let me take v2 = -i v1, so substituting into first equation: -v1 -i*(-i v1) = -v1 - v1 = -2v1 =0? Hmm, maybe I need to do it more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the eigenstates are (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 and (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2. Wait, maybe. Let me think in terms of rotation. The state |+y\u27e9 is a superposition of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9. Let me see: when you rotate the spin about the x-axis by 45 degrees, you get the y-axis. Hmm, perhaps an easier way is to just use the standard expressions.\n\nThe eigenstate of S_y with eigenvalue +\u0127/2 is:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \n\nYes, that's correct. So the initial state |+z\u27e9 can be written as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me write that:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 - i |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2? Wait, no, let me see. Let me rearrange the equation for |+y\u27e9:\n\nIf |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2, then solving for |+z\u27e9:\n\n|+z\u27e9 = \u221a2 |+y\u27e9 - i \u221a2 |-z\u27e9? Hmm, perhaps better to express |+z\u27e9 in terms of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9. Let me see:\n\nLet me write:\n\nLet me call |+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand |-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo to get |+z\u27e9 in terms of |\u00b1y\u27e9, let's add and subtract these equations:\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9 = (2|+z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 |+z\u27e9 = (\u221a2/2)(|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n|+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 = (2i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 |-z\u27e9 = (\u221a2/(2i))( |+y\u27e9 - |-y\u27e9 )\n\nSo the initial state |+z\u27e9 is (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a(2/2) )? Wait, actually, from the first equation, |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9) multiplied by \u221a2/2, since the coefficient is (\u221a2/2) from the equation above. Wait, the first line says:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 \u2192 rearranged, |+z\u27e9 = \u221a2 |+y\u27e9 - i\u221a2 |-z\u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just express |+z\u27e9 as a combination of |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose |+z\u27e9 = a |+y\u27e9 + b |-y\u27e9. We can plug in the expressions for |+y\u27e9 and |-y\u27e9 in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9:\n\nSo substituting,\n\n|+z\u27e9 = a [ (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] + b [ (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nGather terms:\n\nThe coefficients for |+z\u27e9: (a + b)/\u221a2,\n\nthe coefficients for |-z\u27e9: (a i - b i)/\u221a2.\n\nSince the left side is |+z\u27e9, which has 1 in |+z\u27e9 and 0 in |-z\u27e9, we can set up equations:\n\n(a + b)/\u221a2 = 1,\n\nand (i (a - b))/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThe second equation implies that a = b.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation: (2a)/\u221a2 =1 \u2192 a = \u221a2/2.\n\nTherefore, a = b = 1/\u221a2. \n\nSo |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2. \n\nTherefore, the initial state can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. \n\nNow, the time evolution of the system is given by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is H = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y. The eigenvalues are E_+ = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * 1 and E_- = - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2)* (-1) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). \n\nWait, let me compute them properly. The eigenvalues of \u03c3_y are \u00b11, so the Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y will have eigenvalues E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) * (\u00b11). So E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * 1 = - (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2, and E_- = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 * (-1) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2. \n\nTherefore, the energy eigenstates are |+y\u27e9 with energy E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2, and |-y\u27e9 with energy E_- = \u03b3 B \u0127/2.\n\nThe time evolution of the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is given by:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = a e^{-i E_+ t/\u0127} |+y\u27e9 + b e^{-i E_- t/\u0127} |-y\u27e9 \n\nBut since the initial state is |+z\u27e9 = (|+y\u27e9 + |-y\u27e9)/\u221a2, so a = 1/\u221a2, b =1/\u221a2. Therefore,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 } |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) t / \u0127 } |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nThe first exponent: -i * (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) * t / \u0127 = i \u03b3 B t / 2,\n\nthe second exponent: -i (\u03b3 B \u0127 /2) * t / \u0127 = -i \u03b3 B t / 2.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t / 2} |+y\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t / 2} |-y\u27e9 ]\n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of S_z at time t. \n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nSince S_z is diagonal in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, perhaps it's easier to express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in terms of |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, then compute the expectation.\n\nAlternatively, since S_z can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's first express |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis.\n\nWe know that:\n\n|+y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|-y\u27e9 = (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSubstituting these into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (1/\u221a2) [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ]\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\nThe overall factor becomes (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = 1/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03c8(t) = 1/2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 + i |-z\u27e9) + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} (|+z\u27e9 - i |-z\u27e9) ]\n\nNow, expand the terms:\n\n= 1/2 [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |+z\u27e9 + i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} |-z\u27e9 + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |+z\u27e9 - i e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe |+z\u27e9 terms: [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} + e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |+z\u27e9,\n\nThe |-z\u27e9 terms: [ i e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} - i e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |-z\u27e9.\n\nFactor out terms:\n\nFor |+z\u27e9: 2 cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9,\n\nFor |-z\u27e9: i [ e^{i \u03b3 B t/2} - e^{-i \u03b3 B t/2} ] |-z\u27e9 = i [ 2i sin( \u03b3 B t/2) ] |-z\u27e9 = -2 sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9.\n\nPutting back into the expression:\n\n\u03c8(t) = (1/2) [ 2 cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9 - 2 sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03c8(t) = cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |+z\u27e9 - sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ) |-z\u27e9 \n\nNow, compute \u27e8S_z\u27e9. Since S_z is diagonal in the |\u00b1z\u27e9 basis, the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 \n\nThe eigenvalues of S_z for |+z\u27e9 is +\u0127/2, and for |-z\u27e9 is -\u0127/2. Therefore,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = [cos(\u03b3 B t/2)]\u00b2*(\u0127/2) + [ - sin(\u03b3 B t/2) ]\u00b2*(-\u0127/2) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the state is written as |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = A |+z\u27e9 + B |-z\u27e9, where A = cos(\u03b3 B t/2) and B = - sin(\u03b3 B t/2). \n\nThe expectation value of S_z is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (A*) (\u0127/2) A + (B*) (-\u0127/2) B \n\nBecause \u27e8+z|S_z|+z\u27e9 = \u0127/2, \u27e8-z|S_z|-z\u27e9 = -\u0127/2, and cross terms are zero. Since the coefficients are real (since the phases have been accounted for?), wait, actually, are the coefficients real?\n\nWait, in the expression for \u03c8(t), the coefficients are cos(...) and -sin(...), which are real. So yes, the coefficients are real. Therefore, the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2))*(\u0127/2) + (sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2))*(-\u0127/2)\n\n= (\u0127/2)[ cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t/2) ]\n\nUsing the identity cos\u00b2 x - sin\u00b2 x = cos(2x), this simplifies to:\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nWait a second! Because 2*(\u03b3 B t/2) is \u03b3 B t. So yes, that's right.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8S_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos( \u03b3 B t ), with amplitude \u0127/2. \n\nBut the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment \u03bc_z is given by \u03bc = \u03b3 S_z. So \u03bc_z = \u03b3 S_z. Therefore, the average \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 would be \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9, so substituting in the expression above:\n\n\u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3*(\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t )\n\nThe time dependence here is cos(\u03c9 t), where \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Therefore, the frequency is \u03c9/(2\u03c0), but in physics, when we talk about oscillation frequency in such contexts, we usually refer to the angular frequency \u03c9, not the cyclic frequency (which would be \u03c9/(2\u03c0)). The question doesn't specify, but looking at the options, all are in terms of \u03b3 B multiplied by some factor, so likely angular frequency is intended here.\n\nTherefore, the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer would be option B. \n\nWait, let me check again. The angular frequency in the cosine term is \u03b3 B. So yes, the frequency is \u03b3 B. So the answer is B) gamma*B.\n\nWait but let me confirm the steps again to be sure.\n\nWait, when I found \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the cosine term's argument is \u03b3 B t. So the angular frequency \u03c9 is \u03b3 B. Therefore the oscillation frequency is indeed \u03b3 B, so option B.\n\nHmm, but wait. Let me check the steps again. Let me see:\n\nThe time dependence in the exponent came from the Hamiltonian. The energy eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B \u0127/2 and E_- = +\u03b3 B \u0127/2. So the difference between them is E_+ - E_- = -\u03b3 B \u0127. \n\nThe time evolution of the state's phases: the |+y\u27e9 term had an exponent of +i \u03b3 B t/2 and the |-y\u27e9 term had -i \u03b3 B t/2. Wait, actually, when I plugged in the exponents earlier:\n\nThe eigenvalues were E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2), so the phase for |+y\u27e9 would be exp( -i E_+ t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (-\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSimilarly, for |-y\u27e9, E_- is \u03b3 B \u0127/2, so exp( -i E_- t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i (\u03b3 B \u0127/2) t / \u0127 ) = exp( -i \u03b3 B t / 2 )\n\nSo the exponents were indeed \u00b1i \u03b3 B t /2. \n\nThen when we expressed \u03c8(t) in terms of |+z\u27e9 and |-z\u27e9, the coefficients led to the combination that resulted in cos( \u03b3 B t/2 ) and -sin( \u03b3 B t/2 ). Then when computing \u27e8S_z\u27e9, the expression ended up being cos( \u03b3 B t ), so the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait but let me check again the final step. The expectation value of S_z was (\u0127/2)(cos\u00b2 - sin\u00b2), which is (\u0127/2) cos(2*(\u03b3 B t/2)) = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t). So the argument is \u03b3 B t. So the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. So the frequency is indeed B times gamma. So the answer is B. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n\nThe particle starts in the eigenstate of \\( S_z \\) with \\( +\\hbar/2 \\), aligned with the initial \\( +Z \\) field. When the field is switched to \\( +Y \\), the Hamiltonian becomes \\( H = -\\gamma B S_y \\). The initial state \\( |+z\\rangle \\) is expressed in terms of the \\( S_y \\) eigenstates \\( |+y\\rangle \\) and \\( |-y\\rangle \\). The time evolution of the state is derived using the eigenvalues of \\( H \\), leading to oscillations in the expectation value of \\( S_z \\). The angular frequency of the oscillation in \\( \\langle S_z \\rangle \\) is found to be \\( \\gamma B \\), corresponding to the cosine term \\( \\cos(\\gamma B t) \\).\n\nAnswer: B",
