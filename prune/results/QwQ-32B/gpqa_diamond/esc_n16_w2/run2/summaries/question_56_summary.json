      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom's quantum states and their transitions. Let me try to work through this step by step. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. The options give different paths and probabilities, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules apply. The main ones are that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l (delta l) must be \u00b11, and the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any value, but in dipole transitions, it's usually n changes by 1 or more, but maybe here the path is via two steps.\n\nWait, the problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, and it must go through an intermediate state before reaching |1,0,0\u27e9. So the path is two steps: 3 \u2192 intermediate \u2192 1. Each step must be allowed by the dipole selection rules.\n\nLet me recall the selection rules again. For electric dipole transitions, the allowed transitions are:\n\n\u0394l = \u00b11 (so the orbital angular momentum must change by exactly 1 in either direction). So, for example, from l=0, you can only go to l=1 or l=-1, but since l is non-negative, only l=1. \n\nSimilarly, for the magnetic quantum number m, \u0394m can be 0, +1, or -1. So the m has to stay the same or change by 1.\n\nAlso, the principal quantum number n can change by any value, but in dipole transitions, the most common is \u0394n can be any, but each step must satisfy the l and m rules.\n\nSo starting from |3,0,0\u27e9, the first transition must go to a state with l=1 (since \u0394l must be \u00b11, and original l is 0). The m can be 0 \u00b11, so m can be -1, 0, or +1. But the intermediate state must then be able to transition down to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 in the second step.\n\nWait, the intermediate state after the first transition must then go to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 in the second transition. Let me think. Let's denote the first transition as |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |n1, l1, m1\u27e9, then the second transition is |n1,l1,m1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9. Each of these must satisfy the selection rules.\n\nSo let's look at possible paths. The first step from 3,0,0 must have l changing to 1. So l1 must be 1. The m can be 0, \u00b11? Wait, original m is 0, so m1 can be 0+1=1, 0-1=-1, or stay 0? Wait no, the m can only change by 0, +1, or -1. Wait, for dipole transitions, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So starting at m=0, m1 can be 0, 1, or -1. So possible m values are 0,1,-1. \n\nSo possible intermediate states after first transition are:\n\nEither |n1,1,0\u27e9, |n1,1,1\u27e9, or |n1,1,-1\u27e9. \n\nBut then the second transition must go to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's look at the second transition's requirements. The intermediate state must have l=1, and the final l is 0. So \u0394l must be -1 (since 1 to 0 is a decrease by 1, which is allowed). The m must change from m1 to 0. So for the second step, from l=1 to l=0, the m must change by \u0394m = 0, +1, or -1. Wait, but when l decreases, the m can also decrease or increase? Let me think again.\n\nThe selection rules for dipole transitions require that the change in m is -1, 0, or +1. So for the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9, the m must change from m1 to 0. So m_final (0) = m_initial (m1) + \u0394m, where \u0394m is -1, 0, or +1. \n\nTherefore, m1 must be either 0, 1, or -1 so that adding \u0394m gives 0. Wait, for example:\n\nIf the intermediate state has m1 = 0, then in the second transition, \u0394m can be 0 (so m stays 0). That's allowed.\n\nIf m1 was 1, then \u0394m would have to be -1 (since 1 -1 =0). That's allowed.\n\nIf m1 was -1, then \u0394m would have to be +1 (since -1 +1 =0). Also allowed.\n\nSo all three possible m1 values (0,1,-1) can lead to m=0 in the final state. \n\nNow, considering the principal quantum number. The first transition goes from n=3 to some n1, then from n1 to n=1. Each transition can have any \u0394n, but the total change is from 3 to 1. But each step must be a dipole transition. Since dipole transitions can have any \u0394n except 0, but each step must satisfy the l and m rules. \n\nThe possible n1 values in the intermediate state must be such that when you go from 3 to n1 and then to 1. Let me see possible n steps. For the first transition from n=3 to n1, and then from n1 to 1. The total \u0394n from 3 to 1 is -2. But each step can be any \u0394n as long as the other rules are met.\n\nWait, but for the first transition, the l must go from 0 to 1. So possible n1 can be any n such that 3\u2192n1 is allowed via a dipole transition (which allows any n as long as l changes by 1). Similarly for the second transition from n1 to 1. \n\nBut let's see possible paths. Since the options given have the intermediate states as n=2. For example, options A, B, C have the first step going to n=2. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921). The intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. \n\nOption B: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921), with intermediate |2,1,1\u27e9.\n\nOption C: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921), with intermediate |2,1,-1\u27e9.\n\nOption D is similar to A but with different probability and maybe missing a bracket? Wait the D option's first arrow seems like there's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9...? The given option D says \"D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\". Wait, maybe the LaTeX was messed up. Let me check again the user's input.\n\nThe user's option D is written as: D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}. Wait, that first part seems like a typo, maybe missing the initial ket. So probably it's a typo, and the correct path is the same as A, but the probability is different. So the options are between A, B, C, D with D's path same as A but different probability.\n\nSo, first, the possible intermediate states are all with n=2? Because the options given only have n=2 as the intermediate. Let me see: the first step from n=3 to n=2 is allowed. Then from n=2 to n=1. Let me check if those transitions are allowed.\n\nFirst step: 3\u21922. The l must change by \u00b11. Original l=0, so new l must be 1. That's okay. So the intermediate state must have l=1. The m can be 0,1,-1. So the intermediate states in the options are all l=1, m=0,1,-1. So that's okay.\n\nNow, for the second transition from n=2 to n=1. The l must go from 1 to 0, which is allowed (\u0394l = -1). The m must go from the intermediate's m to 0, as we discussed. So for example, if the intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9, then m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m=0, which is allowed. If the intermediate is |2,1,1\u27e9, then m goes from 1 to 0 (\u0394m=-1), allowed. Similarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1, which is also allowed.\n\nSo all three options A, B, C have paths that are allowed in terms of the selection rules. So why are they different? The question mentions that the transition is via two dipole transitions, so all these paths are possible. But the options also have different probabilities. The question asks which one is correct in terms of both the path and the probability. So I need to figure out which path has the correct probability.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\". So each option gives a path and a probability. We need to find the correct path with the correct probability.\n\nHmm. The probabilities would depend on the selection rules and the matrix elements. But perhaps the question is referring to the relative probabilities based on the possible transitions. Wait, but maybe there are multiple paths, and the probabilities are summed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that only certain paths are allowed. Wait, but according to the selection rules, all three paths (A, B, C) are allowed. Because each step is allowed. So why is the answer among them?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the m must remain the same in some way? Or maybe the parity?\n\nWait another thought: in hydrogen atom transitions, the parity must change. The parity of a state is (-1)^l. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, which has l=0, so parity is +1. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, also l=0, so parity +1. Wait, but dipole transitions require a change in parity. Because the dipole moment has parity -1. So the transition must have \u0394parity = -1. So the total parity change over the two transitions must be -1 for each step? Wait, each dipole transition must change parity.\n\nWait each individual dipole transition must change parity. Because the dipole operator has parity -1. Therefore, each transition must go from a state with parity P to a state with parity -P. \n\nSo for the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 (parity +1), the intermediate state must have parity -1. Since the dipole transition requires parity flips. The intermediate state has l=1, so parity (-1)^1 = -1. That's okay. Then the second transition from l=1 (parity -1) must go to l=0 (parity +1). So each step flips parity. So that's okay. So all the paths are allowed in terms of parity.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't eliminate any options. \n\nNow, the probabilities. The question states that the probability is given as 1/3, 1/4, etc. The options give different probabilities. So which one is correct?\n\nPerhaps the probability is calculated based on the number of possible paths. Wait, but the question specifies \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". So maybe each path has a certain probability, but the question is asking for the correct path (i.e., which path is possible, but perhaps only one of them actually can occur? Wait no, all three paths are possible in terms of selection rules. So maybe the question is considering that the m must stay the same? Like in the first transition, m remains 0? Let me think.\n\nWait, the question says the decay happens via two dipole transitions. The path must be a possible route. However, maybe the m must remain the same? Let me think again about the m transitions.\n\nWait, the first transition from m=0 to m1 can be 0,1,-1. The second transition must then have m1 go to 0. So for example, if the first transition goes to m=0, then the second transition can stay at m=0. If the first transition goes to m=1, the second must drop to m=0 (\u0394m=-1). Similarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1. All those are allowed.\n\nSo all three paths (A,B,C) are allowed. But the probabilities would depend on the matrix elements. The problem might be referring to the relative probabilities based on the m values. Since the matrix elements for dipole transitions depend on the angular momentum components. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of possible paths. Since m can be 0,1,-1, there are three possible paths (the three options A,B,C). But the question says \"the transition route\", implying that perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex)\". The options list a specific path and a probability. So perhaps the answer is that the correct path is A (since the m stays 0?), but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first transition, the most probable path is when the m doesn't change, so m=0. But how does that affect the probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the total probability for the two-step transition. The total probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each transition. But the options give specific paths, so perhaps the question is expecting that the path with m=0 in the intermediate state has a different probability than the ones with m=\u00b11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in the first transition, the possible m values have different probabilities. For example, the transition from m=0 to m=0 might have a different probability than m=0 to m=1 or -1. But without calculating the exact matrix elements, perhaps the question refers to the fact that the m=0 path is allowed but the others are not? Wait, no, the selection rules allow all three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the total angular momentum change must be zero? Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. The question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\". The options give a path and a probability. Since all three paths (A,B,C) are possible, but the probabilities may depend on the specific path. For example, the probability for each path could be different, and the question might be asking which one is the correct combination. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using some formula for the transition probabilities. Let me recall that the probability for a dipole transition between states |i\u27e9 and |f\u27e9 is proportional to the square of the matrix element \u27e8f | r | i\u27e9. The matrix element can be calculated using angular momentum coupling rules. For hydrogen, the radial integrals depend on the principal quantum numbers, but the angular part is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for dipole transitions (which involve the operator r, which has angular momentum 1) requires that the transition between states with angular momentum l_i and l_f must satisfy l_f = l_i \u00b11, which we already know. The matrix element also depends on the m values. Specifically, the matrix element \u27e8n',l',m'| r |n,l,m\u27e9 is proportional to \u03b4_{m' - m, 0 \u00b11} (i.e., the m's must differ by 0, +1, or -1). The exact value also depends on the specific m's. \n\nThe probability for each step would then depend on the square of the angular part. For the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m1, the angular part can be calculated. Let's see:\n\nFor the first transition (3,0,0) \u2192 (2,1,m1):\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element \u27e82,1,m1 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the coupling of the angular momentum. \n\nWait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem states that the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n',l',m' | T^{(k)} |n,l,m\u27e9 = \\frac{\\langle l' || T^{(k)} || l \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2l+1}} \\langle l',m' | (Y^{(k)}_{m''}) | l,m \\rangle \n\nWhere T^{(k)} is a tensor operator of rank k. For the dipole transition, the operator is the position vector r, which is a rank 1 tensor. So k=1.\n\nThe reduced matrix element \u27e8l' || T^{(1)} || l \u27e9 depends on the radial parts and the quantum numbers, but the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l', m' | 1, m'' | l, m \u27e9 where m'' is such that m' = m + m''. Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart formula for the dipole moment.\n\nAlternatively, the angular part of the matrix element for the dipole transition between l and l' is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0; l m | l' m'\u27e9 multiplied by some factors. Wait, maybe the exact expression is:\n\nThe matrix element \u27e8n',l',m'| r |n,l,m\u27e9 is proportional to \u03b4_{m' - m, -1,0,1} and the angular part is given by \n\n\u27e8 l',m' | \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\epsilon} | l,m \u27e9 \n\nwhere \u03b5 is the polarization vector. Assuming the dipole transition is along the z-axis (so \u03b5 is along z), then the operator would involve the z-component of the dipole moment. But perhaps more accurately, the dipole operator has components in different directions. \n\nAlternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition can be written using the spherical harmonics. The dipole operator r has components in terms of the spherical harmonics. The transition amplitude will involve integrals over the angular parts, which can be evaluated using the properties of spherical harmonics.\n\nThe integral over the angles for the transition from l, m to l', m' would involve the integral of Y_{l'm'}* Y_{1q} Y_{lm}, where q is the component (the dipole operator has a vector component, so q can be -1,0,1). \n\nThe integral of Y_{l'm'} Y_{1q} Y_{lm} over the sphere is proportional to the product of three Wigner 3j symbols or something similar. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the selection rules for m are that the total m must be conserved (since the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, but maybe the m changes by 0, \u00b11). Wait, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so when you act with it on the initial state |l m\u27e9, it can change the angular momentum by \u00b11 or 0? Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as the dipole operator is a vector operator, so the matrix element is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m + q, where q is the projection of the dipole operator's angular momentum. \n\nWait, the dipole operator r is a vector operator, so its components transform as angular momentum 1. So the matrix element \u27e8l',m'| r |l,m\u27e9 is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m + m1, where m1 is the projection of the dipole's angular momentum. Since the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, m1 can be -1,0,1. Therefore, m' can be m \u00b11 or m. \n\nWait, so for the dipole transition, the change in m can be -1, 0, or +1, which aligns with the selection rules.\n\nNow, the actual probability (the square of the matrix element) depends on the specific m's. For example, the transition from m=0 to m'=0 would involve the component of the dipole operator that doesn't change m (q=0), while transitions to m'=\u00b11 would involve q=\u00b11. The probabilities can vary depending on the m's.\n\nHowever, without calculating the exact values, perhaps there is a standard result here. In the case of transitions where m remains the same, like from m=0 to m=0, the probability might be different than when it changes. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities for the different m transitions can be summed over, but the question specifies a particular path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the total probability for all possible paths (A, B, C) is given, but that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is the one with m=0 because the transition to m=0 is the only one allowed when the energy levels are considered? \n\nWait, but the energy levels for hydrogen depend on n, so going from n=3 to n=2 and then to n=1 is allowed in terms of energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the first transition can't go from n=3 to n=2 with l=1 because of some other reason. Wait, but the selection rules allow that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the transition from n=3 to n=1 directly is forbidden (since \u0394n can be any), but via two steps it's allowed. But that's not the issue here.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the first transition in options A, B, C all go to n=2. Let me think about the possible intermediate states. For example, from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0: the \u0394n is -1. The second step from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0: \u0394n is -1 again. \n\nBut is there another possible intermediate state? For instance, could the first transition go to n=4? Well, but that would require the second transition to go from n=4 to n=1, which might not be allowed. But since the options don't include those, maybe the question is restricting to n=2 as the intermediate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are given as 1/3, 1/4, etc., and we need to figure out which is correct. \n\nWait, maybe the total probability is the sum over all possible paths. The three possible paths (A, B, C) each have a certain probability, so the total probability would be the sum. However, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\", so maybe they are asking for the individual path's probability, not the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the m=0 transition has a different probability than the others. For instance, the matrix element when m changes by zero might be different. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose in the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. The m stays 0. The dipole operator's component that doesn't change m would be the z-component (since the dipole operator in the z-direction would not change m). The matrix element for this would involve the integral of Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0}, which might be non-zero. Whereas transitions where m changes by \u00b11 would involve the x or y components, which might have different probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, the transition probabilities might be proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For example, when going from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 | 1 0; 0 0\u27e9? Wait, maybe I need to think of the angular part as a combination. \n\nWait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The final state after first transition is l'=1, m'=0. The dipole transition requires that the angular momentum of the photon (which is 1) couples with the initial angular momentum (0) to give the final angular momentum (1). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this would be \u27e80 0 | 1 0\u27e9 ? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. \n\nThe matrix element for the dipole transition between the two states is proportional to:\n\n\u27e82,1,0 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 ~ \u27e81 0 | 0 0 \u27e9 * something. \n\nWait, according to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the reduced matrix element \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 depends on the radial part, and the angular factor is \u27e8 l', m' | 1 0 | l, m \u27e9. Wait, the angular part is a 3j symbol. \n\nThe angular part for the transition l to l' with m to m' is given by:\n\n\u27e8 l' m' | r | l m \u27e9 = sqrt( (4\u03c0)/(2l+1) ) * (something) * 3j symbol or something. \n\nAlternatively, the angular part of the matrix element can be written using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The exact form is a bit complex, but perhaps for the case where l=0 and l'=1, m'=0, and m=0, the angular factor would involve a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 with the photon's l=1 to get l'=1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M \u27e9. Here, the photon's angular momentum is 1, so l1=1, m1=0 (since the dipole operator is in the z-direction?), and the initial state has l2=0, m2=0. The final state has L=l'=1 and M=m'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe value of this coefficient can be calculated. The formula for CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=0, L=1, M=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is sqrt( ( (L+1 - l1 - l2)(L + l1 + l2 +1) ) / ( (2L+1)(2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, since l2=0, the CG coefficient simplifies. \n\nThe CG coefficient for combining l1=1, l2=0 to get L=1, M=0 would be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*0+1) )) )? Wait, maybe better to recall that when l2=0, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2L+1)/(2l1+1) ) ) * delta_{L,l1} delta_{M, m1 + m2}. \n\nWait, in this case, l2=0, so m2=0. So M = m1 + 0 = m1. We need M=0, so m1 must be 0. \n\nThus, the CG coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*0 +1) )) )? Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\n\u27e8 l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M \u27e9 = \u03b4_{M, m1+m2} * sqrt( (2L+1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) * C, where C is some other factor. \n\nAlternatively, for l2=0, the CG coefficient becomes:\n\n\u27e8 l1 m1; 0 0 | l1 m1 \u27e9 = sqrt( (2l1 +1)/ ( (2l1+1)(2*0 +1) )) ) ) * delta_{m1 +0, M} \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. When you add angular momentum l1 and l2=0, the result is just l1, and the coefficients are delta_{m1, M} times sqrt( (2l1+1)/( (2l1+1)(2*0+1) )) ), so sqrt(1/(2*0+1)) = 1. Wait, maybe it's 1. \n\nWait, maybe in this case, the CG coefficient is 1. Let me think of specific values. \n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9 is 1. Because when you combine l1=1, m1=0 and l2=0, m2=0, you get L=1, M=0. Since l2=0 has only that state. \n\nTherefore, the angular part of the matrix element for this transition (m=0 to m'=0) is proportional to 1. \n\nNow, for the case where the first transition is to m'=1. Then the CG coefficient would be \u27e81 1; 0 0 | 1 1\u27e9, which would also be 1? Wait, but then M= m1 + m2 = 1+0=1. So yes, that would be 1. \n\nWait, but in this case, the photon's angular momentum must contribute to the m change. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nThe dipole transition involves an operator with angular momentum 1 (the photon's angular momentum), so the matrix element's angular part must conserve angular momentum. The initial state has l=0, m=0. The final state has l'=1, m'=m + m_photon. The photon's angular momentum m_photon can be -1,0,+1. \n\nTherefore, to get m'=0, the photon must have m_photon = 0 (so m'=0 = 0 +0). To get m'=1, the photon must have m_photon=+1 (since m'=0 +1=1). To get m'=-1, the photon has m_photon=-1. \n\nThe probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which includes the square of the CG coefficient for the photon's m_photon. \n\nWait, perhaps the photon's contribution (the dipole operator's angular part) requires that the photon's m_photon is such that m_photon = m' - m. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element squared would have a factor of |\u27e8 photon m_photon | ... | initial state \u27e9 |^2. \n\nBut the dipole operator's angular part is a vector, so the matrix element for each m_photon (i.e., the x, y, z components) contribute. The total probability would be the sum over all photon polarizations. Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the maximum probability path or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the selection rules only require that m_photon = m' - m, so each transition with a different m' corresponds to a different m_photon. The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the angular factor. \n\nFor example, when going from m=0 to m'=0, the photon's m_photon must be 0. The probability for that component (the z-component of the dipole operator) might have a certain value. The transition to m'=1 requires the photon to have m_photon=+1 (the +1 component of the dipole), and similarly for m'=-1.\n\nThe probabilities for each of these would depend on the square of the respective dipole components. For a spherically symmetric atom, the probabilities for the different m_photon components should be equal, except when the initial or final states have specific symmetries. \n\nIn this case, the initial state is spherically symmetric (since l=0), so the dipole transition probabilities should be the same for each m_photon component. Therefore, the probabilities for each of the three possible m transitions (m'=0,1,-1) would be equal. \n\nTherefore, if there are three possible paths (A,B,C) each with equal probabilities, then the total probability would be the sum of their individual probabilities. However, the question is asking for the probability of a specific path, not the total. \n\nWait, but the options give different probabilities. For example, option A has 1/3, option B and C have 1/4, and D has 2/3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the total probability is the sum of all three paths (A,B,C), each contributing 1/3, so total 1, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relative probability between the paths. If each path has equal probability, then each would have probability 1/3. But why?\n\nWait, considering that there are three possible paths (m'=0,1,-1), and each is equally likely, then each has a probability of 1/3. Therefore option A would be correct because it's one of the three paths, each with 1/3 probability. Alternatively, maybe the probability given in the options refers to the total probability for all paths, but the question says \"the corresponding probability\", so perhaps the question is expecting that the correct path (the one with m=0) has probability 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition from n=3 to n=2 has a certain probability, and the second transition from n=2 to n=1 has another. So the total probability is the product. But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps the question is using a standard result where the probability for the path with m=0 is 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A because the m must stay 0. But why?\n\nWait another thought: the question says \"two dipole transitions\". Each transition must be a dipole transition. The first step from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 is allowed. The second step from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 is allowed. \n\nThe other options B and C involve transitions where the intermediate state has m=\u00b11. For the second transition from m=1 to m=0, the \u0394m is -1, which is allowed. \n\nBut maybe the question is considering that the photon emitted in the first transition has a certain m_photon value, and the second transition also must have the photon's m_photon such that the total change in angular momentum is conserved. \n\nWait, but each transition is independent. The total angular momentum of the two photons must add up to the total change. The initial angular momentum is 0, final is 0, so the total angular momentum carried away by the two photons must be zero. \n\nEach photon has angular momentum 1, so the two photons must have combined angular momentum that adds to 0. \n\nThe first photon has angular momentum 1, and the second also 1. The total angular momentum of the two photons must be zero. \n\nSo for the first transition: from m=0 to m'=0, the first photon has m_photon=0 (since m'=0 = m_initial + m_photon \u2192 m_photon=0). \n\nSecond transition from m'=0 to m_final=0: the second photon must also have m_photon=0. So the two photons each have m=0, so total angular momentum 0+0=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the first transition had m_photon=+1 (so m' becomes +1), then the second transition must have m_photon=-1 to get the final m=0. \n\nSimilarly, if the first photon had m_photon=-1, then the second must have +1. \n\nTherefore, the total angular momentum of the two photons would be zero in all cases. \n\nThe probability for each path would depend on the product of the probabilities for each photon's m_photon. \n\nAssuming each photon's m_photon has equal probability (since the atom is spherically symmetric), then for the path where both photons have m=0, the probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor the paths where the first photon is +1 and the second is -1, that's (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. Similarly for the other direction. \n\nBut since the two paths (B and C) can be considered together (since m'=+1 and -1 are symmetric), their combined probability would be 2*(1/9) = 2/9. \n\nWait, but the total probability over all paths would be 1/9 (for A) + 2/9 (for B and C) = 3/9 = 1/3. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the individual probabilities for each m_photon are not 1/3. Because the dipole operator's matrix elements depend on the angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, the total probability for the first transition (from n=3 to n=2) has a certain distribution among the m' values. For example, the probability of m'=0 might be different from m'=\u00b11. \n\nIn the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the possible m' are 0,1,-1. The probabilities for each m' are determined by the square of the matrix elements. \n\nAssuming the initial state is spherically symmetric, the probabilities for m'=0,1,-1 should be the same. Therefore, each has probability 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from l'=1 to l=0 with m' going to 0: the initial m can be 0,1,-1. \n\nFor example, if the intermediate state is m'=1, then the second transition must have m_photon = -1. The probability for that is 1/3 (since the photon's m_photon can be -1,0,+1, each with equal probability). \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A (m'=0 both times) is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor path B (first m'=1, then m_photon=-1): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Similarly for path C, also 1/9. \n\nWait, but then the total probability for all three paths would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. So the total probability for the two-step transition is 1/3. But the question is giving options with probabilities like 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the question is assuming that the only allowed path is the one with m'=0 in both steps, so the probability would be (probability of first transition with m'=0) multiplied by (probability of second transition with m'=0). But if each has probability 1/3, then 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are summed over the possible paths. For instance, the total probability is 1/3 (from all three paths). So the answer might be A with probability 1/3, because that's the total probability. But the options list probabilities for each path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering all possible paths but just the path where the angular momentum doesn't change in m. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A is path 3\u21922,1,0 \u21921,0,0 with probability 1/3.\n\nOption B is 3\u21922,1,1\u21921,0,0 with probability 1/4.\n\nOption C is similar to B but with -1.\n\nOption D has 2/3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is A with probability 1/3, because when you have three possible paths each with equal probability, each contributes 1/3 of the total probability. So the probability of the specific path A would be 1/3 divided by 3? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the probability of the entire transition (two steps) being the sum of all paths, so 1/3 total, but that's not listed as an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. The probability for each step. The first transition from 3\u21922 has certain probabilities, and the second step from 2\u21921 has others. \n\nThe first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 has probability proportional to some value, and similarly for the second step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the only allowed path is the one where the total angular momentum change is zero. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the transition from l=0 to l=1 must have \u0394m=0, so only the path with m'=0 is allowed. But that's not true, because the selection rules allow \u0394m of \u00b11. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another angle. \n\nThe options given for probability are 1/3, 1/4, 2/3. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is A (1/3) because when considering the possible m transitions, there are three possibilities (m'=0,1,-1), each with equal probability. So the probability for each path is 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition has three possible m' states (0,1,-1), each with probability 1/3. The second transition from each of those has a certain probability. \n\nWait, let's calculate the probability for path A:\n\nFirst transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0: probability is proportional to |\u27e82,1,0 | r |3,0,0\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nSecond transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0: |\u27e81,0,0 | r |2,1,0\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nThe total probability for this path is the product of these two squared matrix elements. \n\nSimilarly for the other paths. \n\nBut without calculating the actual matrix elements, perhaps the question is expecting that the total probability is 1/3 because there are three possible paths each with equal probability. So each path contributes 1/3 of the total probability. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the fact that when you have transitions between s states (l=0) and p states (l=1), the matrix elements for m=0 are different. \n\nWait, for the first transition from l=0 to l=1, the matrix element for m'=0 is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} over the angles, which would be proportional to the value of Y_{1,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6) multiplied by Y_{0,0}, integrated. \n\nY_{1,0} is proportional to sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8, and Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). The product would be sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8 * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * cos\u03b8. Integrating over the sphere (\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0, \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0), the integral of cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 is 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 is zero because it's an odd function over symmetric limits. Wait, hold on! \n\nWait, the integral of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0:\n\nLet me compute it. Let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. Then the integral becomes \u222b u du from u=0 to u=0 (since sin0=0 and sin\u03c0=0). Wait, that can't be. Wait, sin\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So the integral over 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/2 ] from 0 to \u03c0. Which is (0 -0)/2 =0. \n\nOh! So the matrix element for the first transition with m'=0 is zero? \n\nWait that's a problem. Because that would mean that the transition to m'=0 is forbidden? But the selection rules allowed \u0394m=0. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. What's going on here. \n\nWait, the integral for the matrix element \u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 (assuming the dipole operator is along the z-axis) would involve the product of Y_{1,0} (for l'=1, m'=0) with the z-component of r. \n\nThe z-component of r is r cos\u03b8, so when multiplied by Y_{0,0}, which is spherically symmetric, the integral over angles would be the integral of Y_{1,0} multiplied by cos\u03b8. \n\nWait, the Y_{1,0} is proportional to cos\u03b8, so Y_{1,0} * cos\u03b8 would be proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nWait, let me re-express this properly. \n\nThe dipole operator in the z-direction is r_z = r cos\u03b8. The matrix element is:\n\n\u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 = \u222b Y_{1,0}* (\u03b8,\u03c6) r_z Y_{0,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6) R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r\u00b2 dr d\u03a9 \n\nThe radial part involves integrals over r which we can ignore for the angular part. The angular part is:\n\n\u222b [Y_{1,0}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6)] [r cos\u03b8] [Y_{0,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6)] d\u03a9 \n\nThe radial part and the R functions are multiplied, but the angular part is the integral of Y_{1,0}* cos\u03b8 Y_{0,0} over the angles. \n\nY_{1,0} is proportional to cos\u03b8, so Y_{1,0}* is also proportional to cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore the angular integral becomes proportional to \u222b cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * Y_{0,0} * Y_{0,0} d\u03a9 \n\nWait Y_{0,0} is a constant (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), so squared terms:\n\nWait let's write it out:\n\nY_{1,0} = sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 \n\nY_{0,0} = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)\n\nSo the angular integral becomes:\n\n\u222b [sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8]^* * cos\u03b8 * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] d\u03a9 \n\nSince everything is real here, the * is redundant. \n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * \u222b cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 gives 2\u03c0. The integral over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nLet me compute that integral:\n\nLet u = cos\u03b8 \u2192 du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1. \n\nThe integral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u^3 /3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait let's compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, constants:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3) / (4\u03c0) \n\nThen multiply by 2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) and 2/3 (from \u03b8 integral):\n\nTotal angular factor: sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, giving sqrt(3)/4 * 2 * 2/3 = sqrt(3)* (4)/(4*3) )? Let me recalculate:\n\nWait sqrt(3)/ (4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nThe \u03c0 terms cancel, leaving sqrt(3)/4 * 2 * (2/3) \n\n= sqrt(3)/4 * 4/3 \n\n= sqrt(3)/3 \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element \u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 is proportional to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nNow, the squared magnitude would be (3/9) = 1/3. \n\nSo the probability for the first transition (to m'=0) is proportional to 1/3. \n\nNow, the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Let's compute its angular part. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e81,0,0 | r_z |2,1,0\u27e9 \n\nSimilar to before, the angular part is:\n\nY_{0,0}^* (1,0,0) times r_z times Y_{1,0}(2,1,0) \n\nWait, the angular integral would be similar:\n\n\u222b Y_{0,0}^* (Y_{1,0} * cos\u03b8 ) d\u03a9 \n\nWait, the operator is r_z again. \n\nThe Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). The Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the angular integral is:\n\n\u222b [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * cos\u03b8 * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\n= sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * \u222b cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 is 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 is the same as before (2/3). \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWhich is the same as before, sqrt(3)/3. \n\nThus, the squared magnitude for this matrix element is also 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nNow, let's compute the probability for path B: first transition to m'=1. \n\nFirst transition: 3,0,0 \u21922,1,1. \n\nThe dipole operator's angular part here would involve the m change of +1. \n\nAssuming the dipole operator has a component that changes m by +1. Let's assume the dipole operator's x or y component. \n\nBut to compute the matrix element, we can consider the general case. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r |3,0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part involves Y_{1,1} and Y_{0,0}. \n\nThe dipole operator's component that changes m by +1 would be r_+ or something. \n\nBut let's compute it similarly. \n\nThe matrix element for the transition from m=0 to m'=1 requires that the dipole operator has a component that increases m by +1. \n\nThe angular part of this matrix element would involve the integral of Y_{1,1}^* * (r_x + i r_y) * Y_{0,0} over the angles. \n\nBut to simplify, let's compute the angular part for the x component. \n\nAlternatively, using spherical harmonics, the matrix element can be expressed using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r_x |3,0,0\u27e9 would involve the angular part: \n\n\u27e81 1 | 0 0 \u27e9 where the dipole operator has l=1, m=1? \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular part as follows: \n\nThe transition from l=0 to l'=1 with \u0394m=+1 requires the dipole operator to have m_photon=+1. \n\nThe angular part is then proportional to \u27e81 1 | 1 1; 0 0 \u27e9, which is a CG coefficient. \n\nWait, the CG coefficient for combining l1=1 (photon) with l2=0 to get L=1, M=1 is \u27e81 1; 0 0 |1 1\u27e9. \n\nThis CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1+1)(2*0+1) )) ) * delta_{1+0,1} ? \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler: the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nTherefore, the angular part would have a value of 1, so the squared matrix element would be 1. \n\nWait, but I need to compute it properly. \n\nAlternatively, the integral for the matrix element \u27e81,1 | r_+ |0,0\u27e9, where r_+ is the raising operator for r. \n\nThe angular part would involve Y_{1,1} * r_+ Y_{0,0}. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r_x + i r_y |3,0,0\u27e9 (for the +1 component) would have an angular part. \n\nThe angular integral would be \u222b Y_{1,1}^* (r_x + i r_y) Y_{0,0} d\u03a9. \n\nExpressing r_x and r_y in terms of spherical harmonics. \n\nThe operator r_x + i r_y is proportional to the spherical component r_{+1}. \n\nThe matrix element would then involve the integral of Y_{1,1}^* r_{+1} Y_{0,0} d\u03a9. \n\nThe radial part can be ignored for now. \n\nThe operator r_{+1} is proportional to the raising operator, which when acting on Y_{0,0} would give a multiple of Y_{1,1}. \n\nSpecifically, the operator r_{+1} acting on Y_{0,0} would give a term proportional to Y_{1,1}, because the angular momentum increases by 1. \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes proportional to the integral of Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,1} d\u03a9, which is 1. \n\nThus, the angular part is non-zero and the squared magnitude would be 1 (up to normalization factors). \n\nTherefore, the matrix element squared for this transition would be proportional to 1. \n\nSimilarly, the second transition from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0 requires a \u0394m of -1. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e81,0,0 | r_- |2,1,1\u27e9 (where r_- is the lowering operator) would also have an angular part of 1. \n\nTherefore, the squared matrix elements for both steps are 1 (assuming proper normalization), leading to a total probability of 1 * 1 = 1. \n\nWait, but that can't be right, because then the path B would have a higher probability than path A. \n\nHmm, there must be a mistake here. Earlier, for path A, the angular parts were each proportional to sqrt(3)/3, leading to a probability of 1/9. For path B, if the angular parts are 1, then their product would be 1, but that can't be because the probabilities can't exceed 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the normalization constants are different. \n\nWait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem says that the matrix element is proportional to the reduced matrix element multiplied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. \n\nFor the first transition in path A (m'=0), the angular part was sqrt(3)/3, leading to 1/3 when squared. \n\nFor path B (m'=1), the angular part's square might be 2/3 or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the squared angular parts for the m'=\u00b11 transitions are higher than for m'=0. \n\nWait, let me think of the probabilities for the first transition. \n\nThe total probability for all possible m' in the first transition must sum to 1 (if we consider only the angular parts). \n\nFor path A's first transition, the squared angular part was 1/3. For the other two paths (B and C), the squared angular parts would also sum to 2/3 (since total is 1). \n\nTherefore, each of the m'=\u00b11 transitions would have a squared angular probability of (2/3)/2 = 1/3 each. \n\nWait, if the total angular probability for the first transition is 1, then the three paths contribute 1/3 each. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from l'=1 to l=0, the probabilities for each m would also be 1/3 each. \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A (both steps with m'=0) would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor path B, the first transition is 1/3, the second transition (from m'=1 to m=0) would also be 1/3. So total 1/9. \n\nSame for path C. \n\nThus, all three paths have equal probabilities of 1/9 each, totaling 1/3 for all paths combined. \n\nTherefore, the probability for the entire two-step transition is 1/3. \n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of a specific path. The options give probabilities of 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is referring to the probability of the entire process, not a particular path. But the options include paths and their probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the first transition has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three m' states), and then the second transition also has 1/3, so the total is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities given in the options are for the total transition (both steps), not per path. \n\nIf the total probability is 1/3 (sum of all paths), then the question might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A with probability 1/3 because that's the total probability. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the paths are equally probable. \n\nWait another thought: the matrix element for the first transition to m'=0 had a squared value of 1/3, and similarly for the second transition. So the product is 1/9. But for paths B and C, the first transition's squared matrix element would be 1/3 (since total is 1 for all m'), and similarly the second transition's matrix element squared would also be 1/3. Thus each path has probability 1/9, and the total is 3/9=1/3. \n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. So each path has probability 1/9, but the options give probabilities like 1/3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach might be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total probability for all paths is 1/3, so the answer is A with probability 1/3 because it's one of the paths, but the question is phrased ambiguously. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the probability of the transition via any of the paths, so the total probability is 1/3, which matches option A's probability. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A gives the path and probability 1/3. \n\nOption B gives another path with 1/4. \n\nIf the total probability of all paths is 1/3, then the probability for any single path (like A) is 1/3 divided by the number of paths (3), which would be 1/9, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different normalization. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition has a probability of 1/2 for m'=0 and 1/4 for the other two, but that would be arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where the correct answer is A, with the probability being 1/3, which is the total probability. \n\nGiven that the options include A with 1/3, and the other options have different probabilities, I'll lean towards option A being correct. \n\nAnother angle: The problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions. The path A is possible, and the probability is 1/3. The other paths also exist, but the question is asking for one of them, and A is a valid path with the given probability. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state in a hydrogen atom via two dipole transitions must satisfy the selection rules: \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = -1, 0, or +1. \n\n1. **First Transition**: From |3,0,0\u27e9, the intermediate state must have l = 1 (since \u0394l = \u00b11 from l = 0). Possible m values are 0, 1, or -1. \n2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state (with l = 1), the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 requires \u0394l = -1 (l = 1 \u2192 0) and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. \n\nAll paths A, B, and C are allowed. However, the probability of each path depends on the angular matrix elements. The probability for the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 (Option A) is calculated by considering the squared matrix elements. The angular part of the matrix elements for transitions with m = 0 (\u0394m = 0) involves integrals of spherical harmonics, which yield probabilities proportional to 1/3 for each step. The product of these probabilities gives (1/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 1/9 for this specific path. However, since the question might be referring to the total probability summed over all paths (A, B, C), the total probability is 1/3 (each path contributes equally). The question explicitly asks for a specific path and its probability. Among the options, **A** correctly lists the path and the probability of 1/3, likely representing the total probability of all valid paths. \n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom's quantum states and their transitions. Let me try to work through this step by step. The question is about the decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. The options give different paths and probabilities, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules apply. The main ones are that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l (delta l) must be \u00b11, and the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any value, but in dipole transitions, it's usually n changes by 1 or more, but maybe here the path is via two steps.\n\nWait, the problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, and it must go through an intermediate state before reaching |1,0,0\u27e9. So the path is two steps: 3 \u2192 intermediate \u2192 1. Each step must be allowed by the dipole selection rules.\n\nLet me recall the selection rules again. For electric dipole transitions, the allowed transitions are:\n\n\u0394l = \u00b11 (so the orbital angular momentum must change by exactly 1 in either direction). So, for example, from l=0, you can only go to l=1 or l=-1, but since l is non-negative, only l=1. \n\nSimilarly, for the magnetic quantum number m, \u0394m can be 0, +1, or -1. So the m has to stay the same or change by 1.\n\nAlso, the principal quantum number n can change by any value, but in dipole transitions, the most common is \u0394n can be any, but each step must satisfy the l and m rules.\n\nSo starting from |3,0,0\u27e9, the first transition must go to a state with l=1 (since \u0394l must be \u00b11, and original l is 0). The m can be 0 \u00b11, so m can be -1, 0, or +1. But the intermediate state must then be able to transition down to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 in the second step.\n\nWait, the intermediate state after the first transition must then go to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 in the second transition. Let me think. Let's denote the first transition as |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |n1, l1, m1\u27e9, then the second transition is |n1,l1,m1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9. Each of these must satisfy the selection rules.\n\nSo let's look at possible paths. The first step from 3,0,0 must have l changing to 1. So l1 must be 1. The m can be 0, \u00b11? Wait, original m is 0, so m1 can be 0+1=1, 0-1=-1, or stay 0? Wait no, the m can only change by 0, +1, or -1. Wait, for dipole transitions, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So starting at m=0, m1 can be 0, 1, or -1. So possible m values are 0,1,-1. \n\nSo possible intermediate states after first transition are:\n\nEither |n1,1,0\u27e9, |n1,1,1\u27e9, or |n1,1,-1\u27e9. \n\nBut then the second transition must go to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's look at the second transition's requirements. The intermediate state must have l=1, and the final l is 0. So \u0394l must be -1 (since 1 to 0 is a decrease by 1, which is allowed). The m must change from m1 to 0. So for the second step, from l=1 to l=0, the m must change by \u0394m = 0, +1, or -1. Wait, but when l decreases, the m can also decrease or increase? Let me think again.\n\nThe selection rules for dipole transitions require that the change in m is -1, 0, or +1. So for the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9, the m must change from m1 to 0. So m_final (0) = m_initial (m1) + \u0394m, where \u0394m is -1, 0, or +1. \n\nTherefore, m1 must be either 0, 1, or -1 so that adding \u0394m gives 0. Wait, for example:\n\nIf the intermediate state has m1 = 0, then in the second transition, \u0394m can be 0 (so m stays 0). That's allowed.\n\nIf m1 was 1, then \u0394m would have to be -1 (since 1 -1 =0). That's allowed.\n\nIf m1 was -1, then \u0394m would have to be +1 (since -1 +1 =0). Also allowed.\n\nSo all three possible m1 values (0,1,-1) can lead to m=0 in the final state. \n\nNow, considering the principal quantum number. The first transition goes from n=3 to some n1, then from n1 to n=1. Each transition can have any \u0394n, but the total change is from 3 to 1. But each step must be a dipole transition. Since dipole transitions can have any \u0394n except 0, but each step must satisfy the l and m rules. \n\nThe possible n1 values in the intermediate state must be such that when you go from 3 to n1 and then to 1. Let me see possible n steps. For the first transition from n=3 to n1, and then from n1 to 1. The total \u0394n from 3 to 1 is -2. But each step can be any \u0394n as long as the other rules are met.\n\nWait, but for the first transition, the l must go from 0 to 1. So possible n1 can be any n such that 3\u2192n1 is allowed via a dipole transition (which allows any n as long as l changes by 1). Similarly for the second transition from n1 to 1. \n\nBut let's see possible paths. Since the options given have the intermediate states as n=2. For example, options A, B, C have the first step going to n=2. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921). The intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. \n\nOption B: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921), with intermediate |2,1,1\u27e9.\n\nOption C: 3\u21922 (then 2\u21921), with intermediate |2,1,-1\u27e9.\n\nOption D is similar to A but with different probability and maybe missing a bracket? Wait the D option's first arrow seems like there's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9...? The given option D says \"D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\". Wait, maybe the LaTeX was messed up. Let me check again the user's input.\n\nThe user's option D is written as: D) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}. Wait, that first part seems like a typo, maybe missing the initial ket. So probably it's a typo, and the correct path is the same as A, but the probability is different. So the options are between A, B, C, D with D's path same as A but different probability.\n\nSo, first, the possible intermediate states are all with n=2? Because the options given only have n=2 as the intermediate. Let me see: the first step from n=3 to n=2 is allowed. Then from n=2 to n=1. Let me check if those transitions are allowed.\n\nFirst step: 3\u21922. The l must change by \u00b11. Original l=0, so new l must be 1. That's okay. So the intermediate state must have l=1. The m can be 0,1,-1. So the intermediate states in the options are all l=1, m=0,1,-1. So that's okay.\n\nNow, for the second transition from n=2 to n=1. The l must go from 1 to 0, which is allowed (\u0394l = -1). The m must go from the intermediate's m to 0, as we discussed. So for example, if the intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9, then m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m=0, which is allowed. If the intermediate is |2,1,1\u27e9, then m goes from 1 to 0 (\u0394m=-1), allowed. Similarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1, which is also allowed.\n\nSo all three options A, B, C have paths that are allowed in terms of the selection rules. So why are they different? The question mentions that the transition is via two dipole transitions, so all these paths are possible. But the options also have different probabilities. The question asks which one is correct in terms of both the path and the probability. So I need to figure out which path has the correct probability.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\". So each option gives a path and a probability. We need to find the correct path with the correct probability.\n\nHmm. The probabilities would depend on the selection rules and the matrix elements. But perhaps the question is referring to the relative probabilities based on the possible transitions. Wait, but maybe there are multiple paths, and the probabilities are summed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that only certain paths are allowed. Wait, but according to the selection rules, all three paths (A, B, C) are allowed. Because each step is allowed. So why is the answer among them?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the m must remain the same in some way? Or maybe the parity?\n\nWait another thought: in hydrogen atom transitions, the parity must change. The parity of a state is (-1)^l. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, which has l=0, so parity is +1. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, also l=0, so parity +1. Wait, but dipole transitions require a change in parity. Because the dipole moment has parity -1. So the transition must have \u0394parity = -1. So the total parity change over the two transitions must be -1 for each step? Wait, each dipole transition must change parity.\n\nWait each individual dipole transition must change parity. Because the dipole operator has parity -1. Therefore, each transition must go from a state with parity P to a state with parity -P. \n\nSo for the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 (parity +1), the intermediate state must have parity -1. Since the dipole transition requires parity flips. The intermediate state has l=1, so parity (-1)^1 = -1. That's okay. Then the second transition from l=1 (parity -1) must go to l=0 (parity +1). So each step flips parity. So that's okay. So all the paths are allowed in terms of parity.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't eliminate any options. \n\nNow, the probabilities. The question states that the probability is given as 1/3, 1/4, etc. The options give different probabilities. So which one is correct?\n\nPerhaps the probability is calculated based on the number of possible paths. Wait, but the question specifies \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". So maybe each path has a certain probability, but the question is asking for the correct path (i.e., which path is possible, but perhaps only one of them actually can occur? Wait no, all three paths are possible in terms of selection rules. So maybe the question is considering that the m must stay the same? Like in the first transition, m remains 0? Let me think.\n\nWait, the question says the decay happens via two dipole transitions. The path must be a possible route. However, maybe the m must remain the same? Let me think again about the m transitions.\n\nWait, the first transition from m=0 to m1 can be 0,1,-1. The second transition must then have m1 go to 0. So for example, if the first transition goes to m=0, then the second transition can stay at m=0. If the first transition goes to m=1, the second must drop to m=0 (\u0394m=-1). Similarly for m=-1, \u0394m=+1. All those are allowed.\n\nSo all three paths (A,B,C) are allowed. But the probabilities would depend on the matrix elements. The problem might be referring to the relative probabilities based on the m values. Since the matrix elements for dipole transitions depend on the angular momentum components. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of possible paths. Since m can be 0,1,-1, there are three possible paths (the three options A,B,C). But the question says \"the transition route\", implying that perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are (use latex)\". The options list a specific path and a probability. So perhaps the answer is that the correct path is A (since the m stays 0?), but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first transition, the most probable path is when the m doesn't change, so m=0. But how does that affect the probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the total probability for the two-step transition. The total probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each transition. But the options give specific paths, so perhaps the question is expecting that the path with m=0 in the intermediate state has a different probability than the ones with m=\u00b11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in the first transition, the possible m values have different probabilities. For example, the transition from m=0 to m=0 might have a different probability than m=0 to m=1 or -1. But without calculating the exact matrix elements, perhaps the question refers to the fact that the m=0 path is allowed but the others are not? Wait, no, the selection rules allow all three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the total angular momentum change must be zero? Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. The question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\". The options give a path and a probability. Since all three paths (A,B,C) are possible, but the probabilities may depend on the specific path. For example, the probability for each path could be different, and the question might be asking which one is the correct combination. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using some formula for the transition probabilities. Let me recall that the probability for a dipole transition between states |i\u27e9 and |f\u27e9 is proportional to the square of the matrix element \u27e8f | r | i\u27e9. The matrix element can be calculated using angular momentum coupling rules. For hydrogen, the radial integrals depend on the principal quantum numbers, but the angular part is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for dipole transitions (which involve the operator r, which has angular momentum 1) requires that the transition between states with angular momentum l_i and l_f must satisfy l_f = l_i \u00b11, which we already know. The matrix element also depends on the m values. Specifically, the matrix element \u27e8n',l',m'| r |n,l,m\u27e9 is proportional to \u03b4_{m' - m, 0 \u00b11} (i.e., the m's must differ by 0, +1, or -1). The exact value also depends on the specific m's. \n\nThe probability for each step would then depend on the square of the angular part. For the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m1, the angular part can be calculated. Let's see:\n\nFor the first transition (3,0,0) \u2192 (2,1,m1):\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element \u27e82,1,m1 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the coupling of the angular momentum. \n\nWait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem states that the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n',l',m' | T^{(k)} |n,l,m\u27e9 = \\frac{\\langle l' || T^{(k)} || l \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2l+1}} \\langle l',m' | (Y^{(k)}_{m''}) | l,m \\rangle \n\nWhere T^{(k)} is a tensor operator of rank k. For the dipole transition, the operator is the position vector r, which is a rank 1 tensor. So k=1.\n\nThe reduced matrix element \u27e8l' || T^{(1)} || l \u27e9 depends on the radial parts and the quantum numbers, but the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l', m' | 1, m'' | l, m \u27e9 where m'' is such that m' = m + m''. Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart formula for the dipole moment.\n\nAlternatively, the angular part of the matrix element for the dipole transition between l and l' is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0; l m | l' m'\u27e9 multiplied by some factors. Wait, maybe the exact expression is:\n\nThe matrix element \u27e8n',l',m'| r |n,l,m\u27e9 is proportional to \u03b4_{m' - m, -1,0,1} and the angular part is given by \n\n\u27e8 l',m' | \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\epsilon} | l,m \u27e9 \n\nwhere \u03b5 is the polarization vector. Assuming the dipole transition is along the z-axis (so \u03b5 is along z), then the operator would involve the z-component of the dipole moment. But perhaps more accurately, the dipole operator has components in different directions. \n\nAlternatively, the matrix element for the dipole transition can be written using the spherical harmonics. The dipole operator r has components in terms of the spherical harmonics. The transition amplitude will involve integrals over the angular parts, which can be evaluated using the properties of spherical harmonics.\n\nThe integral over the angles for the transition from l, m to l', m' would involve the integral of Y_{l'm'}* Y_{1q} Y_{lm}, where q is the component (the dipole operator has a vector component, so q can be -1,0,1). \n\nThe integral of Y_{l'm'} Y_{1q} Y_{lm} over the sphere is proportional to the product of three Wigner 3j symbols or something similar. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the selection rules for m are that the total m must be conserved (since the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, but maybe the m changes by 0, \u00b11). Wait, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so when you act with it on the initial state |l m\u27e9, it can change the angular momentum by \u00b11 or 0? Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as the dipole operator is a vector operator, so the matrix element is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m + q, where q is the projection of the dipole operator's angular momentum. \n\nWait, the dipole operator r is a vector operator, so its components transform as angular momentum 1. So the matrix element \u27e8l',m'| r |l,m\u27e9 is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m + m1, where m1 is the projection of the dipole's angular momentum. Since the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, m1 can be -1,0,1. Therefore, m' can be m \u00b11 or m. \n\nWait, so for the dipole transition, the change in m can be -1, 0, or +1, which aligns with the selection rules.\n\nNow, the actual probability (the square of the matrix element) depends on the specific m's. For example, the transition from m=0 to m'=0 would involve the component of the dipole operator that doesn't change m (q=0), while transitions to m'=\u00b11 would involve q=\u00b11. The probabilities can vary depending on the m's.\n\nHowever, without calculating the exact values, perhaps there is a standard result here. In the case of transitions where m remains the same, like from m=0 to m=0, the probability might be different than when it changes. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities for the different m transitions can be summed over, but the question specifies a particular path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the total probability for all possible paths (A, B, C) is given, but that doesn't fit the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is the one with m=0 because the transition to m=0 is the only one allowed when the energy levels are considered? \n\nWait, but the energy levels for hydrogen depend on n, so going from n=3 to n=2 and then to n=1 is allowed in terms of energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the first transition can't go from n=3 to n=2 with l=1 because of some other reason. Wait, but the selection rules allow that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the transition from n=3 to n=1 directly is forbidden (since \u0394n can be any), but via two steps it's allowed. But that's not the issue here.\n\nWait, looking at the options, the first transition in options A, B, C all go to n=2. Let me think about the possible intermediate states. For example, from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0: the \u0394n is -1. The second step from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0: \u0394n is -1 again. \n\nBut is there another possible intermediate state? For instance, could the first transition go to n=4? Well, but that would require the second transition to go from n=4 to n=1, which might not be allowed. But since the options don't include those, maybe the question is restricting to n=2 as the intermediate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are given as 1/3, 1/4, etc., and we need to figure out which is correct. \n\nWait, maybe the total probability is the sum over all possible paths. The three possible paths (A, B, C) each have a certain probability, so the total probability would be the sum. However, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability are\", so maybe they are asking for the individual path's probability, not the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the m=0 transition has a different probability than the others. For instance, the matrix element when m changes by zero might be different. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose in the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. The m stays 0. The dipole operator's component that doesn't change m would be the z-component (since the dipole operator in the z-direction would not change m). The matrix element for this would involve the integral of Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0}, which might be non-zero. Whereas transitions where m changes by \u00b11 would involve the x or y components, which might have different probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, the transition probabilities might be proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For example, when going from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 | 1 0; 0 0\u27e9? Wait, maybe I need to think of the angular part as a combination. \n\nWait, the initial state is l=0, m=0. The final state after first transition is l'=1, m'=0. The dipole transition requires that the angular momentum of the photon (which is 1) couples with the initial angular momentum (0) to give the final angular momentum (1). The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this would be \u27e80 0 | 1 0\u27e9 ? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. \n\nThe matrix element for the dipole transition between the two states is proportional to:\n\n\u27e82,1,0 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 ~ \u27e81 0 | 0 0 \u27e9 * something. \n\nWait, according to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the reduced matrix element \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 depends on the radial part, and the angular factor is \u27e8 l', m' | 1 0 | l, m \u27e9. Wait, the angular part is a 3j symbol. \n\nThe angular part for the transition l to l' with m to m' is given by:\n\n\u27e8 l' m' | r | l m \u27e9 = sqrt( (4\u03c0)/(2l+1) ) * (something) * 3j symbol or something. \n\nAlternatively, the angular part of the matrix element can be written using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The exact form is a bit complex, but perhaps for the case where l=0 and l'=1, m'=0, and m=0, the angular factor would involve a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 with the photon's l=1 to get l'=1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M \u27e9. Here, the photon's angular momentum is 1, so l1=1, m1=0 (since the dipole operator is in the z-direction?), and the initial state has l2=0, m2=0. The final state has L=l'=1 and M=m'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe value of this coefficient can be calculated. The formula for CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=0, L=1, M=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is sqrt( ( (L+1 - l1 - l2)(L + l1 + l2 +1) ) / ( (2L+1)(2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, since l2=0, the CG coefficient simplifies. \n\nThe CG coefficient for combining l1=1, l2=0 to get L=1, M=0 would be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*0+1) )) )? Wait, maybe better to recall that when l2=0, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2L+1)/(2l1+1) ) ) * delta_{L,l1} delta_{M, m1 + m2}. \n\nWait, in this case, l2=0, so m2=0. So M = m1 + 0 = m1. We need M=0, so m1 must be 0. \n\nThus, the CG coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*0 +1) )) )? Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\n\u27e8 l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M \u27e9 = \u03b4_{M, m1+m2} * sqrt( (2L+1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1) )) ) * C, where C is some other factor. \n\nAlternatively, for l2=0, the CG coefficient becomes:\n\n\u27e8 l1 m1; 0 0 | l1 m1 \u27e9 = sqrt( (2l1 +1)/ ( (2l1+1)(2*0 +1) )) ) ) * delta_{m1 +0, M} \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. When you add angular momentum l1 and l2=0, the result is just l1, and the coefficients are delta_{m1, M} times sqrt( (2l1+1)/( (2l1+1)(2*0+1) )) ), so sqrt(1/(2*0+1)) = 1. Wait, maybe it's 1. \n\nWait, maybe in this case, the CG coefficient is 1. Let me think of specific values. \n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e81 0; 0 0 | 1 0\u27e9 is 1. Because when you combine l1=1, m1=0 and l2=0, m2=0, you get L=1, M=0. Since l2=0 has only that state. \n\nTherefore, the angular part of the matrix element for this transition (m=0 to m'=0) is proportional to 1. \n\nNow, for the case where the first transition is to m'=1. Then the CG coefficient would be \u27e81 1; 0 0 | 1 1\u27e9, which would also be 1? Wait, but then M= m1 + m2 = 1+0=1. So yes, that would be 1. \n\nWait, but in this case, the photon's angular momentum must contribute to the m change. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nThe dipole transition involves an operator with angular momentum 1 (the photon's angular momentum), so the matrix element's angular part must conserve angular momentum. The initial state has l=0, m=0. The final state has l'=1, m'=m + m_photon. The photon's angular momentum m_photon can be -1,0,+1. \n\nTherefore, to get m'=0, the photon must have m_photon = 0 (so m'=0 = 0 +0). To get m'=1, the photon must have m_photon=+1 (since m'=0 +1=1). To get m'=-1, the photon has m_photon=-1. \n\nThe probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which includes the square of the CG coefficient for the photon's m_photon. \n\nWait, perhaps the photon's contribution (the dipole operator's angular part) requires that the photon's m_photon is such that m_photon = m' - m. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element squared would have a factor of |\u27e8 photon m_photon | ... | initial state \u27e9 |^2. \n\nBut the dipole operator's angular part is a vector, so the matrix element for each m_photon (i.e., the x, y, z components) contribute. The total probability would be the sum over all photon polarizations. Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the maximum probability path or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the selection rules only require that m_photon = m' - m, so each transition with a different m' corresponds to a different m_photon. The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the angular factor. \n\nFor example, when going from m=0 to m'=0, the photon's m_photon must be 0. The probability for that component (the z-component of the dipole operator) might have a certain value. The transition to m'=1 requires the photon to have m_photon=+1 (the +1 component of the dipole), and similarly for m'=-1.\n\nThe probabilities for each of these would depend on the square of the respective dipole components. For a spherically symmetric atom, the probabilities for the different m_photon components should be equal, except when the initial or final states have specific symmetries. \n\nIn this case, the initial state is spherically symmetric (since l=0), so the dipole transition probabilities should be the same for each m_photon component. Therefore, the probabilities for each of the three possible m transitions (m'=0,1,-1) would be equal. \n\nTherefore, if there are three possible paths (A,B,C) each with equal probabilities, then the total probability would be the sum of their individual probabilities. However, the question is asking for the probability of a specific path, not the total. \n\nWait, but the options give different probabilities. For example, option A has 1/3, option B and C have 1/4, and D has 2/3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the total probability is the sum of all three paths (A,B,C), each contributing 1/3, so total 1, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the relative probability between the paths. If each path has equal probability, then each would have probability 1/3. But why?\n\nWait, considering that there are three possible paths (m'=0,1,-1), and each is equally likely, then each has a probability of 1/3. Therefore option A would be correct because it's one of the three paths, each with 1/3 probability. Alternatively, maybe the probability given in the options refers to the total probability for all paths, but the question says \"the corresponding probability\", so perhaps the question is expecting that the correct path (the one with m=0) has probability 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition from n=3 to n=2 has a certain probability, and the second transition from n=2 to n=1 has another. So the total probability is the product. But without knowing the exact probabilities, perhaps the question is using a standard result where the probability for the path with m=0 is 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A because the m must stay 0. But why?\n\nWait another thought: the question says \"two dipole transitions\". Each transition must be a dipole transition. The first step from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 is allowed. The second step from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 is allowed. \n\nThe other options B and C involve transitions where the intermediate state has m=\u00b11. For the second transition from m=1 to m=0, the \u0394m is -1, which is allowed. \n\nBut maybe the question is considering that the photon emitted in the first transition has a certain m_photon value, and the second transition also must have the photon's m_photon such that the total change in angular momentum is conserved. \n\nWait, but each transition is independent. The total angular momentum of the two photons must add up to the total change. The initial angular momentum is 0, final is 0, so the total angular momentum carried away by the two photons must be zero. \n\nEach photon has angular momentum 1, so the two photons must have combined angular momentum that adds to 0. \n\nThe first photon has angular momentum 1, and the second also 1. The total angular momentum of the two photons must be zero. \n\nSo for the first transition: from m=0 to m'=0, the first photon has m_photon=0 (since m'=0 = m_initial + m_photon \u2192 m_photon=0). \n\nSecond transition from m'=0 to m_final=0: the second photon must also have m_photon=0. So the two photons each have m=0, so total angular momentum 0+0=0. \n\nAlternatively, if the first transition had m_photon=+1 (so m' becomes +1), then the second transition must have m_photon=-1 to get the final m=0. \n\nSimilarly, if the first photon had m_photon=-1, then the second must have +1. \n\nTherefore, the total angular momentum of the two photons would be zero in all cases. \n\nThe probability for each path would depend on the product of the probabilities for each photon's m_photon. \n\nAssuming each photon's m_photon has equal probability (since the atom is spherically symmetric), then for the path where both photons have m=0, the probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor the paths where the first photon is +1 and the second is -1, that's (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. Similarly for the other direction. \n\nBut since the two paths (B and C) can be considered together (since m'=+1 and -1 are symmetric), their combined probability would be 2*(1/9) = 2/9. \n\nWait, but the total probability over all paths would be 1/9 (for A) + 2/9 (for B and C) = 3/9 = 1/3. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the individual probabilities for each m_photon are not 1/3. Because the dipole operator's matrix elements depend on the angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, the total probability for the first transition (from n=3 to n=2) has a certain distribution among the m' values. For example, the probability of m'=0 might be different from m'=\u00b11. \n\nIn the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the possible m' are 0,1,-1. The probabilities for each m' are determined by the square of the matrix elements. \n\nAssuming the initial state is spherically symmetric, the probabilities for m'=0,1,-1 should be the same. Therefore, each has probability 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from l'=1 to l=0 with m' going to 0: the initial m can be 0,1,-1. \n\nFor example, if the intermediate state is m'=1, then the second transition must have m_photon = -1. The probability for that is 1/3 (since the photon's m_photon can be -1,0,+1, each with equal probability). \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A (m'=0 both times) is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor path B (first m'=1, then m_photon=-1): (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Similarly for path C, also 1/9. \n\nWait, but then the total probability for all three paths would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. So the total probability for the two-step transition is 1/3. But the question is giving options with probabilities like 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the question is assuming that the only allowed path is the one with m'=0 in both steps, so the probability would be (probability of first transition with m'=0) multiplied by (probability of second transition with m'=0). But if each has probability 1/3, then 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the probabilities are summed over the possible paths. For instance, the total probability is 1/3 (from all three paths). So the answer might be A with probability 1/3, because that's the total probability. But the options list probabilities for each path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering all possible paths but just the path where the angular momentum doesn't change in m. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A is path 3\u21922,1,0 \u21921,0,0 with probability 1/3.\n\nOption B is 3\u21922,1,1\u21921,0,0 with probability 1/4.\n\nOption C is similar to B but with -1.\n\nOption D has 2/3.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is A with probability 1/3, because when you have three possible paths each with equal probability, each contributes 1/3 of the total probability. So the probability of the specific path A would be 1/3 divided by 3? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the probability of the entire transition (two steps) being the sum of all paths, so 1/3 total, but that's not listed as an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. The probability for each step. The first transition from 3\u21922 has certain probabilities, and the second step from 2\u21921 has others. \n\nThe first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0 has probability proportional to some value, and similarly for the second step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the only allowed path is the one where the total angular momentum change is zero. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the transition from l=0 to l=1 must have \u0394m=0, so only the path with m'=0 is allowed. But that's not true, because the selection rules allow \u0394m of \u00b11. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another angle. \n\nThe options given for probability are 1/3, 1/4, 2/3. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is A (1/3) because when considering the possible m transitions, there are three possibilities (m'=0,1,-1), each with equal probability. So the probability for each path is 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition has three possible m' states (0,1,-1), each with probability 1/3. The second transition from each of those has a certain probability. \n\nWait, let's calculate the probability for path A:\n\nFirst transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0: probability is proportional to |\u27e82,1,0 | r |3,0,0\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nSecond transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0: |\u27e81,0,0 | r |2,1,0\u27e9|\u00b2. \n\nThe total probability for this path is the product of these two squared matrix elements. \n\nSimilarly for the other paths. \n\nBut without calculating the actual matrix elements, perhaps the question is expecting that the total probability is 1/3 because there are three possible paths each with equal probability. So each path contributes 1/3 of the total probability. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the fact that when you have transitions between s states (l=0) and p states (l=1), the matrix elements for m=0 are different. \n\nWait, for the first transition from l=0 to l=1, the matrix element for m'=0 is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} over the angles, which would be proportional to the value of Y_{1,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6) multiplied by Y_{0,0}, integrated. \n\nY_{1,0} is proportional to sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8, and Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). The product would be sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8 * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * cos\u03b8. Integrating over the sphere (\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0, \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0), the integral of cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 is 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 is zero because it's an odd function over symmetric limits. Wait, hold on! \n\nWait, the integral of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0:\n\nLet me compute it. Let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. Then the integral becomes \u222b u du from u=0 to u=0 (since sin0=0 and sin\u03c0=0). Wait, that can't be. Wait, sin\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So the integral over 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = [ (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/2 ] from 0 to \u03c0. Which is (0 -0)/2 =0. \n\nOh! So the matrix element for the first transition with m'=0 is zero? \n\nWait that's a problem. Because that would mean that the transition to m'=0 is forbidden? But the selection rules allowed \u0394m=0. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. What's going on here. \n\nWait, the integral for the matrix element \u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 (assuming the dipole operator is along the z-axis) would involve the product of Y_{1,0} (for l'=1, m'=0) with the z-component of r. \n\nThe z-component of r is r cos\u03b8, so when multiplied by Y_{0,0}, which is spherically symmetric, the integral over angles would be the integral of Y_{1,0} multiplied by cos\u03b8. \n\nWait, the Y_{1,0} is proportional to cos\u03b8, so Y_{1,0} * cos\u03b8 would be proportional to cos\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nWait, let me re-express this properly. \n\nThe dipole operator in the z-direction is r_z = r cos\u03b8. The matrix element is:\n\n\u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 = \u222b Y_{1,0}* (\u03b8,\u03c6) r_z Y_{0,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6) R_{2,1}(r) R_{3,0}(r) r\u00b2 dr d\u03a9 \n\nThe radial part involves integrals over r which we can ignore for the angular part. The angular part is:\n\n\u222b [Y_{1,0}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6)] [r cos\u03b8] [Y_{0,0}(\u03b8,\u03c6)] d\u03a9 \n\nThe radial part and the R functions are multiplied, but the angular part is the integral of Y_{1,0}* cos\u03b8 Y_{0,0} over the angles. \n\nY_{1,0} is proportional to cos\u03b8, so Y_{1,0}* is also proportional to cos\u03b8. \n\nTherefore the angular integral becomes proportional to \u222b cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * Y_{0,0} * Y_{0,0} d\u03a9 \n\nWait Y_{0,0} is a constant (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), so squared terms:\n\nWait let's write it out:\n\nY_{1,0} = sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 \n\nY_{0,0} = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)\n\nSo the angular integral becomes:\n\n\u222b [sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8]^* * cos\u03b8 * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] d\u03a9 \n\nSince everything is real here, the * is redundant. \n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * \u222b cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 gives 2\u03c0. The integral over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nLet me compute that integral:\n\nLet u = cos\u03b8 \u2192 du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1. \n\nThe integral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u^3 /3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait let's compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, constants:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) = sqrt(3) / (4\u03c0) \n\nThen multiply by 2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) and 2/3 (from \u03b8 integral):\n\nTotal angular factor: sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nThe \u03c0 cancels, giving sqrt(3)/4 * 2 * 2/3 = sqrt(3)* (4)/(4*3) )? Let me recalculate:\n\nWait sqrt(3)/ (4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nThe \u03c0 terms cancel, leaving sqrt(3)/4 * 2 * (2/3) \n\n= sqrt(3)/4 * 4/3 \n\n= sqrt(3)/3 \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element \u27e82,1,0 | r_z |3,0,0\u27e9 is proportional to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nNow, the squared magnitude would be (3/9) = 1/3. \n\nSo the probability for the first transition (to m'=0) is proportional to 1/3. \n\nNow, the second transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Let's compute its angular part. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e81,0,0 | r_z |2,1,0\u27e9 \n\nSimilar to before, the angular part is:\n\nY_{0,0}^* (1,0,0) times r_z times Y_{1,0}(2,1,0) \n\nWait, the angular integral would be similar:\n\n\u222b Y_{0,0}^* (Y_{1,0} * cos\u03b8 ) d\u03a9 \n\nWait, the operator is r_z again. \n\nThe Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). The Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. \n\nSo the angular integral is:\n\n\u222b [1/sqrt(4\u03c0)] * cos\u03b8 * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\n= sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * \u222b cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 is 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 is the same as before (2/3). \n\nSo the angular part is sqrt(3)/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWhich is the same as before, sqrt(3)/3. \n\nThus, the squared magnitude for this matrix element is also 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nNow, let's compute the probability for path B: first transition to m'=1. \n\nFirst transition: 3,0,0 \u21922,1,1. \n\nThe dipole operator's angular part here would involve the m change of +1. \n\nAssuming the dipole operator has a component that changes m by +1. Let's assume the dipole operator's x or y component. \n\nBut to compute the matrix element, we can consider the general case. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r |3,0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part involves Y_{1,1} and Y_{0,0}. \n\nThe dipole operator's component that changes m by +1 would be r_+ or something. \n\nBut let's compute it similarly. \n\nThe matrix element for the transition from m=0 to m'=1 requires that the dipole operator has a component that increases m by +1. \n\nThe angular part of this matrix element would involve the integral of Y_{1,1}^* * (r_x + i r_y) * Y_{0,0} over the angles. \n\nBut to simplify, let's compute the angular part for the x component. \n\nAlternatively, using spherical harmonics, the matrix element can be expressed using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r_x |3,0,0\u27e9 would involve the angular part: \n\n\u27e81 1 | 0 0 \u27e9 where the dipole operator has l=1, m=1? \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular part as follows: \n\nThe transition from l=0 to l'=1 with \u0394m=+1 requires the dipole operator to have m_photon=+1. \n\nThe angular part is then proportional to \u27e81 1 | 1 1; 0 0 \u27e9, which is a CG coefficient. \n\nWait, the CG coefficient for combining l1=1 (photon) with l2=0 to get L=1, M=1 is \u27e81 1; 0 0 |1 1\u27e9. \n\nThis CG coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*1+1)(2*0+1) )) ) * delta_{1+0,1} ? \n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler: the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nTherefore, the angular part would have a value of 1, so the squared matrix element would be 1. \n\nWait, but I need to compute it properly. \n\nAlternatively, the integral for the matrix element \u27e81,1 | r_+ |0,0\u27e9, where r_+ is the raising operator for r. \n\nThe angular part would involve Y_{1,1} * r_+ Y_{0,0}. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let's try another approach. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e82,1,1 | r_x + i r_y |3,0,0\u27e9 (for the +1 component) would have an angular part. \n\nThe angular integral would be \u222b Y_{1,1}^* (r_x + i r_y) Y_{0,0} d\u03a9. \n\nExpressing r_x and r_y in terms of spherical harmonics. \n\nThe operator r_x + i r_y is proportional to the spherical component r_{+1}. \n\nThe matrix element would then involve the integral of Y_{1,1}^* r_{+1} Y_{0,0} d\u03a9. \n\nThe radial part can be ignored for now. \n\nThe operator r_{+1} is proportional to the raising operator, which when acting on Y_{0,0} would give a multiple of Y_{1,1}. \n\nSpecifically, the operator r_{+1} acting on Y_{0,0} would give a term proportional to Y_{1,1}, because the angular momentum increases by 1. \n\nTherefore, the integral becomes proportional to the integral of Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,1} d\u03a9, which is 1. \n\nThus, the angular part is non-zero and the squared magnitude would be 1 (up to normalization factors). \n\nTherefore, the matrix element squared for this transition would be proportional to 1. \n\nSimilarly, the second transition from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0 requires a \u0394m of -1. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e81,0,0 | r_- |2,1,1\u27e9 (where r_- is the lowering operator) would also have an angular part of 1. \n\nTherefore, the squared matrix elements for both steps are 1 (assuming proper normalization), leading to a total probability of 1 * 1 = 1. \n\nWait, but that can't be right, because then the path B would have a higher probability than path A. \n\nHmm, there must be a mistake here. Earlier, for path A, the angular parts were each proportional to sqrt(3)/3, leading to a probability of 1/9. For path B, if the angular parts are 1, then their product would be 1, but that can't be because the probabilities can't exceed 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the normalization constants are different. \n\nWait, the Wigner-Eckart theorem says that the matrix element is proportional to the reduced matrix element multiplied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. \n\nFor the first transition in path A (m'=0), the angular part was sqrt(3)/3, leading to 1/3 when squared. \n\nFor path B (m'=1), the angular part's square might be 2/3 or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the squared angular parts for the m'=\u00b11 transitions are higher than for m'=0. \n\nWait, let me think of the probabilities for the first transition. \n\nThe total probability for all possible m' in the first transition must sum to 1 (if we consider only the angular parts). \n\nFor path A's first transition, the squared angular part was 1/3. For the other two paths (B and C), the squared angular parts would also sum to 2/3 (since total is 1). \n\nTherefore, each of the m'=\u00b11 transitions would have a squared angular probability of (2/3)/2 = 1/3 each. \n\nWait, if the total angular probability for the first transition is 1, then the three paths contribute 1/3 each. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from l'=1 to l=0, the probabilities for each m would also be 1/3 each. \n\nTherefore, the total probability for path A (both steps with m'=0) would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nFor path B, the first transition is 1/3, the second transition (from m'=1 to m=0) would also be 1/3. So total 1/9. \n\nSame for path C. \n\nThus, all three paths have equal probabilities of 1/9 each, totaling 1/3 for all paths combined. \n\nTherefore, the probability for the entire two-step transition is 1/3. \n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of a specific path. The options give probabilities of 1/3, 1/4, etc. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is referring to the probability of the entire process, not a particular path. But the options include paths and their probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the first transition has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three m' states), and then the second transition also has 1/3, so the total is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities given in the options are for the total transition (both steps), not per path. \n\nIf the total probability is 1/3 (sum of all paths), then the question might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A with probability 1/3 because that's the total probability. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the paths are equally probable. \n\nWait another thought: the matrix element for the first transition to m'=0 had a squared value of 1/3, and similarly for the second transition. So the product is 1/9. But for paths B and C, the first transition's squared matrix element would be 1/3 (since total is 1 for all m'), and similarly the second transition's matrix element squared would also be 1/3. Thus each path has probability 1/9, and the total is 3/9=1/3. \n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. So each path has probability 1/9, but the options give probabilities like 1/3. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach might be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total probability for all paths is 1/3, so the answer is A with probability 1/3 because it's one of the paths, but the question is phrased ambiguously. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the probability of the transition via any of the paths, so the total probability is 1/3, which matches option A's probability. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A gives the path and probability 1/3. \n\nOption B gives another path with 1/4. \n\nIf the total probability of all paths is 1/3, then the probability for any single path (like A) is 1/3 divided by the number of paths (3), which would be 1/9, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different normalization. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition has a probability of 1/2 for m'=0 and 1/4 for the other two, but that would be arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where the correct answer is A, with the probability being 1/3, which is the total probability. \n\nGiven that the options include A with 1/3, and the other options have different probabilities, I'll lean towards option A being correct. \n\nAnother angle: The problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions. The path A is possible, and the probability is 1/3. The other paths also exist, but the question is asking for one of them, and A is a valid path with the given probability. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n\nThe decay from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state in a hydrogen atom via two dipole transitions must satisfy the selection rules: \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = -1, 0, or +1. \n\n1. **First Transition**: From |3,0,0\u27e9, the intermediate state must have l = 1 (since \u0394l = \u00b11 from l = 0). Possible m values are 0, 1, or -1. \n2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state (with l = 1), the final state |1,0,0\u27e9 requires \u0394l = -1 (l = 1 \u2192 0) and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. \n\nAll paths A, B, and C are allowed. However, the probability of each path depends on the angular matrix elements. The probability for the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 (Option A) is calculated by considering the squared matrix elements. The angular part of the matrix elements for transitions with m = 0 (\u0394m = 0) involves integrals of spherical harmonics, which yield probabilities proportional to 1/3 for each step. The product of these probabilities gives (1/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 1/9 for this specific path. However, since the question might be referring to the total probability summed over all paths (A, B, C), the total probability is 1/3 (each path contributes equally). The question explicitly asks for a specific path and its probability. Among the options, **A** correctly lists the path and the probability of 1/3, likely representing the total probability of all valid paths. \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions here. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom.\n\nFirst, I remember that dipole transitions must satisfy certain selection rules. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions state that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l (\u0394l) must be \u00b11. Also, the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Since the question mentions dipole transitions, these selection rules definitely apply here.\n\nLooking at the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9, which has n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, so n=1, l=0, m=0. The transition happens in two steps. Let me think about each step.\n\nFirst, the first transition must go from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then to n=1, l=0. Let me consider the possible intermediate states. Since each transition is a dipole transition, each step must obey \u0394l = \u00b11. Starting with l=0 in the initial state, the first transition must have \u0394l = +1 or -1. But since l can't be negative, the first step from l=0 must go to l=1. So the first transition must have \u0394l = +1, so the intermediate state must have l=1. \n\nThe first transition is from |3,0,0\u27e9 to an intermediate state. The possible intermediate states would be n=2 or n=4? Wait, but since the final state is n=1, the second transition has to go down. So probably the first step goes from n=3 to n=2, then from n=2 to n=1. Because you can't jump from 3 to 1 directly in two steps if each step requires a change in n. Because each dipole transition allows \u0394n to be any value except n=0, but the selection rules for n aren't as strict as l. Wait, actually the selection rules for n are not as strict. The main selection rules are for l and m. So the first transition could go to n=2, l=1, m=0, \u00b11? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me check the possible transitions step by step. The first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 must obey \u0394l = \u00b11. Since l starts at 0, the next l must be 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1, and m can change by 0 or \u00b11. So the m can be 0, +1, or -1? Wait, the m value must change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the possible m values after the first transition can be 0, +1, or -1. But l must be 1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m values are okay. \n\nSo the first transition can go to a state with l=1 and m=0, +1, or -1. The n for the intermediate state could be 2 or 4? Hmm, but since the final state is n=1, maybe the first step is to n=2. Because going from n=3 to n=2 is a lower energy step, then from n=2 to n=1. That makes sense. So the intermediate state is likely n=2, l=1, m can be 0, \u00b11.\n\nNow the second transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's consider that. The final l is 0, so from l=1 in the intermediate state, the second transition must have \u0394l = -1, which is allowed. So that's okay. The m in the intermediate state must then change by 0 or \u00b11 to get to m=0. \n\nSo let's see each option.\n\nOption A says the path is |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3. Let's check the transitions here. \n\nFirst transition: 3,0,0 \u2192 2,1,0. The \u0394l here is +1 (from 0 to 1), which is okay. The m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m is 0, which is allowed. So that's a valid dipole transition.\n\nSecond transition: from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Here, \u0394l is -1 (from 1 to 0), allowed. The m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m is 0, which is allowed. So this path is possible. Now the probability part. The question mentions the corresponding probability, so we need to compute the probability for each path and see which matches.\n\nOption B's path is 3\u21922,1,1 then to 1,0,0. Let's check the second transition here. From 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. The \u0394m here would be 0-1 = -1, which is allowed. So that's okay. The first transition's m goes from 0 to 1, which is allowed (\u0394m=+1). So that's also a valid path. But the probability here is given as 1/4. Hmm.\n\nOption C is similar to B, but m is -1. So first transition to m=-1. Then from there, to m=0. The \u0394m would be +1, so that's allowed. So that's also a valid path. Probability is 1/4.\n\nOption D's first part is missing the starting state, but maybe that's a typo. It says |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3, but that's only one transition. The question requires two transitions, so D might not be the answer. Wait, the options are written as:\n\nLooking back at the problem's options:\n\nOption D is written as: |3\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 and 2/3. Wait, the original question's options might have a typo. The user wrote D as:\n\nD) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\n\nHmm, perhaps the first part is missing, but maybe it's supposed to be the same path as A but with a different probability. Wait, the first arrow in D starts with an incomplete ket? Maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. The user input shows:\n\n\"Options:\nA) ... \nB) ... \nC) ...\nD) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\"\n\nHmm, maybe the D option's first part is supposed to be |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192... but the LaTeX is messed up. Maybe it's a typo, but given the options, perhaps D's path is the same as A's path but with a different probability. So assuming that, the paths in A and D are the same except for the probability.\n\nNow, the question is which of these paths is correct and with the right probability.\n\nThe key is to compute the probabilities for each possible path. Since the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", so we need to find which path is allowed and has the probability given in the option.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible paths. The possible paths from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two dipole transitions would involve first going to an intermediate state with n=2 and l=1, then to n=1, l=0. The intermediate state can have m values of -1, 0, or +1. So three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, and |2,1,+1\u27e9. \n\nEach of these intermediate states can then transition to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let me think about the probabilities for each path.\n\nThe total probability would depend on the product of the probabilities for each step. However, I might need to recall the selection rules and the transition probabilities. Wait, but maybe the question is more about the allowed paths and the probabilities given, so perhaps the answer is determined by the allowed transitions and the probabilities given in the options.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering that the first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=1, m can be 0, +1, or -1. So three possibilities. Then each of those can go down to n=1, l=0, m=0. \n\nFor each of those three paths, the total probability would depend on the individual probabilities of each transition. Since the question is asking which option has the correct route and probability, let me think about each option's given probability.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A's path is 3\u21922,1,0 then to 1,0,0. The probability given is 1/3.\n\nOption B's path is 3\u21922,1,1 then to 1,0,0 with probability 1/4.\n\nOption C is similar but m=-1, also 1/4.\n\nOption D (assuming same path as A) has 2/3.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the probabilities. Let me think of the transition probabilities. \n\nThe transition probability for a dipole transition between two states is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. The matrix element involves integrals over the wavefunctions, but perhaps there's a simpler way here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the statistical weight or the number of possible paths. For example, when the first transition from 3,0,0 can go to three different m states (m=-1, 0, +1) in the intermediate l=1 state. So there are three possible paths. However, the actual probabilities might depend on the selection rules for the angular momentum transitions.\n\nWait, but in the first transition from 3,0,0 to n=2, l=1, m must change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the final m can be 0, \u00b11. So three possibilities. However, the probability of each transition may not be the same because the radial integrals could differ. But perhaps the question is considering that each possible m path has equal probability, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be referring to the total probability summed over all possible paths, but the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", so each path's probability is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the fact that for electric dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the reduced matrix element, and for certain transitions, the coefficients can be determined by symmetry or other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the parity must change. Wait, but the parity of the hydrogen atom states is (-1)^l. Since the initial state has l=0 (even parity), and the final l=0 (even parity). Wait, but dipole transitions require a change in parity, so that can't happen. Wait a minute, hold on! This might be a key point I missed.\n\nOh no! Wait, dipole transitions must change the parity. The parity of the state is (-1)^l. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, l=0 \u2192 parity +1. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, l=0 \u2192 parity +1. So the parity doesn't change. But dipole transitions require a change in parity. Therefore, a direct transition from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 is forbidden. But the question says it decays via two dipole transitions, so the intermediate step must have opposite parity.\n\nAh, right! That's a crucial point. So the intermediate state must have l=1, which has parity (-1)^1 = -1. So the first transition is from even parity (l=0) to odd parity (l=1), which is okay. The second transition must go from odd parity (l=1) to even parity (l=0), so that's also okay. So each step changes parity, so the total two steps result in a net change from even to even via odd, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut now, back to the problem of probabilities. Let me think of the transition probabilities. \n\nThe transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9. The m can be 0, 1, -1. The probability of each of these transitions may depend on the matrix elements. \n\nThe transition dipole moment is given by the integral \u27e82,1,m' | r | 3,0,0\u27e9. The radial part would be the same for all m's, but the angular part depends on the m's. \n\nThe angular integral for the dipole transition between l=0 and l'=1. The matrix element for the dipole operator (which has components depending on the spherical harmonics) would involve integrals like \u27e8Y_{1m'} | r Y_{00}\u27e9. \n\nWait, actually, the dipole operator is proportional to r multiplied by a spherical harmonic component. For example, the z-component of the dipole moment is proportional to r * Y_{10}, so the transition from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0 would be allowed for the z-component. Similarly, the x and y components would involve m'=\u00b11. \n\nTherefore, the transition from l=0 to l'=1 can occur via the z-component (m'=0) or x/y components (m'=\u00b11). The matrix elements for these different m' values may have different magnitudes. \n\nHowever, the total probability for all possible m' transitions would be the sum of the probabilities for each m'. Since the question is about a specific path (like m'=0, or m'=+1, etc.), the probability of each path depends on the square of their respective matrix elements.\n\nIn the case of the transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,0\u27e9, the dipole matrix element for that specific transition (m'=0) would be proportional to the integral involving the angular part of Y_{10}, which is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8, and the radial part. The angular integral with l=0 (Y_{00} = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) would be:\n\n\u222b Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{00} d\u03a9? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact form. The dipole transition matrix element involves \u27e8final | r | initial\u27e9. Since the dipole operator is a vector, the transition between states must satisfy \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. \n\nThe angular part for the transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m'=0 would involve the integral of Y_{10}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9. Since Y_{00} is spherically symmetric, the integral of Y_{10} * Y_{00} over the sphere is zero unless the angular dependence cancels out. Wait, actually, let's compute that integral:\n\nThe integral over all angles of Y_{10}^* Y_{00} is equal to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 0 0 | 0 0\u27e9, which is zero because the sum of the angular momenta must add to the total. Alternatively, perhaps using the orthogonality of spherical harmonics. The integral of Y_{10}^* Y_{00} over the sphere is \u03b4_{l' l} \u03b4_{m' m}, but since l'=1 and l=0, it's zero. Wait a second! That can't be right. Wait, no, the spherical harmonics are orthogonal with respect to different l and m. So for different l, the integral over the sphere of Y_{l'm'} Y_{lm} is zero unless l'=l and m'=m. Therefore, the integral of Y_{10} * Y_{00} over the sphere would be zero. Wait, but that would mean the transition to m'=0 is forbidden?\n\nWait, but that contradicts the selection rules. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The dipole operator is a vector, so the transition is actually between l and l' with \u0394l=\u00b11 and \u0394m=0, \u00b11. But the angular part of the matrix element requires that the integral over angles of Y_{l'm'}^* * (r) * Y_{lm} is non-zero. Since the dipole operator is proportional to r multiplied by a component of the position vector, which corresponds to a spherical harmonic of l=1. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to think about this is that the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' is proportional to the integral over angles of Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{lm} Y_{1m_dip} }, where m_dip is the component of the dipole (like m=0 for the z-component). This is because the dipole operator has angular dependence of l=1. \n\nTherefore, the integral for the transition matrix element would involve a product of three spherical harmonics, and the integral is non-zero only if the sum of the angular momenta (l, 1, l') can couple appropriately. \n\nSo the integral is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11, and m' = m + m_dip. But m_dip can be -1, 0, +1 depending on the component (x, y, z). \n\nWait, perhaps using the Wigner-Eckart theorem might help here. The matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = \u27e8n', l' || r || n, l\u27e9 * \u27e8l' m' | 1 0 \u27e9 l m \n\nWait, assuming the dipole operator is along the z-axis (so the m_dip is 0). Then the angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l' m' | l 0 1 0 \u27e9 \u2192 \u27e8 l' m' | l + 1 0 \u27e9? Wait, perhaps the angular factor is \u27e8 l' m' | (Y_{10}) | l m \u27e9 ?\n\nAlternatively, the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l and 1 to get l', with m = m' - 0 (since the dipole component is along z, m_dip=0). Wait, this is getting a bit complex, but let me try to recall:\n\nThe selection rule for m requires that m' = m + \u03bc, where \u03bc is the projection of the dipole moment's angular momentum (since the dipole operator has l=1). If we take the dipole operator component along the z-axis (which is proportional to Y_{10}), then the dipole operator has m_dip = 0. So the transition requires that m' = m + m_dip = m + 0. Wait, no, perhaps the dipole operator's angular part is Y_{1 m_dip}, and the transition matrix element would involve m' = m + m_dip. \n\nSo, for the transition from m=0 to m'=0, the dipole component must have m_dip = 0 (the z-component). For m'=1, m_dip would have to be +1 (the x+iy component), and for m'=-1, m_dip would be -1 (the x-iy component). \n\nThe key point here is that the angular part of the matrix element for the transition to m'=0 (with the dipole's z-component) would involve a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient between l=0, m=0; l_dip=1, m_dip=0; and l'=1, m'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b1 l_dip, but here l=0 and l_dip=1, so l'=1. The m components must add: m = m1 + m2. Here m_dip is 0, so m'=0 = m + m_dip \u2192 m'=0 since m=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0\u27e9? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The angular part of the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{l m} Y_{1 m_dip}. \n\nAlternatively, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = (-1)^{l - m} \\sqrt{(l + 1)(2l' + 1)} / \\sqrt{2l + 1} * \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 * \\langle l' 0 | l 1 m - m_dip \u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think numerically. \n\nFor the transition from l=0 to l'=1:\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for m'=0 would involve the product of Y_{00}, Y_{10}, and the radial integral. The integral over angles of Y_{10}* Y_{00} Y_{00} (since the initial m is 0) would be:\n\n\u222b Y_{10}*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9 \n\nWait, that's not quite right. The dipole operator is a vector, so the matrix element is \u27e8n', l', m' | r_z | n, l, m\u27e9, which is proportional to \u27e8l', m' | 1 0 \u27e9 \u27e8 l, m |. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l' m' | l 0 1 0 \u27e9. Since the dipole component here is along z (m_dip=0), and the initial state has m=0. \n\nSo the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would be \u27e8 l' m' | l=0, m=0; 1, m_dip=0 \u27e9. Since l' = l + 1 (since \u0394l=+1), then l'=1. The m' must be 0 + 0 = 0. So for m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero. \n\nThe value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0 \u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 + 1)/(2*0 + 2) ) ? Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\nFor \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l'= l1 + l2 and m'= m1 + m2, the coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) * something. \n\nIn this case, l1 =0, l2=1, so l' =1. m'=0 =0 +0. The coefficient is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * something. \n\nWait, the exact value might be:\n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * something. But actually, the exact value can be looked up. \n\nAlternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=0 gives l'=1, m'=0. The coefficient is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * something, but perhaps it's sqrt(3/(1*3)) *1 = 1. Wait, maybe it's 1. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the CG coefficient for \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l1=0, m1=0, l2=1, m2=0, then m' must be 0, and l'=1. The coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1)) ) )? Because when l1 is 0, the only possible term is when l'= l2 =1, and the coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1 +1) )) * something. Wait, actually, the formula for when l1=0 is that the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l' +1) )) * \u03b4_{l', l2} \u03b4_{m', m2} }? Hmm, perhaps I need to look at specific values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the matrix element for the z-component of the dipole operator between |l=0, m=0\u27e9 and |l'=1, m'=0\u27e9. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e810| r_z |00\u27e9 is proportional to \u27e8Y_{10}| Y_{00} * r_z ? \n\nWait, perhaps an easier way: the dipole transition from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0 is allowed because the m changes by 0 (since m_dip is 0), and l increases by 1. So the transition is allowed. The angular part of the matrix element is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, for the transition to m'=1, that would require the dipole operator's component with m_dip=+1 (like the x+iy component). So that would involve a transition where m increases by +1, so m'=0 +1=1. The angular part would also be non-zero. \n\nSo all three transitions (m'= -1,0, +1) are allowed. \n\nTherefore, the three possible intermediate states (m=-1,0,+1) are all possible. \n\nNow, the probability for each path depends on the square of the matrix elements for each step. Since the question gives options with different probabilities, perhaps the key is that the path with m'=0 has a different probability than those with m'=\u00b11. \n\nAssuming that the radial matrix elements (the part involving the radial integrals) are the same for all three transitions (since they are all transitions from n=3 to n=2, l=1, differing only in m), the difference in probabilities would come from the angular parts. \n\nThe angular part for the m'=0 transition would involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient squared, compared to m'=\u00b11. \n\nLet me try to compute the angular factors. \n\nFor the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0:\n\nThe angular matrix element for the z-component (m_dip=0) would have a coefficient proportional to the CG coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9. Let's compute that.\n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l1=0, m1=0, l2=1, m2=0, l'=1, m'=0. \n\nThe formula for CG coefficients when l1=0 is straightforward. The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l' +1) )) * delta_{l', l2} delta_{m', m2}. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but in this case, since l'= l2 (since l1=0), m'=m2. So for l1=0, the CG coefficient for combining with l2 to get l'=l2 is sqrt( (2l2+1)/(2l' +1) )? Wait, maybe it's sqrt( (2l2 +1) ) / sqrt(2l2 +1) )? That would be 1. Wait, perhaps in this case, the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula from tables. Let me think of the standard CG coefficients. For example, the CG coefficient for \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9 is indeed sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) ) * something. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\n\u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 = \u03b4_{m', m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) * ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the actual value. \n\nAlternatively, consider that when you add angular momentum 0 and 1, the result is 1. The state |1,0\u27e9 is just the state from the l=1 component. Since the l=0 part doesn't contribute, the coefficient for \u27e81 0 | 0 0 \u2297 1 0 \u27e9 is 1. Because when you combine a spin 0 with spin 1, the total is 1, and the m=0 component is just the same as the m=0 component of the spin 1. \n\nTherefore, the CG coefficient here is 1. \n\nNow for the transition to m'=1. Let's take the case where the dipole operator has m_dip=+1 (the x+iy component). The transition from m=0 to m'=1 requires m_dip=+1, so the angular part would involve the CG coefficient \u27e81 1 | 0 0 1 +1\u27e9. \n\nThe CG coefficient here is \u27e81 1 | 0 0 \u2297 1 +1 \u27e9. The formula for this is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * \u03b4_{m', m1 + m2} ?\n\nWait, m'=1 = 0 +1, so it's allowed. The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) ) times some factor. Since l1=0, l2=1, l'=1. The value should be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * sqrt( ( (l' - l2 + l1)! (l' + l2 - l1)! (l1 + l2 - l')! ) / ( (l1 + l2 + l' +1)! ) ... )) Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since the CG coefficient for \u27e81 1 | 0 0 1 1\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (1 -1 +0)! (1+1 -0)! (0+1 -1)! ) / ( (0+1+1)! (2*1)! )) )? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to recall that the CG coefficient for \u27e8 l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 when l1=0 is just \u03b4_{m, m2} \u03b4_{l, l2} multiplied by a normalization factor. Since when l1=0, the only possible contribution is from l2, so the coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l +1) )) ? Wait, maybe that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, since adding l1=0 and l2=1, the total l'=1. The state |1 m\u27e9 is just the |1 m\u27e9 from the l2=1 part. Therefore, the CG coefficients are such that \u27e81 m | 0 0 \u2297 1 m \u27e9 =1. So the coefficient is 1 for all m. \n\nWait, that can't be. Because then the normalization would require that. Wait, the total state is a direct product. The state |0 0\u27e9 \u2297 |1 m\u27e9 is already an eigenstate of total angular momentum with l'=1 and m. So when we express |l' m'\u27e9 in terms of these, it's exactly |0 0\u27e9 \u2297 |1 m\u27e9. So the coefficient is 1. Therefore, the CG coefficient \u27e81 m | 0 0 1 m\u27e9 =1. \n\nTherefore, for both m'=0 and m'=\u00b11, the CG coefficients are 1. Therefore, the angular parts are the same. So the matrix elements for each of the transitions (m'=0, \u00b11) would have the same angular factor, so their probabilities (squared) would be the same. \n\nTherefore, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to any of the three intermediate states (m'=0, \u00b11) has the same probability. \n\nNow, moving on to the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's take each case:\n\nCase 1: intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. The transition to |1,0,0\u27e9 would involve a dipole transition from l'=1 to l=0. Again, the dipole operator must change l by \u00b11, so that's okay. The m must change by 0, since initial m is 0, final m is 0. So the dipole component must have m_dip=0 (the z-component). The angular part here would be similar to the first transition but reversed. The matrix element would involve \u27e81 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9? Wait, let's think.\n\nThe transition is from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0. The dipole operator's z-component (m_dip=0) would have the angular part:\n\n\u27e80 0 | r_z |1 0\u27e9 \n\nThe angular part here would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10}^*? Wait, perhaps better to use Wigner-Eckart again. \n\nThe angular matrix element is proportional to \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9. Wait, the dipole operator's angular part is l=1, so the transition from l=1 to l'=0 requires that the dipole operator's angular part combines with l=1 to give l'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient here is \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. Wait, that would require that 1 + 1 can form 0? But 1+1 can form 0,1, or 2. So yes, the coefficient is possible. \n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (0 -1 +1)! (0 +1 -1)! (1 +1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! ) ) )? Not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for combining two angular momenta. \n\nAlternatively, using the same logic as before: the state |0 0\u27e9 can be formed by combining |1 0\u27e9 and the dipole's angular part (l=1, m_dip=0). The CG coefficient here would be \u27e80 0 |1 0 \u22971 0\u27e9. But since 1+1 can form 0, the coefficient is non-zero. \n\nThe value of the CG coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * sqrt( ( (0 -1 +1)! (0 +1 -1)! (1 +1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1 +0 +1)! )) )? Hmm, maybe this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, recall that the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l'=0 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (1-1+0)! (1+1 -0)! (1+1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! (2*0)! ) ))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient is sqrt( 1/(3*3) ) * sqrt( (2)! (2)! / (3! 0! )) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's use a known result: the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l'=0 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) multiplied by something. The value is known to be -sqrt(3/16) or something? Wait, perhaps I should recall that the coefficient for |0,0\u27e9 as a combination of |1,1\u27e9 and |-1,-1\u27e9 etc. \n\nWait, maybe it's easier to note that the squared matrix element for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 with m=0 would have an angular factor of 1/ sqrt(3), because when you combine l=1 and l_dip=1 (for the operator), the combination to get l=0 requires a certain coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular part for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 is proportional to the same as before but with different Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, let me think of the first transition again. For the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the angular part was 1. For the second transition, going from l'=1 to l=0, the angular part would be the same as the first part but reversed. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the angular matrix element for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 (with m=0) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nLet me look up the value of \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for \u27e80,0|1,0;1,0\u27e9 is calculated as follows: \n\nThe formula is:\n\n\u27e8l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m\u27e9 = \u27e8l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m\u27e9 \n\nHere, we have l1=1, m1=0; l2=1 (from the dipole operator's angular part?), m2=0; and l=0, m=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is:\n\nsqrt( ( (l - m)! (l + m)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 - l)! (l1 - l2 + l)! (-l1 + l2 + l)! ) )) ) * something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for combining two angular momenta to get a lower l. \n\nThe value of \u27e81 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9 for l'=0 is zero, because 1 +1 can't form 0 with m=0? Wait, no, 1 +1 can form 0. The m must add: 0 +0 =0. So it's possible. \n\nThe exact value is calculated as follows: \n\nThe coefficient is given by:\n\nsqrt( [ ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) / (2l +1) ) ] ) * \u27e8 l1 0 | l2 0 l m \u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the formula:\n\n\u27e8l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 = \u03b4_{m, m1+m2} * sqrt( (2l +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) ) * [ (l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m ) ]\n\nWhere [ (l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m ) ] is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the value of the coefficient for \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nUpon recalling, the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l=0 is sqrt( 1/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1)/(2*0 +1) )) ) times some factor. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficient squared is:\n\n|\u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9|\u00b2 = (2*0 +1)/( (2*1+1)(2*1+1)) ) * ( (1 +1 -0)! (1 -1 +0)! (0 +1 -1)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! )! ) \n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose we have two angular momenta of l1=1 and l2=1, and we want to combine them to get l=0. The only way this can happen is by having the states like |1,1\u27e9 and |1,-1\u27e9 cancelling each other. The coefficient for |0,0\u27e9 would be proportional to (|1,1\u27e9 \u2297 |1,-1\u27e9 - |1,-1\u27e9\u2297|1,1\u27e9)/sqrt(2) plus other terms, but when m1=0 and m2=0, that's not possible. Wait, no, m must add. So m1 + m2 = m. For m=0, possible pairs are (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1). \n\nThe state |0,0\u27e9 is a combination of those. Specifically, the coefficient for the term |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 in |0,0\u27e9 is zero because 0+0=0, but the combination requires that the total angular momentum is zero. The combination for |0,0\u27e9 would include terms like (|1,1\u27e9\u2297|1,-1\u27e9 - |1,-1\u27e9\u2297|1,1\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and similar terms for other m's. The term |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 would contribute to the m=0 part but in the l=2 state (since 1+1 can form l=2 with m=0 as well). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 in |0,0\u27e9 is zero. \n\nWait, so that means that \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 =0? \n\nAh! That's a key point. So if you have two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1, then to get a total l=0, the combination of m1=0 and m2=0 cannot contribute because the only way to get m=0 is by having m1 and m2 cancel each other (like 1 and -1), not both being zero. Therefore, the coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is indeed zero. \n\nWait, that would mean that the transition from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0 via a dipole transition is forbidden? But that contradicts the selection rules because \u0394l= -1 is allowed. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nThe transition is from |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The dipole operator's angular part has l=1. So the angular matrix element is \u27e81,0 | operator |2,1,0\u27e9. The operator is proportional to r multiplied by a component of the dipole, which has angular part l=1. \n\nThe angular part of the matrix element is \u27e81 0 | 1 (dipole) |1 0 \u27e9. \n\nWait, the dipole operator's angular part is a vector, so let's say we're considering the z-component (m_dip=0). The matrix element is \u27e80 0 | (dipole_z) |1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part is the integral over angles of Y_{00}^* * Y_{10} (since the dipole's z-component is proportional to Y_{10}), multiplied by Y_{10} (the initial state's angular part). \n\nWait, the angular matrix element is \u27e8Y_{00} | Y_{10} | Y_{10}\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, no, more precisely, the angular part is:\n\n\u27e81,0 | r_z |1,0\u27e9 \u2192 the angular part would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* (since the final l=0) multiplied by Y_{10} (dipole's z-component) multiplied by Y_{10} (the initial state). \n\nSo the integral is \u222b Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10} d\u03a9. \n\nSince Y_{00} is a constant (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), and Y_{10} is proportional to cos\u03b8. So:\n\nIntegral over all angles: (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * [integral over \u03b8 \u03c6 of cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 d\u03a9 ]\n\nWait, but Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. So the integral becomes:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ) integrated over the sphere. \n\nThe integral would be (3/(4\u03c0))*(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) times the integral of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nWait, let's compute this step by step:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n\u27e8Y_{00}| Y_{10} | Y_{10} \u27e9 = \u222b Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10} d\u03a9 \n\n= (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * [ sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ] * [ sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ] \u222b d\u03a9 \n\nWait, but the product Y_{10}*Y_{10} would be (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8, multiplied by Y_{00}^* which is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the entire integrand is (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) cos\u00b2\u03b8, integrated over the sphere. \n\nBut the integral of cos\u00b2\u03b8 over the sphere (in spherical coordinates) is \u222b0 to \u03c0 \u222b0 to 2\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nThe \u03c6 integral gives 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral: let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nWait, cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2192 let me compute \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u=cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nLimits from u=1 to -1. \n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [ u\u00b3/3 ] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nThus, the integral over \u03b8 is 2/3, multiplied by 2\u03c0 gives 4\u03c0/3. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe integral is (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (4\u03c0/3) ) = (3/(4\u03c0 * 2/sqrt(\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) ) \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me compute the constants step by step. \n\nThe constants part:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) \n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0))^(1/2) * (3/(4\u03c0))^(1/2) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= (3) / ( (4\u03c0)^(1/2) * (4\u03c0) )^(1/2?) Wait, perhaps better to compute exponents:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) = 3/(4\u03c0)\n\nSo overall constants:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nThus, the entire integral becomes:\n\n(1/(sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 3/(4\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\n= (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\nThe 3 and 4\u03c0 terms cancel, leaving (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0)^(1/2) ? Wait, 4\u03c0 divided by sqrt(4\u03c0) is sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n(3/(4\u03c0) * (4\u03c0/3)) ) * (1/sqrt(4\u03c0) )? \n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the constants. Let me try again:\n\nThe angular integral is:\n\n[ (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) ) ] * [ integral over angles of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 ]\n\nThe first part inside the brackets:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nThe integral over angles gave (4\u03c0/3) as above. \n\nSo total integral:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * 3/(4\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) ) \n\n= (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) ) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\nThe 3 cancels, 4\u03c0 cancels with denominator 4\u03c0, leaving 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(4\u03c0) ?\n\nWait, sqrt(4\u03c0) is 2*sqrt(\u03c0). Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should compute numerically:\n\nLet me compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, the constants:\n\nY_{00}^* is (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)).\n\nY_{10} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8, so Y_{10}^2 is (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nThus, the product Y_{00}^* * Y_{10} * Y_{10} is (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nIntegrate over the sphere (\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0, \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0):\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * \u222b0^2\u03c0 d\u03c6 \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 \n\nThe \u03c6 integral is 2\u03c0.\n\nThe \u03b8 integral:\n\n\u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = [ -cos\u00b3\u03b8 / 3 ] from 0 to \u03c0 \n\n= [ - ( (-1)^3 ) /3 - ( -1^3 /3 ) ] ?\n\nWait, let me substitute u=cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1.\n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3.\n\nThus, the integral over \u03b8 is 2/3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, no:\n\nWait the integral over \u03c6 gives 2\u03c0, so:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0))*(3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nThe constants from Y's: (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nMultiply by the integrals:\n\n2\u03c0 (from \u03c6) * (2/3) (from \u03b8) \n\nSo:\n\nTotal = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * 3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe 3 in numerator cancels with the 3 in denominator.\n\nThe \u03c0 terms: 4\u03c0 in denominator and 2\u03c0 numerator \u2192 2/(4) = 1/2.\n\nThe remaining terms: 2/ (sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me compute numerators and denominators:\n\nNumerator factors:\n\n1 (from 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \n\n3 (from 3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) \n\n2 (from 2/3 after the 3 cancels)\n\nDenominator factors:\n\nsqrt(4\u03c0) \n\n4\u03c0 (from the 3/(4\u03c0) term)\n\n3 (from the 2/3 term, but already canceled)\n\nWait this is getting too confusing. Let me compute the numerical value step by step:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n(1/(sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\n= (1/(sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * 2/3) \n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n3 cancels with 3 \u2192 1.\n\nThe 4\u03c0 in the denominator and 2\u03c0 in numerator \u2192 2/(4) = 1/2.\n\nThe remaining 2 from the 2/3 after cancellation?\n\nWait, 2\u03c0 * 2/3 = (4/3) \u03c0. Wait, perhaps I need to track:\n\n3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 = (3 * 2\u03c0)/(4\u03c0) ) = 3/2 * (\u03c0/\u03c0) \u2192 3/2 * 1/2? Wait, sorry:\n\nWait:\n\n3/(4\u03c0) multiplied by 2\u03c0 gives (3*2\u03c0)/(4\u03c0) = 3/2.\n\nThen multiply by the remaining 2/3 (from the theta integral's 2/3):\n\n3/2 * 2/3 = 1.\n\nThus the total is (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 1 \n\nSo the angular integral is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nBut the angular part of the matrix element is this integral multiplied by the radial integral. However, the radial part for this transition would also be involved. \n\nBut the key point here is that the angular part for the transition from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0 has a non-zero value (since the integral is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), so it is allowed. \n\nWait but earlier I thought the CG coefficient was zero, but this calculation shows that the angular integral is non-zero. \n\nHmm, so my earlier conclusion that the CG coefficient was zero was wrong. The integral does give a non-zero value, so the transition is allowed. \n\nTherefore, the path through m'=0 is allowed. \n\nNow, what about the other paths, like m'=+1? \n\nConsider the path through |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe second transition here is from l'=1, m'=1 to l=0, m=0. \n\nThe dipole operator must change m by -1, so the dipole component must have m_dip = -1 (the x-iy component). \n\nThe angular part here would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,1} (since the dipole's component with m_dip=-1 is Y_{1,-1}). \n\nThe angular integral would be:\n\n\u27e80 0 | r_{-1} |1 1\u27e9, where r_{-1} is the dipole component with m_dip=-1. \n\nThe angular part is the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,1} d\u03a9. \n\nY_{00} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). Y_{1,-1} is proportional to e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, and Y_{1,1} is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. \n\nThe product Y_{1,-1} * Y_{1,1} would involve e^{-i\u03c6} * e^{i\u03c6} = 1, and sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nThus, the integrand becomes (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (constant terms) * sin\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 would be 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 would be \u222b0^\u03c0 sin\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u222b0^\u03c0 sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nThe integral of sin\u00b3\u03b8 is 4/3 (I think). \n\nBut the key point is that the angular part is non-zero. \n\nThe angular part for this transition (m'=1 to m=0) would also be non-zero, so this path is allowed. \n\nTherefore, all three paths (m'=0, \u00b11) are allowed for the first transition, and each can proceed to the final state. \n\nNow, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities for each step. Assuming that the radial matrix elements are the same for all first transitions (since they're between the same n values and same l, just different m), and similarly for the second transitions. \n\nThe angular factors for the first transition (to m'=0, \u00b11) are the same (each has a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient of 1, leading to the same angular part), so the first step has equal probabilities for each m'. \n\nThe second step: \n\nFor the path through m'=0, the second transition's angular part is proportional to the integral we computed earlier (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), but let's consider the squared angular part. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part for the first path (m'=0) is different from the others. \n\nThe angular part of the first transition (3\u21922,1,0) has an angular factor of 1 (from the CG coefficient being 1). The second transition (2,1,0\u21921,0,0) has an angular factor of the integral we computed, which was 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) but multiplied by other constants. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the probabilities being proportional to the squares of the angular parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total probability for the path through m'=0 is proportional to (1)^2 * (1)^2 (if the angular parts squared are 1 for both steps), but that may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives options with specific probabilities, maybe the answer is that the probability for the path through m'=0 is 1/3 because there are three possible paths (m'= -1, 0, +1) and they all have equal probabilities. \n\nAssuming that each of the three possible intermediate states has an equal probability, then the probability for each path is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, option A has the path through m'=0 and probability 1/3, which matches. \n\nThe other options B and C have paths through m'=1 and m'=-1, but their probabilities are given as 1/4, which doesn't fit with the 1/3. \n\nOption D's path is the same as A but with probability 2/3, which would not be the case if all three paths are equally probable. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions here. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom.\n\nFirst, I remember that dipole transitions must satisfy certain selection rules. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions state that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l (\u0394l) must be \u00b11. Also, the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or \u00b11. Since the question mentions dipole transitions, these selection rules definitely apply here.\n\nLooking at the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9, which has n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, so n=1, l=0, m=0. The transition happens in two steps. Let me think about each step.\n\nFirst, the first transition must go from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then to n=1, l=0. Let me consider the possible intermediate states. Since each transition is a dipole transition, each step must obey \u0394l = \u00b11. Starting with l=0 in the initial state, the first transition must have \u0394l = +1 or -1. But since l can't be negative, the first step from l=0 must go to l=1. So the first transition must have \u0394l = +1, so the intermediate state must have l=1. \n\nThe first transition is from |3,0,0\u27e9 to an intermediate state. The possible intermediate states would be n=2 or n=4? Wait, but since the final state is n=1, the second transition has to go down. So probably the first step goes from n=3 to n=2, then from n=2 to n=1. Because you can't jump from 3 to 1 directly in two steps if each step requires a change in n. Because each dipole transition allows \u0394n to be any value except n=0, but the selection rules for n aren't as strict as l. Wait, actually the selection rules for n are not as strict. The main selection rules are for l and m. So the first transition could go to n=2, l=1, m=0, \u00b11? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me check the possible transitions step by step. The first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 must obey \u0394l = \u00b11. Since l starts at 0, the next l must be 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1, and m can change by 0 or \u00b11. So the m can be 0, +1, or -1? Wait, the m value must change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the possible m values after the first transition can be 0, +1, or -1. But l must be 1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m values are okay. \n\nSo the first transition can go to a state with l=1 and m=0, +1, or -1. The n for the intermediate state could be 2 or 4? Hmm, but since the final state is n=1, maybe the first step is to n=2. Because going from n=3 to n=2 is a lower energy step, then from n=2 to n=1. That makes sense. So the intermediate state is likely n=2, l=1, m can be 0, \u00b11.\n\nNow the second transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's consider that. The final l is 0, so from l=1 in the intermediate state, the second transition must have \u0394l = -1, which is allowed. So that's okay. The m in the intermediate state must then change by 0 or \u00b11 to get to m=0. \n\nSo let's see each option.\n\nOption A says the path is |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3. Let's check the transitions here. \n\nFirst transition: 3,0,0 \u2192 2,1,0. The \u0394l here is +1 (from 0 to 1), which is okay. The m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m is 0, which is allowed. So that's a valid dipole transition.\n\nSecond transition: from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. Here, \u0394l is -1 (from 1 to 0), allowed. The m goes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m is 0, which is allowed. So this path is possible. Now the probability part. The question mentions the corresponding probability, so we need to compute the probability for each path and see which matches.\n\nOption B's path is 3\u21922,1,1 then to 1,0,0. Let's check the second transition here. From 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. The \u0394m here would be 0-1 = -1, which is allowed. So that's okay. The first transition's m goes from 0 to 1, which is allowed (\u0394m=+1). So that's also a valid path. But the probability here is given as 1/4. Hmm.\n\nOption C is similar to B, but m is -1. So first transition to m=-1. Then from there, to m=0. The \u0394m would be +1, so that's allowed. So that's also a valid path. Probability is 1/4.\n\nOption D's first part is missing the starting state, but maybe that's a typo. It says |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3, but that's only one transition. The question requires two transitions, so D might not be the answer. Wait, the options are written as:\n\nLooking back at the problem's options:\n\nOption D is written as: |3\u27e9\u2192|2,1,0\u27e9\u2192|1,0,0\u27e9 and 2/3. Wait, the original question's options might have a typo. The user wrote D as:\n\nD) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\n\nHmm, perhaps the first part is missing, but maybe it's supposed to be the same path as A but with a different probability. Wait, the first arrow in D starts with an incomplete ket? Maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. The user input shows:\n\n\"Options:\nA) ... \nB) ... \nC) ...\nD) \\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3}\"\n\nHmm, maybe the D option's first part is supposed to be |3,0,0\u27e9\u2192... but the LaTeX is messed up. Maybe it's a typo, but given the options, perhaps D's path is the same as A's path but with a different probability. So assuming that, the paths in A and D are the same except for the probability.\n\nNow, the question is which of these paths is correct and with the right probability.\n\nThe key is to compute the probabilities for each possible path. Since the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", so we need to find which path is allowed and has the probability given in the option.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible paths. The possible paths from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 via two dipole transitions would involve first going to an intermediate state with n=2 and l=1, then to n=1, l=0. The intermediate state can have m values of -1, 0, or +1. So three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, and |2,1,+1\u27e9. \n\nEach of these intermediate states can then transition to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let me think about the probabilities for each path.\n\nThe total probability would depend on the product of the probabilities for each step. However, I might need to recall the selection rules and the transition probabilities. Wait, but maybe the question is more about the allowed paths and the probabilities given, so perhaps the answer is determined by the allowed transitions and the probabilities given in the options.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering that the first transition from n=3 to n=2, l=1, m can be 0, +1, or -1. So three possibilities. Then each of those can go down to n=1, l=0, m=0. \n\nFor each of those three paths, the total probability would depend on the individual probabilities of each transition. Since the question is asking which option has the correct route and probability, let me think about each option's given probability.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A's path is 3\u21922,1,0 then to 1,0,0. The probability given is 1/3.\n\nOption B's path is 3\u21922,1,1 then to 1,0,0 with probability 1/4.\n\nOption C is similar but m=-1, also 1/4.\n\nOption D (assuming same path as A) has 2/3.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the probabilities. Let me think of the transition probabilities. \n\nThe transition probability for a dipole transition between two states is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. The matrix element involves integrals over the wavefunctions, but perhaps there's a simpler way here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the statistical weight or the number of possible paths. For example, when the first transition from 3,0,0 can go to three different m states (m=-1, 0, +1) in the intermediate l=1 state. So there are three possible paths. However, the actual probabilities might depend on the selection rules for the angular momentum transitions.\n\nWait, but in the first transition from 3,0,0 to n=2, l=1, m must change by 0, +1, or -1. Since the initial m is 0, the final m can be 0, \u00b11. So three possibilities. However, the probability of each transition may not be the same because the radial integrals could differ. But perhaps the question is considering that each possible m path has equal probability, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be referring to the total probability summed over all possible paths, but the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", so each path's probability is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the fact that for electric dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the reduced matrix element, and for certain transitions, the coefficients can be determined by symmetry or other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the parity must change. Wait, but the parity of the hydrogen atom states is (-1)^l. Since the initial state has l=0 (even parity), and the final l=0 (even parity). Wait, but dipole transitions require a change in parity, so that can't happen. Wait a minute, hold on! This might be a key point I missed.\n\nOh no! Wait, dipole transitions must change the parity. The parity of the state is (-1)^l. So the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9, l=0 \u2192 parity +1. The final state is |1,0,0\u27e9, l=0 \u2192 parity +1. So the parity doesn't change. But dipole transitions require a change in parity. Therefore, a direct transition from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 is forbidden. But the question says it decays via two dipole transitions, so the intermediate step must have opposite parity.\n\nAh, right! That's a crucial point. So the intermediate state must have l=1, which has parity (-1)^1 = -1. So the first transition is from even parity (l=0) to odd parity (l=1), which is okay. The second transition must go from odd parity (l=1) to even parity (l=0), so that's also okay. So each step changes parity, so the total two steps result in a net change from even to even via odd, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut now, back to the problem of probabilities. Let me think of the transition probabilities. \n\nThe transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9. The m can be 0, 1, -1. The probability of each of these transitions may depend on the matrix elements. \n\nThe transition dipole moment is given by the integral \u27e82,1,m' | r | 3,0,0\u27e9. The radial part would be the same for all m's, but the angular part depends on the m's. \n\nThe angular integral for the dipole transition between l=0 and l'=1. The matrix element for the dipole operator (which has components depending on the spherical harmonics) would involve integrals like \u27e8Y_{1m'} | r Y_{00}\u27e9. \n\nWait, actually, the dipole operator is proportional to r multiplied by a spherical harmonic component. For example, the z-component of the dipole moment is proportional to r * Y_{10}, so the transition from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0 would be allowed for the z-component. Similarly, the x and y components would involve m'=\u00b11. \n\nTherefore, the transition from l=0 to l'=1 can occur via the z-component (m'=0) or x/y components (m'=\u00b11). The matrix elements for these different m' values may have different magnitudes. \n\nHowever, the total probability for all possible m' transitions would be the sum of the probabilities for each m'. Since the question is about a specific path (like m'=0, or m'=+1, etc.), the probability of each path depends on the square of their respective matrix elements.\n\nIn the case of the transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,0\u27e9, the dipole matrix element for that specific transition (m'=0) would be proportional to the integral involving the angular part of Y_{10}, which is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * cos\u03b8, and the radial part. The angular integral with l=0 (Y_{00} = 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) would be:\n\n\u222b Y_{10}^* Y_{00} Y_{00} d\u03a9? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact form. The dipole transition matrix element involves \u27e8final | r | initial\u27e9. Since the dipole operator is a vector, the transition between states must satisfy \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. \n\nThe angular part for the transition from l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m'=0 would involve the integral of Y_{10}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9. Since Y_{00} is spherically symmetric, the integral of Y_{10} * Y_{00} over the sphere is zero unless the angular dependence cancels out. Wait, actually, let's compute that integral:\n\nThe integral over all angles of Y_{10}^* Y_{00} is equal to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 0 0 | 0 0\u27e9, which is zero because the sum of the angular momenta must add to the total. Alternatively, perhaps using the orthogonality of spherical harmonics. The integral of Y_{10}^* Y_{00} over the sphere is \u03b4_{l' l} \u03b4_{m' m}, but since l'=1 and l=0, it's zero. Wait a second! That can't be right. Wait, no, the spherical harmonics are orthogonal with respect to different l and m. So for different l, the integral over the sphere of Y_{l'm'} Y_{lm} is zero unless l'=l and m'=m. Therefore, the integral of Y_{10} * Y_{00} over the sphere would be zero. Wait, but that would mean the transition to m'=0 is forbidden?\n\nWait, but that contradicts the selection rules. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The dipole operator is a vector, so the transition is actually between l and l' with \u0394l=\u00b11 and \u0394m=0, \u00b11. But the angular part of the matrix element requires that the integral over angles of Y_{l'm'}^* * (r) * Y_{lm} is non-zero. Since the dipole operator is proportional to r multiplied by a component of the position vector, which corresponds to a spherical harmonic of l=1. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to think about this is that the dipole transition matrix element between states with angular momentum l and l' is proportional to the integral over angles of Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{lm} Y_{1m_dip} }, where m_dip is the component of the dipole (like m=0 for the z-component). This is because the dipole operator has angular dependence of l=1. \n\nTherefore, the integral for the transition matrix element would involve a product of three spherical harmonics, and the integral is non-zero only if the sum of the angular momenta (l, 1, l') can couple appropriately. \n\nSo the integral is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b11, and m' = m + m_dip. But m_dip can be -1, 0, +1 depending on the component (x, y, z). \n\nWait, perhaps using the Wigner-Eckart theorem might help here. The matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = \u27e8n', l' || r || n, l\u27e9 * \u27e8l' m' | 1 0 \u27e9 l m \n\nWait, assuming the dipole operator is along the z-axis (so the m_dip is 0). Then the angular part is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8l' m' | l 0 1 0 \u27e9 \u2192 \u27e8 l' m' | l + 1 0 \u27e9? Wait, perhaps the angular factor is \u27e8 l' m' | (Y_{10}) | l m \u27e9 ?\n\nAlternatively, the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l and 1 to get l', with m = m' - 0 (since the dipole component is along z, m_dip=0). Wait, this is getting a bit complex, but let me try to recall:\n\nThe selection rule for m requires that m' = m + \u03bc, where \u03bc is the projection of the dipole moment's angular momentum (since the dipole operator has l=1). If we take the dipole operator component along the z-axis (which is proportional to Y_{10}), then the dipole operator has m_dip = 0. So the transition requires that m' = m + m_dip = m + 0. Wait, no, perhaps the dipole operator's angular part is Y_{1 m_dip}, and the transition matrix element would involve m' = m + m_dip. \n\nSo, for the transition from m=0 to m'=0, the dipole component must have m_dip = 0 (the z-component). For m'=1, m_dip would have to be +1 (the x+iy component), and for m'=-1, m_dip would be -1 (the x-iy component). \n\nThe key point here is that the angular part of the matrix element for the transition to m'=0 (with the dipole's z-component) would involve a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient between l=0, m=0; l_dip=1, m_dip=0; and l'=1, m'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 is non-zero only if l' = l \u00b1 l_dip, but here l=0 and l_dip=1, so l'=1. The m components must add: m = m1 + m2. Here m_dip is 0, so m'=0 = m + m_dip \u2192 m'=0 since m=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0\u27e9? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The angular part of the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{l m} Y_{1 m_dip}. \n\nAlternatively, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m\u27e9 = (-1)^{l - m} \\sqrt{(l + 1)(2l' + 1)} / \\sqrt{2l + 1} * \u27e8l' || r || l\u27e9 * \\langle l' 0 | l 1 m - m_dip \u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think numerically. \n\nFor the transition from l=0 to l'=1:\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element for m'=0 would involve the product of Y_{00}, Y_{10}, and the radial integral. The integral over angles of Y_{10}* Y_{00} Y_{00} (since the initial m is 0) would be:\n\n\u222b Y_{10}*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{00}(\u03b8,\u03c6) d\u03a9 \n\nWait, that's not quite right. The dipole operator is a vector, so the matrix element is \u27e8n', l', m' | r_z | n, l, m\u27e9, which is proportional to \u27e8l', m' | 1 0 \u27e9 \u27e8 l, m |. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8 l' m' | l 0 1 0 \u27e9. Since the dipole component here is along z (m_dip=0), and the initial state has m=0. \n\nSo the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would be \u27e8 l' m' | l=0, m=0; 1, m_dip=0 \u27e9. Since l' = l + 1 (since \u0394l=+1), then l'=1. The m' must be 0 + 0 = 0. So for m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero. \n\nThe value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0 \u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 + 1)/(2*0 + 2) ) ? Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\nFor \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l'= l1 + l2 and m'= m1 + m2, the coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) * something. \n\nIn this case, l1 =0, l2=1, so l' =1. m'=0 =0 +0. The coefficient is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * something. \n\nWait, the exact value might be:\n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * something. But actually, the exact value can be looked up. \n\nAlternatively, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 and l2=1, m2=0 gives l'=1, m'=0. The coefficient is sqrt( (2*1+1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * something, but perhaps it's sqrt(3/(1*3)) *1 = 1. Wait, maybe it's 1. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the CG coefficient for \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l1=0, m1=0, l2=1, m2=0, then m' must be 0, and l'=1. The coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1+1)(2l2+1)) ) )? Because when l1 is 0, the only possible term is when l'= l2 =1, and the coefficient is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1 +1) )) * something. Wait, actually, the formula for when l1=0 is that the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l' +1) )) * \u03b4_{l', l2} \u03b4_{m', m2} }? Hmm, perhaps I need to look at specific values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the matrix element for the z-component of the dipole operator between |l=0, m=0\u27e9 and |l'=1, m'=0\u27e9. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e810| r_z |00\u27e9 is proportional to \u27e8Y_{10}| Y_{00} * r_z ? \n\nWait, perhaps an easier way: the dipole transition from l=0 to l'=1 with m'=0 is allowed because the m changes by 0 (since m_dip is 0), and l increases by 1. So the transition is allowed. The angular part of the matrix element is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, for the transition to m'=1, that would require the dipole operator's component with m_dip=+1 (like the x+iy component). So that would involve a transition where m increases by +1, so m'=0 +1=1. The angular part would also be non-zero. \n\nSo all three transitions (m'= -1,0, +1) are allowed. \n\nTherefore, the three possible intermediate states (m=-1,0,+1) are all possible. \n\nNow, the probability for each path depends on the square of the matrix elements for each step. Since the question gives options with different probabilities, perhaps the key is that the path with m'=0 has a different probability than those with m'=\u00b11. \n\nAssuming that the radial matrix elements (the part involving the radial integrals) are the same for all three transitions (since they are all transitions from n=3 to n=2, l=1, differing only in m), the difference in probabilities would come from the angular parts. \n\nThe angular part for the m'=0 transition would involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient squared, compared to m'=\u00b11. \n\nLet me try to compute the angular factors. \n\nFor the first transition from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0:\n\nThe angular matrix element for the z-component (m_dip=0) would have a coefficient proportional to the CG coefficient \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9. Let's compute that.\n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 where l1=0, m1=0, l2=1, m2=0, l'=1, m'=0. \n\nThe formula for CG coefficients when l1=0 is straightforward. The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l' +1) )) * delta_{l', l2} delta_{m', m2}. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but in this case, since l'= l2 (since l1=0), m'=m2. So for l1=0, the CG coefficient for combining with l2 to get l'=l2 is sqrt( (2l2+1)/(2l' +1) )? Wait, maybe it's sqrt( (2l2 +1) ) / sqrt(2l2 +1) )? That would be 1. Wait, perhaps in this case, the CG coefficient is 1. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula from tables. Let me think of the standard CG coefficients. For example, the CG coefficient for \u27e81 0 | 0 0 1 0\u27e9 is indeed sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) ) * something. Wait, perhaps the formula is:\n\n\u27e8 l' m' | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 = \u03b4_{m', m1 + m2} * sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) * ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look up the actual value. \n\nAlternatively, consider that when you add angular momentum 0 and 1, the result is 1. The state |1,0\u27e9 is just the state from the l=1 component. Since the l=0 part doesn't contribute, the coefficient for \u27e81 0 | 0 0 \u2297 1 0 \u27e9 is 1. Because when you combine a spin 0 with spin 1, the total is 1, and the m=0 component is just the same as the m=0 component of the spin 1. \n\nTherefore, the CG coefficient here is 1. \n\nNow for the transition to m'=1. Let's take the case where the dipole operator has m_dip=+1 (the x+iy component). The transition from m=0 to m'=1 requires m_dip=+1, so the angular part would involve the CG coefficient \u27e81 1 | 0 0 1 +1\u27e9. \n\nThe CG coefficient here is \u27e81 1 | 0 0 \u2297 1 +1 \u27e9. The formula for this is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * \u03b4_{m', m1 + m2} ?\n\nWait, m'=1 = 0 +1, so it's allowed. The CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l' +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) ) times some factor. Since l1=0, l2=1, l'=1. The value should be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1+1) )) * sqrt( ( (l' - l2 + l1)! (l' + l2 - l1)! (l1 + l2 - l')! ) / ( (l1 + l2 + l' +1)! ) ... )) Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since the CG coefficient for \u27e81 1 | 0 0 1 1\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/( (2*0+1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (1 -1 +0)! (1+1 -0)! (0+1 -1)! ) / ( (0+1+1)! (2*1)! )) )? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to recall that the CG coefficient for \u27e8 l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 when l1=0 is just \u03b4_{m, m2} \u03b4_{l, l2} multiplied by a normalization factor. Since when l1=0, the only possible contribution is from l2, so the coefficient is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(2l +1) )) ? Wait, maybe that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, since adding l1=0 and l2=1, the total l'=1. The state |1 m\u27e9 is just the |1 m\u27e9 from the l2=1 part. Therefore, the CG coefficients are such that \u27e81 m | 0 0 \u2297 1 m \u27e9 =1. So the coefficient is 1 for all m. \n\nWait, that can't be. Because then the normalization would require that. Wait, the total state is a direct product. The state |0 0\u27e9 \u2297 |1 m\u27e9 is already an eigenstate of total angular momentum with l'=1 and m. So when we express |l' m'\u27e9 in terms of these, it's exactly |0 0\u27e9 \u2297 |1 m\u27e9. So the coefficient is 1. Therefore, the CG coefficient \u27e81 m | 0 0 1 m\u27e9 =1. \n\nTherefore, for both m'=0 and m'=\u00b11, the CG coefficients are 1. Therefore, the angular parts are the same. So the matrix elements for each of the transitions (m'=0, \u00b11) would have the same angular factor, so their probabilities (squared) would be the same. \n\nTherefore, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to any of the three intermediate states (m'=0, \u00b11) has the same probability. \n\nNow, moving on to the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9. Let's take each case:\n\nCase 1: intermediate is |2,1,0\u27e9. The transition to |1,0,0\u27e9 would involve a dipole transition from l'=1 to l=0. Again, the dipole operator must change l by \u00b11, so that's okay. The m must change by 0, since initial m is 0, final m is 0. So the dipole component must have m_dip=0 (the z-component). The angular part here would be similar to the first transition but reversed. The matrix element would involve \u27e81 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9? Wait, let's think.\n\nThe transition is from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0. The dipole operator's z-component (m_dip=0) would have the angular part:\n\n\u27e80 0 | r_z |1 0\u27e9 \n\nThe angular part here would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10}^*? Wait, perhaps better to use Wigner-Eckart again. \n\nThe angular matrix element is proportional to \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9. Wait, the dipole operator's angular part is l=1, so the transition from l=1 to l'=0 requires that the dipole operator's angular part combines with l=1 to give l'=0. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient here is \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. Wait, that would require that 1 + 1 can form 0? But 1+1 can form 0,1, or 2. So yes, the coefficient is possible. \n\nThe CG coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (0 -1 +1)! (0 +1 -1)! (1 +1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! ) ) )? Not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for combining two angular momenta. \n\nAlternatively, using the same logic as before: the state |0 0\u27e9 can be formed by combining |1 0\u27e9 and the dipole's angular part (l=1, m_dip=0). The CG coefficient here would be \u27e80 0 |1 0 \u22971 0\u27e9. But since 1+1 can form 0, the coefficient is non-zero. \n\nThe value of the CG coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) * sqrt( ( (0 -1 +1)! (0 +1 -1)! (1 +1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1 +0 +1)! )) )? Hmm, maybe this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, recall that the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l'=0 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) * sqrt( ( (1-1+0)! (1+1 -0)! (1+1 -0)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! (2*0)! ) ))? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient is sqrt( 1/(3*3) ) * sqrt( (2)! (2)! / (3! 0! )) ? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's use a known result: the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l'=0 is sqrt( (2*0 +1)/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1) )) ) multiplied by something. The value is known to be -sqrt(3/16) or something? Wait, perhaps I should recall that the coefficient for |0,0\u27e9 as a combination of |1,1\u27e9 and |-1,-1\u27e9 etc. \n\nWait, maybe it's easier to note that the squared matrix element for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 with m=0 would have an angular factor of 1/ sqrt(3), because when you combine l=1 and l_dip=1 (for the operator), the combination to get l=0 requires a certain coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular part for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 is proportional to the same as before but with different Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, let me think of the first transition again. For the first transition from l=0 to l'=1, the angular part was 1. For the second transition, going from l'=1 to l=0, the angular part would be the same as the first part but reversed. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the angular matrix element for the transition from l'=1 to l=0 (with m=0) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nLet me look up the value of \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for \u27e80,0|1,0;1,0\u27e9 is calculated as follows: \n\nThe formula is:\n\n\u27e8l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m\u27e9 = \u27e8l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m\u27e9 \n\nHere, we have l1=1, m1=0; l2=1 (from the dipole operator's angular part?), m2=0; and l=0, m=0. \n\nThe CG coefficient is:\n\nsqrt( ( (l - m)! (l + m)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 - l)! (l1 - l2 + l)! (-l1 + l2 + l)! ) )) ) * something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for combining two angular momenta to get a lower l. \n\nThe value of \u27e81 0 | 1 0 1 0 \u27e9 for l'=0 is zero, because 1 +1 can't form 0 with m=0? Wait, no, 1 +1 can form 0. The m must add: 0 +0 =0. So it's possible. \n\nThe exact value is calculated as follows: \n\nThe coefficient is given by:\n\nsqrt( [ ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) / (2l +1) ) ] ) * \u27e8 l1 0 | l2 0 l m \u27e9 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the formula:\n\n\u27e8l m | l1 m1 l2 m2 \u27e9 = \u03b4_{m, m1+m2} * sqrt( (2l +1)/( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )) ) * [ (l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m ) ]\n\nWhere [ (l1 l2 m1 m2 | l m ) ] is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the value of the coefficient for \u27e80 0 | 1 0 1 0\u27e9. \n\nUpon recalling, the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l=0 is sqrt( 1/( (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1)/(2*0 +1) )) ) times some factor. \n\nThe formula for the CG coefficient squared is:\n\n|\u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9|\u00b2 = (2*0 +1)/( (2*1+1)(2*1+1)) ) * ( (1 +1 -0)! (1 -1 +0)! (0 +1 -1)! ) / ( (1+1+0)! )! ) \n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose we have two angular momenta of l1=1 and l2=1, and we want to combine them to get l=0. The only way this can happen is by having the states like |1,1\u27e9 and |1,-1\u27e9 cancelling each other. The coefficient for |0,0\u27e9 would be proportional to (|1,1\u27e9 \u2297 |1,-1\u27e9 - |1,-1\u27e9\u2297|1,1\u27e9)/sqrt(2) plus other terms, but when m1=0 and m2=0, that's not possible. Wait, no, m must add. So m1 + m2 = m. For m=0, possible pairs are (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1). \n\nThe state |0,0\u27e9 is a combination of those. Specifically, the coefficient for the term |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 in |0,0\u27e9 is zero because 0+0=0, but the combination requires that the total angular momentum is zero. The combination for |0,0\u27e9 would include terms like (|1,1\u27e9\u2297|1,-1\u27e9 - |1,-1\u27e9\u2297|1,1\u27e9)/sqrt(2) and similar terms for other m's. The term |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 would contribute to the m=0 part but in the l=2 state (since 1+1 can form l=2 with m=0 as well). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of |1,0\u27e9\u2297|1,0\u27e9 in |0,0\u27e9 is zero. \n\nWait, so that means that \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 =0? \n\nAh! That's a key point. So if you have two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1, then to get a total l=0, the combination of m1=0 and m2=0 cannot contribute because the only way to get m=0 is by having m1 and m2 cancel each other (like 1 and -1), not both being zero. Therefore, the coefficient \u27e80 0 |1 0 1 0\u27e9 is indeed zero. \n\nWait, that would mean that the transition from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0 via a dipole transition is forbidden? But that contradicts the selection rules because \u0394l= -1 is allowed. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nThe transition is from |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The dipole operator's angular part has l=1. So the angular matrix element is \u27e81,0 | operator |2,1,0\u27e9. The operator is proportional to r multiplied by a component of the dipole, which has angular part l=1. \n\nThe angular part of the matrix element is \u27e81 0 | 1 (dipole) |1 0 \u27e9. \n\nWait, the dipole operator's angular part is a vector, so let's say we're considering the z-component (m_dip=0). The matrix element is \u27e80 0 | (dipole_z) |1 0\u27e9. \n\nThe angular part is the integral over angles of Y_{00}^* * Y_{10} (since the dipole's z-component is proportional to Y_{10}), multiplied by Y_{10} (the initial state's angular part). \n\nWait, the angular matrix element is \u27e8Y_{00} | Y_{10} | Y_{10}\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, no, more precisely, the angular part is:\n\n\u27e81,0 | r_z |1,0\u27e9 \u2192 the angular part would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* (since the final l=0) multiplied by Y_{10} (dipole's z-component) multiplied by Y_{10} (the initial state). \n\nSo the integral is \u222b Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10} d\u03a9. \n\nSince Y_{00} is a constant (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), and Y_{10} is proportional to cos\u03b8. So:\n\nIntegral over all angles: (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * [integral over \u03b8 \u03c6 of cos\u03b8 * cos\u03b8 d\u03a9 ]\n\nWait, but Y_{10} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. So the integral becomes:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ) integrated over the sphere. \n\nThe integral would be (3/(4\u03c0))*(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) ) times the integral of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nWait, let's compute this step by step:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n\u27e8Y_{00}| Y_{10} | Y_{10} \u27e9 = \u222b Y_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10} d\u03a9 \n\n= (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * [ sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ] * [ sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8 ] \u222b d\u03a9 \n\nWait, but the product Y_{10}*Y_{10} would be (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8, multiplied by Y_{00}^* which is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). So the entire integrand is (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) cos\u00b2\u03b8, integrated over the sphere. \n\nBut the integral of cos\u00b2\u03b8 over the sphere (in spherical coordinates) is \u222b0 to \u03c0 \u222b0 to 2\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. \n\nThe \u03c6 integral gives 2\u03c0. The \u03b8 integral: let u = sin\u03b8, du = cos\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nWait, cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2192 let me compute \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Let u=cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nLimits from u=1 to -1. \n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [ u\u00b3/3 ] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3. \n\nThus, the integral over \u03b8 is 2/3, multiplied by 2\u03c0 gives 4\u03c0/3. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe integral is (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (4\u03c0/3) ) = (3/(4\u03c0 * 2/sqrt(\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) ) \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me compute the constants step by step. \n\nThe constants part:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) \n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0))^(1/2) * (3/(4\u03c0))^(1/2) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= (3) / ( (4\u03c0)^(1/2) * (4\u03c0) )^(1/2?) Wait, perhaps better to compute exponents:\n\nsqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) = 3/(4\u03c0)\n\nSo overall constants:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nThus, the entire integral becomes:\n\n(1/(sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 3/(4\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\n= (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\nThe 3 and 4\u03c0 terms cancel, leaving (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0)^(1/2) ? Wait, 4\u03c0 divided by sqrt(4\u03c0) is sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n(3/(4\u03c0) * (4\u03c0/3)) ) * (1/sqrt(4\u03c0) )? \n\nHmm, perhaps I messed up the constants. Let me try again:\n\nThe angular integral is:\n\n[ (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) * ( sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) ) ) ] * [ integral over angles of cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03a9 ]\n\nThe first part inside the brackets:\n\n1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) * sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n= 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nThe integral over angles gave (4\u03c0/3) as above. \n\nSo total integral:\n\n(1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * 3/(4\u03c0)) ) * (4\u03c0/3) ) \n\n= (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) ) * (4\u03c0/3) \n\nThe 3 cancels, 4\u03c0 cancels with denominator 4\u03c0, leaving 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(4\u03c0) ?\n\nWait, sqrt(4\u03c0) is 2*sqrt(\u03c0). Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should compute numerically:\n\nLet me compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, the constants:\n\nY_{00}^* is (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)).\n\nY_{10} is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8, so Y_{10}^2 is (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nThus, the product Y_{00}^* * Y_{10} * Y_{10} is (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nIntegrate over the sphere (\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0, \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0):\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * \u222b0^2\u03c0 d\u03c6 \u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 \n\nThe \u03c6 integral is 2\u03c0.\n\nThe \u03b8 integral:\n\n\u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = [ -cos\u00b3\u03b8 / 3 ] from 0 to \u03c0 \n\n= [ - ( (-1)^3 ) /3 - ( -1^3 /3 ) ] ?\n\nWait, let me substitute u=cos\u03b8, du = -sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. When \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1.\n\nIntegral becomes \u222b_{1}^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3]_{-1}^1 = (1/3 - (-1/3)) = 2/3.\n\nThus, the integral over \u03b8 is 2/3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, no:\n\nWait the integral over \u03c6 gives 2\u03c0, so:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0))*(3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nThe constants from Y's: (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \n\nMultiply by the integrals:\n\n2\u03c0 (from \u03c6) * (2/3) (from \u03b8) \n\nSo:\n\nTotal = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * 3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe 3 in numerator cancels with the 3 in denominator.\n\nThe \u03c0 terms: 4\u03c0 in denominator and 2\u03c0 numerator \u2192 2/(4) = 1/2.\n\nThe remaining terms: 2/ (sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me compute numerators and denominators:\n\nNumerator factors:\n\n1 (from 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \n\n3 (from 3/(4\u03c0)) \n\n2\u03c0 (from \u03c6 integral) \n\n2 (from 2/3 after the 3 cancels)\n\nDenominator factors:\n\nsqrt(4\u03c0) \n\n4\u03c0 (from the 3/(4\u03c0) term)\n\n3 (from the 2/3 term, but already canceled)\n\nWait this is getting too confusing. Let me compute the numerical value step by step:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n(1/(sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\n= (1/(sqrt(4\u03c0))) * (3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * 2/3) \n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n3 cancels with 3 \u2192 1.\n\nThe 4\u03c0 in the denominator and 2\u03c0 in numerator \u2192 2/(4) = 1/2.\n\nThe remaining 2 from the 2/3 after cancellation?\n\nWait, 2\u03c0 * 2/3 = (4/3) \u03c0. Wait, perhaps I need to track:\n\n3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 = (3 * 2\u03c0)/(4\u03c0) ) = 3/2 * (\u03c0/\u03c0) \u2192 3/2 * 1/2? Wait, sorry:\n\nWait:\n\n3/(4\u03c0) multiplied by 2\u03c0 gives (3*2\u03c0)/(4\u03c0) = 3/2.\n\nThen multiply by the remaining 2/3 (from the theta integral's 2/3):\n\n3/2 * 2/3 = 1.\n\nThus the total is (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 1 \n\nSo the angular integral is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nBut the angular part of the matrix element is this integral multiplied by the radial integral. However, the radial part for this transition would also be involved. \n\nBut the key point here is that the angular part for the transition from l'=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0 has a non-zero value (since the integral is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), so it is allowed. \n\nWait but earlier I thought the CG coefficient was zero, but this calculation shows that the angular integral is non-zero. \n\nHmm, so my earlier conclusion that the CG coefficient was zero was wrong. The integral does give a non-zero value, so the transition is allowed. \n\nTherefore, the path through m'=0 is allowed. \n\nNow, what about the other paths, like m'=+1? \n\nConsider the path through |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. \n\nThe second transition here is from l'=1, m'=1 to l=0, m=0. \n\nThe dipole operator must change m by -1, so the dipole component must have m_dip = -1 (the x-iy component). \n\nThe angular part here would involve the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,1} (since the dipole's component with m_dip=-1 is Y_{1,-1}). \n\nThe angular integral would be:\n\n\u27e80 0 | r_{-1} |1 1\u27e9, where r_{-1} is the dipole component with m_dip=-1. \n\nThe angular part is the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,1} d\u03a9. \n\nY_{00} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). Y_{1,-1} is proportional to e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8, and Y_{1,1} is proportional to e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. \n\nThe product Y_{1,-1} * Y_{1,1} would involve e^{-i\u03c6} * e^{i\u03c6} = 1, and sin\u03b8 * sin\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nThus, the integrand becomes (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * (constant terms) * sin\u00b2\u03b8. \n\nThe integral over \u03c6 would be 2\u03c0, and the integral over \u03b8 would be \u222b0^\u03c0 sin\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u222b0^\u03c0 sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8. \n\nThe integral of sin\u00b3\u03b8 is 4/3 (I think). \n\nBut the key point is that the angular part is non-zero. \n\nThe angular part for this transition (m'=1 to m=0) would also be non-zero, so this path is allowed. \n\nTherefore, all three paths (m'=0, \u00b11) are allowed for the first transition, and each can proceed to the final state. \n\nNow, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities for each step. Assuming that the radial matrix elements are the same for all first transitions (since they're between the same n values and same l, just different m), and similarly for the second transitions. \n\nThe angular factors for the first transition (to m'=0, \u00b11) are the same (each has a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient of 1, leading to the same angular part), so the first step has equal probabilities for each m'. \n\nThe second step: \n\nFor the path through m'=0, the second transition's angular part is proportional to the integral we computed earlier (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), but let's consider the squared angular part. \n\nWait, perhaps the angular part for the first path (m'=0) is different from the others. \n\nThe angular part of the first transition (3\u21922,1,0) has an angular factor of 1 (from the CG coefficient being 1). The second transition (2,1,0\u21921,0,0) has an angular factor of the integral we computed, which was 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) but multiplied by other constants. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the probabilities being proportional to the squares of the angular parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total probability for the path through m'=0 is proportional to (1)^2 * (1)^2 (if the angular parts squared are 1 for both steps), but that may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives options with specific probabilities, maybe the answer is that the probability for the path through m'=0 is 1/3 because there are three possible paths (m'= -1, 0, +1) and they all have equal probabilities. \n\nAssuming that each of the three possible intermediate states has an equal probability, then the probability for each path is 1/3. \n\nTherefore, option A has the path through m'=0 and probability 1/3, which matches. \n\nThe other options B and C have paths through m'=1 and m'=-1, but their probabilities are given as 1/4, which doesn't fit with the 1/3. \n\nOption D's path is the same as A but with probability 2/3, which would not be the case if all three paths are equally probable. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nThe question involves determining the valid transition path and probability for the hydrogen atom transitioning from the |3,0,0\u27e9 state to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Selection Rules**: \n   - Dipole transitions require \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. \n   - Parity must change (since parity is (-1)^l, transitions must alternate parity).\n\n2. **Intermediate State**:\n   - The initial state |3,0,0\u27e9 (l=0, even parity) must transition to an intermediate state with l=1 (odd parity). The final state |1,0,0\u27e9 (l=0, even parity) requires the intermediate state to have l=1.\n\n3. **Possible Paths**:\n   - The intermediate state can be |2,1,m\u27e9 where m = -1, 0, +1. \n   - Each path must obey \u0394m rules and parity changes.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - The first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9 (m = -1, 0, +1) has equal angular contributions due to symmetry, leading to three equally probable paths.\n   - The second transition from each intermediate state to |1,0,0\u27e9 is also allowed and has the same probability for each m. \n\n5. **Given Options**:\n   - **Option A** specifies the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3. This aligns with the equal probability distribution among three paths (1/3 each).\n   - Options B and C incorrectly state probabilities of 1/4, and Option D's probability (2/3) contradicts the equal distribution.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A**, as it matches the valid path and probability.\n\nAnswer: A",
