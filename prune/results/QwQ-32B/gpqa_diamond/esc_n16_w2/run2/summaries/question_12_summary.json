      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in this decay: Pi(+) decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is stationary, which probably means it's at rest. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 for the pion and 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2 for the muon. The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible, but I should remember that.\n\nHmm, right, in particle decays like this, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay should be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nLet me recall the formula for energy in terms of momentum and mass. The total energy of a particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). Since the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero (assuming it's a massless particle here), its energy would just be pc. \n\nLet me set up variables. Let the pion's rest mass be M = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, and the muon's mass m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's mass m\u03bd is zero. \n\nThe initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: M c\u00b2 = 139.6 MeV. Since it's at rest, all the energy after decay must come from this. The total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. \n\nAlso, since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal. Let's call their momentum magnitude p. So the muon's momentum is p in one direction, and the neutrino's is p in the opposite direction.\n\nSo the energy of the muon is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p c. \n\nAdding those together gives the total energy after decay, which must equal the pion's rest energy. \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) + p c = M c\u00b2\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by c\u00b2 to simplify units maybe? Let me think in terms of energy variables. Let me set variables without c for simplicity (using natural units where c=1). So then:\n\nsqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 ) + p = M \n\nWhere all masses and energies are in units of MeV, and p is in MeV/c. Wait, actually, maybe better to work in natural units where c=1. Let me rephrase the equation in terms of energy:\n\nMuon energy E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 )\n\nNeutrino energy E_nu = p \n\nTotal energy: E_mu + E_nu = M \n\nSo substituting:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) + p = M \n\nI need to solve for p here. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = M - p \n\nThen square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m\u00b2 = (M - p)^2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M p + p\u00b2 \n\nCancel p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M p \n\nThen solving for p:\n\n2 M p = M\u00b2 - m\u00b2 \n\np = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M) \n\nPlugging in the numbers: M = 139.6, m = 105.7.\n\nCalculating numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 \n\nHmm, that's a difference of squares. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 139.6 squared: Let me compute 140^2 = 19600, subtract (0.4)^2 and cross terms. Wait, maybe easier to calculate directly. \n\n139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16 \n\nSimilarly 105.7 squared: Let me compute 100 +5.7 squared: (105.7)^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000+1140 is 11140 +32.49 is 11172.49 \n\nSo the numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's subtract:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49 \n\nSubtract 11172 from 19488: 19488-11172=8316. Then subtract the remaining 0.49: 8316.16 -0.49= 8315.67 ?\n\nWait, wait, actually, 19488.16 minus 11172.49: \n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49)\n= 8316 - 0.33\n= 8315.67 ?\n\nWait, 0.16 -0.49 is -0.33, so 8316 -0.33 is 8315.67. So numerator is 8315.67 (MeV)^2?\n\nWait, but actually, the units here: since the masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, when squared, it's (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV. Wait, but in natural units, perhaps I should think in terms of energy squared. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful with units here. Alternatively, since we are working with energy variables where c is 1, so the units are consistent here. \n\nAnyway, moving on. The denominator is 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2 \n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, approximate to see. Let me see: 8315.67 / 279.2. \n\nWell, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, so subtract a bit. \n\nThe difference between 8376 and 8315.67 is about 60.33. So 60.33 /279.2 per unit. So 30 - (60.33 /279.2) \u2248 30 - 0.216 \u2248 29.784. Hmm, so approximately 29.78 MeV/c ?\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me recalculate the numerator again.\n\nWait, 139.6 squared was 19488.16? Let me check again:\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140*140 =19600. Subtract 0.4*140*2 (because (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 where a=140, b=0.4). Wait, no, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16. That's correct.\n\nThen 105.7 squared: 105.7^2. Let me check again. 105 squared is 11025, plus 0.7^2 and cross terms?\n\nWait, 105.7 squared is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49. 10000+1140=11140; 11140+32.49=11172.49. Correct.\n\nSo 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67. So that's correct.\n\nThen denominator 2*139.6 = 279.2. \n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute this division more accurately. \n\nLet me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8 \n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8 \n\nBut 29*279.2 = 8096.8. \n\nThe numerator is 8315.67. \n\nSo 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. \n\nSo 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.784 \n\nSo total p =29 +0.784 \u224829.784 MeV/c. \n\nSo approximately 29.78 MeV/c. \n\nHmm, so p \u224829.78 MeV/c. \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but in natural units that's just p. So E_nu = 29.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 ). Let's compute that. \n\np squared is (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30\u00b2 is 900, so 29.78 is a bit less, so 29.78\u00b2 \u2248 29.78*29.78. Let's compute 30-0.22 squared: (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 \u2248 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484). \n\nm squared is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 (MeV)^2. \n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, in natural units, m is in MeV, so m\u00b2 is (105.7)^2, but the p squared is (29.78)^2. Wait, but adding p\u00b2 (in MeV/c)^2 and m\u00b2 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here in units. \n\nHold on, perhaps I need to be more careful with units. \n\nWait, in natural units where c=1, then the units for mass is energy (like MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2 gives MeV). So in natural units, mass is m c\u00b2, which would be in MeV. So when I write E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), where m is m_mu * c\u00b2, and p is in units of MeV/c. Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of energy variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of energy. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe rest mass of the pion is M = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThe rest mass of the muon is m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThe neutrino's mass is negligible, so m_nu =0. \n\nThe pion is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let\u2019s denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. \n\nThe energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nThe energy of the neutrino is E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + 0 ) = p c \n\nThe total energy must equal the rest energy of the pion: E_mu + E_nu = M c\u00b2 \n\nLet me use variables in terms of c=1 (natural units). Then, \n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo equation: sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) + p = M \n\nWe can proceed as before. \n\nSo solving for p gives p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M) \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM =139.6, m=105.7.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \n\nDenominator: 2*139.6 =279.2 \n\np=8315.67 /279.2 \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, the units for p here would be (MeV)/c, but when multiplied by c gives MeV for energy?)\n\nWait, in natural units, p is in MeV/c, so E_nu = p*c would be in MeV. So the calculation is okay. \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, and the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute 29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2. Let me calculate 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2 is ~0.6, cross term 2*29*0.78 =45.24. So total (29 +0.78)^2 = 29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.78 +0.78\u00b2 \u2248841 +45.24 +0.6084\u2248886.8484. \n\nThen m squared is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49. \n\nWait, but wait, in natural units, m is 105.7 MeV (since m c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV, so m in natural units is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 =105.7 MeV. So m\u00b2 is (105.7)^2. \n\nSo p squared is (29.78)^2 \u2248886.8484, and m squared is 11172.49. \n\nWait, adding p squared and m squared gives 886.8484 +11172.49 \u224812059.34. The square root of that is sqrt(12059.34). Let me compute that. \n\nHmm sqrt(12059.34). Well, 110 squared is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is just a bit less than 110. Let's see: 110^2=12100, so 12059.34 is 40.66 less. \n\nApproximate sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 - (40.66)/(2*110) \u2248 110 - 0.185 \u2248109.815. \n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 +m\u00b2) \u2248109.8 MeV. \n\nTherefore the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. \n\nNow, the total energy should be 109.8 +29.78 = 139.58 MeV, which matches the pion's rest energy (139.6), so that checks out. \n\nNow, the question asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. \n\nSo KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2. Since in natural units, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. \n\nSo KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy, which is zero (since mass is negligible). So KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated (4.1 and 29.78). So probably D is the answer. \n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, when I calculated p, I had 8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do that more accurately. \n\n8315.67 /279.2: \n\n279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2 =8096.8 \n\nSo 29 gives 8096.8, but the numerator is 8315.67. \n\nThe difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 =218.87 \n\nSo 218.87 divided by 279.2 per 1 unit. \n\n218.87 /279.2 \u22480.784. So total p=29.784. So that's correct. \n\nThen E_mu is sqrt(29.784\u00b2 +105.7\u00b2). Let me compute 29.784 squared exactly: \n\n29.784 squared: \n\nLet me compute 29.784^2: \n\n= (30 -0.216)^2 \n\n= 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.216 +0.216\u00b2 \n\n=900 -12.96 +0.046656 \n\n=900 -12.96 =887.04 +0.046656\u2248887.086656 \n\nAdding that to m squared (105.7^2=11172.49) gives 887.086656 +11172.49 = 12059.576656 \n\nThe square root of that is sqrt(12059.576656). \n\nLet me see, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.58) is 110 - (12100-12059.58)/(2*110) \n\nThe difference is 12100-12059.58=40.42 \n\nSo delta = -40.42/(2*110)= -40.42/220 \u2248-0.1837 \n\nSo sqrt \u2248110 -0.1837\u2248109.816 MeV. \n\nThus E_mu is ~109.816 MeV \n\nSubtract the muon's rest mass energy (105.7 MeV) gives KE_mu =109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV \u22484.12 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's KE is 29.784 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV. \n\nSo the correct option is D: 4.12 and 29.8. \n\nLet me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nYes, D matches exactly. \n\nTherefore the answer is D.\n",

Then subtract the remaining 0.49: 8316.16 -0.49= 8315.67 ?\n\nWait, wait, actually, 19488.16 minus 11172.49: \n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n19488.16\n-11172.49\n= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49)\n= 8316 - 0.33\n= 8315.67 ?\n\nWait, 0.16 -0.49 is -0.33, so 8316 -0.33 is 8315.67. So numerator is 8315.67 (MeV)^2?\n\nWait, but actually, the units here: since the masses are in MeV/c\u00b2, when squared, it's (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, they become MeV. Wait, but in natural units, perhaps I should think in terms of energy squared. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful with units here. Alternatively, since we are working with energy variables where c is 1, so the units are consistent here. \n\nAnyway, moving on. The denominator is 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2 \n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, approximate to see. Let me see: 8315.67 / 279.2. \n\nWell, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, so subtract a bit. \n\nThe difference between 8376 and 8315.67 is about 60.33. So 60.33 /279.2 per unit. So 30 - (60.33 /279.2) \u2248 30 - 0.216 \u2248 29.784. Hmm, so approximately 29.78 MeV/c ?\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me recalculate the numerator again.\n\nWait, 139.6 squared was 19488.16? Let me check again:\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140*140 =19600. Subtract 0.4*140*2 (because (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2 where a=140, b=0.4). Wait, no, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 -112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16. That's correct.\n\nThen 105.7 squared: 105.7^2. Let me check again. 105 squared is 11025, plus 0.7^2 and cross terms?\n\nWait, 105.7 squared is (100 +5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49. 10000+1140=11140; 11140+32.49=11172.49. Correct.\n\nSo 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67. So that's correct.\n\nThen denominator 2*139.6 = 279.2. \n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute this division more accurately. \n\nLet me see, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8 \n\nWait, 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8 \n\nBut 29*279.2 = 8096.8. \n\nThe numerator is 8315.67. \n\nSo 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87. \n\nSo 218.87 /279.2 \u2248 0.784 \n\nSo total p =29 +0.784 \u224829.784 MeV/c. \n\nSo approximately 29.78 MeV/c. \n\nHmm, so p \u224829.78 MeV/c. \n\nNow, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, but in natural units that's just p. So E_nu = 29.78 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 ). Let's compute that. \n\np squared is (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30\u00b2 is 900, so 29.78 is a bit less, so 29.78\u00b2 \u2248 29.78*29.78. Let's compute 30-0.22 squared: (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22\u00b2 \u2248 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484). \n\nm squared is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 (MeV)^2. \n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, in natural units, m is in MeV, so m\u00b2 is (105.7)^2, but the p squared is (29.78)^2. Wait, but adding p\u00b2 (in MeV/c)^2 and m\u00b2 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here in units. \n\nHold on, perhaps I need to be more careful with units. \n\nWait, in natural units where c=1, then the units for mass is energy (like MeV/c\u00b2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2 gives MeV). So in natural units, mass is m c\u00b2, which would be in MeV. So when I write E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), where m is m_mu * c\u00b2, and p is in units of MeV/c. Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of energy variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of energy. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe rest mass of the pion is M = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThe rest mass of the muon is m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nThe neutrino's mass is negligible, so m_nu =0. \n\nThe pion is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let\u2019s denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. \n\nThe energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 )\n\nThe energy of the neutrino is E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + 0 ) = p c \n\nThe total energy must equal the rest energy of the pion: E_mu + E_nu = M c\u00b2 \n\nLet me use variables in terms of c=1 (natural units). Then, \n\nE_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 )\n\nE_nu = p \n\nSo equation: sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) + p = M \n\nWe can proceed as before. \n\nSo solving for p gives p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M) \n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM =139.6, m=105.7.\n\nCompute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \n\nDenominator: 2*139.6 =279.2 \n\np=8315.67 /279.2 \u224829.78 MeV/c (since in natural units, the units for p here would be (MeV)/c, but when multiplied by c gives MeV for energy?)\n\nWait, in natural units, p is in MeV/c, so E_nu = p*c would be in MeV. So the calculation is okay. \n\nSo the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, and the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, compute 29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2. Let me calculate 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2 is ~0.6, cross term 2*29*0.78 =45.24. So total (29 +0.78)^2 = 29\u00b2 + 2*29*0.78 +0.78\u00b2 \u2248841 +45.24 +0.6084\u2248886.8484. \n\nThen m squared is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49. \n\nWait, but wait, in natural units, m is 105.7 MeV (since m c\u00b2 is 105.7 MeV, so m in natural units is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 =105.7 MeV. So m\u00b2 is (105.7)^2. \n\nSo p squared is (29.78)^2 \u2248886.8484, and m squared is 11172.49. \n\nWait, adding p squared and m squared gives 886.8484 +11172.49 \u224812059.34. The square root of that is sqrt(12059.34). Let me compute that. \n\nHmm sqrt(12059.34). Well, 110 squared is 12100, so sqrt(12059) is just a bit less than 110. Let's see: 110^2=12100, so 12059.34 is 40.66 less. \n\nApproximate sqrt(12100 -40.66) \u2248 110 - (40.66)/(2*110) \u2248 110 - 0.185 \u2248109.815. \n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 +m\u00b2) \u2248109.8 MeV. \n\nTherefore the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV. \n\nNow, the total energy should be 109.8 +29.78 = 139.58 MeV, which matches the pion's rest energy (139.6), so that checks out. \n\nNow, the question asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. \n\nSo KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2. Since in natural units, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. \n\nSo KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy, which is zero (since mass is negligible). So KE_nu = E_nu =29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated (4.1 and 29.78). So probably D is the answer. \n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, when I calculated p, I had 8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do that more accurately. \n\n8315.67 /279.2: \n\n279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2 =8096.8 \n\nSo 29 gives 8096.8, but the numerator is 8315.67. \n\nThe difference is 8315.67 -8096.8 =218.87 \n\nSo 218.87 divided by 279.2 per 1 unit. \n\n218.87 /279.2 \u22480.784. So total p=29.784. So that's correct. \n\nThen E_mu is sqrt(29.784\u00b2 +105.7\u00b2). Let me compute 29.784 squared exactly: \n\n29.784 squared: \n\nLet me compute 29.784^2: \n\n= (30 -0.216)^2 \n\n= 30\u00b2 -2*30*0.216 +0.216\u00b2 \n\n=900 -12.96 +0.046656 \n\n=900 -12.96 =887.04 +0.046656\u2248887.086656 \n\nAdding that to m squared (105.7^2=11172.49) gives 887.086656 +11172.49 = 12059.576656 \n\nThe square root of that is sqrt(12059.576656). \n\nLet me see, 110^2 is 12100, so sqrt(12059.58) is 110 - (12100-12059.58)/(2*110) \n\nThe difference is 12100-12059.58=40.42 \n\nSo delta = -40.42/(2*110)= -40.42/220 \u2248-0.1837 \n\nSo sqrt \u2248110 -0.1837\u2248109.816 MeV. \n\nThus E_mu is ~109.816 MeV \n\nSubtract the muon's rest mass energy (105.7 MeV) gives KE_mu =109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV \u22484.12 MeV. \n\nThe neutrino's KE is 29.784 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV. \n\nSo the correct option is D: 4.12 and 29.8. \n\nLet me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nYes, D matches exactly. \n\nTherefore the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino in the decay \\( \\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu \\), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so the total momentum of the products must be zero, implying equal and opposite momenta for the muon and neutrino. \n\nLet \\( M = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\) (pion's rest mass) and \\( m = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\) (muon's rest mass). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible. \n\nUsing energy conservation:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{p^2 + m^2} + p = M\n\\]\nSolving for \\( p \\):\n\\[\np = \\frac{M^2 - m^2}{2M}\n\\]\nPlugging in values:\n\\[\np = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}/c\n\\]\nThe neutrino's energy (KE) is \\( p c \\approx 29.8 \\, \\text{MeV} \\). The muon's energy is:\n\\[\nE_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\approx 109.8 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\nSubtracting the muon's rest energy gives its KE:\n\\[\n\\text{KE}_\\mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \\, \\text{MeV} \\, (\\approx 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV})\n\\]\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The problem states that the pion is stationary, right? The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible since they usually have very tiny masses, maybe even considered zero for this problem? Hmm, I should check if that's a valid assumption here.\n\nAlright, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum of the muon and neutrino must also be zero. That means their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So momentum conservation gives p_mu = p_nu in magnitude. \n\nNow, energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c\u00b2. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies can be written using the relativistic energy equation: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nLet me note down the variables. Let me denote the muon's mass as m_mu and the neutrino's mass as m_nu. Since neutrinos are massless in many approximations, maybe m_nu is zero here. The problem doesn't give a mass for the neutrino, so I think that's a safe assumption. \n\nSo the total energy after decay would be E_mu + E_nu = (m_pi c\u00b2). \n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its energy is just E_nu = p_nu * c. And since p_mu = p_nu (from momentum conservation), then E_nu = p_mu * c. \n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nSo substituting E_nu = p_mu c into the energy equation: sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) + p_mu c = m_pi c\u00b2. \n\nHmm, I need to solve for p_mu here. Let me denote variables without c for simplicity, assuming units where c=1. Let me rewrite the equation as:\n\nsqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + p_mu = m_pi\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + p_mu = m_pi\n\nLet me call p_mu as p for simplicity. Then:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi\n\nLet me isolate the square root term:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p\n\nNow square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p\n\nThen solving for p:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2\n\np = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2) / (2 m_pi)\n\nHmm, okay. That gives the momentum of the muon. Then the neutrino has the same magnitude, so p_nu = p_mu = p.\n\nOnce I have p, I can find the energy of each particle. For the muon, its total energy E_mu is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), and we know p = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi), plugging that in might be messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the kinetic energy of each particle. The kinetic energy K is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon:\n\nK_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = [sqrt(p\u00b2 c^4 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) ] - m_mu c\u00b2 \n\nBut again, maybe using the variables without c for simplicity. Let me see:\n\nWait, let's think in terms of units where c=1, so all masses are in energy units (since E=mc\u00b2). Then m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. \n\nSo m_pi squared is (139.6)^2, m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. \n\nCalculating p:\n\np = ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 )\n\nLet me compute numerator first:\n\n139.6\u00b2 = Let's calculate 140\u00b2 is 19600, subtract (0.4)^2 and cross terms. Wait maybe better to compute exact numbers.\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139.6 * 139.6:\n\nLet me compute 139^2 = 19321, then 0.6^2 = 0.36, and cross terms 2*139*0.6 = 166.8\n\nWait perhaps easier:\n\n139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16?\n\nWait 140 squared is 19600. Then subtract 2*140*0.4 = 2*140 is 280, 280*0.4 is 112. So yes, 19600 - 112 = 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. So 139.6\u00b2 = 19488.16 (MeV)^2 ?\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared:\n\n105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000 + 1140 is 11140, plus 32.49 is 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator is (19488.16 - 11172.49) = 19488.16 minus 11172.49.\n\nLet me subtract:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49: \n\n19488.16 - 11000 = 8488.16\n\nThen subtract 172.49 more: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67?\n\nWait, 11172.49 is 11000 + 172.49. So yes. So the numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, approximate:\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than numerator 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, so 30 minus (8376 -8315.67)/279.2\n\nWait maybe better to do 8315.67 / 279.2:\n\nLet me see 279.2 * 29.7 = ?\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, so subtract 0.3 * 279.2 = 83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76 = 8292.24. Still higher than 8315.67? Wait no, 29.7 would be 29.7 * 279.2.\n\nWait perhaps this is getting too calculation-heavy. Alternatively, let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nLet me approximate 279.2 \u2248 280, so 8315.67 / 280 \u2248 29.7 MeV. Hmm. Let me see:\n\n280 * 29.7 = 280*(30 -0.3) = 8400 - 84 = 8316. So yes, approximately 29.7. So p \u2248 29.7 MeV/c (since the units here are in terms of MeV? Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, the momentum p would have units of MeV/c divided by c? Hmm, maybe I need to be careful with units here. Wait, perhaps in these units, p is in units of MeV/c. Because energy is MeV, and p*c has units MeV. So p would be (MeV)/c. So the calculation gives p \u224829.7 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but let me check again with exact numbers:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nLet me compute 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30 -0.3) = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2*0.3=83.76 \u2192 8376-83.76=8292.24. The numerator is 8315.67. So the difference between 8315.67 and 8292.24 is 23.43. So 23.43 /279.2 \u2248 0.0839. So total is 29.7 + 0.0839 \u2248 29.7839. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute p squared: (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30\u00b2 is 900, subtract (0.22)^2 and cross terms?)\n\nAlternatively, 29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484.\n\nm_mu squared is 105.7\u00b2 = 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo E_mu squared is 886.8484 + 11172.49 \u2248 12059.34.\n\nTaking square root of that gives sqrt(12059.34). Let's see sqrt(12059) is approx 109.8 MeV? Wait, sqrt(12100) is 110, so sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Let me compute 109.8 squared: 109.8\u00b2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 +0.04 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.34. So the square root is approximately 109.8 + (12059.34-12056.04)/(2*109.8). The difference is 3.3. So 3.3/(219.6) \u2248 0.015. So approx 109.815 MeV. So E_mu \u2248109.8 MeV.\n\nThen the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, that's close to option D's first value (4.12 MeV). \n\nNow the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p*c (since it's massless). Since in our units where c=1, that's just p. So E_nu = p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe total energy of the system is E_mu + E_nu \u2248 109.8 +29.78 = 139.58 MeV, which is very close to the pion's rest mass (139.6), so that checks out.\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is (4.12, 29.8), which matches these numbers. Let me check other options. Option A's second value is 26.8, which is too low. B's second is 32.8, which is higher. C's second is 20.8. So D seems right.\n\nWait, but let me verify again the calculations step by step because sometimes I might have messed up a number.\n\nFirst, p calculation:\n\np = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nm_pi =139.6 MeV, m_mu=105.7.\n\nSo m_pi squared: 139.6^2 = let's compute 139.6*139.6:\n\nLet me do 140*140 = 19600. Then subtract (140 -139.6)* (140 +139.6) + (0.4)^2? Wait, maybe better to compute (a - b)^2 where a=140, b=0.4.\n\nWait 139.6 = 140 -0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 - 112 +0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. Correct.\n\nm_mu squared is 105.7 squared. Let me compute that again:\n\n105.7 *105.7:\n\n105^2 = 11025, 0.7^2 =0.49, cross term 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2=105\u00b2 +2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 =11025+147 +0.49=11172.49. Correct.\n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67.\n\nDenominator 2*139.6 =279.2.\n\nSo 8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do exact division:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, that's under 8315.67. 29 gives 8096.8. The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87. Then, 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approx 0.784. So total p is 29.784, so ~29.78. So that's correct.\n\nThen E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nWait, p is in MeV/c (assuming units where c=1, so p is in MeV/c, and m_mu is in MeV/c\u00b2. So when squared, (p c)^2 is (29.78)^2 (MeV)^2, and (m_mu c^2)^2 is (105.7)^2 (MeV)^2. So sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) gives MeV. So yes, as above.\n\nSo 29.78 squared is approx 887, plus 105.7 squared (11172.49) gives 12059.49. Square root is approx 109.8. \n\nThen K_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. That's exactly the first value in D (4.12 is close, maybe due to more precise calculation).\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p (since E_nu = pc when m_nu=0). So 29.78 MeV. So its kinetic energy is same as total energy, so 29.78, which rounds to 29.8 MeV. So D's second value matches.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The problem states that the pion is stationary, right? The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and mu+ is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible since they usually have very tiny masses, maybe even considered zero for this problem? Hmm, I should check if that's a valid assumption here.\n\nAlright, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum of the muon and neutrino must also be zero. That means their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So momentum conservation gives p_mu = p_nu in magnitude. \n\nNow, energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c\u00b2. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies can be written using the relativistic energy equation: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nLet me note down the variables. Let me denote the muon's mass as m_mu and the neutrino's mass as m_nu. Since neutrinos are massless in many approximations, maybe m_nu is zero here. The problem doesn't give a mass for the neutrino, so I think that's a safe assumption. \n\nSo the total energy after decay would be E_mu + E_nu = (m_pi c\u00b2). \n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its energy is just E_nu = p_nu * c. And since p_mu = p_nu (from momentum conservation), then E_nu = p_mu * c. \n\nThe muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nSo substituting E_nu = p_mu c into the energy equation: sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) + p_mu c = m_pi c\u00b2. \n\nHmm, I need to solve for p_mu here. Let me denote variables without c for simplicity, assuming units where c=1. Let me rewrite the equation as:\n\nsqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + p_mu = m_pi\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( p_mu\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 ) + p_mu = m_pi\n\nLet me call p_mu as p for simplicity. Then:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) + p = m_pi\n\nLet me isolate the square root term:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = m_pi - p\n\nNow square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p + p\u00b2\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm_mu\u00b2 = m_pi\u00b2 - 2 m_pi p\n\nThen solving for p:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2\n\np = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2) / (2 m_pi)\n\nHmm, okay. That gives the momentum of the muon. Then the neutrino has the same magnitude, so p_nu = p_mu = p.\n\nOnce I have p, I can find the energy of each particle. For the muon, its total energy E_mu is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2), and we know p = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi), plugging that in might be messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the kinetic energy of each particle. The kinetic energy K is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So for the muon:\n\nK_mu = E_mu - m_mu c\u00b2 = [sqrt(p\u00b2 c^4 + (m_mu c\u00b2)^2 ) ] - m_mu c\u00b2 \n\nBut again, maybe using the variables without c for simplicity. Let me see:\n\nWait, let's think in terms of units where c=1, so all masses are in energy units (since E=mc\u00b2). Then m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. \n\nSo m_pi squared is (139.6)^2, m_mu squared is (105.7)^2. \n\nCalculating p:\n\np = ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / ( 2 * 139.6 )\n\nLet me compute numerator first:\n\n139.6\u00b2 = Let's calculate 140\u00b2 is 19600, subtract (0.4)^2 and cross terms. Wait maybe better to compute exact numbers.\n\n139.6 squared:\n\n139.6 * 139.6:\n\nLet me compute 139^2 = 19321, then 0.6^2 = 0.36, and cross terms 2*139*0.6 = 166.8\n\nWait perhaps easier:\n\n139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16?\n\nWait 140 squared is 19600. Then subtract 2*140*0.4 = 2*140 is 280, 280*0.4 is 112. So yes, 19600 - 112 = 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. So 139.6\u00b2 = 19488.16 (MeV)^2 ?\n\nSimilarly, 105.7 squared:\n\n105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7\u00b2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000 + 1140 is 11140, plus 32.49 is 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator is (19488.16 - 11172.49) = 19488.16 minus 11172.49.\n\nLet me subtract:\n\n19488.16 - 11172.49: \n\n19488.16 - 11000 = 8488.16\n\nThen subtract 172.49 more: 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67?\n\nWait, 11172.49 is 11000 + 172.49. So yes. So the numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo p = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, approximate:\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than numerator 8315.67. So 30 would give 8376, so 30 minus (8376 -8315.67)/279.2\n\nWait maybe better to do 8315.67 / 279.2:\n\nLet me see 279.2 * 29.7 = ?\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, so subtract 0.3 * 279.2 = 83.76 \u2192 8376 -83.76 = 8292.24. Still higher than 8315.67? Wait no, 29.7 would be 29.7 * 279.2.\n\nWait perhaps this is getting too calculation-heavy. Alternatively, let me compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nLet me approximate 279.2 \u2248 280, so 8315.67 / 280 \u2248 29.7 MeV. Hmm. Let me see:\n\n280 * 29.7 = 280*(30 -0.3) = 8400 - 84 = 8316. So yes, approximately 29.7. So p \u2248 29.7 MeV/c (since the units here are in terms of MeV? Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, the momentum p would have units of MeV/c divided by c? Hmm, maybe I need to be careful with units here. Wait, perhaps in these units, p is in units of MeV/c. Because energy is MeV, and p*c has units MeV. So p would be (MeV)/c. So the calculation gives p \u224829.7 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but let me check again with exact numbers:\n\n8315.67 divided by 279.2:\n\nLet me compute 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30 -0.3) = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2*0.3=83.76 \u2192 8376-83.76=8292.24. The numerator is 8315.67. So the difference between 8315.67 and 8292.24 is 23.43. So 23.43 /279.2 \u2248 0.0839. So total is 29.7 + 0.0839 \u2248 29.7839. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u224829.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute p squared: (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (since 30\u00b2 is 900, subtract (0.22)^2 and cross terms?)\n\nAlternatively, 29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.22\u00b2 = 900 -13.2 +0.0484 \u2248 886.8484.\n\nm_mu squared is 105.7\u00b2 = 11172.49 as before.\n\nSo E_mu squared is 886.8484 + 11172.49 \u2248 12059.34.\n\nTaking square root of that gives sqrt(12059.34). Let's see sqrt(12059) is approx 109.8 MeV? Wait, sqrt(12100) is 110, so sqrt(12059) is about 109.8. Let me compute 109.8 squared: 109.8\u00b2 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 +0.04 = 12056.04. Close to 12059.34. So the square root is approximately 109.8 + (12059.34-12056.04)/(2*109.8). The difference is 3.3. So 3.3/(219.6) \u2248 0.015. So approx 109.815 MeV. So E_mu \u2248109.8 MeV.\n\nThen the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, that's close to option D's first value (4.12 MeV). \n\nNow the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p*c (since it's massless). Since in our units where c=1, that's just p. So E_nu = p \u224829.78 MeV. \n\nThe total energy of the system is E_mu + E_nu \u2248 109.8 +29.78 = 139.58 MeV, which is very close to the pion's rest mass (139.6), so that checks out.\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is (4.12, 29.8), which matches these numbers. Let me check other options. Option A's second value is 26.8, which is too low. B's second is 32.8, which is higher. C's second is 20.8. So D seems right.\n\nWait, but let me verify again the calculations step by step because sometimes I might have messed up a number.\n\nFirst, p calculation:\n\np = (m_pi\u00b2 - m_mu\u00b2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nm_pi =139.6 MeV, m_mu=105.7.\n\nSo m_pi squared: 139.6^2 = let's compute 139.6*139.6:\n\nLet me do 140*140 = 19600. Then subtract (140 -139.6)* (140 +139.6) + (0.4)^2? Wait, maybe better to compute (a - b)^2 where a=140, b=0.4.\n\nWait 139.6 = 140 -0.4. So (140 -0.4)^2 =140\u00b2 -2*140*0.4 +0.4\u00b2 =19600 - 112 +0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 gives 19488.16. Correct.\n\nm_mu squared is 105.7 squared. Let me compute that again:\n\n105.7 *105.7:\n\n105^2 = 11025, 0.7^2 =0.49, cross term 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 +0.7)^2=105\u00b2 +2*105*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 =11025+147 +0.49=11172.49. Correct.\n\nSo numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67.\n\nDenominator 2*139.6 =279.2.\n\nSo 8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let me do exact division:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 =8376 minus 279.2 \u2192 8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, that's under 8315.67. 29 gives 8096.8. The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87. Then, 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approx 0.784. So total p is 29.784, so ~29.78. So that's correct.\n\nThen E_mu = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_mu\u00b2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )\n\nWait, p is in MeV/c (assuming units where c=1, so p is in MeV/c, and m_mu is in MeV/c\u00b2. So when squared, (p c)^2 is (29.78)^2 (MeV)^2, and (m_mu c^2)^2 is (105.7)^2 (MeV)^2. So sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) gives MeV. So yes, as above.\n\nSo 29.78 squared is approx 887, plus 105.7 squared (11172.49) gives 12059.49. Square root is approx 109.8. \n\nThen K_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV. That's exactly the first value in D (4.12 is close, maybe due to more precise calculation).\n\nThe neutrino's energy is p (since E_nu = pc when m_nu=0). So 29.78 MeV. So its kinetic energy is same as total energy, so 29.78, which rounds to 29.8 MeV. So D's second value matches.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve for the kinetic energies of the muon (\u03bc\u207a) and neutrino (\u03bd) in the decay \u03c0\u207a \u2192 \u03bc\u207a + \u03bd, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is initially at rest, so total momentum is zero, implying the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. \n\n**Step 1: Momentum Conservation**  \nLet \\( p \\) be the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's momentum is also \\( p \\).\n\n**Step 2: Energy Conservation**  \nThe total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  \n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]  \nThe total energy after decay is the sum of the muon and neutrino energies:  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu} c^2)^2} + p c = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]  \nAssuming the neutrino is massless (\\( m_{\\nu} = 0 \\)), its energy simplifies to \\( E_{\\nu} = p c \\).\n\n**Step 3: Solve for Momentum \\( p \\)**  \nLet \\( m_{\\pi} = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\), \\( m_{\\mu} = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\). Using natural units (\\( c = 1 \\)):  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\\mu}^2} + p = m_{\\pi}.\n\\]  \nIsolate the square root term and square both sides:  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\\mu}^2} = m_{\\pi} - p \\implies p^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 = (m_{\\pi} - p)^2.\n\\]  \nExpanding and simplifying:  \n\\[\nm_{\\mu}^2 = m_{\\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\\pi} p \\implies p = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 - m_{\\mu}^2}{2 m_{\\pi}}.\n\\]  \nPlugging in values:  \n\\[\np = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} \\approx 29.8 \\, \\text{MeV}/c.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Energies**  \nMuon energy:  \n\\[\nE_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\\mu}^2} \\approx \\sqrt{(29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\approx 109.8 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]  \nMuon kinetic energy:  \n\\[\nK_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]  \nNeutrino energy (kinetic energy since massless):  \n\\[\nK_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = p c \\approx 29.8 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe closest option matching these results is **D** (4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV).\n\nAnswer: D",
