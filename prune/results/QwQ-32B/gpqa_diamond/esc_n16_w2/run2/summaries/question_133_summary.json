      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me try to work through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nHmm, right. Phosphate is a polyprotic acid, so its different forms depend on the pH. The salts here are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me recall their formulas. \n\nKH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula can be written as K+ H2PO4^- because when it dissociates, it gives K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. The sodium ions would dissociate, giving Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. \n\nThe problem is asking about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. That's the third deprotonated form of H3PO4. So, the orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, right? \n\nSo, the solution is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those two ions are present in the solution. Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-. Since PO4^3- is the next deprotonation step beyond HPO4^2-, maybe we need to consider the third dissociation (Ka3) here? \n\nLet me think. The two salts provided are KH2PO4 (providing H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (providing HPO4^2-). The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would be controlled by the second dissociation constant (Ka2). But the question is about PO4^3-, which is the next step. \n\nWait, but if the solution has HPO4^2- present, then the PO4^3- concentration would depend on the third dissociation (Ka3) of H3PO4. So, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, and that's governed by Ka3. \n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- using Ka3. \n\nBut since we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (from the first and second salts), the pH of the solution is going to be around the pKa2, which is the pH where the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are equal. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about PO4^3-, so maybe I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- based on the HPO4^2- concentration and the Ka3. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. \n\nStarting with KH2PO4: the molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So, moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007347 mol. \n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g, so moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. \n\nThe volume of the solution is 0.2 L. So the concentrations are: \n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.03674 M \n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.02809 M \n\nSo the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is about 0.02809 / 0.03674 \u2248 0.764. Since this is a buffer, the pH would be around pKa2. Let me calculate pKa2: \n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21 (since log(6.2) is ~0.79, so 8 - 0.79 = 7.21). \n\nSo the pH of the solution is around 7.21. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation of H3PO4, which is: \n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] \n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02809 M. The [H+] can be found from the pH. Since the pH is about 7.21, [H+] = 10^(-7.21) \u2248 6.17e-8 M. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 6.17e-8 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 5.056e-14 \n\nDivide by 6.17e-8: 5.056e-14 / 6.17e-8 \u2248 8.19e-7 M? Wait, that's not matching the options. Wait, let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the [H+]. Let me recalculate that. \n\npH = 7.21, so [H+] = 10^-7.21. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.21 is about 0.617 (since log(0.617) is about -0.21). So 1e-7 * 0.617 \u2248 6.17e-8 M. That's correct. \n\nSo 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = let's see, 1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.05056, so 0.05056e-12 = 5.056e-14. \n\nThen divide by 6.17e-8: \n\n5.056e-14 / 6.17e-8 = (5.056 /6.17) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.819 * 1e-6 = 8.19e-7? Hmm, but the options given are in the 1e-7 range. Wait, but 8.19e-7 is 8.19 x 10^-7, which is about 8.2e-7. Looking at the options: \n\nA) 6.24e-7 \n\nB)5.48e-7 \n\nC)2.81e-7 \n\nD)3.97e-7 \n\nHmm, my calculation gives ~8e-7, which isn't among the options. That suggests I made an error. \n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the formula for Ka3. Let me check the dissociation again. \n\nThe third dissociation of H3PO4 is HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3- and H+. So the correct expression for Ka3 is indeed [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M is not accurate. Because in the solution, there are also H+ and OH- ions from water, but since the solution is buffered, maybe the concentrations are as calculated. Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the pH isn't exactly pKa2. Because the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is not 1. \n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (pKa2) would be: \n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) \n\nSo plugging in the values: \n\npH = 7.21 + log(0.02809 / 0.03674) \n\nCompute the log of (0.02809/0.03674) = 0.764. \n\nlog(0.764) is approximately log(0.76) which is about -0.118. So pH \u2248 7.21 -0.118 = 7.09. \n\nSo the actual pH is around 7.09, not exactly pKa2. \n\nTherefore, [H+] would be 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.1e-8 (since 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^-7 *10^-0.09 \u2248 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8). \n\nSo maybe I miscalculated the pH earlier. Let me recalculate with the correct pH. \n\nSo pH = 7.09, so [H+] = 8.12e-8. \n\nNow, recompute [PO4^3-]: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \u2192 [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12 \n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M \n\n[H+] = 8.12e-8 \n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14 \n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8 \n\nSo 5.056e-14 / 8.12e-8 \u2248 (5.056 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\n5.056 divided by 8.12 is approximately 0.6225. \n\nSo 0.6225e-6 is 6.225e-7 M. \n\nAh! That's closer to option A (6.24e-7). \n\nHmm, so my initial mistake was assuming the pH was exactly pKa2, but actually, because the ratio of the concentrations isn't 1, the pH is a bit lower, leading to a higher [H+], which would decrease the [PO4^3-]. Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, if the pH is lower (7.09 vs 7.21), that means [H+] is higher (since pH is lower). So with higher [H+], then in the equation for Ka3, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+], so higher [H+] would lead to lower [PO4^3-]. Wait, but my calculation now gives 6.2e-7, which is option A. But let me check the exact calculation again. \n\nWait, let me redo the calculation step precisely. \n\nFirst, exact values:\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 \u2248 0.007347 mol. \n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. \n\nConcentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007347 /0.2 = 0.036735 M \n\nHPO4^2- is 0.005618 /0.2 = 0.02809 M \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch for the second dissociation (since that's the relevant buffer):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that exactly:\n\n6.2e-8 \u2192 log(6.2) is 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.1976 (since 8 -0.7924 = 7.2076? Wait wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). \n\nWait, the pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). \n\nSo log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. \n\nSo pKa2 is 7.2076. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02809 /0.036735) \n\nCompute the ratio: 0.02809 /0.036735 \u2248 0.7645. \n\nlog(0.7645) \u2248 log(0.76) is about -0.118, log(0.7645) is roughly let's see: \n\nUsing calculator-like steps: \n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645 x 10^-1) = log(7.645) + (-1). \n\nLog(7.645): log(7)=0.8451, log(7.6)=0.8808, so 7.645 is between 7.6 and 7.7. \n\nApproximate: 7.645 is 0.45 of the way from 7.6 to 7.7. The log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.7)=0.8865. The difference is ~0.0057 over 0.1 in the number. So 0.45*0.0057 \u22480.0026. So log(7.645)=0.8808 +0.0026= 0.8834. Then subtract 1 gives log(0.7645)= -0.1166. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1166 \u2248 7.091. \n\nSo pH \u22487.091. \n\n[H+] = 10^-7.091. \n\nCalculating 10^-7.091: \n\n10^0.091 is about 1.228 (since 10^0.09 \u22481.23), so 10^-7.091 = 10^(-7 -0.091) = 1e-7 / 1.228 \u2248 8.14e-8. \n\nSo [H+] \u22488.14e-8 M. \n\nNow, plug into the formula for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nKa3 =1.8e-12 \n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M \n\n[H+] =8.14e-8 \n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.05056, so 0.05056e-12 =5.056e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.14e-8: 5.056e-14 /8.14e-8 = (5.056 /8.14) * 1e-6 \n\n5.056 divided by 8.14 \u22480.621. \n\nSo 0.621e-6 = 6.21e-7 M. \n\nLooking at the options, that's closest to option A (6.24e-7) or B (5.48e-7). The calculated value is 6.21e-7, so A is the closest. \n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the contribution from the third dissociation differently. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+, so using the Ka3 expression. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to account for the fact that H2PO4^- can also dissociate further. But given that the pH is around 7, which is much lower than pKa3 (which is pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) \u224811.74). \n\nSince the pH is ~7, which is way below the pKa3 (11.74), so the HPO4^2- is mostly undissociated into PO4^3-. Wait, no. Wait, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-. So when pH is lower than pKa3 (which it is, since 7 <11.74), the equilibrium favors the left side (HPO4^2-). Thus, the concentration of PO4^3- should be small, which aligns with the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another source of PO4^3-? Like from the H2PO4^-? Let's see. \n\nH2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+ (this is the second dissociation). The third dissociation is HPO4^2- to PO4^3- and H+. \n\nSo the only source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2- via Ka3. Therefore, the approach is correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives ~6.2e-7, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made an error in the initial molar masses. \n\nKH2PO4's molar mass is K (39.1) + 2 H (2*1.008) + P (30.97) + 4 O (4*16.00). Let me compute that: \n\n39.1 + 2.016 + 30.97 + 64 = 39.1+2.016=41.116 +30.97=72.086 +64=136.086 g/mol. Which matches the given Mw 136.09. So that's correct. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na is 22.99*2 =45.98. HPO4^2- is H (1.008) + P (30.97) +4 O (64) = 1.008 +30.97+64=95.978. Then the two H2O: 2*(18.015)=36.03. So total is 45.98 +95.978 +36.03 = 45.98+95.978=141.958 +36.03=177.988, which rounds to 177.99. So that's correct. \n\nMoles are correct. \n\nConcentration calculations: 1.00g /136.09 is indeed ~0.007347 mol, divided by 0.2 gives 0.036735 M. \n\nSimilarly for the other. \n\nSo the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A) 6.24e-7 M. \n\nWait, but my calculation gave 6.21e-7, which is very close to 6.24e-7. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding during intermediate steps. Let me recalculate with more precision. \n\nLet me compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately. \n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.005618 mol /0.2 L =0.02809 M \n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.007347 mol /0.2 L =0.036735 M \n\nRatio =0.02809 /0.036735 =0.02809 \u00f70.036735. Let's compute this division precisely. \n\n0.02809 \u00f70.036735. Let me do 2809 /3673.5 (since multiplying numerator and denominator by 100,000 to eliminate decimals). \n\n2809 \u00f73673.5 \u22480.7645 (exactly, 3673.5 *0.7645 = 3673.5*0.7 =2571.45, 3673.5*0.06=220.41, 3673.5*0.0045=16.53075; total \u22482571.45+220.41=2791.86 +16.53=2808.39, which is very close to 2809, so the ratio is exactly ~0.7645. \n\nSo log(0.7645) as before. Let's use a calculator approach. \n\nLet me recall that log(0.7645) = ln(0.7645)/ln(10). \n\nNatural log of 0.7645: ln(0.7645) \u2248 -0.267. Since ln(0.75)= -0.2877, so 0.7645 is a bit higher. \n\nAlternatively, using linear approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation. Let me compute log(0.7645):\n\nLet me note that log(7.645 \u00d710^-1). \n\nlog(7.645) is needed. \n\nSince log(7.6) is 0.8808, log(7.64)= ?\n\nUsing logarithm table steps:\n\nlog(7.6)=0.8808\n\nlog(7.64) can be approximated as follows:\n\nThe difference between 7.6 and 7.64 is 0.04. \n\nThe derivative of log(x) at x=7.6 is (1/(ln(10)*x)) \u2248 (1/(2.3026*7.6)) \u22481/(17.5)\u22480.057 per unit x. So over 0.04 increase in x, the increase in log is ~0.04 *0.057 \u22480.0023. \n\nThus log(7.64)=0.8808+0.0023\u22480.8831. \n\nThus log(7.645)= ~0.8831 + (0.005/0.04)*0.0023? Wait, maybe better to use linear between 7.64 and 7.65. \n\nAlternatively, let me use a calculator-like approach: \n\nlog(7.645)= ?\n\nWe can use the fact that 10^0.883 =10^0.88 *10^0.003. \n\n10^0.88 \u22487.586 (since 10^0.88= e^(0.88*ln10)= e^(0.88*2.3026)=e^2.026 \u22487.58). \n\n10^0.003 \u22481.0069. So 7.586*1.0069\u22487.64, so log(7.64)=0.883. \n\nTherefore, log(7.645)=0.883 + (0.005/0.01)*(0.8831-0.883) \u2192 perhaps negligible. So log(7.645)=~0.8833. \n\nTherefore log(0.7645)=0.8833 -1= -0.1167. \n\nSo pH=7.2076 (pKa2) + (-0.1167)=7.0909. \n\n[H+]=10^-7.0909. Let's compute this more precisely. \n\nLet me write 10^-7.0909 = 10^(-7 -0.0909) = 10^-7 *10^-0.0909. \n\nCompute 10^-0.0909: \n\nlog(0.81)= -0.0915 (since 10^-0.0915 \u22480.81). So 0.0909 is very close to that. \n\nSo 10^-0.0909 \u22480.81. \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.81 \u22488.1e-8 M. \n\nSo using this, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/(8.1e-8). \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809 =0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0562/8.1)*1e-6. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.1 = let's see. 8.1*0.624=5.0664. So 0.624 gives 5.0664. \n\nSo 5.0562 /8.1 \u22480.624 - (0.0102/8.1) \u22480.624 -0.00126\u22480.6227. \n\nThus, 0.6227e-6 =6.227e-7 M. \n\nWhich rounds to 6.23e-7, very close to option A (6.24e-7). The slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the ratio of the concentrations directly. Wait, but I think the method is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for orthophosphate. Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, so yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother check: the answer options include 6.24e-7 which is very close to our calculated 6.23e-7.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me try to work through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nHmm, right. Phosphate is a polyprotic acid, so its different forms depend on the pH. The salts here are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me recall their formulas. \n\nKH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Its formula can be written as K+ H2PO4^- because when it dissociates, it gives K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules. The sodium ions would dissociate, giving Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. \n\nThe problem is asking about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. That's the third deprotonated form of H3PO4. So, the orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, right? \n\nSo, the solution is a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those two ions are present in the solution. Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-. Since PO4^3- is the next deprotonation step beyond HPO4^2-, maybe we need to consider the third dissociation (Ka3) here? \n\nLet me think. The two salts provided are KH2PO4 (providing H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (providing HPO4^2-). The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would be controlled by the second dissociation constant (Ka2). But the question is about PO4^3-, which is the next step. \n\nWait, but if the solution has HPO4^2- present, then the PO4^3- concentration would depend on the third dissociation (Ka3) of H3PO4. So, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-, and that's governed by Ka3. \n\nSo, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- using Ka3. \n\nBut since we have a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- (from the first and second salts), the pH of the solution is going to be around the pKa2, which is the pH where the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are equal. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about PO4^3-, so maybe I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- based on the HPO4^2- concentration and the Ka3. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. \n\nStarting with KH2PO4: the molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So, moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.007347 mol. \n\nSimilarly, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g, so moles = 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. \n\nThe volume of the solution is 0.2 L. So the concentrations are: \n\n[H2PO4^-] = 0.007347 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.03674 M \n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L \u2248 0.02809 M \n\nSo the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- is about 0.02809 / 0.03674 \u2248 0.764. Since this is a buffer, the pH would be around pKa2. Let me calculate pKa2: \n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21 (since log(6.2) is ~0.79, so 8 - 0.79 = 7.21). \n\nSo the pH of the solution is around 7.21. \n\nNow, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, we need to look at the third dissociation of H3PO4, which is: \n\nHPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nThe equilibrium constant for this is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. \n\nThe expression for Ka3 is: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] \n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nWe know [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02809 M. The [H+] can be found from the pH. Since the pH is about 7.21, [H+] = 10^(-7.21) \u2248 6.17e-8 M. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 6.17e-8 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 \u2248 5.056e-14 \n\nDivide by 6.17e-8: 5.056e-14 / 6.17e-8 \u2248 8.19e-7 M? Wait, that's not matching the options. Wait, let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the [H+]. Let me recalculate that. \n\npH = 7.21, so [H+] = 10^-7.21. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.21 is about 0.617 (since log(0.617) is about -0.21). So 1e-7 * 0.617 \u2248 6.17e-8 M. That's correct. \n\nSo 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = let's see, 1.8 * 0.02809 = 0.05056, so 0.05056e-12 = 5.056e-14. \n\nThen divide by 6.17e-8: \n\n5.056e-14 / 6.17e-8 = (5.056 /6.17) * 1e-6 \u2248 0.819 * 1e-6 = 8.19e-7? Hmm, but the options given are in the 1e-7 range. Wait, but 8.19e-7 is 8.19 x 10^-7, which is about 8.2e-7. Looking at the options: \n\nA) 6.24e-7 \n\nB)5.48e-7 \n\nC)2.81e-7 \n\nD)3.97e-7 \n\nHmm, my calculation gives ~8e-7, which isn't among the options. That suggests I made an error. \n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the formula for Ka3. Let me check the dissociation again. \n\nThe third dissociation of H3PO4 is HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3- and H+. So the correct expression for Ka3 is indeed [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but perhaps the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M is not accurate. Because in the solution, there are also H+ and OH- ions from water, but since the solution is buffered, maybe the concentrations are as calculated. Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the pH isn't exactly pKa2. Because the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is not 1. \n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (pKa2) would be: \n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]) \n\nSo plugging in the values: \n\npH = 7.21 + log(0.02809 / 0.03674) \n\nCompute the log of (0.02809/0.03674) = 0.764. \n\nlog(0.764) is approximately log(0.76) which is about -0.118. So pH \u2248 7.21 -0.118 = 7.09. \n\nSo the actual pH is around 7.09, not exactly pKa2. \n\nTherefore, [H+] would be 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.1e-8 (since 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^-7 *10^-0.09 \u2248 1e-7 * 0.812 \u2248 8.12e-8). \n\nSo maybe I miscalculated the pH earlier. Let me recalculate with the correct pH. \n\nSo pH = 7.09, so [H+] = 8.12e-8. \n\nNow, recompute [PO4^3-]: \n\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] \u2192 [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nKa3 = 1.8e-12 \n\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M \n\n[H+] = 8.12e-8 \n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.056e-14 \n\nDenominator: 8.12e-8 \n\nSo 5.056e-14 / 8.12e-8 \u2248 (5.056 /8.12) * 1e-6 \n\n5.056 divided by 8.12 is approximately 0.6225. \n\nSo 0.6225e-6 is 6.225e-7 M. \n\nAh! That's closer to option A (6.24e-7). \n\nHmm, so my initial mistake was assuming the pH was exactly pKa2, but actually, because the ratio of the concentrations isn't 1, the pH is a bit lower, leading to a higher [H+], which would decrease the [PO4^3-]. Wait, no, let me think again. \n\nWait, if the pH is lower (7.09 vs 7.21), that means [H+] is higher (since pH is lower). So with higher [H+], then in the equation for Ka3, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+], so higher [H+] would lead to lower [PO4^3-]. Wait, but my calculation now gives 6.2e-7, which is option A. But let me check the exact calculation again. \n\nWait, let me redo the calculation step precisely. \n\nFirst, exact values:\n\nMoles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 /136.09 \u2248 0.007347 mol. \n\nMoles of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005618 mol. \n\nConcentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007347 /0.2 = 0.036735 M \n\nHPO4^2- is 0.005618 /0.2 = 0.02809 M \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch for the second dissociation (since that's the relevant buffer):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that exactly:\n\n6.2e-8 \u2192 log(6.2) is 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.1976 (since 8 -0.7924 = 7.2076? Wait wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). \n\nWait, the pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). \n\nSo log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. \n\nSo pKa2 is 7.2076. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + log(0.02809 /0.036735) \n\nCompute the ratio: 0.02809 /0.036735 \u2248 0.7645. \n\nlog(0.7645) \u2248 log(0.76) is about -0.118, log(0.7645) is roughly let's see: \n\nUsing calculator-like steps: \n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645 x 10^-1) = log(7.645) + (-1). \n\nLog(7.645): log(7)=0.8451, log(7.6)=0.8808, so 7.645 is between 7.6 and 7.7. \n\nApproximate: 7.645 is 0.45 of the way from 7.6 to 7.7. The log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.7)=0.8865. The difference is ~0.0057 over 0.1 in the number. So 0.45*0.0057 \u22480.0026. So log(7.645)=0.8808 +0.0026= 0.8834. Then subtract 1 gives log(0.7645)= -0.1166. \n\nSo pH = 7.2076 -0.1166 \u2248 7.091. \n\nSo pH \u22487.091. \n\n[H+] = 10^-7.091. \n\nCalculating 10^-7.091: \n\n10^0.091 is about 1.228 (since 10^0.09 \u22481.23), so 10^-7.091 = 10^(-7 -0.091) = 1e-7 / 1.228 \u2248 8.14e-8. \n\nSo [H+] \u22488.14e-8 M. \n\nNow, plug into the formula for [PO4^3-]: \n\n[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] \n\nKa3 =1.8e-12 \n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M \n\n[H+] =8.14e-8 \n\nSo numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.05056, so 0.05056e-12 =5.056e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.14e-8: 5.056e-14 /8.14e-8 = (5.056 /8.14) * 1e-6 \n\n5.056 divided by 8.14 \u22480.621. \n\nSo 0.621e-6 = 6.21e-7 M. \n\nLooking at the options, that's closest to option A (6.24e-7) or B (5.48e-7). The calculated value is 6.21e-7, so A is the closest. \n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the contribution from the third dissociation differently. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+, so using the Ka3 expression. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to account for the fact that H2PO4^- can also dissociate further. But given that the pH is around 7, which is much lower than pKa3 (which is pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) \u224811.74). \n\nSince the pH is ~7, which is way below the pKa3 (11.74), so the HPO4^2- is mostly undissociated into PO4^3-. Wait, no. Wait, the dissociation of HPO4^2- is HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3-. So when pH is lower than pKa3 (which it is, since 7 <11.74), the equilibrium favors the left side (HPO4^2-). Thus, the concentration of PO4^3- should be small, which aligns with the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another source of PO4^3-? Like from the H2PO4^-? Let's see. \n\nH2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+ (this is the second dissociation). The third dissociation is HPO4^2- to PO4^3- and H+. \n\nSo the only source of PO4^3- is the dissociation of HPO4^2- via Ka3. Therefore, the approach is correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives ~6.2e-7, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made an error in the initial molar masses. \n\nKH2PO4's molar mass is K (39.1) + 2 H (2*1.008) + P (30.97) + 4 O (4*16.00). Let me compute that: \n\n39.1 + 2.016 + 30.97 + 64 = 39.1+2.016=41.116 +30.97=72.086 +64=136.086 g/mol. Which matches the given Mw 136.09. So that's correct. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: Na is 22.99*2 =45.98. HPO4^2- is H (1.008) + P (30.97) +4 O (64) = 1.008 +30.97+64=95.978. Then the two H2O: 2*(18.015)=36.03. So total is 45.98 +95.978 +36.03 = 45.98+95.978=141.958 +36.03=177.988, which rounds to 177.99. So that's correct. \n\nMoles are correct. \n\nConcentration calculations: 1.00g /136.09 is indeed ~0.007347 mol, divided by 0.2 gives 0.036735 M. \n\nSimilarly for the other. \n\nSo the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A) 6.24e-7 M. \n\nWait, but my calculation gave 6.21e-7, which is very close to 6.24e-7. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding during intermediate steps. Let me recalculate with more precision. \n\nLet me compute the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately. \n\n[HPO4^2-] =0.005618 mol /0.2 L =0.02809 M \n\n[H2PO4^-] =0.007347 mol /0.2 L =0.036735 M \n\nRatio =0.02809 /0.036735 =0.02809 \u00f70.036735. Let's compute this division precisely. \n\n0.02809 \u00f70.036735. Let me do 2809 /3673.5 (since multiplying numerator and denominator by 100,000 to eliminate decimals). \n\n2809 \u00f73673.5 \u22480.7645 (exactly, 3673.5 *0.7645 = 3673.5*0.7 =2571.45, 3673.5*0.06=220.41, 3673.5*0.0045=16.53075; total \u22482571.45+220.41=2791.86 +16.53=2808.39, which is very close to 2809, so the ratio is exactly ~0.7645. \n\nSo log(0.7645) as before. Let's use a calculator approach. \n\nLet me recall that log(0.7645) = ln(0.7645)/ln(10). \n\nNatural log of 0.7645: ln(0.7645) \u2248 -0.267. Since ln(0.75)= -0.2877, so 0.7645 is a bit higher. \n\nAlternatively, using linear approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation. Let me compute log(0.7645):\n\nLet me note that log(7.645 \u00d710^-1). \n\nlog(7.645) is needed. \n\nSince log(7.6) is 0.8808, log(7.64)= ?\n\nUsing logarithm table steps:\n\nlog(7.6)=0.8808\n\nlog(7.64) can be approximated as follows:\n\nThe difference between 7.6 and 7.64 is 0.04. \n\nThe derivative of log(x) at x=7.6 is (1/(ln(10)*x)) \u2248 (1/(2.3026*7.6)) \u22481/(17.5)\u22480.057 per unit x. So over 0.04 increase in x, the increase in log is ~0.04 *0.057 \u22480.0023. \n\nThus log(7.64)=0.8808+0.0023\u22480.8831. \n\nThus log(7.645)= ~0.8831 + (0.005/0.04)*0.0023? Wait, maybe better to use linear between 7.64 and 7.65. \n\nAlternatively, let me use a calculator-like approach: \n\nlog(7.645)= ?\n\nWe can use the fact that 10^0.883 =10^0.88 *10^0.003. \n\n10^0.88 \u22487.586 (since 10^0.88= e^(0.88*ln10)= e^(0.88*2.3026)=e^2.026 \u22487.58). \n\n10^0.003 \u22481.0069. So 7.586*1.0069\u22487.64, so log(7.64)=0.883. \n\nTherefore, log(7.645)=0.883 + (0.005/0.01)*(0.8831-0.883) \u2192 perhaps negligible. So log(7.645)=~0.8833. \n\nTherefore log(0.7645)=0.8833 -1= -0.1167. \n\nSo pH=7.2076 (pKa2) + (-0.1167)=7.0909. \n\n[H+]=10^-7.0909. Let's compute this more precisely. \n\nLet me write 10^-7.0909 = 10^(-7 -0.0909) = 10^-7 *10^-0.0909. \n\nCompute 10^-0.0909: \n\nlog(0.81)= -0.0915 (since 10^-0.0915 \u22480.81). So 0.0909 is very close to that. \n\nSo 10^-0.0909 \u22480.81. \n\nThus, [H+] = 1e-7 *0.81 \u22488.1e-8 M. \n\nSo using this, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/(8.1e-8). \n\nLet me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8*0.02809 =0.050562e-12 =5.0562e-14. \n\nDivide by 8.1e-8: 5.0562e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0562/8.1)*1e-6. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.1 = let's see. 8.1*0.624=5.0664. So 0.624 gives 5.0664. \n\nSo 5.0562 /8.1 \u22480.624 - (0.0102/8.1) \u22480.624 -0.00126\u22480.6227. \n\nThus, 0.6227e-6 =6.227e-7 M. \n\nWhich rounds to 6.23e-7, very close to option A (6.24e-7). The slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the ratio of the concentrations directly. Wait, but I think the method is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for orthophosphate. Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-, so yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother check: the answer options include 6.24e-7 which is very close to our calculated 6.23e-7. So that's A. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we first calculate the concentrations of the provided salts:\n\n1. **Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{136.09 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.007347 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   [\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084}^-] = \\frac{0.007347 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.2 \\, \\text{L}} \\approx 0.0367 \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00 \\, \\text{g}}{177.99 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005618 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   [\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}] = \\frac{0.005618 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.2 \\, \\text{L}} \\approx 0.0281 \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n\nUsing the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** for the second dissociation (pKa\u2082 = -log(6.2\u00d710\u207b\u2078) \u2248 7.21):\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa}_2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}{[\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084}^-]}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.21 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.0281}{0.0367}\\right) \\approx 7.21 - 0.117 \\approx 7.09\n\\]\nThus, \\([\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-7.09} \\approx 8.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{M}\\).\n\nUsing the **third dissociation constant (Ka\u2083)** for H\u2083PO\u2084:\n\\[\n\\text{Ka}_3 = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}\n\\]\nRearranging to solve for [\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}]:\n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084}^{3-}] = \\frac{\\text{Ka}_3 \\times [\\text{HPO\u2084}^{2-}]}{[\\text{H}^+]} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 0.0281}{8.1 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.23 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThis value closely matches **Option A (6.24\u00d710\u207b\u2077 M)**, considering rounding differences.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution is made by mixing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O in 200.00 cm\u00b3. The question gives the Ka values for H3PO4, which are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. Hmm, orthophosphate ions... I think that's PO4^3-? Wait, let me confirm. Orthophosphate usually refers to the fully deprotonated form, so yes, PO4^3-.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the concentrations of each of the salts in the solution. Let's start by calculating the moles of each compound. \n\nStarting with KH2PO4. Its molecular weight is given as 136.09 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g, so moles = mass / molar mass. That would be 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007347 moles. Let me check that calculation again. 1 divided by 136.09. Let me compute that more precisely: 136.09 goes into 1.00 how many times? Well, 1/136.09 \u2248 0.007347, yes. So approximately 0.007347 moles of KH2PO4.\n\nThen the other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. Again, 1.00 g divided by 177.99 gives moles. Let's see: 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 moles. Let me confirm that division. 177.99 times 0.0056 would be 1.00, so that's correct.\n\nNow, since the volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters, the concentrations are moles divided by 0.2 L.\n\nSo for KH2PO4: 0.007347 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M. Let me note that as [KH2PO4] = 0.0367 M approximately.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M. So that's the concentration of Na2HPO4. But wait, when Na2HPO4 dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the concentration of HPO4^2- from this would be 0.02809 M. Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions, so the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.0367 M.\n\nSo the solution has H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are in a buffer solution, right? Because they are adjacent phosphate species. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. But since they are adjacent, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH would be determined by the ratio of their concentrations. \n\nThe question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. To get PO4^3-, the HPO4^2- would have to lose another proton. The third dissociation (since H3PO4 is triprotic) is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+ with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Since Ka3 is so small, the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low. \n\nSo the approach here is to consider the equilibrium involving the third dissociation. Let me think. Since we have HPO4^2- in solution, which can deprotonate to form PO4^3- and H+. The equilibrium expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need to find [PO4^3-]. To do that, we need to know [H+] and [HPO4^2-]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express [PO4^3-] in terms of the other species. Let's see. Let's first find the pH of the solution because that will determine [H+], which is needed for the Ka3 expression. \n\nThe pH of the buffer solution made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa we need here would be the pKa2 of H3PO4, because H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-. \n\nWait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the reverse reaction). \n\nSo the pKa here is the second dissociation constant's pKa, which is pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that. \n\nlog(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = ~0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio of [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.7645. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.7645). Let's compute log(0.7645). Since log(0.76) is about -0.118, and 0.7645 is a bit higher. Let me do a more precise calculation. \n\nlog(0.7645) = ln(0.7645)/ln(10). Let me approximate. Alternatively, maybe use linear approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that log(7.645\u00d710^-1). Let me think: 10^(-0.118) is about 0.76, so log(0.7645) \u2248 -0.117. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645\u00d710^-1) = log(7.645) - 1. log(7.645) is log(7.6) is ~0.8808, 7.645 is a bit more. Since 7.645 is 7.6 + 0.045. Let's see: 7.6 is 10^0.8808, and 7.645 is a bit higher. The difference between 7.6 and 7.645 is 0.045. The derivative of log10(x) is 1/(x ln10). So delta log \u2248 (0.045)/(7.6 * 2.3026) \u2248 0.045/(17.5) \u2248 0.0026. So log(7.645) \u2248 0.8808 + 0.0026 \u2248 0.8834. So log(0.7645) = 0.8834 -1 = -0.1166. So approximately -0.1166.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1166) = 7.091. So pH is approximately 7.09. \n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09). Let's calculate that. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.09. 10^-0.09 \u2248 0.8123, so 1e-7 *0.8123 \u2248 8.123e-8 M. \n\nWait, let me confirm that exponent. 10^-0.09 is the same as e^(-0.09*ln10). Let me see, ln(10) is ~2.3026, so -0.09 *2.3026 \u2248 -0.207. e^-0.207 \u2248 0.813. So yes, so [H+] \u2248 8.13e-8 M. \n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation (Ka3) for HPO4^2-:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nKa3 is given as 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is the concentration from the Na2HPO4, but we have to consider that in the buffer solution, the actual concentration might be slightly different? Wait, no. Wait, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the HPO4^2- concentration is the same as the initial concentration (since they are in a 1:1 ratio in the solution?), but actually, the initial concentrations are from the salts. But when they form the buffer, the concentrations might shift a bit, but given that the Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is small, but the ratio of the concentrations is close (since they're about 0.028 vs 0.037), so the buffer is not extremely diluted, so maybe the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are approximately their initial values. Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch assumes that the concentrations of acid and base are approximately their initial concentrations, which is valid when the buffer ratio is close to 1 and the dissociation is minimal. Since the pH is around 7.09 and the pKa2 is ~7.2, which is very close, so the ratio is about 0.76, so the assumption holds. Therefore, the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02809 M, and [H+] is 8.13e-8 M.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.13e-8\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8 * 0.02809 = ~0.050562e-12 \u2192 5.0562e-14. Wait, actually:\n\n1.8 * 0.02809 = let's calculate exactly:\n\n0.02809 * 1.8 = (0.02 * 1.8) + (0.00809 *1.8) \n\n0.02*1.8 = 0.036\n\n0.00809 *1.8 = 0.014562\n\nTotal is 0.036 +0.014562 = 0.050562. So 0.050562e-12 \u2192 5.0562e-14.\n\nDenominator is 8.13e-8.\n\nSo 5.0562e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.0562 /8.13) * 1e-6. Let's compute 5.0562 /8.13. \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.13. Let me see, 8.13 goes into 5.0562 approximately 0.622 times (since 8.13*0.6=4.878, subtract that from 5.056 gives 0.178, then 0.178/8.13 \u22480.022). So total ~0.622. \n\nSo 0.622 *1e-6 = 6.22e-7 M. Wait, but let me do this division more precisely:\n\n5.0562 /8.13:\n\nLet me compute 5.0562 \u00f7 8.13.\n\nLet me write it as 5056.2 / 8130 (since multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals). \n\nDividing 5056.2 by 8130.\n\n8130 x 0.6 = 4878. \n\nSubtract 4878 from 5056.2: 5056.2 - 4878 = 178.2. \n\nNow, 178.2 /8130 = ~0.0219. \n\nSo total is 0.6 +0.0219 = 0.6219. \n\nSo approximately 0.6219. \n\nThus, 0.6219e-6 is 6.219e-7 M. \n\nHmm, so that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But wait, let me check my calculations again for any errors.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of [H+]. Let me recalculate that part again. \n\nThe pH was 7.091. So [H+] is 10^-7.091. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nThe exact value of pH was 7.2076 (pKa2) minus log(0.7645) which was approximately 7.2076 -0.1166 =7.091. \n\nTo compute 10^-7.091:\n\nWe can write it as 10^(-7 -0.091) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.091. \n\nCalculating 10^-0.091. Let's compute ln(10^-0.091) = -0.091 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.091 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2095. \n\ne^-0.2095 \u2248 0.8107. \n\nTherefore, 10^-0.091 \u22480.8107. So [H+] = 0.8107e-7 =8.107e-8. \n\nSo that's accurate. \n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.107e-8 \n\nCalculating numerator again:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562e-12 \u21925.0562e-14.\n\nDenominator 8.107e-8 \u2192 so 5.0562e-14 /8.107e-8 =5.0562 /8.107 *1e-6. \n\n5.0562 divided by8.107. Let me do this division again. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.107. Let me compute 8.107 \u00d70.623 = ?\n\n8 \u00d70.623 =4.984, 0.107\u00d70.623 \u22480.0666, so total 4.984+0.0666\u22485.0506. \n\nSo 0.623 gives 5.0506, which is very close to 5.0562. \n\nThe difference is 5.0562 -5.0506 =0.0056. \n\nSo, 0.0056 /8.107 \u2248 ~0.00069. \n\nSo total is ~0.623 +0.00069 \u22480.6237. \n\nThus, 0.6237e-6 \u21926.237e-7 M. \n\nSo that rounds to approximately 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A. \n\nWait, but let me check again the problem's given options. The options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives around 6.24e-7, which is exactly option A. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I made an error in the assumption of the concentrations of HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, the problem is, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, their concentrations are as per the initial moles divided by the volume, but in the solution, they can react with each other. However, since they are in a buffer system, their concentrations remain approximately the same. So the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when calculating the pH, I used the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to compute the pH, but when calculating [PO4^3-], the HPO4^2- concentration is indeed the same as the initial value? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+, so the actual [HPO4^2-] would be slightly less than the initial, and [H+] would be slightly higher? \n\nWait, but the Ka3 is 1.8e-12 which is extremely small. So the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates into PO4^3- is negligible compared to the initial concentration. So the approximation is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I messed up any step. Let me retrace.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol. Let's compute that exactly:\n\n1 divided by 136.09: 1/136.09 = approx 0.007347 mol. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1/177.99 = approx 0.005617 mol. \n\nConcentrations: \n\nKH2PO4: 0.007347 /0.2 =0.036735 M.\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.005617 /0.2=0.028085 M. \n\nThen pH calculation using Henderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npH = pKa2 + log( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that again precisely:\n\nlog(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8). \n\nlog(6.2)=0.7924, so total log(6.2e-8)=0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2=7.2076.\n\nThe ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.028085 /0.036735 \u22480.7645. \n\nlog(0.7645)= approximately -0.117 (as before), so pH=7.2076 -0.117=7.0906.\n\nSo [H+]=10^-7.0906 \u22488.12e-8 M (as before). \n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] \n\nPlugging in:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, [H+]=8.12e-8. \n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.12e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator: \n\n1.8 *0.028085 =0.050553 \n\nSo numerator is 0.050553e-12 =5.0553e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0553/8.12) *1e-6 \n\n5.0553 divided by 8.12. Let me compute this division again. \n\n8.12 \u00d70.622 = 5.05 (since 8 \u00d70.622=4.976, 0.12\u00d70.622=0.0746; total 4.976+0.0746\u22485.0506). \n\nSo 5.0553/8.12 = ~0.622. \n\nSo 0.622e-6 is 6.22e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7 when considering more precise decimals. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option A. \n\nWait, but why is the option B there? Let me check if I made a mistake in the pKa value. Wait, the question says Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 for H3PO4. \n\nWait, H3PO4's first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^-. \n\nSecond: H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- \n\nThird: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nSo yes, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+, so Ka3 is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I messed up the formula of the sodium salt. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe second compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar mass given is 177.99 g/mol. Let me confirm that. \n\nThe formula for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: \n\nNa: 2\u00d722.99=45.98 \n\nHPO4^2-: H is 1.008, P is 30.97, O4 is 4\u00d716=64. So HPO4^2- is (1.008 +30.97 +64)=95.98. \n\nThen the two water molecules: 2\u00d7(2\u00d71.008 +16)=2\u00d718.016=36.032. \n\nTotal molar mass: 45.98 +95.98 +36.032 = 45.98+95.98 is 141.96 +36.032 = 178. So the given Mw is 177.99, which is correct. \n\nSo the moles calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, let me check the question again. It says \"concentration of orthophosphate ions\". Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another form? Like, maybe the total phosphate species? But no, the question specifically says orthophosphate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (because it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the base is HPO4^2-. \n\nTherefore, the equation is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the contribution of PO4^3- to the HPO4^2- concentration? But since Ka3 is so small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates to PO4^3- is negligible. \n\nTherefore, the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (0.02809 M) is indeed the value to use. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options given include A as 6.24e-7, which is exactly what I got. So I think that's the correct answer. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, people might consider activity coefficients or something, but I think at 25\u00b0C and assuming ideal solution, the calculation is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once more. \n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 \u00d7 [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809, [H+] is 8.12e-8. \n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.12e-8) \n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 \u21925.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8 \u2192 5.0562e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0562/8.12)*1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by8.12:\n\nLet me compute 5.0562 \u00f78.12. Let's do this division precisely. \n\n8.12 \u00d70.622 = 8\u00d70.622=4.976, 0.12\u00d70.622=0.07464 \u2192 total 4.976+0.07464=5.05064. \n\nSo 0.622 gives 5.05064, which is very close to 5.0562. \n\nThe difference is 5.0562-5.05064=0.00556. \n\nSo 0.00556 /8.12 = ~0.000684. \n\nSo total is 0.622 +0.000684 \u22480.622684. \n\nThus, 0.622684 \u00d71e-6 =6.2268e-7. \n\nSo approximately 6.23e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7 when considering more precise calculation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, so I think I'm confident. The answer must be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution is made by mixing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O in 200.00 cm\u00b3. The question gives the Ka values for H3PO4, which are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. The temperature is 25\u00b0C. Hmm, orthophosphate ions... I think that's PO4^3-? Wait, let me confirm. Orthophosphate usually refers to the fully deprotonated form, so yes, PO4^3-.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the concentrations of each of the salts in the solution. Let's start by calculating the moles of each compound. \n\nStarting with KH2PO4. Its molecular weight is given as 136.09 g/mol. The mass is 1.00 g, so moles = mass / molar mass. That would be 1.00 / 136.09 \u2248 0.007347 moles. Let me check that calculation again. 1 divided by 136.09. Let me compute that more precisely: 136.09 goes into 1.00 how many times? Well, 1/136.09 \u2248 0.007347, yes. So approximately 0.007347 moles of KH2PO4.\n\nThen the other compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, which has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. Again, 1.00 g divided by 177.99 gives moles. Let's see: 1 / 177.99 \u2248 0.005617 moles. Let me confirm that division. 177.99 times 0.0056 would be 1.00, so that's correct.\n\nNow, since the volume is 200 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters, the concentrations are moles divided by 0.2 L.\n\nSo for KH2PO4: 0.007347 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M. Let me note that as [KH2PO4] = 0.0367 M approximately.\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M. So that's the concentration of Na2HPO4. But wait, when Na2HPO4 dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the concentration of HPO4^2- from this would be 0.02809 M. Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions, so the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.0367 M.\n\nSo the solution has H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are in a buffer solution, right? Because they are adjacent phosphate species. The H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. But since they are adjacent, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH would be determined by the ratio of their concentrations. \n\nThe question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. To get PO4^3-, the HPO4^2- would have to lose another proton. The third dissociation (since H3PO4 is triprotic) is HPO4^2- \u2194 PO4^3- + H+ with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Since Ka3 is so small, the concentration of PO4^3- should be very low. \n\nSo the approach here is to consider the equilibrium involving the third dissociation. Let me think. Since we have HPO4^2- in solution, which can deprotonate to form PO4^3- and H+. The equilibrium expression for Ka3 is:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need to find [PO4^3-]. To do that, we need to know [H+] and [HPO4^2-]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express [PO4^3-] in terms of the other species. Let's see. Let's first find the pH of the solution because that will determine [H+], which is needed for the Ka3 expression. \n\nThe pH of the buffer solution made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa we need here would be the pKa2 of H3PO4, because H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid of HPO4^2-. \n\nWait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the reverse reaction). \n\nSo the pKa here is the second dissociation constant's pKa, which is pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that. \n\nlog(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = ~0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2 \u2248 7.2076.\n\nThe ratio of [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03673 \u2248 0.7645. \n\nSo pH = pKa2 + log(0.7645). Let's compute log(0.7645). Since log(0.76) is about -0.118, and 0.7645 is a bit higher. Let me do a more precise calculation. \n\nlog(0.7645) = ln(0.7645)/ln(10). Let me approximate. Alternatively, maybe use linear approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that log(7.645\u00d710^-1). Let me think: 10^(-0.118) is about 0.76, so log(0.7645) \u2248 -0.117. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\nlog(0.7645) = log(7.645\u00d710^-1) = log(7.645) - 1. log(7.645) is log(7.6) is ~0.8808, 7.645 is a bit more. Since 7.645 is 7.6 + 0.045. Let's see: 7.6 is 10^0.8808, and 7.645 is a bit higher. The difference between 7.6 and 7.645 is 0.045. The derivative of log10(x) is 1/(x ln10). So delta log \u2248 (0.045)/(7.6 * 2.3026) \u2248 0.045/(17.5) \u2248 0.0026. So log(7.645) \u2248 0.8808 + 0.0026 \u2248 0.8834. So log(0.7645) = 0.8834 -1 = -0.1166. So approximately -0.1166.\n\nSo pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1166) = 7.091. So pH is approximately 7.09. \n\nSo [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09). Let's calculate that. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.09. 10^-0.09 \u2248 0.8123, so 1e-7 *0.8123 \u2248 8.123e-8 M. \n\nWait, let me confirm that exponent. 10^-0.09 is the same as e^(-0.09*ln10). Let me see, ln(10) is ~2.3026, so -0.09 *2.3026 \u2248 -0.207. e^-0.207 \u2248 0.813. So yes, so [H+] \u2248 8.13e-8 M. \n\nNow, going back to the third dissociation (Ka3) for HPO4^2-:\n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nKa3 is given as 1.8e-12.\n\n[HPO4^2-] is the concentration from the Na2HPO4, but we have to consider that in the buffer solution, the actual concentration might be slightly different? Wait, no. Wait, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the HPO4^2- concentration is the same as the initial concentration (since they are in a 1:1 ratio in the solution?), but actually, the initial concentrations are from the salts. But when they form the buffer, the concentrations might shift a bit, but given that the Ka2 is 6.2e-8, which is small, but the ratio of the concentrations is close (since they're about 0.028 vs 0.037), so the buffer is not extremely diluted, so maybe the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are approximately their initial values. Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch assumes that the concentrations of acid and base are approximately their initial concentrations, which is valid when the buffer ratio is close to 1 and the dissociation is minimal. Since the pH is around 7.09 and the pKa2 is ~7.2, which is very close, so the ratio is about 0.76, so the assumption holds. Therefore, the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02809 M, and [H+] is 8.13e-8 M.\n\nSo plugging into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.13e-8\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 1.8 * 0.02809 = ~0.050562e-12 \u2192 5.0562e-14. Wait, actually:\n\n1.8 * 0.02809 = let's calculate exactly:\n\n0.02809 * 1.8 = (0.02 * 1.8) + (0.00809 *1.8) \n\n0.02*1.8 = 0.036\n\n0.00809 *1.8 = 0.014562\n\nTotal is 0.036 +0.014562 = 0.050562. So 0.050562e-12 \u2192 5.0562e-14.\n\nDenominator is 8.13e-8.\n\nSo 5.0562e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.0562 /8.13) * 1e-6. Let's compute 5.0562 /8.13. \n\n5.0562 divided by 8.13. Let me see, 8.13 goes into 5.0562 approximately 0.622 times (since 8.13*0.6=4.878, subtract that from 5.056 gives 0.178, then 0.178/8.13 \u22480.022). So total ~0.622. \n\nSo 0.622 *1e-6 = 6.22e-7 M. Wait, but let me do this division more precisely:\n\n5.0562 /8.13:\n\nLet me compute 5.0562 \u00f7 8.13.\n\nLet me write it as 5056.2 / 8130 (since multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals). \n\nDividing 5056.2 by 8130.\n\n8130 x 0.6 = 4878. \n\nSubtract 4878 from 5056.2: 5056.2 - 4878 = 178.2. \n\nNow, 178.2 /8130 = ~0.0219. \n\nSo total is 0.6 +0.0219 = 0.6219. \n\nSo approximately 0.6219. \n\nThus, 0.6219e-6 is 6.219e-7 M. \n\nHmm, so that's about 6.22e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. But wait, let me check my calculations again for any errors.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of [H+]. Let me recalculate that part again. \n\nThe pH was 7.091. So [H+] is 10^-7.091. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nThe exact value of pH was 7.2076 (pKa2) minus log(0.7645) which was approximately 7.2076 -0.1166 =7.091. \n\nTo compute 10^-7.091:\n\nWe can write it as 10^(-7 -0.091) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.091. \n\nCalculating 10^-0.091. Let's compute ln(10^-0.091) = -0.091 * ln(10) \u2248 -0.091 *2.3026 \u2248-0.2095. \n\ne^-0.2095 \u2248 0.8107. \n\nTherefore, 10^-0.091 \u22480.8107. So [H+] = 0.8107e-7 =8.107e-8. \n\nSo that's accurate. \n\nSo plugging back into the equation:\n\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02809)/8.107e-8 \n\nCalculating numerator again:\n\n1.8e-12 *0.02809 = 1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562e-12 \u21925.0562e-14.\n\nDenominator 8.107e-8 \u2192 so 5.0562e-14 /8.107e-8 =5.0562 /8.107 *1e-6. \n\n5.0562 divided by8.107. Let me do this division again. \n\n5.0562 \u00f78.107. Let me compute 8.107 \u00d70.623 = ?\n\n8 \u00d70.623 =4.984, 0.107\u00d70.623 \u22480.0666, so total 4.984+0.0666\u22485.0506. \n\nSo 0.623 gives 5.0506, which is very close to 5.0562. \n\nThe difference is 5.0562 -5.0506 =0.0056. \n\nSo, 0.0056 /8.107 \u2248 ~0.00069. \n\nSo total is ~0.623 +0.00069 \u22480.6237. \n\nThus, 0.6237e-6 \u21926.237e-7 M. \n\nSo that rounds to approximately 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A. \n\nWait, but let me check again the problem's given options. The options are:\n\nA) 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB)5.48x10^-7 \n\nC)2.81x10^-7 \n\nD)3.97x10^-7 \n\nHmm, so the calculation gives around 6.24e-7, which is exactly option A. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I made an error in the assumption of the concentrations of HPO4^2-?\n\nWait, the problem is, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, their concentrations are as per the initial moles divided by the volume, but in the solution, they can react with each other. However, since they are in a buffer system, their concentrations remain approximately the same. So the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when calculating the pH, I used the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to compute the pH, but when calculating [PO4^3-], the HPO4^2- concentration is indeed the same as the initial value? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+, so the actual [HPO4^2-] would be slightly less than the initial, and [H+] would be slightly higher? \n\nWait, but the Ka3 is 1.8e-12 which is extremely small. So the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates into PO4^3- is negligible compared to the initial concentration. So the approximation is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me check if I messed up any step. Let me retrace.\n\nFirst, moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol. Let's compute that exactly:\n\n1 divided by 136.09: 1/136.09 = approx 0.007347 mol. \n\nNa2HPO4\u00b72H2O: 1/177.99 = approx 0.005617 mol. \n\nConcentrations: \n\nKH2PO4: 0.007347 /0.2 =0.036735 M.\n\nNa2HPO4: 0.005617 /0.2=0.028085 M. \n\nThen pH calculation using Henderson-Hasselbalch:\n\npH = pKa2 + log( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )\n\npKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that again precisely:\n\nlog(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8). \n\nlog(6.2)=0.7924, so total log(6.2e-8)=0.7924 -8 = -7.2076, so pKa2=7.2076.\n\nThe ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =0.028085 /0.036735 \u22480.7645. \n\nlog(0.7645)= approximately -0.117 (as before), so pH=7.2076 -0.117=7.0906.\n\nSo [H+]=10^-7.0906 \u22488.12e-8 M (as before). \n\nThen, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] \n\nPlugging in:\n\nKa3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028085, [H+]=8.12e-8. \n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 *0.028085) /8.12e-8 \n\nLet me compute numerator: \n\n1.8 *0.028085 =0.050553 \n\nSo numerator is 0.050553e-12 =5.0553e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8: 5.0553e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0553/8.12) *1e-6 \n\n5.0553 divided by 8.12. Let me compute this division again. \n\n8.12 \u00d70.622 = 5.05 (since 8 \u00d70.622=4.976, 0.12\u00d70.622=0.0746; total 4.976+0.0746\u22485.0506). \n\nSo 5.0553/8.12 = ~0.622. \n\nSo 0.622e-6 is 6.22e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7 when considering more precise decimals. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option A. \n\nWait, but why is the option B there? Let me check if I made a mistake in the pKa value. Wait, the question says Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 for H3PO4. \n\nWait, H3PO4's first dissociation is H3PO4 \u2194 H+ + H2PO4^-. \n\nSecond: H2PO4^- \u2194 H+ + HPO4^2- \n\nThird: HPO4^2- \u2194 H+ + PO4^3- \n\nSo yes, the third dissociation is HPO4^2- \u2192 PO4^3- + H+, so Ka3 is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I messed up the formula of the sodium salt. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe second compound is Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O. The molar mass given is 177.99 g/mol. Let me confirm that. \n\nThe formula for Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O: \n\nNa: 2\u00d722.99=45.98 \n\nHPO4^2-: H is 1.008, P is 30.97, O4 is 4\u00d716=64. So HPO4^2- is (1.008 +30.97 +64)=95.98. \n\nThen the two water molecules: 2\u00d7(2\u00d71.008 +16)=2\u00d718.016=36.032. \n\nTotal molar mass: 45.98 +95.98 +36.032 = 45.98+95.98 is 141.96 +36.032 = 178. So the given Mw is 177.99, which is correct. \n\nSo the moles calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, let me check the question again. It says \"concentration of orthophosphate ions\". Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another form? Like, maybe the total phosphate species? But no, the question specifically says orthophosphate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). \n\nIn this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (because it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the base is HPO4^2-. \n\nTherefore, the equation is correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the contribution of PO4^3- to the HPO4^2- concentration? But since Ka3 is so small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates to PO4^3- is negligible. \n\nTherefore, the initial concentration of HPO4^2- (0.02809 M) is indeed the value to use. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options given include A as 6.24e-7, which is exactly what I got. So I think that's the correct answer. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, people might consider activity coefficients or something, but I think at 25\u00b0C and assuming ideal solution, the calculation is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once more. \n\nKa3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]\n\nWe need [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 \u00d7 [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\n\nKa3 is 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809, [H+] is 8.12e-8. \n\nSo:\n\n(1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.12e-8) \n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n1.8 *0.02809 =0.050562 \u2192 0.050562e-12 \u21925.0562e-14 \n\nDivide by 8.12e-8 \u2192 5.0562e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.0562/8.12)*1e-6 \n\n5.0562 divided by8.12:\n\nLet me compute 5.0562 \u00f78.12. Let's do this division precisely. \n\n8.12 \u00d70.622 = 8\u00d70.622=4.976, 0.12\u00d70.622=0.07464 \u2192 total 4.976+0.07464=5.05064. \n\nSo 0.622 gives 5.05064, which is very close to 5.0562. \n\nThe difference is 5.0562-5.05064=0.00556. \n\nSo 0.00556 /8.12 = ~0.000684. \n\nSo total is 0.622 +0.000684 \u22480.622684. \n\nThus, 0.622684 \u00d71e-6 =6.2268e-7. \n\nSo approximately 6.23e-7, which rounds to 6.24e-7 when considering more precise calculation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, so I think I'm confident. The answer must be A.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) in the solution, we start by calculating the initial concentrations of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. \n\n**Moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084**:  \n\\[\n\\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{136.09\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.007347\\ \\text{mol}\n\\]  \n**Concentration of KH\u2082PO\u2084**:  \n\\[\n\\frac{0.007347\\ \\text{mol}}{0.200\\ \\text{L}} \\approx 0.0367\\ \\text{M (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b)}\n\\]\n\n**Moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:  \n\\[\n\\text{Moles} = \\frac{1.00\\ \\text{g}}{177.99\\ \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.005617\\ \\text{mol}\n\\]  \n**Concentration of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O**:  \n\\[\n\\frac{0.005617\\ \\text{mol}}{0.200\\ \\text{L}} \\approx 0.0281\\ \\text{M (HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b)}\n\\]\n\nUsing the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system between H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b:  \n\\[\n\\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_{a2} + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b}]}\\right)\n\\]  \n**pKa\u2082** (from \\( K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\)):  \n\\[\n\\text{p}K_{a2} = -\\log(6.2 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 7.208\n\\]  \n**pH calculation**:  \n\\[\n\\text{pH} = 7.208 + \\log\\left(\\frac{0.0281}{0.0367}\\right) \\approx 7.208 - 0.1166 \\approx 7.091\n\\]  \n**[H\u207a]**:  \n\\[\n[H^+] = 10^{-7.091} \\approx 8.12 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nUsing the \\( K_{a3} \\) expression for HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u2192 PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a:  \n\\[\nK_{a3} = \\frac{[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}][\\text{H\u207a}]}{[\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]} \\implies [\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{K_{a3} \\times [\\text{HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b}]}{[\\text{H\u207a}]}\n\\]  \nPlugging in the values:  \n\\[\n[\\text{PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b}] = \\frac{(1.8 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 0.0281}{8.12 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx \\frac{5.06 \\times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 6.24 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}\n\\]\n\n**Answer: A**  \nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
