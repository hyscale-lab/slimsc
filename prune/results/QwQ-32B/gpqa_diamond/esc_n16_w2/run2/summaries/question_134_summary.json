      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing these three solutions. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that neutralization reactions between acids and bases produce water and a salt, and the enthalpy change can be calculated if I know the moles of the acid and base reacting. But wait, the problem gives three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to figure out how they react together.\n\nFirst step, maybe I should write the chemical equations for each possible reaction. Let's see, HCl is a strong monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is a strong diprotic acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions per formula unit. The neutralization reactions would be between each acid and the base.\n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each acid and base. \n\nFor HCl: Volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles HCl.\n\nH2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. But since each H2SO4 provides 2 H+ ions, the total H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.\n\nBa(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.\n\nNow, the H+ from both acids and OH- from the base will react. Let's calculate total H+ and total OH-.\n\nTotal H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles (since HCl is monoprotic)\nTotal H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 moles\nTotal H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.\n\nTotal OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.\n\nThe reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O, with a neutralization enthalpy. But the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is about -57.32 kJ/mol, which is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol (since 1 kcal \u2248 4.184 kJ). But I need to confirm the exact value here. Alternatively, maybe the question expects using the standard value, so I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAssuming that the reaction goes to completion and that the limiting reagent is either H+ or OH-.\n\nLet's see: the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. That means all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain unreacted. The amount reacted is 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.\n\nTherefore, the moles of water formed will be 0.2 moles. The enthalpy change would be the moles reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"enthalpy of neutralization\". The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of water is formed from the reaction of an acid and a base. So if that's the case, then the total enthalpy change would be moles reacted (0.2 mol) multiplied by -57.32 kJ/mol (or the kcal equivalent). But let me check units here.\n\nThe options are in kcal and kJ. The first three options are in kcal, D is in kJ. The question might expect using the value in kcal. Let me see.\n\nWait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.32 kJ/mol, which converts to about -13.7 kcal/mol (since 57.32 / 4.184 \u2248 13.7). Let me calculate 57.32 divided by 4.184: 57.32 /4.184 \u2248 13.7. Yes.\n\nSo, if the reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-, then the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.32 kJ) = -11.464 kJ. But converting that to kcal: 0.2 * (-13.7 kcal) = -2.74 kcal. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. Option B is -11.42 kcal which would be if we used 0.83 moles (since 11.42 /13.7 \u22480.83). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me recalculate the moles again.\n\nHCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl \u2192 0.1 mol H+.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 \u2192 each gives 2 H+ so 0.18 mol H+.\n\nTotal H+ = 0.1 +0.18 = 0.28 mol.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 \u2192 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nSo yes, the OH- is 0.2 mol, so that's the limiting reagent. So the reaction consumes 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nSo the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) \u2192 0.2*13.7=2.74, so -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72 kcal, which is probably the answer. But let me check the calculation again for possible errors.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of reaction, and maybe the standard value is taken as exactly -57.2 kJ/mol (sometimes rounded). Let me see.\n\nIf using 57.2 kJ/mol, then in kcal, that's 57.2 /4.184 \u224813.67 kcal/mol. So 0.2 mol *13.67 \u22482.734, so that rounds to -2.73 kcal. The option A is -2.72, which is very close. So probably that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering which acid and base are reacting. Wait, but H2SO4 is diprotic. Wait, when H2SO4 is in solution, the first dissociation is complete, but the second H+ might not be fully dissociated. Wait, but for strong acids like H2SO4, the first H+ is fully dissociated, the second H+ is also considered strong? Or is the second H+ weak?\n\nHmm, this might complicate things. Wait, actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second dissociation is not as strong. Wait, but in many cases, especially in problems like this, H2SO4 is treated as a strong diprotic acid, meaning both H+ ions are fully dissociated. Because otherwise, the problem would have to specify, but since it's a standard question, I think we can assume both H+ are fully dissociated. So my previous calculation holds.\n\nAnother point: when mixing the three solutions, the total volume would be 500+300+200 =1000 mL =1 L. But maybe the volume doesn't matter here because we are looking at moles?\n\nWait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. The total moles of H+ and OH- that react is 0.2 moles, so the total enthalpy is 0.2 times the enthalpy per mole. \n\nWait another thought: the problem says \"enthalpy of neutralization\", which is usually defined as the heat released when one mole of water is formed from the reaction of an acid and a base. So, the enthalpy change per mole of water is -57.3 kJ/mol. Since the moles of water formed would be equal to the moles of H+ and OH- that reacted (which is 0.2 mol), then total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ. Let me compute that in kcal. 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 \u224813.7). \n\nSo 0.2 *13.7 = 2.74, so -2.74 kcal. The closest option is A) -2.72. Maybe the question uses a slightly different value for the enthalpy. For example, if they use 57.1 kJ/mol, then 57.1/4.184 =13.65, so 0.2*13.65=2.73, which would be -2.73, but the option A is 2.72. Hmm, maybe the problem is using 57 kJ/mol?\n\nWait 57 kJ/mol divided by 4.184 gives 13.62 kcal/mol. 0.2*13.62 =2.724, which would round to 2.72, so that's exactly option A. So perhaps they used 57 kJ/mol as the enthalpy of neutralization. That would make sense. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check again:\n\nHCl: 0.5 L *0.2 M =0.1 mol H+.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol H2SO4 \u2192 0.09*2=0.18 H+.\n\nTotal H+ =0.28 mol.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 \u2192 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nSo yes, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So the reaction consumes 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nTherefore, the moles of reaction (water formed) is 0.2 mol. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) \u2192 -11.46 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Wait, but the options have A in kcal and D in kJ. So if the question wants the answer in kcal, then A is correct. But if the calculation in kJ would be -11.46 kJ, which is close to option B's -11.42 kcal? Wait no, option B is in kcal. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the total heat released as (moles of reaction) * (enthalpy per mole). The enthalpy per mole is -57.32 kJ/mol (for strong acid and base). So 0.2 mol * -57.32 kJ/mol = -11.464 kJ. If the answer is in kJ, that would be approximately -11.5 kJ, but none of the options have that in kJ except D which is -16.0, which is way off. So maybe the question expects the answer in kcal, so converting that -11.464 kJ to kcal: divide by 4.184. 11.464 /4.184 \u22482.74. So that's -2.74 kcal, which matches option A's -2.72 if rounded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the total moles of H+ and OH- and which is the limiting reagent. Wait, but I think that's correct here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the stoichiometry. Let me think again. \n\nWait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so each molecule provides two H+ ions, so that part is right. The HCl is monoprotic. The Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per formula unit, so that's correct. So the calculations of moles are correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you mix all three solutions, the reaction between H+ and OH- is the only one that contributes to the enthalpy of neutralization. The other ions (like Ba\u00b2+, Cl-, SO4^2-) don't participate in the neutralization reaction, so their presence doesn't affect the enthalpy calculation. So the calculation should be correct as done before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A) -2.72 kcal.\n",

I guess I need to figure out the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. The limiting reactant will determine how much actually reacts. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. \n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each acid and the base. \n\nFirst, for HCl: 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So that's 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it donates 1 H+ per molecule. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.\n\nNext, H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 300 mL. The volume in liters is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is strong, the second is weak, but in neutralization with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, maybe both H+ ions are released? Wait, actually, in reactions with strong bases, both H+ from H2SO4 would be considered. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. Therefore, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.\n\nNow the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Volume is 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH- ions. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.\n\nSo total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. OH- from base is 0.2 moles. \n\nNow, the reaction between H+ and OH- gives H2O. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The enthalpy change per mole is typically around -57.32 kJ/mol (I remember that value from before). But let me confirm: the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is about -57.32 kJ per mole of water formed. Wait, but here, the H2SO4 might contribute both H+ ions. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, all the OH- will react. \n\nWait, but which is the limiting reagent here? The H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. Since they react 1:1, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So the moles of reaction that occur are 0.2 moles. \n\nTherefore, the total enthalpy change would be moles \u00d7 \u0394H per mole. So 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -11.464 kJ. Wait, but the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, C is -3.80 kcal, D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, the calculation I did gives around -11.464 kJ. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's in kcal. Oh, so maybe I made a mistake in units. Wait, the standard enthalpy is -57.32 kJ/mol, so if I did that in kJ, then 0.2\u00d7-57.32 is ~-11.464 kJ. But the options have B as kcal. So perhaps the question expects kcal. \n\nWait, let me recall the conversion. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So to convert kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184. So -11.464 kJ divided by 4.184 is approximately -2.74 kcal. Wait, but that would be option A. But that contradicts. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation steps. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the correct value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in moles. Let me recalculate:\n\nHCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl \u2192 0.1 H+.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L (300 mL) is 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ so 0.18 mol H+.\n\nTotal H+ = 0.28 mol.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 \u2192 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nSo H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2 \u2192 OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol reacted. \n\nSo the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) \u2192 -11.464 kJ. If the options are in kcal, then -11.464 kJ divided by 4.184 is about -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's close. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if someone kept it in kJ but the option is written as kcal. Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the enthalpy of neutralization is -13.7 kcal/mol? Wait, maybe the standard value is -13.7 kcal per mole? Let me think. \n\nWait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.1 kJ/mol. Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 57.1/4.184 \u224813.64 kcal/mol. So per mole of H2O formed, the enthalpy is -13.64 kcal. \n\nAh, so if the question uses that value, then the calculation would be:\n\nmoles reacted (0.2 mol) \u00d7 (-13.64 kcal/mol) = 0.2 \u00d7 -13.64 = -2.728 kcal. Which rounds to -2.73 kcal, so that's option A. \n\nWait, but why is the option B -11.42 kcal? Because that would be if you kept the answer in kJ but converted incorrectly. Wait, but the problem says \"enthalpy of neutralization\" which is typically reported in kJ or kcal. The options have both. Let me check the question again. The options are A and C in kcal, B and D in kJ? Wait no, D is -16.0 kJ. The question might be mixing units. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Wait, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is less, so only 0.2 moles can react, forming 0.2 moles of H2O. So using -13.7 kcal per mole gives 0.2\u00d7-13.7 = -2.74, which is close to option A. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, perhaps the question uses a different value. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and the excess. Wait, maybe I need to see the reaction between each acid and the base. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the individual reactions. \n\nWait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second H+ might not be fully neutralized. Wait, but in the presence of excess OH-, maybe both H+ ions are neutralized. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 would react completely until one runs out. \n\nWait, but my initial calculation seems right. So the answer would be A? But the question's options have B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, a precipitate forms? Wait, BaSO4 is insoluble. Oh wait! Oh, that's a good point! Because H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Wait, but does that affect the enthalpy of neutralization?\n\nHmm, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically the heat released when an acid and base neutralize each other. But if there's a precipitation reaction, maybe that's part of the reaction. Let me think. \n\nThe reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:\n\nH2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O\n\nSimilarly, HCl and Ba(OH)2 would react as:\n\n2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n\nSo the total reaction would involve both acids reacting with the base. But the key here is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. The precipitation of BaSO4 doesn't affect the enthalpy of neutralization (which is about the H+ and OH- combining), but maybe the presence of other ions doesn't change that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the stoichiometry of each reaction. Let me see. \n\nLet me first calculate the total H+ and OH- as before. H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So the OH- is limiting. So only 0.2 mol of H+ can react. \n\nThe total moles of H2O formed would be 0.2 mol. \n\nUsing the standard enthalpy per mole of H2O, which is -57.32 kJ/mol, so 0.2 \u00d7 -57.32 = -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options are A: -2.72 kcal, B: -11.42 kcal, C: -3.80 kcal, D: -16.0 kJ. \n\nSo -11.464 kJ is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is closest to option B if it were in kJ. But option B is in kcal. Wait, maybe the question expects the answer in kcal? But then converting -11.464 kJ to kcal would be -11.464 /4.184 \u2248 -2.74 kcal, which is option A. \n\nHmm. There's a conflict here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the enthalpy of neutralization is -13.7 kcal per mole (since 57.32 kJ \u224813.7 kcal). So 0.2 mol \u00d7-13.7 kcal gives exactly -2.74, which is very close to option A (-2.72 kcal). Maybe there was a rounding difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me check again:\n\nHCl: 0.2 M \u00d7 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M \u00d7 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ \u2192 0.18 mol H+. Correct.\n\nTotal H+ = 0.28. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M \u00d70.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- \u2192 0.2 mol. \n\nSo yes, that's right. \n\nHmm. So then the answer should be A? But option B is in kcal as well but the number is 11.42. Wait, maybe the question is considering the total reaction between the acids and the base, but taking into account the stoichiometry of each acid?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's consider each acid separately. \n\nFirst, HCl and Ba(OH)2. The reaction is:\n\n2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n\nSo moles of HCl available: 0.1 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2 available: 0.1 mol.\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio is 2:1. So for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, you need 0.2 mol HCl. But we only have 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is limiting here. \n\nWait, but then maybe I need to do a step-by-step approach. \n\nWait, this might be the problem. I assumed all H+ and OH- just combine, but perhaps I need to consider each acid's reaction with the base. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first determine which acid and base react first. \n\nAlternatively, since both acids are present, they will both react with the base. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see:\n\nTotal H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.28 mol. \n\nTotal OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol. \n\nSo the OH- is the limiting reagent, so all 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+ to form 0.2 mol H2O. \n\nThe remaining H+ (0.08 mol) will remain unreacted. \n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change is based on 0.2 mol of reaction. \n\nThus, using -57.32 kJ/mol gives 0.2\u00d7-57.32 = -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options given are: \n\nA) -2.72 kcal \n\nB) -11.42 kcal \n\nC) -3.80 kcal \n\nD) -16.0 kJ \n\nHmm. So option D is in kJ and is -16.0, which is not close. \n\nOption B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if they considered the value in kJ but wrote kcal by mistake. Or perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ but the options have a typo? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the conversion again. \n\nWait, if the question uses a different enthalpy of neutralization. For example, maybe -55.2 kJ/mol? Let me see: 0.2\u00d755.2=11.04, which is close to 11.42. Not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enthalpy for H2SO4 is different? Since H2SO4's second H+ is not fully neutralized in some cases, but in this case, since we have excess H+ from HCl and H2SO4, but the OH- is limiting, so even if the second H+ from H2SO4 is weak, the OH- would still react with all available H+ until it's gone. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the H2SO4's second H+ is not counted because it's a weak acid? \n\nWait, H2SO4's first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. So maybe only one H+ per H2SO4 is considered here? \n\nOh, that's a crucial point I might have missed. \n\nAh! If the second H+ from H2SO4 is not fully ionized, then the actual H+ from H2SO4 would be only 1 per molecule. Because the second H+ is from a weak acid. \n\nSo that changes things. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 mol (since each H2SO4 gives 1 H+ initially, and the second is not ionized in solution). \n\nWait, but in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, even the second H+ would be neutralized because the base is strong. \n\nHmm. This is a bit confusing. \n\nThe first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete: H2SO4 \u2192 2 H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, actually, no. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 \u2192 H+ + HSO4^- (completely). The second dissociation is HSO4^- \u21cc H+ + SO4^2-, which is not complete (pKa around 1.99, so it's a weak acid). \n\nSo in solution, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 1 (from first dissociation) plus some from the second, but in neutralization with a strong base, the OH- would deprotonate both. \n\nWait, when you add a strong base, the HSO4^- would donate its H+ as well. So in the reaction with Ba(OH)2, even the second H+ would be neutralized. \n\nTherefore, in neutralization reactions with strong bases, both H+ ions from H2SO4 are considered. \n\nTherefore, my original calculation is correct. \n\nSo the problem must be in the units. \n\nThe question is in enthalpy of neutralization, which is usually given as about -57.32 kJ per mole. So if the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, then the enthalpy is -11.464 kJ. \n\nLooking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ which is higher, but the closest in kJ is not there. \n\nWait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 11.42 \u00d74.184 \u2248 47.8 kJ. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different value. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is -57.3 kJ/mol. \n\nWait, but the calculation gives -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options have D as -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the moles. Let me check again:\n\nWait, H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 300 mL. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. \n\nYes. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- \u2192 0.2 mol. \n\nSo the OH- is 0.2. \n\nH+ total: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28. \n\nSo the OH- is limiting. \n\n0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -11.464 kJ. \n\nHmm. So the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) -2.72 kcal \n\nB) -11.42 kcal \n\nC) -3.80 kcal \n\nD) -16.0 kJ \n\nWait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is very close to the kJ value (but in kcal). Let me see:\n\nIf the question expects the answer in kcal, then the calculation is 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal. That would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for enthalpy. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires considering the specific reactions and the total moles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me consider each acid's reaction with the base. \n\nFirst, let's see the total moles of each acid and base:\n\nHCl: 0.1 mol H+ \n\nH2SO4: 0.18 mol H+ (if both H+ are considered)\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-\n\nTotal H+ is 0.28. \n\nThe OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. \n\nThus, the total heat released is moles of OH- (0.2 mol) \u00d7 \u0394H per mole. \n\nAssuming \u0394H is -57.32 kJ/mol, so 0.2 \u00d7 (-57.32) = -11.464 kJ. \n\nThe closest option in kJ is D (-16.0 kJ) which is not close. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal and the value is -57.32/4.184 \u224813.7 kcal/mol. \n\nThen 0.2 \u00d713.7=2.74 kcal. So -2.74, which matches option A. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of H2SO4's H+. Let me recheck that. \n\nH2SO4 is diprotic, but only the first H+ is fully dissociated. The second is weak. \n\nWait, if the second H+ is not considered, then H2SO4 contributes only 0.09 mol H+. \n\nSo total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4 first H+) =0.19 mol H+. \n\nThen OH- is 0.2 mol. \n\nWait, then OH- is in excess. The H+ is limiting. \n\nSo moles reacted: 0.19 mol. \n\nThen enthalpy change would be 0.19 \u00d7-57.32 \u2248-10.9 kJ or -2.6 kcal (0.19\u00d713.7 \u22482.6). \n\nHmm. That's closer to option A. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. Whether the second H+ from H2SO4 is considered or not. \n\nIn neutralization with a strong base, even the second H+ (from HSO4^-) will react with OH- because the base is strong. So the HSO4^- will donate its H+ when OH- is added. \n\nTherefore, the second H+ should be counted. \n\nThus, the original calculation is correct: 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- \u2192 0.2 moles reaction. \n\nSo that gives -11.46 kJ or ~-2.74 kcal. \n\nOption A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. \n\nTherefore the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for enthalpy. For example, maybe -56 kJ/mol. 0.2 \u00d756=11.2 \u2192 11.2 kJ \u2192 which would be 2.68 kcal (11.2 /4.184\u22482.68). So that's very close to option A. \n\nHence, the correct answer is A. \n\nWait but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. If I messed up the moles. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the moles of H2SO4. \n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M \u00d70.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ \u2192 0.18. \n\nYes. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M \u00d70.2 L =0.1 \u2192 0.2 OH-. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is A. The options probably have a rounding difference. So I'll go with A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing these three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that neutralization reactions between acids and bases produce water and a salt. The enthalpy change here would depend on how much acid and base are reacting, right?\n\nWait, the question mentions three different solutions. I guess I need to figure out the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. The limiting reactant will determine how much actually reacts. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. \n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each acid and the base. \n\nFirst, for HCl: 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters). So that's 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it donates 1 H+ per molecule. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.\n\nNext, H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 300 mL. The volume in liters is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is strong, the second is weak, but in neutralization with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, maybe both H+ ions are released? Wait, actually, in reactions with strong bases, both H+ from H2SO4 would be considered. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. Therefore, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.\n\nNow the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 200 mL. Volume is 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH- ions. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.\n\nSo total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. OH- from base is 0.2 moles. \n\nNow, the reaction between H+ and OH- gives H2O. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. The enthalpy change per mole is typically around -57.32 kJ/mol (I remember that value from before). But let me confirm: the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is about -57.32 kJ per mole of water formed. Wait, but here, the H2SO4 might contribute both H+ ions. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, all the OH- will react. \n\nWait, but which is the limiting reagent here? The H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. Since they react 1:1, the OH- is the limiting reagent. So the moles of reaction that occur are 0.2 moles. \n\nTherefore, the total enthalpy change would be moles \u00d7 \u0394H per mole. So 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -11.464 kJ. Wait, but the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options: A is -2.72 kcal, B is -11.42 kcal, C is -3.80 kcal, D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, the calculation I did gives around -11.464 kJ. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's in kcal. Oh, so maybe I made a mistake in units. Wait, the standard enthalpy is -57.32 kJ/mol, so if I did that in kJ, then 0.2\u00d7-57.32 is ~-11.464 kJ. But the options have B as kcal. So perhaps the question expects kcal. \n\nWait, let me recall the conversion. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So to convert kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184. So -11.464 kJ divided by 4.184 is approximately -2.74 kcal. Wait, but that would be option A. But that contradicts. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation steps. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the correct value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in moles. Let me recalculate:\n\nHCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl \u2192 0.1 H+.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L (300 mL) is 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ so 0.18 mol H+.\n\nTotal H+ = 0.28 mol.\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 \u2192 0.2 mol OH-.\n\nSo H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2 \u2192 OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol reacted. \n\nSo the enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) \u2192 -11.464 kJ. If the options are in kcal, then -11.464 kJ divided by 4.184 is about -2.74 kcal. But option A is -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's close. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if someone kept it in kJ but the option is written as kcal. Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the enthalpy of neutralization is -13.7 kcal/mol? Wait, maybe the standard value is -13.7 kcal per mole? Let me think. \n\nWait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.1 kJ/mol. Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 57.1/4.184 \u224813.64 kcal/mol. So per mole of H2O formed, the enthalpy is -13.64 kcal. \n\nAh, so if the question uses that value, then the calculation would be:\n\nmoles reacted (0.2 mol) \u00d7 (-13.64 kcal/mol) = 0.2 \u00d7 -13.64 = -2.728 kcal. Which rounds to -2.73 kcal, so that's option A. \n\nWait, but why is the option B -11.42 kcal? Because that would be if you kept the answer in kJ but converted incorrectly. Wait, but the problem says \"enthalpy of neutralization\" which is typically reported in kJ or kcal. The options have both. Let me check the question again. The options are A and C in kcal, B and D in kJ? Wait no, D is -16.0 kJ. The question might be mixing units. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Wait, H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is less, so only 0.2 moles can react, forming 0.2 moles of H2O. So using -13.7 kcal per mole gives 0.2\u00d7-13.7 = -2.74, which is close to option A. But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, perhaps the question uses a different value. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and the excess. Wait, maybe I need to see the reaction between each acid and the base. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the individual reactions. \n\nWait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the second H+ might not be fully neutralized. Wait, but in the presence of excess OH-, maybe both H+ ions are neutralized. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 would react completely until one runs out. \n\nWait, but my initial calculation seems right. So the answer would be A? But the question's options have B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, a precipitate forms? Wait, BaSO4 is insoluble. Oh wait! Oh, that's a good point! Because H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Wait, but does that affect the enthalpy of neutralization?\n\nHmm, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is typically the heat released when an acid and base neutralize each other. But if there's a precipitation reaction, maybe that's part of the reaction. Let me think. \n\nThe reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:\n\nH2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O\n\nSimilarly, HCl and Ba(OH)2 would react as:\n\n2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n\nSo the total reaction would involve both acids reacting with the base. But the key here is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. The precipitation of BaSO4 doesn't affect the enthalpy of neutralization (which is about the H+ and OH- combining), but maybe the presence of other ions doesn't change that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the stoichiometry of each reaction. Let me see. \n\nLet me first calculate the total H+ and OH- as before. H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So the OH- is limiting. So only 0.2 mol of H+ can react. \n\nThe total moles of H2O formed would be 0.2 mol. \n\nUsing the standard enthalpy per mole of H2O, which is -57.32 kJ/mol, so 0.2 \u00d7 -57.32 = -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options are A: -2.72 kcal, B: -11.42 kcal, C: -3.80 kcal, D: -16.0 kJ. \n\nSo -11.464 kJ is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is closest to option B if it were in kJ. But option B is in kcal. Wait, maybe the question expects the answer in kcal? But then converting -11.464 kJ to kcal would be -11.464 /4.184 \u2248 -2.74 kcal, which is option A. \n\nHmm. There's a conflict here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the enthalpy of neutralization is -13.7 kcal per mole (since 57.32 kJ \u224813.7 kcal). So 0.2 mol \u00d7-13.7 kcal gives exactly -2.74, which is very close to option A (-2.72 kcal). Maybe there was a rounding difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me check again:\n\nHCl: 0.2 M \u00d7 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.\n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M \u00d7 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ \u2192 0.18 mol H+. Correct.\n\nTotal H+ = 0.28. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M \u00d70.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- \u2192 0.2 mol. \n\nSo yes, that's right. \n\nHmm. So then the answer should be A? But option B is in kcal as well but the number is 11.42. Wait, maybe the question is considering the total reaction between the acids and the base, but taking into account the stoichiometry of each acid?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's consider each acid separately. \n\nFirst, HCl and Ba(OH)2. The reaction is:\n\n2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n\nSo moles of HCl available: 0.1 mol. Moles of Ba(OH)2 available: 0.1 mol.\n\nThe stoichiometric ratio is 2:1. So for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, you need 0.2 mol HCl. But we only have 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is limiting here. \n\nWait, but then maybe I need to do a step-by-step approach. \n\nWait, this might be the problem. I assumed all H+ and OH- just combine, but perhaps I need to consider each acid's reaction with the base. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first determine which acid and base react first. \n\nAlternatively, since both acids are present, they will both react with the base. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see:\n\nTotal H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.28 mol. \n\nTotal OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol. \n\nSo the OH- is the limiting reagent, so all 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+ to form 0.2 mol H2O. \n\nThe remaining H+ (0.08 mol) will remain unreacted. \n\nTherefore, the enthalpy change is based on 0.2 mol of reaction. \n\nThus, using -57.32 kJ/mol gives 0.2\u00d7-57.32 = -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options given are: \n\nA) -2.72 kcal \n\nB) -11.42 kcal \n\nC) -3.80 kcal \n\nD) -16.0 kJ \n\nHmm. So option D is in kJ and is -16.0, which is not close. \n\nOption B is -11.42 kcal, which would be if they considered the value in kJ but wrote kcal by mistake. Or perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ but the options have a typo? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the conversion again. \n\nWait, if the question uses a different enthalpy of neutralization. For example, maybe -55.2 kJ/mol? Let me see: 0.2\u00d755.2=11.04, which is close to 11.42. Not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enthalpy for H2SO4 is different? Since H2SO4's second H+ is not fully neutralized in some cases, but in this case, since we have excess H+ from HCl and H2SO4, but the OH- is limiting, so even if the second H+ from H2SO4 is weak, the OH- would still react with all available H+ until it's gone. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the H2SO4's second H+ is not counted because it's a weak acid? \n\nWait, H2SO4's first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. So maybe only one H+ per H2SO4 is considered here? \n\nOh, that's a crucial point I might have missed. \n\nAh! If the second H+ from H2SO4 is not fully ionized, then the actual H+ from H2SO4 would be only 1 per molecule. Because the second H+ is from a weak acid. \n\nSo that changes things. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 mol (since each H2SO4 gives 1 H+ initially, and the second is not ionized in solution). \n\nWait, but in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, even the second H+ would be neutralized because the base is strong. \n\nHmm. This is a bit confusing. \n\nThe first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete: H2SO4 \u2192 2 H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, actually, no. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 \u2192 H+ + HSO4^- (completely). The second dissociation is HSO4^- \u21cc H+ + SO4^2-, which is not complete (pKa around 1.99, so it's a weak acid). \n\nSo in solution, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 1 (from first dissociation) plus some from the second, but in neutralization with a strong base, the OH- would deprotonate both. \n\nWait, when you add a strong base, the HSO4^- would donate its H+ as well. So in the reaction with Ba(OH)2, even the second H+ would be neutralized. \n\nTherefore, in neutralization reactions with strong bases, both H+ ions from H2SO4 are considered. \n\nTherefore, my original calculation is correct. \n\nSo the problem must be in the units. \n\nThe question is in enthalpy of neutralization, which is usually given as about -57.32 kJ per mole. So if the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O, then the enthalpy is -11.464 kJ. \n\nLooking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ which is higher, but the closest in kJ is not there. \n\nWait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 11.42 \u00d74.184 \u2248 47.8 kJ. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different value. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is -57.3 kJ/mol. \n\nWait, but the calculation gives -11.464 kJ. \n\nBut the options have D as -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the moles. Let me check again:\n\nWait, H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 300 mL. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. \n\nYes. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- \u2192 0.2 mol. \n\nSo the OH- is 0.2. \n\nH+ total: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28. \n\nSo the OH- is limiting. \n\n0.2 mol \u00d7 (-57.32 kJ/mol) = -11.464 kJ. \n\nHmm. So the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA) -2.72 kcal \n\nB) -11.42 kcal \n\nC) -3.80 kcal \n\nD) -16.0 kJ \n\nWait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is very close to the kJ value (but in kcal). Let me see:\n\nIf the question expects the answer in kcal, then the calculation is 0.2 mol \u00d7 (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal. That would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for enthalpy. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires considering the specific reactions and the total moles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me consider each acid's reaction with the base. \n\nFirst, let's see the total moles of each acid and base:\n\nHCl: 0.1 mol H+ \n\nH2SO4: 0.18 mol H+ (if both H+ are considered)\n\nBa(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-\n\nTotal H+ is 0.28. \n\nThe OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. \n\nThus, the total heat released is moles of OH- (0.2 mol) \u00d7 \u0394H per mole. \n\nAssuming \u0394H is -57.32 kJ/mol, so 0.2 \u00d7 (-57.32) = -11.464 kJ. \n\nThe closest option in kJ is D (-16.0 kJ) which is not close. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal and the value is -57.32/4.184 \u224813.7 kcal/mol. \n\nThen 0.2 \u00d713.7=2.74 kcal. So -2.74, which matches option A. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of H2SO4's H+. Let me recheck that. \n\nH2SO4 is diprotic, but only the first H+ is fully dissociated. The second is weak. \n\nWait, if the second H+ is not considered, then H2SO4 contributes only 0.09 mol H+. \n\nSo total H+ would be 0.1 (HCl) +0.09 (H2SO4 first H+) =0.19 mol H+. \n\nThen OH- is 0.2 mol. \n\nWait, then OH- is in excess. The H+ is limiting. \n\nSo moles reacted: 0.19 mol. \n\nThen enthalpy change would be 0.19 \u00d7-57.32 \u2248-10.9 kJ or -2.6 kcal (0.19\u00d713.7 \u22482.6). \n\nHmm. That's closer to option A. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. Whether the second H+ from H2SO4 is considered or not. \n\nIn neutralization with a strong base, even the second H+ (from HSO4^-) will react with OH- because the base is strong. So the HSO4^- will donate its H+ when OH- is added. \n\nTherefore, the second H+ should be counted. \n\nThus, the original calculation is correct: 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- \u2192 0.2 moles reaction. \n\nSo that gives -11.46 kJ or ~-2.74 kcal. \n\nOption A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. \n\nTherefore the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for enthalpy. For example, maybe -56 kJ/mol. 0.2 \u00d756=11.2 \u2192 11.2 kJ \u2192 which would be 2.68 kcal (11.2 /4.184\u22482.68). So that's very close to option A. \n\nHence, the correct answer is A. \n\nWait but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. If I messed up the moles. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the moles of H2SO4. \n\nH2SO4: 0.3 M \u00d70.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ \u2192 0.18. \n\nYes. \n\nBa(OH)2: 0.5 M \u00d70.2 L =0.1 \u2192 0.2 OH-. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is A. The options probably have a rounding difference. So I'll go with A.\n\n\nTo calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we first determine the moles of H\u207a and OH\u207b ions from the given solutions:\n\n1. **HCl (0.2 M, 500 mL):**\n   - Moles of HCl = \\(0.2 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{L} = 0.1 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n   - H\u207a contributed = \\(0.1 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n\n2. **H\u2082SO\u2084 (0.3 M, 300 mL):**\n   - Moles of H\u2082SO\u2084 = \\(0.3 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.3 \\, \\text{L} = 0.09 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n   - Each H\u2082SO\u2084 molecule provides 2 H\u207a ions (both fully neutralized by the strong base).\n   - H\u207a contributed = \\(0.09 \\times 2 = 0.18 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n\n3. **Ba(OH)\u2082 (0.5 M, 200 mL):**\n   - Moles of Ba(OH)\u2082 = \\(0.5 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.2 \\, \\text{L} = 0.1 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n   - Each Ba(OH)\u2082 molecule provides 2 OH\u207b ions.\n   - OH\u207b contributed = \\(0.1 \\times 2 = 0.2 \\, \\text{mol}\\).\n\n**Total H\u207a = 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H\u2082SO\u2084) = 0.28 mol.**  \n**Total OH\u207b = 0.2 mol.**  \n\nThe limiting reactant is OH\u207b (0.2 mol), so 0.2 mol of H\u207a reacts with 0.2 mol of OH\u207b to form 0.2 mol of H\u2082O.  \n\nThe enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H\u2082O is approximately \\(-57.32 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}\\).  \n\n**Total enthalpy change:**  \n\\[\n0.2 \\, \\text{mol} \\times (-57.32 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}) = -11.464 \\, \\text{kJ}.\n\\]  \n\nConverting to kcal (\\(1 \\, \\text{kJ} \\approx 0.239 \\, \\text{kcal}\\)):  \n\\[\n-11.464 \\, \\text{kJ} \\times 0.239 \\approx -2.74 \\, \\text{kcal}.\n\\]  \n\nThe closest option is **A) -2.72 kcal**, considering rounding differences.  \n\nAnswer: A",
