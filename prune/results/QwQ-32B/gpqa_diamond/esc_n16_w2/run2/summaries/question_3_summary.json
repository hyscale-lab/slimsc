      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x for a spin-half particle in the state 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9. Hmm, expectation values are calculated by taking the bra times the operator times the ket, right? Let me start by recalling the formula.\n\nThe expectation value \u27e8A\u27e9 for an operator A is \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9. Here, the operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. Since \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x are Pauli matrices, maybe I can compute each part separately and then add them up?\n\nFirst, let me write down the state vector. The given state is \u03c8 = 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let me compute the squares of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2. That would be 0.25 + (3/4) which is 0.25 +0.75 =1. Okay, so it's normalized, good.\n\nThe operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. To find \u27e810\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x\u27e9, this is the same as 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. So I can compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. The expectation value of \u03c3_z in this state would be the sum over the probabilities times the eigenvalues. That is, (0.5)^2*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) + cross terms? Wait, no, actually, maybe I need to think in terms of the bra-ket notation properly.\n\nWait, the expectation value of \u03c3_z is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3_z acts on |\u2191\u27e9 gives +1|\u2191\u27e9 and on |\u2193\u27e9 gives -1|\u2193\u27e9. So let's compute that:\n\nFirst, write the state as |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The bra \u27e8\u03c8| is 0.5*\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|.\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5\u27e8\u2191|\u03c3_z (0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9) + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z (0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * [0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, so the first part here is 0.5 *0.5 *1. The second term \u27e8\u2191|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is zero because \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is -|\u2193\u27e9, and \u27e8\u2191| and |\u2193\u27e9 are orthogonal. So first part is 0.5*0.5*1 = 0.25.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2)* [0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 is zero, since \u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, and \u27e8\u2193| and |\u2191\u27e9 are orthogonal. The second part here is (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9. Since \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is -|\u2193\u27e9, so that gives (sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2) * (-1). \n\nCalculating that term: sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4). So multiplied by -1 gives -3/4. Then multiplied by the sqrt(3)/2 outside? Wait, no, wait. Let me retrace.\n\nWait the second term's structure is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by [ ... ].\n\nInside the [...] for the second term: the second part is (sqrt(3)/2)*(\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9). Wait, no, the term is 0.5 times \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 (which is 0) plus (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo the second part inside is (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9. \n\nSo the entire second term is (sqrt(3)/2) * [ 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is -1, so that gives (sqrt(3)/2) * ( sqrt(3)/2 * (-1) )\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 times sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4), so that term becomes (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) ?\n\nWait no, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe second term's contribution is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)* (-1) ]\n\nSo inside the brackets: (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) multiplied by the 0.5? Wait no. Wait the terms inside the bracket after the \u03c3_z operator:\n\nThe first term in the bracket is 0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 which is 0, the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 which is (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1). So the entire bracket is (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1). \n\nThen, the entire second term is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by that bracket, so (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2*(-1)) \n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2 = (3/4), so the second term is (3/4)*(-1) = -3/4. \n\nTherefore, adding the first term (0.25) and the second term (-0.75) gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. \n\nOkay that's the \u03c3_z part. Now, the \u03c3_x term. Hmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli X matrix, which in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis is represented as:\n\n\u03c3_x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|. \n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, which is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The bra is \u27e8\u03c8| = 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|. \n\nSo \u03c3_x applied to |\u03c8\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|) (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nFirst term: |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| acting on the state: \u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2), so this term is |\u2191\u27e9*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSecond term: |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191| acting on the state: \u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5, so this term is |\u2193\u27e9*(0.5).\n\nThus, \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 + 0.5|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| multiplied by that result.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| ] [ (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 + 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5*0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.25*0 =0.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| times (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| times 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSo adding the first and fourth terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = (sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThus, \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660...\n\nWait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so divided by 2 is about 0.866. \n\nSo now, putting it all together. The expectation value of the operator is 10*\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = -0.5 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 \u22480.866.\n\nCalculating 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5*(0.866) \u22484.33. Adding those gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait wait, wait, let me check the calculation again. Wait, the question says up to one decimal place, so perhaps I need to be precise here.\n\nWait let me recalculate the exact value.\n\nFirst, let me do the exact calculation for \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9:\n\nThe terms were sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So exactly sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660254...\n\nSo 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 = 4.33.\n\nThen 10*(-0.5) is exactly -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. So that would be option C?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is -0.7. Option A is -1.4, which is further off. Option D is 0.85. Hmm, so according to this, the answer is C.\n\nWait but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the expectation value of \u03c3_x step by step.\n\nThe state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\n\u03c3_x in the basis is:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9,\n\n\u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo applying \u03c3_x to |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3_x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 )) = 0.5 \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 +0.5 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of \u03c8 with this vector. Let's write it as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|) \u00b7 [ (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 +0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: 0.5*0.5 * \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.25*0 =0.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9: (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)* \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nAdding first and fourth terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660254...\n\nYes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is indeed sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nTherefore, 10*( -0.5 ) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer is C) -0.7.\n\nWait but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me see:\n\nWait another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9:\n\nSince \u03c3_z has eigenvalues \u00b11, then \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is the probability of up times +1 plus probability of down times -1. The probabilities are |0.5|\u00b2 and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2, which are 0.25 and 0.75. So:\n\n0.25*1 +0.75*(-1) =0.25-0.75 = -0.5. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nFor \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, another approach is to note that in the basis of \u03c3_x's eigenstates, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since \u03c3_x is a Pauli matrix, the expectation value can also be written as the sum over components:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], then in the basis of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value would be:\n\nThe top component of \u03c8 is 0.5, the bottom is sqrt(3)/2. So \u03c8 is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Then \u03c3_x times this vector is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. The inner product of \u03c8 with this is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = same as before, sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the answer is C, -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is indeed -0.7, so that's the correct answer.\n",

So first part is 0.5*0.5*1 = 0.25.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3)/2)* [0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 is zero, since \u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 is |\u2191\u27e9, and \u27e8\u2193| and |\u2191\u27e9 are orthogonal. The second part here is (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9. Since \u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is -|\u2193\u27e9, so that gives (sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2) * (-1). \n\nCalculating that term: sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4). So multiplied by -1 gives -3/4. Then multiplied by the sqrt(3)/2 outside? Wait, no, wait. Let me retrace.\n\nWait the second term's structure is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by [ ... ].\n\nInside the [...] for the second term: the second part is (sqrt(3)/2)*(\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9). Wait, no, the term is 0.5 times \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 (which is 0) plus (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nSo the second part inside is (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9. \n\nSo the entire second term is (sqrt(3)/2) * [ 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\n\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 is -1, so that gives (sqrt(3)/2) * ( sqrt(3)/2 * (-1) )\n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 times sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4), so that term becomes (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) ?\n\nWait no, let me compute step by step:\n\nThe second term's contribution is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)* (-1) ]\n\nSo inside the brackets: (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) multiplied by the 0.5? Wait no. Wait the terms inside the bracket after the \u03c3_z operator:\n\nThe first term in the bracket is 0.5 \u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2191\u27e9 which is 0, the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*\u27e8\u2193|\u03c3_z |\u2193\u27e9 which is (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1). So the entire bracket is (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1). \n\nThen, the entire second term is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by that bracket, so (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2*(-1)) \n\nSo sqrt(3)/2 * sqrt(3)/2 = (3/4), so the second term is (3/4)*(-1) = -3/4. \n\nTherefore, adding the first term (0.25) and the second term (-0.75) gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. \n\nSo \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. \n\nOkay that's the \u03c3_z part. Now, the \u03c3_x term. Hmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli X matrix, which in the |\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u27e9 basis is represented as:\n\n\u03c3_x = |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|. \n\nSo to compute \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, which is \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9. Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, |\u03c8\u27e9 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The bra is \u27e8\u03c8| = 0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|. \n\nSo \u03c3_x applied to |\u03c8\u27e9 is (|\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| + |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191|) (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9 )\n\nFirst term: |\u2191\u27e9\u27e8\u2193| acting on the state: \u27e8\u2193|\u03c8\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2), so this term is |\u2191\u27e9*(sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSecond term: |\u2193\u27e9\u27e8\u2191| acting on the state: \u27e8\u2191|\u03c8\u27e9 is 0.5, so this term is |\u2193\u27e9*(0.5).\n\nThus, \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 + 0.5|\u2193\u27e9.\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is \u27e8\u03c8| multiplied by that result.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 = [0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| ] [ (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 + 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| times 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.5*0.5 \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.25*0 =0.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| times (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| times 0.5|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSo adding the first and fourth terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = (sqrt(3)/2).\n\nThus, \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.8660...\n\nWait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so divided by 2 is about 0.866. \n\nSo now, putting it all together. The expectation value of the operator is 10*\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9.\n\nWe have \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 = -0.5 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 \u22480.866.\n\nCalculating 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5*(0.866) \u22484.33. Adding those gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait wait, wait, let me check the calculation again. Wait, the question says up to one decimal place, so perhaps I need to be precise here.\n\nWait let me recalculate the exact value.\n\nFirst, let me do the exact calculation for \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9:\n\nThe terms were sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So exactly sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660254...\n\nSo 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*sqrt(3))/2 \u2248 (5*1.732)/2 \u2248 (8.66)/2 = 4.33.\n\nThen 10*(-0.5) is exactly -5. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. So that would be option C?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C is -0.7. Option A is -1.4, which is further off. Option D is 0.85. Hmm, so according to this, the answer is C.\n\nWait but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the expectation value of \u03c3_x step by step.\n\nThe state is \u03c8 = 0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. \n\n\u03c3_x in the basis is:\n\n\u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 = |\u2193\u27e9,\n\n\u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 = |\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo applying \u03c3_x to |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u03c3_x (0.5|\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2 |\u2193\u27e9 )) = 0.5 \u03c3_x |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2) \u03c3_x |\u2193\u27e9 \n\n= 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9.\n\nSo \u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 +0.5 |\u2193\u27e9.\n\nThen \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product of \u03c8 with this vector. Let's write it as:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x |\u03c8\u27e9 = (0.5\u27e8\u2191| + (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193|) \u00b7 [ (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9 +0.5 |\u2193\u27e9 ]\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\nFirst term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * \u27e8\u2191|\u2191\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nSecond term: 0.5\u27e8\u2191| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: 0.5*0.5 * \u27e8\u2191|\u2193\u27e9 = 0.25*0 =0.\n\nThird term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2191\u27e9: (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)* \u27e8\u2193|\u2191\u27e9 = (3/4)*0 =0.\n\nFourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)\u27e8\u2193| multiplied by 0.5 |\u2193\u27e9: (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) * \u27e8\u2193|\u2193\u27e9 = (sqrt(3)/4)*1.\n\nAdding first and fourth terms: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.8660254...\n\nYes, that's correct. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is indeed sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866.\n\nTherefore, 10*( -0.5 ) +5*(0.866) = -5 +4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer is C) -0.7.\n\nWait but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me see:\n\nWait another way to compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9:\n\nSince \u03c3_z has eigenvalues \u00b11, then \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is the probability of up times +1 plus probability of down times -1. The probabilities are |0.5|\u00b2 and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2, which are 0.25 and 0.75. So:\n\n0.25*1 +0.75*(-1) =0.25-0.75 = -0.5. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nFor \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9, another approach is to note that in the basis of \u03c3_x's eigenstates, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since \u03c3_x is a Pauli matrix, the expectation value can also be written as the sum over components:\n\n\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9. Since \u03c3_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], then in the basis of |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9, the expectation value would be:\n\nThe top component of \u03c8 is 0.5, the bottom is sqrt(3)/2. So \u03c8 is a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Then \u03c3_x times this vector is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. The inner product of \u03c8 with this is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = same as before, sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the answer is C, -0.7.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is indeed -0.7, so that's the correct answer.\n\n\nThe expectation value of the operator \\(10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x\\) is calculated by finding the individual expectations of \\(\\sigma_z\\) and \\(\\sigma_x\\) and then combining them. \n\nFor \\(\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle\\):\n- The state is \\(0.5|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}|\\downarrow\\rangle\\).\n- The expectation value of \\(\\sigma_z\\) is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle = (0.5)^2(1) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.\n  \\]\n\nFor \\(\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle\\):\n- Using the matrix representation of \\(\\sigma_x\\) and the given state, the expectation value is:\n  \\[\n  \\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle = \\left(0.5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 0.5\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866.\n  \\]\n\nCombining these results:\n\\[\n\\langle 10\\sigma_z + 5\\sigma_x \\rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 \\approx -0.67 \\approx -0.7 \\text{ (to one decimal place)}.\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state given is 0.5 times |\u2191\u27e9 plus sqrt(3)/2 times |\u2193\u27e9. The operator we need to find the expectation value for is 10\u03c3_z + 5\u03c3_x. Alright, expectation values usually involve taking the bra of the state, multiplying by the operator, then the ket of the state. Let me recall the formula: \u27e8A\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nFirst, let me write down the state properly. The state vector is \u03c8 = 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let's see: the coefficients squared should add to 1. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, the operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. To find the expectation value, I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. So I need to compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 separately and then combine them. \n\nStarting with \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, that should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3_z are +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. So, the expectation value of \u03c3_z is (0.5)^2*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) ? Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, the expectation value of an operator in a given state is calculated by taking the sum over the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their eigenvalues. \n\nWait, more precisely, since \u03c3_z acts on |\u2191\u27e9 to give +1|\u2191\u27e9 and on |\u2193\u27e9 to give -1|\u2193\u27e9, so when we compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9, let me write that out.\n\nLet me denote \u03c8 as a column vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is the first basis vector and |\u2193\u27e9 the second, \u03c8 would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. The \u03c3_z matrix is diagonal with entries +1 and -1. So \u03c3_z times \u03c8 would be [0.5*1, (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)]^T. Then the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 times that result. Since all coefficients are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [0.5, -sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\nCalculating that: 0.5 * 0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. Then 10 times that is -5. \n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli matrix for the x-component. Its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So applying \u03c3_x to \u03c8: let's compute that. The vector \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Multiplying \u03c3_x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]) with \u03c8 gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 times this result. Again, since everything's real, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. \n\nLet me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. That's two terms each equal to (sqrt(3)/4). Adding them gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is approximately 0.866. \n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866). Let's calculate each term: 10*(-0.5) is -5, and 5*(0.866) is about 4.33. Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but the options given are -1.4, 1.65, -0.7, 0.85. Hmm, so -0.67 is approximately -0.7, which would be option C. But let me check my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, double-checking \u03c3_z expectation:\n\nThe state is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The expectation of \u03c3_z is (probability of |\u2191\u27e9)*1 + (probability of |\u2193\u27e9)*(-1). The probabilities are |0.5|\u00b2 and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2, which are 0.25 and 0.75. So 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct. So 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5.\n\nFor \u03c3_x, perhaps I made an error here. Let's recalculate the expectation value of \u03c3_x step by step. \n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is the inner product of \u03c8 with \u03c3_x \u03c8. \n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\n\u03c3_x \u03c8 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. \n\nThe inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). \n\nWait, that's exactly two terms each of 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) so adding gives sqrt(3)/2. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So that's correct. \n\nSo 5 multiplied by that is 5*(0.866) \u2248 4.33. \n\nThen total expectation value is -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer should be C) -0.7. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake in the operator's coefficients. The question says 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x, so yes, that's correct. The coefficients are 10 and 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the terms when calculating the inner product for \u03c3_x? Let me think. The inner product is \u03c8* \u03c3_x \u03c8. Since \u03c8 is a column vector, the bra is the conjugate transpose. So when you do \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8, the first component of \u03c8 is 0.5, the second is sqrt(3)/2. The \u03c3_x \u03c8 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. So the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) which is indeed the same as sqrt(3)/2. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the calculation is right. The options given include C) -0.7, which matches. So the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the sign? Let me check the \u03c3_x calculation again. The \u03c3_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So multiplying by \u03c8 gives:\n\nFirst component: 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSecond component: 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. The inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the second component of the bra is sqrt(3)/2, so the second term is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by 0.5 (the second component of \u03c3_x \u03c8). Wait, the second component of \u03c3_x \u03c8 is 0.5. So the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). \n\nWait, so the first term is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). So both terms are the same, so adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. That's correct. \n\nHmm, so no mistake there. So the total expectation value is indeed approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to compute this. Maybe using the formula for expectation values in terms of the coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the question is using different conventions for the Pauli matrices? Like, sometimes \u03c3_z is represented as [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is what I used here, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the expectation value of \u03c3_z and \u03c3_x in some other basis, but since the state is given in the \u03c3_z basis, I think that's right. \n\nSo I think I've checked all the steps and everything seems correct. The answer must be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state given is 0.5 times |\u2191\u27e9 plus sqrt(3)/2 times |\u2193\u27e9. The operator we need to find the expectation value for is 10\u03c3_z + 5\u03c3_x. Alright, expectation values usually involve taking the bra of the state, multiplying by the operator, then the ket of the state. Let me recall the formula: \u27e8A\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8|A|\u03c8\u27e9. \n\nFirst, let me write down the state properly. The state vector is \u03c8 = 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. Wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let's see: the coefficients squared should add to 1. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.\n\nNow, the operator is 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x. To find the expectation value, I can split this into two parts: 10\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 +5\u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. So I need to compute \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 separately and then combine them. \n\nStarting with \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9. Since |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 are eigenstates of \u03c3_z, that should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for \u03c3_z are +1 and -1 for |\u2191\u27e9 and |\u2193\u27e9 respectively. So, the expectation value of \u03c3_z is (0.5)^2*(1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) ? Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, the expectation value of an operator in a given state is calculated by taking the sum over the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their eigenvalues. \n\nWait, more precisely, since \u03c3_z acts on |\u2191\u27e9 to give +1|\u2191\u27e9 and on |\u2193\u27e9 to give -1|\u2193\u27e9, so when we compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9, let me write that out.\n\nLet me denote \u03c8 as a column vector. Since |\u2191\u27e9 is the first basis vector and |\u2193\u27e9 the second, \u03c8 would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. The \u03c3_z matrix is diagonal with entries +1 and -1. So \u03c3_z times \u03c8 would be [0.5*1, (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)]^T. Then the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_z|\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 times that result. Since all coefficients are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [0.5, -sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\nCalculating that: 0.5 * 0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So \u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9 is -0.5. Then 10 times that is -5. \n\nNow for \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9. Hmm, \u03c3_x is the Pauli matrix for the x-component. Its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So applying \u03c3_x to \u03c8: let's compute that. The vector \u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Multiplying \u03c3_x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]) with \u03c8 gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c3_x|\u03c8\u27e9 is the conjugate transpose of \u03c8 times this result. Again, since everything's real, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. \n\nLet me compute that: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. That's two terms each equal to (sqrt(3)/4). Adding them gives sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is approximately 0.866. \n\nSo putting it all together, the expectation value of 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866). Let's calculate each term: 10*(-0.5) is -5, and 5*(0.866) is about 4.33. Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but the options given are -1.4, 1.65, -0.7, 0.85. Hmm, so -0.67 is approximately -0.7, which would be option C. But let me check my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, double-checking \u03c3_z expectation:\n\nThe state is 0.5 |\u2191\u27e9 + (sqrt(3)/2)|\u2193\u27e9. The expectation of \u03c3_z is (probability of |\u2191\u27e9)*1 + (probability of |\u2193\u27e9)*(-1). The probabilities are |0.5|\u00b2 and |sqrt(3)/2|\u00b2, which are 0.25 and 0.75. So 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct. So 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5.\n\nFor \u03c3_x, perhaps I made an error here. Let's recalculate the expectation value of \u03c3_x step by step. \n\nThe expectation value \u27e8\u03c3_x\u27e9 is the inner product of \u03c8 with \u03c3_x \u03c8. \n\n\u03c8 is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. \n\n\u03c3_x \u03c8 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. \n\nThe inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). \n\nWait, that's exactly two terms each of 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) so adding gives sqrt(3)/2. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866. So that's correct. \n\nSo 5 multiplied by that is 5*(0.866) \u2248 4.33. \n\nThen total expectation value is -5 +4.33 \u2248 -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer should be C) -0.7. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake in the operator's coefficients. The question says 10\u03c3_z +5\u03c3_x, so yes, that's correct. The coefficients are 10 and 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the terms when calculating the inner product for \u03c3_x? Let me think. The inner product is \u03c8* \u03c3_x \u03c8. Since \u03c8 is a column vector, the bra is the conjugate transpose. So when you do \u03c8\u2020 \u03c3_x \u03c8, the first component of \u03c8 is 0.5, the second is sqrt(3)/2. The \u03c3_x \u03c8 is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. So the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) which is indeed the same as sqrt(3)/2. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the calculation is right. The options given include C) -0.7, which matches. So the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the sign? Let me check the \u03c3_x calculation again. The \u03c3_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So multiplying by \u03c8 gives:\n\nFirst component: 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nSecond component: 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. The inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the second component of the bra is sqrt(3)/2, so the second term is (sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by 0.5 (the second component of \u03c3_x \u03c8). Wait, the second component of \u03c3_x \u03c8 is 0.5. So the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). \n\nWait, so the first term is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). So both terms are the same, so adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. That's correct. \n\nHmm, so no mistake there. So the total expectation value is indeed approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to compute this.
