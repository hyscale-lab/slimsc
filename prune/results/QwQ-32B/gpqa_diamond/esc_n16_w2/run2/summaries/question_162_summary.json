      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a pseudosphere is. From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape extended infinitely. But wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe it's referring to a specific parametrization or a portion of it?\n\nThe metric provided is ds\u00b2 = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Hmm, this looks like a conformal metric because it's scaling the standard Euclidean metric by a factor that depends on x and y. The denominator is (4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), so the scaling factor becomes infinite when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =4. That might be the boundary of the region where the metric is defined. \n\nSince the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, maybe the pseudosphere here is the region where the metric is valid. Wait, radius r=2 might refer to the maximum distance from the origin? Let me think. The denominator 4 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) would be zero when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =4, so that's the boundary. So the pseudosphere here is the region inside the circle of radius 2 in the plane, but with this metric. But since the metric is conformal, the area element would be the scaling factor times dx dy. \n\nWait, area in a metric space is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the region. Here the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. Since it's 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) multiplied by (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2), the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) and similarly g_yy. So the determinant is (32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2))\u00b2. Therefore, the area element dA would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) dx dy. Wait, no, actually, the determinant of the metric tensor for 2D here would be (32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2))*(32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2)) since both diagonal terms are the same. Wait, no, wait, the metric is given as ds\u00b2 = (32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2))(dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2), and g_xy = 0. Therefore determinant is (32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2))^2. The square root of determinant is 32/(4 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2). So the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy = [32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)] dx dy. Wait, but actually, in 2D, if the metric is diagonal with g_11 and g_22, then determinant is g_11*g_22, so sqrt(det g) is sqrt(g_11 * g_22). Since both are the same here, sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) = g_xx since they are equal. Wait, no, sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) would be sqrt( (32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) * (32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) ) = 32/(4 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). So yes, the area element dA is that multiplied by dx dy. \n\nTherefore, to find the area of the pseudosphere (which I think is the entire region where the metric is defined, so up to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4, since at x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =4, the denominator becomes zero and the metric becomes singular). So the area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 (since when x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =4, that's the boundary). But integrating from 0 to 2 in radius. Wait, but the coordinates here are Cartesian x and y. So maybe switching to polar coordinates would be better here. Let me set x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8. Then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2. The area integral becomes the double integral over the disk of radius 2 of [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] r dr d\u03b8 (since dx dy becomes r dr d\u03b8 in polar coordinates). \n\nWait, so the integral for the area would be:\n\nA = \u222b (\u03b8=0 to 2\u03c0) \u222b (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8 \n\nHmm, but wait a second, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up. That suggests that the integral might diverge. Let me check that. Let's see, the integrand's inner integral over r would be \u222b0^2 [32r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr. Let me compute that. Let me make substitution u =4 - r\u00b2, then du = -2r dr, so -du/2 = r dr. Then the integral becomes \u222b (when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0) [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) from u=4 to 0. The limits would reverse and the negative sign cancels, so it becomes (32/2) \u222b from 0 to4 (1/u) du. Which is 16 [ln u] from 0 to4. But ln(u) as u approaches 0 from the right goes to negative infinity. Therefore the integral diverges. So the area is infinite?\n\nLooking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D. \n\nWait, but why is the question referring to a pseudosphere of radius 2? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think again. The pseudosphere usually has a specific parametrization. For example, the tractricoid which is a classic pseudosphere has a finite area. But in this problem, the metric given might be different. The metric here is conformal to the Euclidean plane but scaled by 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). The region of validity is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4, so the disk of radius 2. But the scaling factor near the boundary (r approaching 2) causes the metric to blow up, leading the area integral to diverge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is being considered as a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but the problem is giving an intrinsic metric. In that case, the area computed via this metric would indeed be infinite because the integral diverges. So the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)0, B) 4\u03c0(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), C)4\u03c0(x\u00b2\u2212y\u00b2), D)+infty. So D is the correct answer here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integral. Let me recheck the substitution. The integral of [32r/(4 - r\u00b2)] dr from 0 to 2:\n\nLet me compute without substitution. Let me set u =4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r, so (du) = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2. The integral becomes \u222b_{u=4 to 0} (32/u)*(-du/2) = (32/2) \u222b_{0 to4} (1/u) du = 16 \u222b0^4 (1/u) du. But the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is divergent. So yes, the integral diverges. So the area is indeed infinite. So D is the answer.\n",

From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, the question here is about calculating its area using the provided metric. \n\nThe metric given is ds\u00b2 = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Wait, that looks like a conformal metric because it's scaling dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2 by a factor depending on x and y. The general form of a conformal metric in 2D is ds\u00b2 = e^{2u} (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Here, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). \n\nThe problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere when the radius is 2. Hmm, pseudosphere... I think the standard pseudosphere is parametrized by coordinates that might relate to hyperbolic geometry. But maybe here, the radius refers to the parameter in the metric? Wait, perhaps the radius here is the parameter r=2, so maybe the region where the metric is defined is such that 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 is positive. So the domain would be where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is the surface corresponding to this metric on the disk of radius 2?\n\nThe area would then be the integral over the disk of radius 2 of the area element given by the metric. The area element for a metric like this is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. Wait, the metric here is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) dx\u00b2 + (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) dy\u00b2, so the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), and g_xy = 0. So determinant g is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2))\u00b2. Therefore the square root of that is 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). \n\nTherefore the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy. So the area would be the double integral over the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy. Wait, but integrating over the disk of radius 2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 goes up to 4. Let me set up the integral in polar coordinates. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2. Then the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8\n\nBecause in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr d\u03b8. The 32/(4 - r\u00b2) term comes from substituting x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 with r\u00b2. \n\nSo the integral simplifies to 32 * \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} d\u03b8 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr \n\nThe integral over \u03b8 is straightforward. The integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 is just 2\u03c0. So the total area is 32 * 2\u03c0 * \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr \n\nNow let's compute the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du)/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging limits: when r=0, u =4-0=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0. \n\nSo the integral becomes \u222b_{u=4}^{u=0} [1/u] * (-du/2) = (1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du \n\nBut integrating 1/u from 0 to 4 would be problematic because as u approaches 0, the integral diverges. Wait, so the integral becomes (1/2)[ln u] from 0 to 4, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Therefore, the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr diverges to infinity. \n\nTherefore, the total area would be 32 * 2\u03c0 * (something infinite) \u2192 infinity. \n\nLooking at the options, D is +infty, which would be the answer. Let me double-check. The key point is that near r=2 (since the upper limit is 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up there. The integral over a region where the integrand has a 1/(4 - r\u00b2) term, which near r=2 behaves like 1/(4 - r\u00b2) ~ 1/(something approaching zero). So integrating from 0 to 2, the integral diverges. Hence the area is infinite, so the answer must be D.\n",

But wait, the question here is about calculating its area using the provided metric. \n\nThe metric given is ds\u00b2 = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Wait, that looks like a conformal metric because it's scaling dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2 by a factor depending on x and y. The general form of a conformal metric in 2D is ds\u00b2 = e^{2u} (dx\u00b2 + dy\u00b2). Here, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). \n\nThe problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere when the radius is 2. Hmm, pseudosphere... I think the standard pseudosphere is parametrized by coordinates that might relate to hyperbolic geometry. But maybe here, the radius refers to the parameter in the metric? Wait, perhaps the radius here is the parameter r=2, so maybe the region where the metric is defined is such that 4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 is positive. So the domain would be where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 <4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the plane. So maybe the pseudosphere is the surface corresponding to this metric on the disk of radius 2?\n\nThe area would then be the integral over the disk of radius 2 of the area element given by the metric. The area element for a metric like this is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. Wait, the metric here is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) dx\u00b2 + (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)) dy\u00b2, so the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), and g_xy = 0. So determinant g is (32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2))\u00b2. Therefore the square root of that is 32/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). \n\nTherefore the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy. So the area would be the double integral over the disk x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2264 4 of (32)/(4 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) dx dy. Wait, but integrating over the disk of radius 2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 goes up to 4. Let me set up the integral in polar coordinates. Let x = r cos\u03b8, y = r sin\u03b8, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2. Then the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [32 / (4 - r\u00b2)] * r dr d\u03b8\n\nBecause in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr d\u03b8. The 32/(4 - r\u00b2) term comes from substituting x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 with r\u00b2. \n\nSo the integral simplifies to 32 * \u222b\u2080^{2\u03c0} d\u03b8 \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr \n\nThe integral over \u03b8 is straightforward. The integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 is just 2\u03c0. So the total area is 32 * 2\u03c0 * \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr \n\nNow let's compute the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r / (4 - r\u00b2) ] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r\u00b2, then du/dr = -2r \u2192 - (du)/2 = r dr. \n\nChanging limits: when r=0, u =4-0=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0. \n\nSo the integral becomes \u222b_{u=4}^{u=0} [1/u] * (-du/2) = (1/2) \u222b\u2080\u2074 (1/u) du \n\nBut integrating 1/u from 0 to 4 would be problematic because as u approaches 0, the integral diverges. Wait, so the integral becomes (1/2)[ln u] from 0 to 4, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Therefore, the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b2 [ r/(4 - r\u00b2) ] dr diverges to infinity. \n\nTherefore, the total area would be 32 * 2\u03c0 * (something infinite) \u2192 infinity. \n\nLooking at the options, D is +infty, which would be the answer. Let me double-check. The key point is that near r=2 (since the upper limit is 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up there. The integral over a region where the integrand has a 1/(4 - r\u00b2) term, which near r=2 behaves like 1/(4 - r\u00b2) ~ 1/(something approaching zero). So integrating from 0 to 2, the integral diverges. Hence the area is infinite, so the answer must be D.\n\n\nTo determine the area of the pseudosphere with radius \\( r = 2 \\) using the given metric \\( ds^2 = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}(dx^2 + dy^2) \\), we first note that the metric is defined on the disk \\( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \\). The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which gives \\( \\sqrt{g} \\, dx \\, dy = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \\, dx \\, dy \\).\n\nConverting to polar coordinates (\\( x = r \\cos \\theta \\), \\( y = r \\sin \\theta \\)), the area integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^2 \\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta.\n\\]\nThe angular integral \\( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\) contributes a factor of \\( 2\\pi \\), simplifying the expression to:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 32 \\cdot 2\\pi \\int_0^2 \\frac{r}{4 - r^2} \\, dr.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( u = 4 - r^2 \\), \\( du = -2r \\, dr \\), the integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\int_0^2 \\frac{r}{4 - r^2} \\, dr = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_4^0 \\frac{-du}{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^4 \\frac{du}{u}.\n\\]\nThe integral \\( \\int_0^4 \\frac{du}{u} \\) diverges because \\( \\ln u \\) approaches \\( -\\infty \\) as \\( u \\to 0 \\). Thus, the area integral diverges to infinity. \n\nAnswer: D) \\( +\\infty \\).\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\nAnswer: D",
