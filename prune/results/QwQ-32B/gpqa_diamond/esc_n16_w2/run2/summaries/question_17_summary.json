      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says the solution is 0.02 M in the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric usually means the ratio is 1:1, right? Because EDTA typically binds to calcium in a 1:1 ratio. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then that should mean that the concentration of calcium ions and EDTA would each be related to that. But hold on, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. Hmm. \n\nThe formation constant (K) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The formation constant expression would be K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). Since it's a 1:1 complex, the denominator would be the product of the concentrations of free calcium and free EDTA. \n\nNow, if the solution is stoichiometric, that probably means that all the calcium and EDTA are complexed. Wait, but in reality, even if they are stoichiometric in the beginning, some might dissociate. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. So maybe the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions, we need to consider the dissociation of the complex. \n\nLet me write down the equation. The complex formation is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc Ca-EDTA. The formation constant K is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). \n\nThe problem gives K as 5e10. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA, the concentration of EDTA would also be x. \n\nSo, substituting into the K expression: \n\nK = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) \n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of it breaks into Ca and EDTA. So the initial assumption might be that the total complex is 0.02 M, but if some dissociates, then the actual concentration of the complex would be (0.02 - x), where x is the amount that dissociates. Wait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. Let me set up variables properly. \n\nLet me consider that the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let\u2019s let the concentration of free Ca^2+ be x. Since each Ca-EDTA that dissociates releases one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentrations of both free ions would be x. \n\nSo the equilibrium concentrations are:\n[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x (but wait, actually, the total complex is 0.02, so if some dissociates, the complex's concentration decreases. However, since the K is very large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. \n\nTherefore, the approximation can be made that [Ca-EDTA] \u2248 0.02. \n\nThen the formation constant K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 5e10. \n\nSo solving for x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10). \n\nLet me compute that: \n\n0.02 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. \n\nTaking the square root gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but maybe easier to write as 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. \n\nWait sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^(1/2). The square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is 10^(-13), so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) \u2248 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.3e-7. \n\nAh, so that would give x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. Which is option C. \n\nWait, so the answer should be C) 6.3x10^-7 M. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me re-derive. \n\nThe formation constant K is very large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. Therefore, the concentration of free Ca^2+ should be very low. The options given have C as 6.3e-7, which is small, so that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is 0.02 M in the total complex, and assuming that the concentration of free Ca is negligible? Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, which would be the x we found. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, so the reaction is: \n\nCa-EDTA \u21cc Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- \n\nThe dissociation constant would be 1/K, right? Because the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]), so the reverse reaction's K would be 1/K. \n\nSo the expression for the dissociation would be Kdiss = [Ca^2+][EDTA]/[Ca-EDTA] = 1/(5e10). \n\nLet me write that down. \n\nLet the concentration of Ca^2+ at equilibrium be x. Then [EDTA] is also x, and [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02. \n\nSo substituting into the dissociation equation: \n\n(x)(x)/(0.02) = 1/(5e10)\n\nSo x\u00b2 / 0.02 = 1/(5e10)\n\nx\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13 (since 0.02 is 2e-2, divided by 5e10 gives 2/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13). \n\nSo x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 \u2248 6.3e-7, same as before. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That seems right. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA) 2.0e-2 (which is 0.02, the concentration of the complex, but that can't be right since some is dissociated)\n\nB) 5e-3 (0.005) which is lower than the complex concentration but maybe not?)\n\nC) 6.3e-7 (matches our calculation)\n\nD) 1e-2 (0.01, also higher than the dissociation)\n\nSo yes, the answer must be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution is 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. I need to find [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nWait, right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) is given here. The stoichiometric concentration probably means that all the EDTA is complexed with Ca. So, the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. \n\nThe reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Since it's stoichiometric, the EDTA and Ca are in 1:1 ratio. So, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA must have been such that they reacted completely. But wait, actually, if it's a 1:1 complex, then the concentration of the complex is equal to the initial concentration of either Ca or EDTA, assuming they are present in stoichiometric amounts. \n\nBut here, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the solution is at equilibrium, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). But since all the EDTA is complexed (assuming it's the only form present), then the free EDTA concentration would be negligible, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe I need to set up the equilibrium properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stoichiometric concentration implies that the solution is made by mixing Ca\u00b2+ and EDTTA in a 1:1 ratio, so that all the Ca is complexed, but that's not possible because K is very large (5e10), so the reaction should go to completion. Wait, if K is 5e10, that's a very large K, meaning the reaction favors the product. So, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that would mean that essentially all the Ca is in the complex form. But then why is there any free Ca\u00b2+ left?\n\nHmm, maybe the question is a bit different. Let's think again. The problem says \"stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex\"\u2014maybe that's a typo, but I'll assume it's the complex formed. The key here is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the K is given. Since the K is large, but we need to find the [Ca\u00b2+], which would be very small. \n\nThe formation constant Kf is 5e10 = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Assuming that the EDTA is present only in the form of the complex and free EDTA is negligible? Wait, but that's not right. Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C = 0.02 M. Let\u2019s let x be the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- (since they are in a 1:1 ratio in the complex, their free concentrations would be equal at equilibrium). \n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\n[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x (Wait, no. Wait, maybe the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but when some dissociates, the complex concentration would decrease. Wait, perhaps I need to set up the equation properly.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think again. Let me denote the initial concentrations. Suppose we have a solution where Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, so they form the complex. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentrations would have been 0.02 M for Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M for EDTA. But since K is huge, almost all of them form the complex. The amount that dissociates is negligible. However, the question is asking for the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution. So even though K is very large, there's a tiny amount of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA present.\n\nLet me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ be x. Then the concentration of free EDTA is also x. The concentration of the complex is (0.02 - x), but since K is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate the complex concentration as 0.02.\n\nThus, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10. \n\nSolving for x: x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 1e-13 is 10^-13, so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5 \u2248 3.16e-7. Wait, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.3e-7. \n\nWait, let me do the calculation again. Let me compute 0.02 divided by 5e10:\n\n0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. \n\nThen the square root of 4e-13 is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) \u2248 1e-6 * 0.3162 \u2248 3.16e-7. \n\nSo 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.3e-7. \n\nTherefore, x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, so that's the answer. Let me check if I did everything right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the EDTA concentration is also x. Since the EDTA comes only from dissociation, the free EDTA would be x, and the free Ca is x. The complex is 0.02 - x, but since x is very small, we can approximate it as 0.02. So the equation is correct. So the calculation leads to 6.3e-7, which is option C. \n\nAnother way: Let me write Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10. Since [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, so Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10. \n\nSolving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) as before. \n\nYes, so the answer should be C.\n",

The question says the solution is 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. I need to find [Ca\u00b2+].\n\nWait, right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) is given here. The stoichiometric concentration probably means that all the EDTA is complexed with Ca. So, the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. \n\nThe reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + EDTA^4- \u21cc CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA^4-]). Since it's stoichiometric, the EDTA and Ca are in 1:1 ratio. So, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA must have been such that they reacted completely. But wait, actually, if it's a 1:1 complex, then the concentration of the complex is equal to the initial concentration of either Ca or EDTA, assuming they are present in stoichiometric amounts. \n\nBut here, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the solution is at equilibrium, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). But since all the EDTA is complexed (assuming it's the only form present), then the free EDTA concentration would be negligible, but that might not be the case. Wait, maybe I need to set up the equilibrium properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stoichiometric concentration implies that the solution is made by mixing Ca\u00b2+ and EDTTA in a 1:1 ratio, so that all the Ca is complexed, but that's not possible because K is very large (5e10), so the reaction should go to completion. Wait, if K is 5e10, that's a very large K, meaning the reaction favors the product. So, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that would mean that essentially all the Ca is in the complex form. But then why is there any free Ca\u00b2+ left?\n\nHmm, maybe the question is a bit different. Let's think again. The problem says \"stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex\"\u2014maybe that's a typo, but I'll assume it's the complex formed. The key here is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the K is given. Since the K is large, but we need to find the [Ca\u00b2+], which would be very small. \n\nThe formation constant Kf is 5e10 = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]). Assuming that the EDTA is present only in the form of the complex and free EDTA is negligible? Wait, but that's not right. Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C = 0.02 M. Let\u2019s let x be the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA^4- (since they are in a 1:1 ratio in the complex, their free concentrations would be equal at equilibrium). \n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\n[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x (Wait, no. Wait, maybe the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but when some dissociates, the complex concentration would decrease. Wait, perhaps I need to set up the equation properly.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think again. Let me denote the initial concentrations. Suppose we have a solution where Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, so they form the complex. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentrations would have been 0.02 M for Ca\u00b2+ and 0.02 M for EDTA. But since K is huge, almost all of them form the complex. The amount that dissociates is negligible. However, the question is asking for the concentration of Ca\u00b2+ in solution. So even though K is very large, there's a tiny amount of free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA present.\n\nLet me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ be x. Then the concentration of free EDTA is also x. The concentration of the complex is (0.02 - x), but since K is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate the complex concentration as 0.02.\n\nThus, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca\u00b2+][EDTA]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10. \n\nSolving for x: x\u00b2 = 0.02/(5e10) \u2192 x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12 \u2192 0.4e-12 \u2192 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 1e-13 is 10^-13, so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5 \u2248 3.16e-7. Wait, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.3e-7. \n\nWait, let me do the calculation again. Let me compute 0.02 divided by 5e10:\n\n0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. \n\nThen the square root of 4e-13 is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) \u2248 1e-6 * 0.3162 \u2248 3.16e-7. \n\nSo 2 * 3.16e-7 \u2248 6.3e-7. \n\nTherefore, x \u2248 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca\u00b2+.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, so that's the answer. Let me check if I did everything right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the EDTA concentration is also x. Since the EDTA comes only from dissociation, the free EDTA would be x, and the free Ca is x. The complex is 0.02 - x, but since x is very small, we can approximate it as 0.02. So the equation is correct. So the calculation leads to 6.3e-7, which is option C. \n\nAnother way: Let me write Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10. Since [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, so Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10. \n\nSolving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) as before. \n\nYes, so the answer should be C.\n\n\nTo determine the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex solution with a formation constant \\( K = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\), we start by setting up the equilibrium expression for the reaction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\n\\]\n\nThe formation constant \\( K \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nAssuming the concentrations of free \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\text{EDTA}^{4-}\\) are equal (denoted as \\( x \\)) and the concentration of the complex is approximately \\( 0.02 \\, \\text{M} \\) (since \\( K \\) is very large and dissociation is minimal), we substitute into the equation:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions \\([\\text{Ca}^{2+}]\\) is \\( 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\), corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
