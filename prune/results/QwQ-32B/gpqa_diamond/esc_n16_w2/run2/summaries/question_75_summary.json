The key here is to look at the provided DNA sequence and figure out what's wrong with it.\n\nFirst, the setup: They added an influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant to the N-terminus of GADD45G. They used a plasmid transfected into cells, but the protein isn't being expressed properly. The options give possible reasons. \n\nThe question is probably about a mutation or a problem in the coding sequence that would prevent proper translation. Let me look at the sequence provided. Since it's the plus strand (coding strand), the mRNA would be complementary. So the mRNA would be the reverse complement. Wait, but maybe I can check for a stop codon?\n\nWait, the options include a premature stop codon leading to early termination. Let me think. Let me see if there's a stop codon in the middle of the sequence. The DNA sequence is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be transcribed from this, so the mRNA would be complementary to the DNA's template strand. But since this is the plus (coding) strand, the mRNA would be the same as the DNA's plus strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be 5' ATG... until the end. Wait, maybe I can look for a premature stop codon in the mRNA sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the introduced antigenic determinant sequence has a stop codon in it. Let me check the beginning of the sequence. The first few bases are 5' ATG TAC CCA... The start is ATG (methionine). The first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. Wait, but maybe somewhere early there's a stop codon. Let me look through the sequence for a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA's plus strand (since mRNA is complementary, so the DNA's TAA would correspond to mRNA's ATT, but wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the DNA sequence, a stop codon is present in the coding sequence. Let me parse the DNA as codons. Let's look at the sequence in triplets. Starting from the first base:\n\nThe first codon is ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, etc. Let me scan through until I hit a stop codon. The DNA's plus strand has the coding sequence, so the mRNA is the same except U instead of T. So the mRNA would be:\n\n5' AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GTT CCAGA TAC GCC AAA TG... and so on. Wait, let's go step by step. The DNA is written as 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC... So each triplet:\n\nLooking for a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA (since the mRNA would have UAA, UAG, UGA as stop codons). Wait, the DNA's coding strand would have complementary to the template strand. So the mRNA is complementary to the template strand, so the coding strand's sequence is same as mRNA except T\u2192U. So the DNA's TAA would be mRNA's UAA, which is a stop. So if the DNA has a TAA, that would be a stop codon. Let me look through the DNA sequence for any of TAA, TAG, TGA in the coding sequence (i.e., before the actual stop codon should be).\n\nWait, the DNA's sequence is given, so let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA anywhere in the sequence.

The last few bases are ... GAGTGA3'. The last codon would be GAG TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the DNA's plus strand ends with GAG TGA. Since the mRNA is the same except T\u2192U, the last codon in the mRNA would be TGA (since DNA's TGA is mRNA's UGA). Wait, TGA in DNA's plus strand would translate to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. But that's the end of the sequence, so that's the intended stop codon. But maybe earlier in the sequence there's an unexpected stop codon.\n\nWait, let's look for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA sequence. Let me scan through the sequence.\n\nStarting from the beginning. Let me break the sequence into triplets:\n\nFirst few triplets:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT CCG GAA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TG A...

That's a stop codon in DNA's plus strand. Since mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop. So the DNA has a TGA in the coding sequence, which would cause a premature stop. So the ribosome would terminate early here, leading to a truncated protein. So that would mean the answer is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B says the ribosome terminated early. That's exactly what the TGA stop codon would do. The other options: A is a missense mutation, but a stop codon isn't missense. C is about proteolysis due to lack of linker, but that's not the issue here.

The key here is to check the DNA sequence for any possible stop codons that might cause premature termination. Because if there's a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, the protein would be truncated and not expressed properly, leading to low expression levels.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to translate it into amino acids to see if there's an early stop codon.

Let's go through the sequence step by step. \n\nWait, the first part is:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTCT...\n\nWait, here's a problem. The triplet after the initial part has \"AAA TGA\". Let me parse that.

That would mean the mRNA has a UGA stop codon at that position, which would terminate translation prematurely.

If the HA tag and the GADD45G weren't properly linked, maybe proteases would cleave it, but the problem here is that the protein isn't even made properly.
