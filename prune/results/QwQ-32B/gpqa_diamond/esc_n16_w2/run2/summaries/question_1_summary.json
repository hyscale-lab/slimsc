      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with different lifetimes. The problem gives me their lifetimes as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The options are different energy differences, and I have to pick the right one. Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. \n\nWait, right! The energy-time uncertainty principle. The basic idea is that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is related to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) by \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h, or maybe approximate it as h-bar over 2? Not sure exactly the exact form, but the key is that a shorter lifetime (smaller \u0394t) means a larger energy uncertainty (\u0394E). \n\nSo the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty in their energies for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, the uncertainty would blur the two energy levels together. \n\nEach state has its own lifetime, which would contribute to their individual energy uncertainties. The total uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps the larger one? Let me think. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Since \u0127 is a constant (~1.05e-34 J\u00b7s), but maybe in terms of eV and seconds, the exact value might not be necessary here because the options are given in orders of magnitude. \n\nLet me calculate the energy uncertainties for each state. \n\nFor the first state with lifetime \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1). Let's see, if I remember that \u0127 is about 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert that to eV\u00b7s, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so \u0127 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1.6e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 * 1e-9 s) \u2192 6.56e-16 / 2e-9 \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. Wait, that's 3.28e-7 eV for the first state's energy uncertainty. \n\nSimilarly for the second state with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s:\n\u0394E2 \u2248 6.56e-16 / (2 *1e-8) \u2192 6.56e-16/(2e-8) = 3.28e-8 eV. \n\nHmm, so the energy uncertainties are 3.28e-7 eV for the first and 3.28e-8 eV for the second. \n\nWait, but when distinguishing between two energy levels, the total uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe the larger of the two? Because if one has a bigger uncertainty, then the total uncertainty between them would be dominated by that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nThe energy levels have their own uncertainties. To resolve them, the separation between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nIn this case, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nSo the required energy difference is (3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8) eV. Let's calculate that. \n\n3.28e-7 is 0.0328e-6, and 3.28e-8 is 0.00328e-6. Adding them gives ~0.036e-6 eV, which is 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nWait, but the options given are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst, let's redo the calculation. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Let's compute both:\n\nFor the first state (\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 5.25e-26 J. \n\nConvert that to eV: since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 5.25e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (5.25/1.6)*1e-7 eV \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. That's correct. \n\nSecond state (\u0394t2=1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J \u2192 5.25e-27 /1.6e-19 \u2248 3.28e-8 eV. \n\nAdding them gives 3.28e-7 + 0.328e-7 \u2248 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nWait, but that would be 3.6e-7 eV. However the options are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8. None of the options are in that range. Wait, the options are way smaller. Hmm. Wait maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties? Because if one uncertainty is bigger than the other, then the minimum required separation is the larger uncertainty. \n\nIn that case, the first state's uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV, and the second is 3.28e-8. The larger is 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be greater than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the available options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nHmm, 3.28e-7 is approximately 3e-7, so the energy difference must be greater than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than 3e-7 eV is option C)1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 3e-7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is \u0394E \u2248 h/(\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant. Let me try that. \n\nh is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nSo for first state: \u0394E1 \u2248 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 6.626e-25 / 1.6e-19 = ~4.14e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.626e-34/(1e-8) = 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nThen the sum is 4.14e-6 + 4.14e-7 \u2248 ~4.55e-6 eV. \n\nStill way larger than any of the options except C (1e-4 eV). \n\nHmm, but the options given are way smaller. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. \n\nWait another thought: maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime, because the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, the first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so its uncertainty is higher. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. \n\nSo in that case, the required \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 (since \u0394E1 is larger). \n\nIn the first calculation (with h-bar), that was 3.28e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than 3e-7 is option C (1e-4). \n\nBut the options are given as A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times bigger than 3e-7 (since 3e-7 is 0.0000003, 1e-4 is 0.0001). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the uncertainty as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Because sometimes in the energy-time uncertainty, people use \u0394E \u0394t ~ \u0127, so maybe the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nSo with that formula, for first state: \u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.56e-7 eV. \n\nSecond state: 1.05e-34/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 ~6.56e-8 eV. \n\nThen the total required would be 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 \u2248 ~7.2e-7 eV. \n\nStill, same order of magnitude as before. \n\nHmm. So the options given don't include anything close to that except C, but that's way higher. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters. \n\nWait the problem states the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So the shorter lifetime (1e-9) has a larger uncertainty, so the required energy separation must be larger than the largest uncertainty (the one from the shorter lifetime). \n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than 6.56e-7 eV (for the first case using \u0127/\u0394t), then the answer would need to be an option larger than that. But the options are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, 6.56e-7 is approximately 6e-7, which is 6 x 10^-7. The options D is 1e-8, which is smaller. C is 1e-4. \n\nHmm, so perhaps I have a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state individually. Because if the energy difference is larger than each state's uncertainty, then they can be distinguished. \n\nWait, but if the energy difference is, say, 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than the uncertainties (which are on the order of 1e-7), then that would work. \n\nBut the problem is asking which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct answer must be the one that's bigger than the sum of the uncertainties? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the uncertainty principle as \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 h, so that the uncertainty in energy for each is h / \u0394t. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nThe energy resolution required is such that the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy for each state is proportional to 1/(lifetime). \n\nThe shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. \n\nTherefore, to resolve the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nBecause if the energy difference is less than the uncertainty of either state, then you can't tell them apart. \n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty of each is \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), in some units. \n\nWait maybe the problem is expecting an approximate calculation without getting into the exact constants. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nThe energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So for the first state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the uncertainty is larger. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each is roughly proportional to 1/(lifetime). \n\nSo if the lifetimes are \u03c41 and \u03c42, the uncertainties are \u0394E1 ~ 1/\u03c41 and \u0394E2 ~1/\u03c42. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. \n\nSo \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nLet me compute in terms of the given options. \n\nSuppose we take the proportionality as \u0394E ~ 1/(\u03c4). \n\nLet me see: \n\nSuppose the required energy difference is inversely proportional to the shortest lifetime. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the form \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127, so \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t. \n\nBut let's use approximate values. \n\nTake \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nCompute \u0394E for first state (1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. \n\nSo 1.05e-25 /1.6e-19 = (1.05/1.6)*1e-6 \u2248 0.656e-6 eV \u2248 6.56e-7 eV. \n\nSimilarly for the second state (1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = (1.05e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 1.05e-26/(1.6e-19) \u2248 6.56e-8 eV. \n\nSo the sum is ~7.2e-7 eV. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than this. \n\nLooking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 7.2e-7. \n\nBut the options given include D) 1e-8, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be C? But that seems way too big. Wait maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Let me recalculate with that. \n\nSo \u0394E1 = 1.05e-34/(2e-9) = 5.25e-25 J \u2192 5.25e-25/(1.6e-19)= ~3.28e-6 eV? Wait wait, no, wait, no, 5.25e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is (5.25 /1.6)*1e-6 \u2192 ~3.28e-6 eV? Wait that can't be right. Wait, 5.25e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is (5.25/1.6) * 1e-6 \u2192 3.28e-6 eV. \n\nWait, but that contradicts previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nWait 1.05e-34 divided by (2 *1e-9) is 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = (1.05 /2) * 1e-25 \u2192 0.525e-25 J. \n\n0.525e-25 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is (0.525 / 1.6) * 1e-6 eV \u2192 ~0.328e-6 eV \u2192 3.28e-7 eV. Oh right, okay. \n\nSo the previous calculation was correct. So the sum is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nHmm, so the required energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4 eV). \n\nBut 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is 1e-4 eV. \n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is indeed larger than 3.6e-7 (0.00000036 eV). \n\nSo why are the other options so much smaller? Maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula \u0394E \u2248 h / (\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant, so that gives a different value. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nh is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nFor first state: \u0394E1 = 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 6.626e-25 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 ~4.14e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.626e-34/(1e-8) = 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nTotal uncertainty would be ~4.5e-6 eV. \n\nAgain, the required energy difference would need to be higher than that. \n\nSo even with h instead of \u0127, the required energy difference is 4.5e-6 eV, so again the only option is C (1e-4). \n\nHmm. But the options include D)1e-8, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than the required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nIn the first calculation (using \u0127/(2\u0394t)), the first uncertainty is ~3.28e-7 eV. \n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than that, then the correct answer would be any of the options larger than 3e-7. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 1e-4, which is way bigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in units. \n\nWait the question asks for the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, then you can resolve them. \n\nWait maybe the problem is using the formula \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h. \n\nWait let's see, for the energy difference to be resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. \n\nThe uncertainty in energy for each state is given by \u0394E ~ h/(\u0394t). \n\nTherefore, the minimum energy difference needed is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum required \u0394E is the maximum of the individual uncertainties. \n\nWait the problem says \"clearly distinguish these two energy levels\". \n\nSuppose the two states have energies E1 and E2, with uncertainties \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. \n\nTo distinguish them, the separation between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nSo \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nUsing the first calculation (with \u0127/(2\u0394t)), the sum is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4). \n\nBut that's a big difference. Maybe the question expects us to use the approximate formula where \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), so in some units. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using natural units where \u0127 =1, so \u0394E ~1/\u0394t. \n\nBut even then, the numbers are still way off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. \n\nWait let me try another approach. \n\nLet me think in terms of the uncertainty in energy for each state. \n\nThe lifetime is the time over which the state exists, so the uncertainty in time is the lifetime itself. \n\nSo, \u0394t is the lifetime. \n\nThe energy uncertainty is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than this uncertainty. \n\nWait but each state has its own uncertainty. \n\nTo resolve two energy levels, the separation must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nSo, for state 1: \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) \n\nState 2: \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2) \n\nTotal uncertainty to resolve: \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \n\nThe energy difference must be greater than this. \n\nSo, substituting numbers: \n\n\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s \n\n\u0394t2 = 1e-8 s \n\n\u0394E1 = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J \u2192 convert to eV: 5.25e-26 /1.6e-19 = ~3.28e-7 eV \n\n\u0394E2 = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) \u2192 5.25e-26 J/(1e-8) ? Wait, sorry: \n\nWait 1.05e-34 divided by (2 *1e-8) is 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J \u2192 5.25e-27/(1.6e-19) \u2248 3.28e-8 eV \n\nAdding those gives 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.608e-7 eV. \n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at options: \n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 1e-9 is smaller \n\nB)1e-11 \u2192 even smaller \n\nC)1e-4 \u2192 1e-4 is larger (since 1e-4 is bigger than 3.6e-7) \n\nD)1e-8 \u2192 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7 (since 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 3.6e-7 is 3.6e-7). \n\nTherefore the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options given include C as 1e-4 eV. That's a pretty big energy difference. Maybe the question is expecting us to use a different approach? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum energy difference required, so the smallest possible energy difference that can be resolved is when the energy difference equals the sum of the uncertainties. \n\nTherefore the minimum required is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is C (1e-4), which is much larger, but there's no option between 1e-7 and 1e-4. \n\nWait, the options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except C are larger than 3.6e-7. \n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Maybe I miscalculated the exponents? \n\nWait let me check the exponents again. \n\n\u0394E1 = 1.05e-34 / (2e-9) \u2192 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. \n\nSo 1.05/(2) *1e-25 \u2192 5.25e-26 J. \n\nConverting to eV: \n\n5.25e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (5.25 / 1.6) * 1e-7 eV \u2192 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so given the options, the correct answer must be C. \n\nBut maybe the question is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states. \n\nWait, if the two states have their own energy uncertainties, the total uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). \n\nIn that case, sqrt( (3.28e-7)^2 + (3.28e-8)^2 ) \u2248 3.28e-7 * sqrt(1 + 0.01) \u2248 ~3.28e-7 *1.005 ~ 3.3e-7 eV. \n\nStill the same order of magnitude. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to D, and the only one bigger than that is C. \n\nSo I think that must be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, then yes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV. \n\nWait, but why is option D (1e-8) given? Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h, so \u0394E \u2248 h/(\u0394t). Let me see. \n\nWith h=6.6e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nFirst state: \u0394E1=6.6e-34/(1e-9)=6.6e-25 J \u2192 6.6e-25/(1.6e-19)= ~4.1e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.6e-34/(1e-8)=6.6e-26 J \u2192 ~4.1e-7 eV. \n\nTotal uncertainty 4.5e-6 eV. \n\nStill, only option C is bigger. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \u0394t as the shorter lifetime? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime (since that's the bigger uncertainty). \n\nThe shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the energy difference is larger than the bigger uncertainty (\u0394E1), then you can resolve them. \n\nIn that case, the required energy difference is larger than \u0394E1. \n\n\u0394E1 was 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nThe options given are A)1e-9 (too small), B)1e-11 (too small), C)1e-4 (bigger), D)1e-8 (1e-8 is smaller than 3.28e-7 (since 3.28e-7 is 3.28 x 1e-7, which is 0.328e-6, and 1e-8 is 0.1e-7). \n\nThus the smallest energy difference that can be resolved is when it's just larger than the largest uncertainty (\u0394E1). \n\nSo the minimum required is ~3.3e-7 eV. \n\nThe options don't have that. The closest higher is C (1e-4). \n\nHmm, but maybe the question expects us to use the formula \u0394E \u2248 1/(\u0394t) in eV\u00b7s units? \n\nWait, perhaps in some units where the uncertainty is 1/(lifetime in seconds) in eV? \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle in natural units (where \u0127=1) would give \u0394E \u0394t \u22481. \n\nSo if \u0394t is in seconds, then \u0394E (in eV) would be approximately 1/(\u0394t in seconds) multiplied by some conversion factor. \n\nWait, but maybe in the problem's context, they are using a simplified formula where the uncertainty in energy is roughly the inverse of the lifetime in seconds, but expressed in eV. \n\nWait let's see: \n\nThe conversion factor between seconds and eV is given by \u0127 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo, \u0394E (eV) \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t (s)). \n\nSo for \u0394t = 1e-9 s: \n\n\u0394E \u2248 6.582e-16 /1e-9 \u22486.582e-7 eV. \n\nSame as before. \n\nSo the required energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nThe options given are: \n\nA)1e-9 (too small), B)1e-11 (too small), C)1e-4 (larger), D)1e-8 (still smaller than 6.5e-7). \n\nThus, the only possible answer is C. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to D. The problem says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". \n\nSo if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, then it's much larger than the uncertainty, so they can be resolved. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the larger uncertainty between the two? \n\nThe first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so larger uncertainty (\u0394E1 = ~6.5e-7 eV). \n\nThus, the energy difference must be larger than \u0394E1. \n\nThe minimum possible energy difference that can be resolved is just over \u0394E1. \n\nBut since the options don't have anything in that range, perhaps the question is using a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is D? Let me see. \n\nWait perhaps the question is referring to the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states. \n\nThe energy difference between the states is \u0394E = |E1 - E2|. \n\nThe uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). \n\nSo sqrt( (6.5e-7)^2 + (6.5e-8)^2 ) \u2248 ~6.5e-7 eV. \n\nTherefore, to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than this. \n\nThus, 6.5e-7 eV is the minimum required. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger is C (1e-4 eV). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula where \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), but using the longer lifetime? \n\nThe longer lifetime has a smaller uncertainty. \n\nWait, but the longer lifetime (1e-8) has a smaller uncertainty. \n\nSo if you use the smaller uncertainty (\u0394E2=6.5e-8 eV), then the required \u0394E must be larger than that. \n\nIn that case, even D (1e-8) is equal to that. \n\nHmm, but then you can just choose D. \n\nWait but that would be if the uncertainty in the energy difference is just the larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, the problem says \"clearly distinguish these two energy levels\". \n\nSuppose the energy difference is exactly the uncertainty of the larger one. \n\nThen you can barely distinguish them. \n\nSo if the energy difference is equal to \u0394E1 (~6.5e-7), then they can just barely be resolved. \n\nTherefore, the minimum required is ~6.5e-7. \n\nThe options don't have that, but the next higher is C (1e-4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters. \n\nWait the problem says the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. \n\nSo the first has a shorter lifetime. \n\nWait, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nThe larger uncertainty is 6.5e-7 eV. \n\nThus, the energy difference must be greater than that. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible option is C. \n\nHence the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula where the energy uncertainty is \u0394E = h / (\u0394t). \n\nWait let me see with h: \n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s \n\n\u0394E1 = h / \u0394t1 \u2192 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 6.626e-25 /1.6e-19 = 4.14e-6 eV. \n\n\u0394E2 = h/(1e-8) \u2192 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nTotal required is 4.14e-6 + 4.14e-7 \u22484.55e-6 eV. \n\nThe options still don't have this. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have to think in terms of the energy resolution of the equipment. \n\nThe energy resolution must be better than the uncertainty. \n\nBut I think I've exhausted the possibilities. \n\nGiven that all calculations point to the correct answer being C, I'll go with that. \n\nWait but the options given include D (1e-8). \n\nWait, 1e-8 eV is 1e-8, which is smaller than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So it's not enough. \n\nSo C is the only option. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the energy uncertainty and \u0394t is the lifetime. For the first state (\u0394t\u2081 = 10\u207b\u2079 s), the energy uncertainty is \u0394E\u2081 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t\u2081) \u2248 (1.05\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s)/(2\u00d710\u207b\u2079 s) \u2248 5.25\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2076 J, which converts to ~3.28\u00d710\u207b\u2077 eV.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with different lifetimes. The problem gives me their lifetimes as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The options are different energy differences, and I have to pick the right one. Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. \n\nWait, right! The energy-time uncertainty principle. The basic idea is that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) is related to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) by \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h, or maybe approximate it as h-bar over 2? Not sure exactly the exact form, but the key is that a shorter lifetime (smaller \u0394t) means a larger energy uncertainty (\u0394E). \n\nSo the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty in their energies for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, the uncertainty would blur the two energy levels together. \n\nEach state has its own lifetime, which would contribute to their individual energy uncertainties. The total uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps the larger one? Let me think. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Since \u0127 is a constant (~1.05e-34 J\u00b7s), but maybe in terms of eV and seconds, the exact value might not be necessary here because the options are given in orders of magnitude. \n\nLet me calculate the energy uncertainties for each state. \n\nFor the first state with lifetime \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1). Let's see, if I remember that \u0127 is about 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert that to eV\u00b7s, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so \u0127 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1.6e-19) eV\u00b7s \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s / (2 * 1e-9 s) \u2192 6.56e-16 / 2e-9 \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. Wait, that's 3.28e-7 eV for the first state's energy uncertainty. \n\nSimilarly for the second state with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s:\n\u0394E2 \u2248 6.56e-16 / (2 *1e-8) \u2192 6.56e-16/(2e-8) = 3.28e-8 eV. \n\nHmm, so the energy uncertainties are 3.28e-7 eV for the first and 3.28e-8 eV for the second. \n\nWait, but when distinguishing between two energy levels, the total uncertainty would be the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or maybe the larger of the two? Because if one has a bigger uncertainty, then the total uncertainty between them would be dominated by that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nThe energy levels have their own uncertainties. To resolve them, the separation between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nIn this case, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nSo the required energy difference is (3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8) eV. Let's calculate that. \n\n3.28e-7 is 0.0328e-6, and 3.28e-8 is 0.00328e-6. Adding them gives ~0.036e-6 eV, which is 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nWait, but the options given are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst, let's redo the calculation. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Let's compute both:\n\nFor the first state (\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 5.25e-26 J. \n\nConvert that to eV: since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 5.25e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (5.25/1.6)*1e-7 eV \u2248 3.28e-7 eV. That's correct. \n\nSecond state (\u0394t2=1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = (1.05e-34)/(2*1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J \u2192 5.25e-27 /1.6e-19 \u2248 3.28e-8 eV. \n\nAdding them gives 3.28e-7 + 0.328e-7 \u2248 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nWait, but that would be 3.6e-7 eV. However the options are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8. None of the options are in that range. Wait, the options are way smaller. Hmm. Wait maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties? Because if one uncertainty is bigger than the other, then the minimum required separation is the larger uncertainty. \n\nIn that case, the first state's uncertainty is 3.28e-7 eV, and the second is 3.28e-8. The larger is 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be greater than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the available options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nHmm, 3.28e-7 is approximately 3e-7, so the energy difference must be greater than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than 3e-7 eV is option C)1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 3e-7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is \u0394E \u2248 h/(\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant. Let me try that. \n\nh is about 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nSo for first state: \u0394E1 \u2248 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 6.626e-25 / 1.6e-19 = ~4.14e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.626e-34/(1e-8) = 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nThen the sum is 4.14e-6 + 4.14e-7 \u2248 ~4.55e-6 eV. \n\nStill way larger than any of the options except C (1e-4 eV). \n\nHmm, but the options given are way smaller. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. \n\nWait another thought: maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime, because the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, the first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so its uncertainty is higher. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. \n\nSo in that case, the required \u0394E must be greater than \u0394E1 (since \u0394E1 is larger). \n\nIn the first calculation (with h-bar), that was 3.28e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than 3e-7 is option C (1e-4). \n\nBut the options are given as A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is 1e-4 is 10,000 times bigger than 3e-7 (since 3e-7 is 0.0000003, 1e-4 is 0.0001). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the uncertainty as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Because sometimes in the energy-time uncertainty, people use \u0394E \u0394t ~ \u0127, so maybe the formula is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nSo with that formula, for first state: \u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.56e-7 eV. \n\nSecond state: 1.05e-34/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 ~6.56e-8 eV. \n\nThen the total required would be 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 \u2248 ~7.2e-7 eV. \n\nStill, same order of magnitude as before. \n\nHmm. So the options given don't include anything close to that except C, but that's way higher. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters. \n\nWait the problem states the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So the shorter lifetime (1e-9) has a larger uncertainty, so the required energy separation must be larger than the largest uncertainty (the one from the shorter lifetime). \n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than 6.56e-7 eV (for the first case using \u0127/\u0394t), then the answer would need to be an option larger than that. But the options are A) 1e-9, B) 1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nWait, 6.56e-7 is approximately 6e-7, which is 6 x 10^-7. The options D is 1e-8, which is smaller. C is 1e-4. \n\nHmm, so perhaps I have a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state individually. Because if the energy difference is larger than each state's uncertainty, then they can be distinguished. \n\nWait, but if the energy difference is, say, 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than the uncertainties (which are on the order of 1e-7), then that would work. \n\nBut the problem is asking which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct answer must be the one that's bigger than the sum of the uncertainties? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the uncertainty principle as \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 h, so that the uncertainty in energy for each is h / \u0394t. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nThe energy resolution required is such that the energy difference \u0394E must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy for each state is proportional to 1/(lifetime). \n\nThe shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. \n\nTherefore, to resolve the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nBecause if the energy difference is less than the uncertainty of either state, then you can't tell them apart. \n\nWait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty of each is \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), in some units. \n\nWait maybe the problem is expecting an approximate calculation without getting into the exact constants. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nThe energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So for the first state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the uncertainty is larger. \n\nThe energy uncertainty for each is roughly proportional to 1/(lifetime). \n\nSo if the lifetimes are \u03c41 and \u03c42, the uncertainties are \u0394E1 ~ 1/\u03c41 and \u0394E2 ~1/\u03c42. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. \n\nSo \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nLet me compute in terms of the given options. \n\nSuppose we take the proportionality as \u0394E ~ 1/(\u03c4). \n\nLet me see: \n\nSuppose the required energy difference is inversely proportional to the shortest lifetime. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the form \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127, so \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t. \n\nBut let's use approximate values. \n\nTake \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nCompute \u0394E for first state (1e-9 s):\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 (1.05e-34)/(1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J. \n\nConvert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. \n\nSo 1.05e-25 /1.6e-19 = (1.05/1.6)*1e-6 \u2248 0.656e-6 eV \u2248 6.56e-7 eV. \n\nSimilarly for the second state (1e-8 s):\n\n\u0394E2 = (1.05e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J \u2192 1.05e-26/(1.6e-19) \u2248 6.56e-8 eV. \n\nSo the sum is ~7.2e-7 eV. \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than this. \n\nLooking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 7.2e-7. \n\nBut the options given include D) 1e-8, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be C? But that seems way too big. Wait maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the uncertainty as \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). Let me recalculate with that. \n\nSo \u0394E1 = 1.05e-34/(2e-9) = 5.25e-25 J \u2192 5.25e-25/(1.6e-19)= ~3.28e-6 eV? Wait wait, no, wait, no, 5.25e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is (5.25 /1.6)*1e-6 \u2192 ~3.28e-6 eV? Wait that can't be right. Wait, 5.25e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is (5.25/1.6) * 1e-6 \u2192 3.28e-6 eV. \n\nWait, but that contradicts previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nWait 1.05e-34 divided by (2 *1e-9) is 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = (1.05 /2) * 1e-25 \u2192 0.525e-25 J. \n\n0.525e-25 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is (0.525 / 1.6) * 1e-6 eV \u2192 ~0.328e-6 eV \u2192 3.28e-7 eV. Oh right, okay. \n\nSo the previous calculation was correct. So the sum is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nHmm, so the required energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4 eV). \n\nBut 1e-4 is 10^-4, which is 1e-4 eV. \n\nWait, but 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is indeed larger than 3.6e-7 (0.00000036 eV). \n\nSo why are the other options so much smaller? Maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula \u0394E \u2248 h / (\u0394t), where h is Planck's constant, so that gives a different value. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nh is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nFor first state: \u0394E1 = 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 6.626e-25 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 ~4.14e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.626e-34/(1e-8) = 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nTotal uncertainty would be ~4.5e-6 eV. \n\nAgain, the required energy difference would need to be higher than that. \n\nSo even with h instead of \u0127, the required energy difference is 4.5e-6 eV, so again the only option is C (1e-4). \n\nHmm. But the options include D)1e-8, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than the required. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nIn the first calculation (using \u0127/(2\u0394t)), the first uncertainty is ~3.28e-7 eV. \n\nSo if the energy difference is larger than that, then the correct answer would be any of the options larger than 3e-7. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 1e-4, which is way bigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in units. \n\nWait the question asks for the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, then you can resolve them. \n\nWait maybe the problem is using the formula \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h. \n\nWait let's see, for the energy difference to be resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. \n\nThe uncertainty in energy for each state is given by \u0394E ~ h/(\u0394t). \n\nTherefore, the minimum energy difference needed is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum required \u0394E is the maximum of the individual uncertainties. \n\nWait the problem says \"clearly distinguish these two energy levels\". \n\nSuppose the two states have energies E1 and E2, with uncertainties \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. \n\nTo distinguish them, the separation between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nSo \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. \n\nUsing the first calculation (with \u0127/(2\u0394t)), the sum is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger than that is C (1e-4). \n\nBut that's a big difference. Maybe the question expects us to use the approximate formula where \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), so in some units. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using natural units where \u0127 =1, so \u0394E ~1/\u0394t. \n\nBut even then, the numbers are still way off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. \n\nWait let me try another approach. \n\nLet me think in terms of the uncertainty in energy for each state. \n\nThe lifetime is the time over which the state exists, so the uncertainty in time is the lifetime itself. \n\nSo, \u0394t is the lifetime. \n\nThe energy uncertainty is \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t). \n\nThe energy difference must be larger than this uncertainty. \n\nWait but each state has its own uncertainty. \n\nTo resolve two energy levels, the separation must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. \n\nSo, for state 1: \u0394E1 = \u0127/(2\u0394t1) \n\nState 2: \u0394E2 = \u0127/(2\u0394t2) \n\nTotal uncertainty to resolve: \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \n\nThe energy difference must be greater than this. \n\nSo, substituting numbers: \n\n\u0394t1 = 1e-9 s \n\n\u0394t2 = 1e-8 s \n\n\u0394E1 = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J \u2192 convert to eV: 5.25e-26 /1.6e-19 = ~3.28e-7 eV \n\n\u0394E2 = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) \u2192 5.25e-26 J/(1e-8) ? Wait, sorry: \n\nWait 1.05e-34 divided by (2 *1e-8) is 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J \u2192 5.25e-27/(1.6e-19) \u2248 3.28e-8 eV \n\nAdding those gives 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.608e-7 eV. \n\nSo the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at options: \n\nA) 1e-9 \u2192 1e-9 is smaller \n\nB)1e-11 \u2192 even smaller \n\nC)1e-4 \u2192 1e-4 is larger (since 1e-4 is bigger than 3.6e-7) \n\nD)1e-8 \u2192 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7 (since 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 3.6e-7 is 3.6e-7). \n\nTherefore the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options given include C as 1e-4 eV. That's a pretty big energy difference. Maybe the question is expecting us to use a different approach? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum energy difference required, so the smallest possible energy difference that can be resolved is when the energy difference equals the sum of the uncertainties. \n\nTherefore the minimum required is ~3.6e-7 eV. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher value is C (1e-4), which is much larger, but there's no option between 1e-7 and 1e-4. \n\nWait, the options are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except C are larger than 3.6e-7. \n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Maybe I miscalculated the exponents? \n\nWait let me check the exponents again. \n\n\u0394E1 = 1.05e-34 / (2e-9) \u2192 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. \n\nSo 1.05/(2) *1e-25 \u2192 5.25e-26 J. \n\nConverting to eV: \n\n5.25e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = (5.25 / 1.6) * 1e-7 eV \u2192 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so given the options, the correct answer must be C. \n\nBut maybe the question is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states. \n\nWait, if the two states have their own energy uncertainties, the total uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). \n\nIn that case, sqrt( (3.28e-7)^2 + (3.28e-8)^2 ) \u2248 3.28e-7 * sqrt(1 + 0.01) \u2248 ~3.28e-7 *1.005 ~ 3.3e-7 eV. \n\nStill the same order of magnitude. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to D, and the only one bigger than that is C. \n\nSo I think that must be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The question says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, then yes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV. \n\nWait, but why is option D (1e-8) given? Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 h, so \u0394E \u2248 h/(\u0394t). Let me see. \n\nWith h=6.6e-34 J\u00b7s. \n\nFirst state: \u0394E1=6.6e-34/(1e-9)=6.6e-25 J \u2192 6.6e-25/(1.6e-19)= ~4.1e-6 eV. \n\nSecond state: 6.6e-34/(1e-8)=6.6e-26 J \u2192 ~4.1e-7 eV. \n\nTotal uncertainty 4.5e-6 eV. \n\nStill, only option C is bigger. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \u0394t as the shorter lifetime? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime (since that's the bigger uncertainty). \n\nThe shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the energy difference is larger than the bigger uncertainty (\u0394E1), then you can resolve them. \n\nIn that case, the required energy difference is larger than \u0394E1. \n\n\u0394E1 was 3.28e-7 eV. \n\nThe options given are A)1e-9 (too small), B)1e-11 (too small), C)1e-4 (bigger), D)1e-8 (1e-8 is smaller than 3.28e-7 (since 3.28e-7 is 3.28 x 1e-7, which is 0.328e-6, and 1e-8 is 0.1e-7). \n\nThus the smallest energy difference that can be resolved is when it's just larger than the largest uncertainty (\u0394E1). \n\nSo the minimum required is ~3.3e-7 eV. \n\nThe options don't have that. The closest higher is C (1e-4). \n\nHmm, but maybe the question expects us to use the formula \u0394E \u2248 1/(\u0394t) in eV\u00b7s units? \n\nWait, perhaps in some units where the uncertainty is 1/(lifetime in seconds) in eV? \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle in natural units (where \u0127=1) would give \u0394E \u0394t \u22481. \n\nSo if \u0394t is in seconds, then \u0394E (in eV) would be approximately 1/(\u0394t in seconds) multiplied by some conversion factor. \n\nWait, but maybe in the problem's context, they are using a simplified formula where the uncertainty in energy is roughly the inverse of the lifetime in seconds, but expressed in eV. \n\nWait let's see: \n\nThe conversion factor between seconds and eV is given by \u0127 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s. \n\nSo, \u0394E (eV) \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t (s)). \n\nSo for \u0394t = 1e-9 s: \n\n\u0394E \u2248 6.582e-16 /1e-9 \u22486.582e-7 eV. \n\nSame as before. \n\nSo the required energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV. \n\nThe options given are: \n\nA)1e-9 (too small), B)1e-11 (too small), C)1e-4 (larger), D)1e-8 (still smaller than 6.5e-7). \n\nThus, the only possible answer is C. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to D. The problem says \"could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". \n\nSo if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, then it's much larger than the uncertainty, so they can be resolved. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the larger uncertainty between the two? \n\nThe first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so larger uncertainty (\u0394E1 = ~6.5e-7 eV). \n\nThus, the energy difference must be larger than \u0394E1. \n\nThe minimum possible energy difference that can be resolved is just over \u0394E1. \n\nBut since the options don't have anything in that range, perhaps the question is using a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is D? Let me see. \n\nWait perhaps the question is referring to the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states. \n\nThe energy difference between the states is \u0394E = |E1 - E2|. \n\nThe uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). \n\nSo sqrt( (6.5e-7)^2 + (6.5e-8)^2 ) \u2248 ~6.5e-7 eV. \n\nTherefore, to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than this. \n\nThus, 6.5e-7 eV is the minimum required. \n\nLooking at the options, the only one larger is C (1e-4 eV). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula where \u0394E ~ 1/(\u0394t), but using the longer lifetime? \n\nThe longer lifetime has a smaller uncertainty. \n\nWait, but the longer lifetime (1e-8) has a smaller uncertainty. \n\nSo if you use the smaller uncertainty (\u0394E2=6.5e-8 eV), then the required \u0394E must be larger than that. \n\nIn that case, even D (1e-8) is equal to that. \n\nHmm, but then you can just choose D. \n\nWait but that would be if the uncertainty in the energy difference is just the larger uncertainty. \n\nWait, the problem says \"clearly distinguish these two energy levels\". \n\nSuppose the energy difference is exactly the uncertainty of the larger one. \n\nThen you can barely distinguish them. \n\nSo if the energy difference is equal to \u0394E1 (~6.5e-7), then they can just barely be resolved. \n\nTherefore, the minimum required is ~6.5e-7. \n\nThe options don't have that, but the next higher is C (1e-4). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the question's parameters. \n\nWait the problem says the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. \n\nSo the first has a shorter lifetime. \n\nWait, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. \n\nThe larger uncertainty is 6.5e-7 eV. \n\nThus, the energy difference must be greater than that. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible option is C. \n\nHence the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the formula where the energy uncertainty is \u0394E = h / (\u0394t). \n\nWait let me see with h: \n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s \n\n\u0394E1 = h / \u0394t1 \u2192 6.626e-34/(1e-9) = 6.626e-25 J \u2192 6.626e-25 /1.6e-19 = 4.14e-6 eV. \n\n\u0394E2 = h/(1e-8) \u2192 6.626e-26 J \u2192 ~4.14e-7 eV. \n\nTotal required is 4.14e-6 + 4.14e-7 \u22484.55e-6 eV. \n\nThe options still don't have this. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have to think in terms of the energy resolution of the equipment. \n\nThe energy resolution must be better than the uncertainty. \n\nBut I think I've exhausted the possibilities. \n\nGiven that all calculations point to the correct answer being C, I'll go with that. \n\nWait but the options given include D (1e-8). \n\nWait, 1e-8 eV is 1e-8, which is smaller than the required 3.6e-7 eV. So it's not enough. \n\nSo C is the only option. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle states that \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0394E is the energy uncertainty and \u0394t is the lifetime. For the first state (\u0394t\u2081 = 10\u207b\u2079 s), the energy uncertainty is \u0394E\u2081 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t\u2081) \u2248 (1.05\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s)/(2\u00d710\u207b\u2079 s) \u2248 5.25\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2076 J, which converts to ~3.28\u00d710\u207b\u2077 eV. For the second state (\u0394t\u2082 = 10\u207b\u2078 s), \u0394E\u2082 \u2248 3.28\u00d710\u207b\u2078 eV. To resolve the energy levels, their difference must exceed the sum of these uncertainties (~3.6\u00d710\u207b\u2077 eV). Among the options, only **10\u207b\u2074 eV (C)** is sufficiently large to satisfy this condition.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about distinguishing two quantum states based on their energy difference and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle here. The uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t), right? The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use the approximate form \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t?\n\nWait, the key idea here is that if the energy difference between the two states is smaller than the uncertainty in energy due to their finite lifetime, then you can't distinguish them. So to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So the minimum resolvable energy difference would be on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nBut the problem gives two different lifetimes. Wait, each state has its own lifetime. Hmm. Wait, the question says \"their lifetime of 1e-9 and 1e-8 sec respectively.\" So maybe the uncertainty in energy for each state is related to their own lifetime? Or perhaps the combined uncertainty?\n\nWait, I think the energy uncertainty of each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t), but maybe they just use \u0394E \u2248 hbar/(\u0394t) for an approximate value. But since the problem is multiple choice, maybe we can approximate using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the form \u0394E * \u0394t ~ h-bar. Let me recall the exact formula. The uncertainty principle states that \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So to get a rough estimate, the minimum energy uncertainty would be \u0127/(2\u0394t). But for the purposes here, perhaps we can just take \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nNow, the question is to distinguish the two energy levels. The energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then the two states can't be resolved.\n\nSo let's think. Each state has its own lifetime. The energy uncertainty of each would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1), and similarly \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t2). But the energy difference between them, \u0394E_total = |E1 - E2| must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because the energy difference is E1 - E2, so the uncertainty in that difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), but maybe just adding them for an upper bound?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each of the states. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. Since the uncertainty in each state's energy is inversely proportional to their lifetime, the uncertainty for each is hbar over their lifetime. So the minimum resolvable energy difference would be the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty of either. Let's see. Let me think numerically. Let's compute the uncertainties for each state first.\n\nGiven the lifetimes:\n\nState 1 has \u0394t1 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\nState 2 has \u0394t2 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\nThe uncertainty in energy for each would be:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t1, and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t2.\n\nWait, but since the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each. Wait, but perhaps the total uncertainty in the energy difference?\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Not sure. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then the two states would be smeared out such that their energies overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo let's compute the uncertainties.\n\nFirst, let's note that \u0127 is approximately 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the answer is in eV, maybe we can use a conversion factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard value used in such problems. For example, sometimes the approximate value of \u0127/(e) is around 4.135667696\u00d710^-15 eV\u00b7s. Wait, let me think. The conversion between Joules and eV is 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So \u0127 is 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s, so in eV\u00b7s, that's (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nAlternatively, the value of \u0127/(2\u03c0) is about 1.05e-34 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 1.67e-35 J\u00b7s, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me see. Let me look up the value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can recall that the energy-time uncertainty principle \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127. So to get the uncertainty in energy for each state:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nSo using \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert that into eV\u00b7s, divide by 1.6e-19 (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J). So 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo for state 1 with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s \u2248 6.56e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for state 2 with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s:\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 6.56e-16 / 1e-8 \u2248 6.56e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties in energy for the two states are approximately 6.56e-7 eV and 6.56e-8 eV respectively.\n\nNow, to distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or just larger than the larger of the two uncertainties?\n\nWait, the energy difference must be bigger than the uncertainty in each individual state. Otherwise, the energy levels would be too smeared out to see a separation. Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the largest uncertainty between the two?\n\nBecause if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in one of the states, then even if the other is smaller, you can't resolve them. For example, if one state has a large uncertainty, then the energy difference would be lost in that spread.\n\nAlternatively, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), but that's if the uncertainties are independent. But maybe the question is simpler and just wants the energy difference to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.\n\nIn this case, the larger uncertainty is 6.56e-7 eV (from the first state with shorter lifetime). So the energy difference must be greater than that. Let's see the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 6.56e-7 \u2192 no good.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 that's 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 6.56e-7 (which is ~0.000000656). So that would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.56e-7 (0.000000656). Wait, no, 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000656. So that's also too small.\n\nWait, so the only option that is larger than the largest uncertainty (6.56e-7 eV) is option C: 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much bigger than 6.56e-7 (~0.000000656).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me recalculate the numbers again to be sure.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 again.\n\nGiven \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s, \u0394t2 =1e-8 s.\n\nUsing the formula \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Let's use the exact value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert to eV\u00b7s, divide by the electron charge in J/C (but actually, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV. Therefore, 1 J\u00b7s = 1/(1.602e-19) eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, so \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 /1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV \u2248 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8 eV. The largest is the first one, 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be larger than this value (6.58e-7 eV) to be resolved. Looking at the options:\n\nA: 1e-9 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB: 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 100 times larger than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is ~0.000000658, so 1e-4 is bigger).\n\nD: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.58e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistakes here. For example, maybe the question is considering the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties?\n\nIf the energy difference is E1 - E2, then the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt( (6.58e-7)^2 + (6.58e-8)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt( (4.33e-13) + (4.33e-15) ) \u2248 sqrt(4.37e-13) \u2248 ~6.6e-7 eV, which is roughly the same as the largest uncertainty. So the total uncertainty is still on the order of the largest uncertainty. So even if you take that approach, the required energy difference must be larger than ~6.6e-7 eV. So again, only option C is larger than that.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is C) 10^-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 10^-9 eV\n\nB) 10^-11 eV\n\nC) 10^-4 eV\n\nD) 10^-8 eV\n\nYes, so option C is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 6.5e-7. So that's correct. The other options are all smaller than the required minimum.\n\nWait, but another thought: the problem says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". So perhaps the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty of each individual state. But the first state has a larger uncertainty (since it has a shorter lifetime). So the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties (since if it's smaller than that, even the first state's energy is uncertain enough to overlap with the other). So yes, the energy difference must be bigger than the larger uncertainty (6.5e-7 eV). So option C is the only one that's larger. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Suppose the energy difference is exactly equal to the uncertainty, can you resolve it? Probably not. So you need to be significantly larger. The options are given, so perhaps the question expects using the uncertainty principle as \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the smaller lifetime? Wait, but why the smaller? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the lifetime of the state as the time over which the energy is measured. The lifetime is related to the energy uncertainty. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty. So the first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so higher uncertainty. The second has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s) so lower uncertainty. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be dominated by the first state's uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Let's see: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approx 7.2e-7 eV. So then the required energy difference would be ~7e-7 eV. The closest option is C (1e-4 is 1e-4 which is much bigger than that). Wait, but the options don't have that. The next option is D, 1e-8 eV is way smaller. So even if you add them, the required would still be 7e-7, which is 7e-7 is 0.0000007 eV. So the options given don't have that. The options are:\n\nA: 0.000000001 eV (1e-9)\n\nB: 1e-11 (way smaller)\n\nC: 0.0001 eV (1e-4)\n\nD: 0.00000001 eV (1e-8)\n\nSo the only one that is bigger than 7e-7 is C. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, which is 1e-4, which is larger than 7e-7 (0.0000007). So yes, so the correct answer is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nHmm, that's what I thought earlier. I think that's right.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about distinguishing two quantum states based on their energy difference and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle here. The uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t), right? The formula is \u0394E * \u0394t \u2248 \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. But maybe for this problem, they just use the approximate form \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t?\n\nWait, the key idea here is that if the energy difference between the two states is smaller than the uncertainty in energy due to their finite lifetime, then you can't distinguish them. So to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So the minimum resolvable energy difference would be on the order of \u0127 divided by the lifetime.\n\nBut the problem gives two different lifetimes. Wait, each state has its own lifetime. Hmm. Wait, the question says \"their lifetime of 1e-9 and 1e-8 sec respectively.\" So maybe the uncertainty in energy for each state is related to their own lifetime? Or perhaps the combined uncertainty?\n\nWait, I think the energy uncertainty of each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t), but maybe they just use \u0394E \u2248 hbar/(\u0394t) for an approximate value. But since the problem is multiple choice, maybe we can approximate using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the form \u0394E * \u0394t ~ h-bar. Let me recall the exact formula. The uncertainty principle states that \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. So to get a rough estimate, the minimum energy uncertainty would be \u0127/(2\u0394t). But for the purposes here, perhaps we can just take \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nNow, the question is to distinguish the two energy levels. The energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then the two states can't be resolved.\n\nSo let's think. Each state has its own lifetime. The energy uncertainty of each would be \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t1), and similarly \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127/(2\u0394t2). But the energy difference between them, \u0394E_total = |E1 - E2| must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because the energy difference is E1 - E2, so the uncertainty in that difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), but maybe just adding them for an upper bound?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each of the states. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. Since the uncertainty in each state's energy is inversely proportional to their lifetime, the uncertainty for each is hbar over their lifetime. So the minimum resolvable energy difference would be the maximum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty of either. Let's see. Let me think numerically. Let's compute the uncertainties for each state first.\n\nGiven the lifetimes:\n\nState 1 has \u0394t1 = 1e-9 seconds.\n\nState 2 has \u0394t2 = 1e-8 seconds.\n\nThe uncertainty in energy for each would be:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t1, and \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t2.\n\nWait, but since the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each. Wait, but perhaps the total uncertainty in the energy difference?\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Not sure. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then the two states would be smeared out such that their energies overlap, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSo let's compute the uncertainties.\n\nFirst, let's note that \u0127 is approximately 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. But since the answer is in eV, maybe we can use a conversion factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard value used in such problems. For example, sometimes the approximate value of \u0127/(e) is around 4.135667696\u00d710^-15 eV\u00b7s. Wait, let me think. The conversion between Joules and eV is 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So \u0127 is 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s, so in eV\u00b7s, that's (1.05e-34 J\u00b7s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nAlternatively, the value of \u0127/(2\u03c0) is about 1.05e-34 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 1.67e-35 J\u00b7s, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me see. Let me look up the value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, perhaps I can recall that the energy-time uncertainty principle \u0394E \u0394t \u2248 \u0127. So to get the uncertainty in energy for each state:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / \u0394t.\n\nSo using \u0127 \u2248 1.05e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert that into eV\u00b7s, divide by 1.6e-19 (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J). So 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-19 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo for state 1 with \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 6.56e-16 eV\u00b7s / 1e-9 s \u2248 6.56e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for state 2 with \u0394t2 = 1e-8 s:\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 6.56e-16 / 1e-8 \u2248 6.56e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties in energy for the two states are approximately 6.56e-7 eV and 6.56e-8 eV respectively.\n\nNow, to distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or just larger than the larger of the two uncertainties?\n\nWait, the energy difference must be bigger than the uncertainty in each individual state. Otherwise, the energy levels would be too smeared out to see a separation. Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the largest uncertainty between the two?\n\nBecause if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in one of the states, then even if the other is smaller, you can't resolve them. For example, if one state has a large uncertainty, then the energy difference would be lost in that spread.\n\nAlternatively, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ), but that's if the uncertainties are independent. But maybe the question is simpler and just wants the energy difference to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.\n\nIn this case, the larger uncertainty is 6.56e-7 eV (from the first state with shorter lifetime). So the energy difference must be greater than that. Let's see the options:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 1e-9 eV \u2192 1e-9 is smaller than 6.56e-7 \u2192 no good.\n\nB) 1e-11 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nC) 1e-4 eV \u2192 that's 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 6.56e-7 (which is ~0.000000656). So that would work.\n\nD) 1e-8 eV \u2192 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.56e-7 (0.000000656). Wait, no, 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 0.000000656. So that's also too small.\n\nWait, so the only option that is larger than the largest uncertainty (6.56e-7 eV) is option C: 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much bigger than 6.56e-7 (~0.000000656).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me recalculate the numbers again to be sure.\n\nFirst, let me compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 again.\n\nGiven \u0394t1 = 1e-9 s, \u0394t2 =1e-8 s.\n\nUsing the formula \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/(\u0394t). Let's use the exact value of \u0127 in eV\u00b7s.\n\nThe value of \u0127 is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s. To convert to eV\u00b7s, divide by the electron charge in J/C (but actually, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV. Therefore, 1 J\u00b7s = 1/(1.602e-19) eV\u00b7s.\n\nWait, so \u0127 in eV\u00b7s is:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J\u00b7s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = \u0127/(\u0394t1) = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV \u2248 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 /1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV \u2248 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo the uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8 eV. The largest is the first one, 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference between the two states must be larger than this value (6.58e-7 eV) to be resolved. Looking at the options:\n\nA: 1e-9 eV \u2192 way too small.\n\nB: 1e-11 \u2192 even smaller.\n\nC: 1e-4 eV \u2192 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 100 times larger than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is ~0.000000658, so 1e-4 is bigger).\n\nD: 1e-8 eV \u2192 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.58e-7.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistakes here. For example, maybe the question is considering the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties?\n\nIf the energy difference is E1 - E2, then the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2 ). Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt( (6.58e-7)^2 + (6.58e-8)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt( (4.33e-13) + (4.33e-15) ) \u2248 sqrt(4.37e-13) \u2248 ~6.6e-7 eV, which is roughly the same as the largest uncertainty. So the total uncertainty is still on the order of the largest uncertainty. So even if you take that approach, the required energy difference must be larger than ~6.6e-7 eV. So again, only option C is larger than that.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is C) 10^-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 10^-9 eV\n\nB) 10^-11 eV\n\nC) 10^-4 eV\n\nD) 10^-8 eV\n\nYes, so option C is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 6.5e-7. So that's correct. The other options are all smaller than the required minimum.\n\nWait, but another thought: the problem says \"their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved\". So perhaps the energy difference has to be larger than the uncertainty of each individual state. But the first state has a larger uncertainty (since it has a shorter lifetime). So the energy difference must be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties (since if it's smaller than that, even the first state's energy is uncertain enough to overlap with the other). So yes, the energy difference must be bigger than the larger uncertainty (6.5e-7 eV). So option C is the only one that's larger. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Suppose the energy difference is exactly equal to the uncertainty, can you resolve it? Probably not. So you need to be significantly larger. The options are given, so perhaps the question expects using the uncertainty principle as \u0394E \u2265 \u0127/(\u0394t), where \u0394t is the smaller lifetime? Wait, but why the smaller? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the lifetime of the state as the time over which the energy is measured. The lifetime is related to the energy uncertainty. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the energy uncertainty. So the first state has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) so higher uncertainty. The second has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s) so lower uncertainty. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be dominated by the first state's uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Let's see: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approx 7.2e-7 eV. So then the required energy difference would be ~7e-7 eV. The closest option is C (1e-4 is 1e-4 which is much bigger than that). Wait, but the options don't have that. The next option is D, 1e-8 eV is way smaller. So even if you add them, the required would still be 7e-7, which is 7e-7 is 0.0000007 eV. So the options given don't have that. The options are:\n\nA: 0.000000001 eV (1e-9)\n\nB: 1e-11 (way smaller)\n\nC: 0.0001 eV (1e-4)\n\nD: 0.00000001 eV (1e-8)\n\nSo the only one that is bigger than 7e-7 is C. Because 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, which is 1e-4, which is larger than 7e-7 (0.0000007). So yes, so the correct answer is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nHmm, that's what I thought earlier.
