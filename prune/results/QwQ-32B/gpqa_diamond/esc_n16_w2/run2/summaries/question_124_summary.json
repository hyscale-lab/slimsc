      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning they're moving at speeds very close to the speed of light. Their Lorentz factor is given as about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls before decaying. The question is asking what Lorentz factor would be needed so that two thirds of the particles reach the walls instead. The options are A to D.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetimes are extended due to time dilation. The key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the lifetime of the particles as observed in the lab frame. Because if the particles decay quickly, only those that live longer will reach the detector walls.\n\nThe particles are created at the center of the sphere, so they have to travel 30 meters to hit the walls. The distance they need to cover is fixed. The time they take to reach the walls depends on their speed. But their lifetime is also a factor. If their lifetime in the lab frame is longer, then more of them will survive the trip.\n\nWait, the problem states that they are ultra-relativistic, so their speed is nearly c. The Lorentz factor gamma is given as ~20. The decay process must be such that the particles' proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is fixed. The lab frame observes a longer lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.\n\nSo, the idea is that the average distance a particle travels before decaying (in the lab frame) is the speed multiplied by the lifetime in that frame. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n- c as the speed of light.\n- gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n- t_0 is the proper lifetime (rest frame lifetime) of the particle.\n- Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is t = gamma * t_0.\n\nThe distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame would be d = v * t, where v is the particle's speed. Since the particle is ultra-relativistic, v \u2248 c, so we can approximate v \u2248 c. Therefore, d \u2248 c * gamma * t_0.\n\nThe detector has a radius of 30 meters, so the particles need to travel 30 meters to reach the walls. The fraction of particles that reach the detector would depend on whether their decay distance d is greater than 30 meters. Wait, but how exactly is the fraction determined here?\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is assuming that the decay happens after a random time, so the probability that the particle travels a distance less than 30 meters before decaying is proportional to the fraction that actually reach the walls. Wait, actually, particles decay exponentially, right? The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle survives for a time t is exp(-t / t_lab), where t_lab is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. But maybe here they are simplifying it as a fixed fraction based on the ratio of the distance to the decay length?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using an approximation where the average distance traveled before decay is d = c * gamma * t_0, and the fraction that reach the detector is the ratio of the detector radius to this distance? Wait, but if the detector is 30 meters, then the fraction that reach would be (30 meters) / d. So, the fraction is (30) / (c * gamma * t_0). But the problem says that when gamma is ~20, the fraction is 1/3. So, 1/3 = 30/(c * 20 * t_0). Then, when we want the fraction to be 2/3, we set 2/3 = 30/(c * gamma_new * t_0). Then solving for gamma_new would give the answer.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me see. Let's check this approach.\n\nAssuming that the average distance they can travel before decaying is d_avg = c * gamma * t_0, so the average distance is proportional to gamma. Since the problem states that when gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3. The fraction here is the ratio of the detector radius (distance needed) to the average distance they can travel before decaying. So 30/(d_avg) = 1/3 when gamma=20. So 30/(c * 20 * t0) = 1/3 \u2192 c * 20 * t0 = 90. \n\nIf we want the fraction to be 2/3, then 30/(c * gamma_new * t0) = 2/3 \u2192 cross multiplying, 30*3 = 2*c*gamma_new*t0 \u2192 90 = 2*c*gamma_new*t0. But from the first equation, c *20*t0 = 90, so substituting that into the second equation's RHS: 2*(c*gamma_new*t0) = 2*( (gamma_new/20) * (c*20*t0) ) \u2192 Wait maybe I need to substitute differently. Let me see.\n\nWait, from first equation, c *20*t0 = 90. So c * t0 = 90/(20) = 4.5.\n\nSo in the second equation, 90 = 2*c*gamma_new*t0 \u2192 90 = 2*(c t0)*gamma_new \u2192 substituting c t0 as 4.5 gives 90 = 2*(4.5)*gamma_new \u2192 90 = 9 * gamma_new \u2192 gamma_new = 10? Wait that can't be right because the options don't have 10. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. \n\nOriginal case: gamma1 = 20, fraction f1 = 1/3.\n\nAssuming the fraction f = (distance needed)/(average distance traveled before decay) \u2192 f = R/(c * gamma * t0). \n\nSo 1/3 = 30/(c * 20 * t0). \n\nWe need to find gamma2 such that 2/3 = 30/(c * gamma2 * t0).\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n(2/3)/(1/3) = (30/(c gamma2 t0 )) / (30/(c gamma1 t0 )) \n\nSimplifies to 2 = (gamma1)/(gamma2). Wait, that can't be. Wait let me see:\n\nWait cross multiplying the equations:\n\nFirst equation: 30/(c*20*t0) = 1/3 \u2192 c*20*t0 = 90.\n\nSecond equation: 30/(c*gamma2*t0) = 2/3 \u2192 30/(c*gamma2*t0) = 2/3 \u2192 cross multiplying gives 30*3 = 2 * c gamma2 t0 \u2192 90 = 2 c gamma2 t0 \u2192 \n\nFrom first equation, c gamma1 t0 = (c*20*t0) = 90/ (since c*20*t0 = 90). Wait, actually first equation gives c*20*t0 = 90. \n\nSo substituting into the second equation's RHS: 2 * c gamma2 t0 = 2 gamma2 (c t0 *20/20) \u2192 Not sure. Wait, since c*20*t0 =90, then c*t0 = 90/(20) =4.5.\n\nSo in the second equation: 90 = 2 * c gamma2 t0 \u2192 90 = 2 * gamma2 * (c t0) \u2192 90 = 2 * gamma2 *4.5 \u2192 90 = 9 * gamma2 \u2192 gamma2 = 10. But 10 isn't an option. Hmm, that suggests my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I have the relationship inverted. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is not directly proportional to R/(distance). Maybe the number of particles that reach the detector is proportional to the probability that their decay occurs after they've traveled at least 30 meters. \n\nSince the decay is an exponential process, the probability that a particle survives for a time t is exp(-t / t_lab). The time taken to reach the detector is t_needed = distance / speed = 30 meters / v. Since v \u2248 c, t_needed \u2248 30/(c).\n\nThe survival probability is exp( - (t_needed)/t_lab ). The fraction of particles that reach the detector would be exp( - (30/c) / (gamma t0) ). Because t_lab = gamma t0. \n\nWait, that might make more sense. Let me write this down:\n\nThe proper lifetime is t0. The lab frame lifetime is gamma t0. The time to reach detector is t_needed = R/c (since v\u2248c). \n\nThe survival probability is exp(- t_needed / t_lab) = exp( - (R/c) / (gamma t0) )\n\nThe problem states that when gamma is ~20, the survival fraction is 1/3. So:\n\nexp( - (30/(c)) / (20 t0) ) = 1/3.\n\nWe need to find gamma_new such that exp( - (30/c)/(gamma_new t0) ) = 2/3.\n\nLet me denote x = (30/c)/(t0). Then the equations become:\n\nFor gamma1=20: exp( -x/(20) ) = 1/3 \u2192 -x/(20) = ln(1/3) \u2192 x/(20) = ln(3) \u2192 x = 20 ln3.\n\nThen for gamma2, we have exp( -x/(gamma2) ) = 2/3 \u2192 -x/gamma2 = ln(2/3) \u2192 x/gamma2 = ln(3/2).\n\nSubstituting x from above:\n\n20 ln3 / gamma2 = ln(3/2) \u2192 gamma2 = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2).\n\nCalculating this:\n\nln3 \u2248 1.0986, but wait, wait, actually ln(3) is about 1.0986? Wait no, wait. Let me recall that ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3) is about 1.0986? Wait no, wait 1.0986 is ln(3), yes. Wait, ln(3) \u22481.0986? Let me check:\n\nWait, actually ln(3) is approximately 1.0986? Hmm, no, actually no. Wait, e^1 is about 2.718, so ln(3) is a bit more than 1. Let me compute more accurately. Let me think:\n\ne^1.1 \u2248 e^1 * e^0.1 \u2248 2.718 * 1.105 \u2248 3.004. Oh, so ln(3) is approximately 1.0986. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo ln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)= ln1.5 \u22480.4055.\n\nSo gamma2 = 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055) \u2248 20 * (2.7095) \u224854.19. \n\nAh, so approximately 54. So the answer would be A)54. \n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me check again.\n\nWait the steps again. The survival probability is exp(- (distance / c) / (gamma t0) ). \n\nWait, the time needed to reach the detector is t_needed = R/c. The mean lifetime in lab frame is gamma t0. So the ratio t_needed / (gamma t0) is (R/(c)) / (gamma t0). The exponential of the negative of that gives the survival probability. \n\nSo when gamma is 20, the survival fraction is 1/3. So:\n\nexp( - (R/(c gamma t0)) ) = 1/3. \n\nWait, no, actually, the exponent is - (t_needed)/(mean lifetime). The mean lifetime is gamma t0. So the exponent is - (R/c)/(gamma t0) = - R/(c gamma t0). \n\nSo:\n\nexp( - R/(c gamma t0) ) = 1/3 when gamma=20.\n\nWe can write that as exp( - 30/(c * 20 * t0) ) = 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, for the desired gamma_new, exp( - 30/(c gamma_new t0) ) = 2/3.\n\nTaking the natural log of both sides for both equations:\n\nFirst equation: \n\n-30/(c *20 t0) = ln(1/3) \u2192 30/(c*20 t0) = ln3 \n\nSecond equation:\n\n-30/(c gamma_new t0) = ln(2/3) \u2192 30/(c gamma_new t0) = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo from first equation, 30/(c*20 t0) = ln3 \u2192 30/(c t0) = 20 ln3 \u2192 \n\nSubstitute into the second equation's left side:\n\n30/(c gamma_new t0) = (30/(c t0 )) / gamma_new = (20 ln3)/gamma_new = ln(3/2). \n\nThus:\n\n20 ln3 / gamma_new = ln(3/2)\n\nSolving for gamma_new:\n\ngamma_new = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2) \n\nCalculating that:\n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)=ln1.5\u22480.4055.\n\nSo 20 *1.0986 /0.4055 \u2248 (21.972)/0.4055 \u224854.17. Which is approximately 54. So the answer is A)54.\n\nSo the correct option is A. That makes sense. The other options: 68 is higher, but maybe if I messed up a step, but according to this calculation, 54 is right. Let me check if I made any mistake in the setup.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote that the average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma t0. The average distance traveled before decay would be v * gamma t0. Since v \u2248c, then average distance is c gamma t0. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector would be the fraction of those whose decay occurs after traveling at least 30 meters. For an exponential decay, the average distance is c gamma t0, and the probability that a particle travels more than 30 meters is exp(-30/(c gamma t0)). Wait, that's the same as before. So the setup was correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)54.\n",

So the ratio t_needed / (gamma t0) is (R/(c)) / (gamma t0). The exponential of the negative of that gives the survival probability. \n\nSo when gamma is 20, the survival fraction is 1/3. So:\n\nexp( - (R/(c gamma t0)) ) = 1/3. \n\nWait, no, actually, the exponent is - (t_needed)/(mean lifetime). The mean lifetime is gamma t0. So the exponent is - (R/c)/(gamma t0) = - R/(c gamma t0). \n\nSo:\n\nexp( - R/(c gamma t0) ) = 1/3 when gamma=20.\n\nWe can write that as exp( - 30/(c * 20 * t0) ) = 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, for the desired gamma_new, exp( - 30/(c gamma_new t0) ) = 2/3.\n\nTaking the natural log of both sides for both equations:\n\nFirst equation: \n\n-30/(c *20 t0) = ln(1/3) \u2192 30/(c*20 t0) = ln3 \n\nSecond equation:\n\n-30/(c gamma_new t0) = ln(2/3) \u2192 30/(c gamma_new t0) = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)\n\nSo from first equation, 30/(c*20 t0) = ln3 \u2192 30/(c t0) = 20 ln3 \u2192 \n\nSubstitute into the second equation's left side:\n\n30/(c gamma_new t0) = (30/(c t0 )) / gamma_new = (20 ln3)/gamma_new = ln(3/2). \n\nThus:\n\n20 ln3 / gamma_new = ln(3/2)\n\nSolving for gamma_new:\n\ngamma_new = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2) \n\nCalculating that:\n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)=ln1.5\u22480.4055.\n\nSo 20 *1.0986 /0.4055 \u2248 (21.972)/0.4055 \u224854.17. Which is approximately 54. So the answer is A)54.\n\nSo the correct option is A. That makes sense. The other options: 68 is higher, but maybe if I messed up a step, but according to this calculation, 54 is right. Let me check if I made any mistake in the setup.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote that the average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma t0. The average distance traveled before decay would be v * gamma t0. Since v \u2248c, then average distance is c gamma t0. \n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector would be the fraction of those whose decay occurs after traveling at least 30 meters. For an exponential decay, the average distance is c gamma t0, and the probability that a particle travels more than 30 meters is exp(-30/(c gamma t0)). Wait, that's the same as before. So the setup was correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)54.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the required Lorentz factor (\u03b3) to increase the fraction of particles reaching the detector's inner walls from 1/3 to 2/3. The key relationship is between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. \n\nThe survival probability \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R/c}{\\gamma t_0}\\right) \\), where \\( R = 30 \\) meters is the detector radius, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, and \\( t_0 \\) is the proper lifetime. \n\nFor the initial condition (\\( \\gamma = 20 \\)) and \\( P = 1/3 \\):\n\\[\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{30/(c)}{20 t_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies \\frac{30}{c \\cdot 20 t_0} = \\ln 3\n\\]\n\nFor the desired condition (\\( P = 2/3 \\)):\n\\[\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{30/(c)}{\\gamma_{\\text{new}} t_0}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies \\frac{30}{c \\cdot \\gamma_{\\text{new}} t_0} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\gamma_{\\text{new}} \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{20 \\ln 3}{\\ln(3/2)} \\approx \\frac{20 \\cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 54.17\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **A) 54**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles are ultra-relativistic with a Lorentz factor of about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor would be needed to have about two thirds of the particles reach the walls. The options are A) 54, B)68, C)40, D)28.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that for relativistic particles, their lifetime is dilated due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the particles live longer from the detector's frame of reference, which allows them to travel further before decaying. \n\nThe key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance the particles can travel. Since the problem states that with gamma ~20, only a third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma that would make two-thirds reach, so that's double the fraction. Wait, actually, maybe the fraction is related to the lifetime? Let me think.\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. The distance the particle can travel before decaying is then v * gamma * tau_0. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately c. So the distance would be c * gamma * tau_0. \n\nThe detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is 30 meters. Wait, but the particles are created at the center, so they have to reach the surface, which is 30 meters away. So the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. \n\nThe probability of reaching the detector probably depends on whether their lifetime (in the lab frame) allows them to reach the detector. If their lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the edge, they would reach it. But maybe it's more probabilistic? Or perhaps the decay is exponential? Hmm, decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays after time t is exp(-t/tau). So the probability that it survives long enough to reach the detector is exp(-distance/(v * tau_0 * gamma))? Wait, let me get this straight. \n\nThe proper lifetime is tau_0. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau_0. The time taken to reach the detector is distance divided by speed. Since the particles are moving at nearly c, we can approximate v = c. So the time taken to go 30 meters is t = 30 / c. The particle must survive at least that time. The survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma * tau_0)). \n\nSo the survival probability P is exp(- (30 / c) / (gamma * tau_0)). \n\nWait, but the problem says that with gamma =20, the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(- (30/(c))/(20 * tau_0) ). \n\nWe need to find gamma such that P becomes 2/3. \n\nLet me write equations. Let me denote the survival probability as P = exp(-d/(v gamma tau_0)), where d is the distance (30m). Wait, but v is c. So substituting v = c:\n\nP = exp(-d/(c * gamma * tau_0)) \n\nWait, but maybe I have to think of the time. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_0. The time to reach the detector is t = d / v = 30 / c. So the ratio is t/(gamma tau_0). The survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0))? Wait, no. The decay probability is exp(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime. So yes, here the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, so the survival probability after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)). \n\nTherefore, P = exp( - (d / v) / (gamma tau_0) ). Since v is c, that's exp( -d/(c gamma tau_0) )\n\nSo given that when gamma =20, P =1/3. \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(c * 20 * tau_0) )\n\nWe need to find gamma such that 2/3 = exp( -30/(c * gamma * tau_0) )\n\nLet me take the natural logarithm of both sides for both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c *20 * tau_0 )\n\nSecond equation:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * gamma * tau_0 )\n\nLet me denote the denominator terms. Let me call the term 30/(c * tau_0) as a constant, let's say K. Then:\n\nFirst equation: ln(1/3) = - K/(20)\n\nSecond equation: ln(2/3) = - K/(gamma)\n\nSo from the first equation, K = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln3 ) / gamma\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, let me re-arrange the first equation. \n\nln(1/3) = - (K)/(20) \u2192 K = -20 ln(1/3) \u2192 which is 20 ln3 (since ln(1/3) = -ln3)\n\nSo substituting into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - ( K )/(gamma )\n\nBut K =20 ln3 \u2192 \n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln3)/gamma \u2192 solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = - (20 ln3 ) / ln(2/3)\n\nLet me compute this value numerically. \n\nFirst compute ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nln(3) is approx 1.0986\n\nSo plug in:\n\ngamma = - (20 * 1.0986 ) / ( -0.4055 )\n\nThe negatives cancel, so 20 *1.0986 /0.4055\n\nCompute numerator: 20 *1.0986 = 21.972\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 /0.4055 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 21.972 /0.4055:\n\nWell 0.4055 * 54 = 0.4055*50=20.275, plus 0.4055*4=1.622 \u2192 total 21.897. So that's about 54. So 54 would give approximately that. \n\nWait 21.972 divided by 0.4055 is approximately 54. \n\nSo gamma \u224854. That's option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me do precise steps:\n\nln(3) is approximately 1.098612289\n\nln(2/3)= ln(2)-ln(3)=0.69314718056 -1.098612289 \u2248 -0.4054651085\n\nSo gamma = (20 * 1.098612289) / 0.4054651085\n\nCompute numerator: 20 *1.098612289 = 21.97224578\n\nDivide by 0.4054651085:\n\n21.97224578 /0.4054651085 \u2248 let me compute this division:\n\nLet me see, 0.4054651 *54 = 21.8913 (approx). Because 0.4054651 *50 =20.273255, plus 0.4054651*4=1.62186, total 21.8951. \n\nThe numerator is 21.9722, so subtract 21.8951 from 21.9722 gives about 0.0771. \n\nSo 0.0771 /0.4054651 \u2248 ~0.19. So total gamma is 54 +0.19 \u224854.19. So approximately 54.2. The closest option is A)54. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A?\n\nWait but the options have 54 and 68. Let me check if I did the equations correctly. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equations again. \n\nThe survival probability P is exp(-d/(c gamma tau_0)). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0. The time taken to reach the detector is t =d/c. \n\nThe survival probability is exp(-t/(tau_lab)) = exp( - (d/c) / (gamma tau0) )\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the equation is P = exp( -d/(c gamma tau0) )\n\nSo when gamma is 20, P is 1/3, so:\n\nln(1/3) = -d/(c *20 tau0 )\n\nSo rearranged, d/(c tau0) = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln3 \n\nThen for the new gamma, when P is 2/3,\n\nln(2/3) = -d/(c gamma tau0 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = d/(c gamma tau0 )\n\nBut d/(c tau0) is 20 ln3, so substituting:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln3)/gamma \u2192 gamma = (20 ln3)/ [ -ln(2/3) ]\n\nWait, wait, let me check again. \n\nWait:\n\nln(2/3) = - (d/(c gamma tau0)) \u2192 \n\nthen rearranged:\n\nd/(c gamma tau0) = - ln(2/3)\n\nBut d/(c tau0) is 20 ln3, so substituting:\n\n(20 ln3)/gamma = -ln(2/3)\n\nSo gamma = (20 ln3) / [ - ln(2/3) ]\n\nWait, but ln(2/3) is negative, so the denominator becomes -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2). Because ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2). \n\nThus gamma = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2). \n\nAh, that's a better way to write it. Because ln(3/2) is positive. \n\nSo let me compute that. \n\nln(3) \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)= ln(1.5)\u22480.4055. \n\nSo 20*1.0986 /0.4055 \u224821.972 /0.4055\u224854.19, so yeah, so 54. So that would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 54 (A) and 68 (B). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the distance as 30 meters, but the particles are moving at gamma ~20. So their gamma is 20, so their speed is v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)). Wait, but for ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is large, so v \u2248c. So approximating v as c is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles have to travel the radius, so the time is r/(v). The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0. The probability to reach the detector is exp(-r/(v tau0 gamma))? Wait, no. Wait, the time taken to reach the detector is t = r/v. The proper lifetime is tau0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau0. So the time needed to reach is t. The survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau0))? Wait, no. Let me think of the decay as a Poisson process. The mean lifetime is gamma tau0. The probability that the particle lives longer than time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau0)). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the setup is correct. \n\nHmm, so why is 54 an option? The calculation says about 54. So the answer would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check with exact numbers. Let me compute gamma again. \n\ngamma = (20 * ln3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)) \n\nBecause ln(3/2) = ln3 - ln2. \n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln2\u22480.6931. \n\nSo denominator: 1.0986 -0.6931=0.4055. \n\nSo 20*1.0986=21.972. \n\n21.972 divided by 0.4055 is exactly 21.972 /0.4055. Let me do this division step by step. \n\n0.4055 * 54 = 0.4055 *50 + 0.4055 *4 = 20.275 + 1.622 = 21.897. \n\nThe numerator is 21.972, so subtract 21.897 gives 0.075. \n\nSo 0.075 /0.4055 \u22480.185. \n\nSo total is 54.185, so ~54.2. So 54.2. \n\nThe options are A)54, so that's the closest. \n\nTherefore the correct answer should be A)54. \n\nHmm, but let me check if the question is about the fraction being two-thirds, so maybe I have to invert something?\n\nWait, let's see: when gamma is higher, the lifetime in lab frame is longer, so the survival probability increases. So higher gamma should give higher P. Since the original P was 1/3 at gamma 20, and we want to reach 2/3, which is higher, so gamma must be higher than 20. 54 is higher, so that makes sense. The options given include 54, which is the calculated value. \n\nSo I think the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but why is there an option D)28? Maybe a common mistake would be to square the gamma? Let's see. Suppose someone thought that since the survival probability goes from 1/3 to 2/3, which is doubling the probability, but that's not linear. Alternatively, perhaps they thought that since the distance is fixed, the required gamma is proportional to the inverse of the logarithm? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the mean free path? Like the particles have a mean lifetime, so the mean distance traveled is v*gamma*tau0. \n\nWait, the mean distance before decay would be v * tau_lab = v gamma tau0. \n\nThe detector radius is 30 meters, so to have a higher fraction reach, the mean distance should be longer than 30. \n\nWait, but the question says \"on average, one third of these particles reaches...\" So maybe the fraction that reaches the detector is equal to the ratio of the detector radius to the mean free path? \n\nHmm, that might be a different approach. Let me think. \n\nSuppose that the particles travel a distance before decaying, and the distribution of decay distances is exponential. The probability that a particle travels a distance x is proportional to exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)). The probability that it reaches the detector (distance 30m) would be the integral from 0 to 30 of the probability density, but actually, the survival probability is the integral from 30 to infinity? Wait no. \n\nWait, the survival probability is the chance that the decay happens after time t=30/c. So that's exp(-t/(gamma tau0)), as before. \n\nAlternatively, the mean free path is v gamma tau0. So the mean distance traveled is v gamma tau0. \n\nIf the mean free path is longer, then the average distance traveled is longer, so more particles would reach the detector. \n\nBut the question says that with gamma 20, the average fraction is 1/3. So maybe the fraction is (distance)/(mean free path). Wait, but that would be different. \n\nSuppose that the probability to reach the detector is (distance)/(mean free path). Then, if the mean free path is \u03bc = v gamma tau0. \n\nSo P = 30/(v gamma tau0). \n\nWait, but that would be linear, which might not be the case. The exponential model is different. \n\nWait, let's see. If the probability is P = exp(-d/(\u03bc)), where \u03bc is the mean free path, then yes, that's the exponential survival. \n\nSo if \u03bc = v gamma tau0, then P = exp(-d/(v gamma tau0)). \n\nSo in this case, the same as before. \n\nSo the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought of the problem as P = d/(\u03bc), so linear, then:\n\nOriginal case: 1/3 = 30/(v gamma1 tau0) \u2192 gamma1 = (30 v)/(3 * tau0 )\n\nDesired case: 2/3 = 30/(v gamma2 tau0 ) \u2192 gamma2 = (30 v)/( (2/3) tau0 ) \u2192 so gamma2 = (30/( (2/3) tau0 )) v \u2192 but gamma1 is (30/(3 tau0 )) v \u2192 so gamma2 is (3/(2/3)) gamma1 \u2192 4.5 times gamma1? \n\nWait, 4.5*20 is 90, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model. But given that the options include 54, which matches the exponential calculation, I think the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to gamma? Because the lifetime increases with gamma, so the distance they can travel increases as gamma. So the survival probability would increase with gamma. \n\nSuppose the survival probability is proportional to gamma, but that's not the case. Because the survival probability is exp(-d/(v gamma tau0)), so it's an exponential function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles must travel a certain distance, and the time taken is 30 meters divided by the speed. The time in the lab frame is t = 30/(v). The proper lifetime is tau0. The time in the particle's frame is t' = t / gamma. So the probability to survive is exp(-t'/tau0) = exp(- (30/(v gamma)) / tau0 ). \n\nWait, but that's the same as before. Because in the particle's frame, the lifetime is tau0, so the time experienced by the particle during the trip is t' = t / gamma. So the survival probability is exp(-t' / tau0). \n\nYes, so same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A)54. So I think that's correct.\n",

The time to reach the detector is t = d / v = 30 / c. So the ratio is t/(gamma tau_0). The survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0))? Wait, no. The decay probability is exp(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime. So yes, here the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, so the survival probability after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)). \n\nTherefore, P = exp( - (d / v) / (gamma tau_0) ). Since v is c, that's exp( -d/(c gamma tau_0) )\n\nSo given that when gamma =20, P =1/3. \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30/(c * 20 * tau_0) )\n\nWe need to find gamma such that 2/3 = exp( -30/(c * gamma * tau_0) )\n\nLet me take the natural logarithm of both sides for both equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nln(1/3) = -30/(c *20 * tau_0 )\n\nSecond equation:\n\nln(2/3) = -30/(c * gamma * tau_0 )\n\nLet me denote the denominator terms. Let me call the term 30/(c * tau_0) as a constant, let's say K. Then:\n\nFirst equation: ln(1/3) = - K/(20)\n\nSecond equation: ln(2/3) = - K/(gamma)\n\nSo from the first equation, K = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln(3)\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln3 ) / gamma\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, let me re-arrange the first equation. \n\nln(1/3) = - (K)/(20) \u2192 K = -20 ln(1/3) \u2192 which is 20 ln3 (since ln(1/3) = -ln3)\n\nSo substituting into the second equation:\n\nln(2/3) = - ( K )/(gamma )\n\nBut K =20 ln3 \u2192 \n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln3)/gamma \u2192 solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = - (20 ln3 ) / ln(2/3)\n\nLet me compute this value numerically. \n\nFirst compute ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) \u2248 0.6931 -1.0986 \u2248 -0.4055\n\nln(3) is approx 1.0986\n\nSo plug in:\n\ngamma = - (20 * 1.0986 ) / ( -0.4055 )\n\nThe negatives cancel, so 20 *1.0986 /0.4055\n\nCompute numerator: 20 *1.0986 = 21.972\n\nDivide by 0.4055: 21.972 /0.4055 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 21.972 /0.4055:\n\nWell 0.4055 * 54 = 0.4055*50=20.275, plus 0.4055*4=1.622 \u2192 total 21.897. So that's about 54. So 54 would give approximately that. \n\nWait 21.972 divided by 0.4055 is approximately 54. \n\nSo gamma \u224854. That's option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me do precise steps:\n\nln(3) is approximately 1.098612289\n\nln(2/3)= ln(2)-ln(3)=0.69314718056 -1.098612289 \u2248 -0.4054651085\n\nSo gamma = (20 * 1.098612289) / 0.4054651085\n\nCompute numerator: 20 *1.098612289 = 21.97224578\n\nDivide by 0.4054651085:\n\n21.97224578 /0.4054651085 \u2248 let me compute this division:\n\nLet me see, 0.4054651 *54 = 21.8913 (approx). Because 0.4054651 *50 =20.273255, plus 0.4054651*4=1.62186, total 21.8951. \n\nThe numerator is 21.9722, so subtract 21.8951 from 21.9722 gives about 0.0771. \n\nSo 0.0771 /0.4054651 \u2248 ~0.19. So total gamma is 54 +0.19 \u224854.19. So approximately 54.2. The closest option is A)54. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A?\n\nWait but the options have 54 and 68. Let me check if I did the equations correctly. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equations again. \n\nThe survival probability P is exp(-d/(c gamma tau_0)). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0. The time taken to reach the detector is t =d/c. \n\nThe survival probability is exp(-t/(tau_lab)) = exp( - (d/c) / (gamma tau0) )\n\nYes, so that's correct. So the equation is P = exp( -d/(c gamma tau0) )\n\nSo when gamma is 20, P is 1/3, so:\n\nln(1/3) = -d/(c *20 tau0 )\n\nSo rearranged, d/(c tau0) = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln3 \n\nThen for the new gamma, when P is 2/3,\n\nln(2/3) = -d/(c gamma tau0 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = d/(c gamma tau0 )\n\nBut d/(c tau0) is 20 ln3, so substituting:\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln3)/gamma \u2192 gamma = (20 ln3)/ [ -ln(2/3) ]\n\nWait, wait, let me check again. \n\nWait:\n\nln(2/3) = - (d/(c gamma tau0)) \u2192 \n\nthen rearranged:\n\nd/(c gamma tau0) = - ln(2/3)\n\nBut d/(c tau0) is 20 ln3, so substituting:\n\n(20 ln3)/gamma = -ln(2/3)\n\nSo gamma = (20 ln3) / [ - ln(2/3) ]\n\nWait, but ln(2/3) is negative, so the denominator becomes -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2). Because ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2). \n\nThus gamma = 20 ln3 / ln(3/2). \n\nAh, that's a better way to write it. Because ln(3/2) is positive. \n\nSo let me compute that. \n\nln(3) \u22481.0986, ln(3/2)= ln(1.5)\u22480.4055. \n\nSo 20*1.0986 /0.4055 \u224821.972 /0.4055\u224854.19, so yeah, so 54. So that would be option A. \n\nBut wait, the options include 54 (A) and 68 (B). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the distance as 30 meters, but the particles are moving at gamma ~20. So their gamma is 20, so their speed is v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)). Wait, but for ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is large, so v \u2248c. So approximating v as c is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles have to travel the radius, so the time is r/(v). The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0. The probability to reach the detector is exp(-r/(v tau0 gamma))? Wait, no. Wait, the time taken to reach the detector is t = r/v. The proper lifetime is tau0. The lab lifetime is gamma tau0. So the time needed to reach is t. The survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau0))? Wait, no. Let me think of the decay as a Poisson process. The mean lifetime is gamma tau0. The probability that the particle lives longer than time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau0)). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the setup is correct. \n\nHmm, so why is 54 an option? The calculation says about 54. So the answer would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check with exact numbers. Let me compute gamma again. \n\ngamma = (20 * ln3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)) \n\nBecause ln(3/2) = ln3 - ln2. \n\nln3 \u22481.0986, ln2\u22480.6931. \n\nSo denominator: 1.0986 -0.6931=0.4055. \n\nSo 20*1.0986=21.972. \n\n21.972 divided by 0.4055 is exactly 21.972 /0.4055. Let me do this division step by step. \n\n0.4055 * 54 = 0.4055 *50 + 0.4055 *4 = 20.275 + 1.622 = 21.897. \n\nThe numerator is 21.972, so subtract 21.897 gives 0.075. \n\nSo 0.075 /0.4055 \u22480.185. \n\nSo total is 54.185, so ~54.2. So 54.2. \n\nThe options are A)54, so that's the closest. \n\nTherefore the correct answer should be A)54. \n\nHmm, but let me check if the question is about the fraction being two-thirds, so maybe I have to invert something?\n\nWait, let's see: when gamma is higher, the lifetime in lab frame is longer, so the survival probability increases. So higher gamma should give higher P. Since the original P was 1/3 at gamma 20, and we want to reach 2/3, which is higher, so gamma must be higher than 20. 54 is higher, so that makes sense. The options given include 54, which is the calculated value. \n\nSo I think the answer is A)54. \n\nWait, but why is there an option D)28? Maybe a common mistake would be to square the gamma? Let's see. Suppose someone thought that since the survival probability goes from 1/3 to 2/3, which is doubling the probability, but that's not linear. Alternatively, perhaps they thought that since the distance is fixed, the required gamma is proportional to the inverse of the logarithm? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the mean free path? Like the particles have a mean lifetime, so the mean distance traveled is v*gamma*tau0. \n\nWait, the mean distance before decay would be v * tau_lab = v gamma tau0. \n\nThe detector radius is 30 meters, so to have a higher fraction reach, the mean distance should be longer than 30. \n\nWait, but the question says \"on average, one third of these particles reaches...\" So maybe the fraction that reaches the detector is equal to the ratio of the detector radius to the mean free path? \n\nHmm, that might be a different approach. Let me think. \n\nSuppose that the particles travel a distance before decaying, and the distribution of decay distances is exponential. The probability that a particle travels a distance x is proportional to exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)). The probability that it reaches the detector (distance 30m) would be the integral from 0 to 30 of the probability density, but actually, the survival probability is the integral from 30 to infinity? Wait no. \n\nWait, the survival probability is the chance that the decay happens after time t=30/c. So that's exp(-t/(gamma tau0)), as before. \n\nAlternatively, the mean free path is v gamma tau0. So the mean distance traveled is v gamma tau0. \n\nIf the mean free path is longer, then the average distance traveled is longer, so more particles would reach the detector. \n\nBut the question says that with gamma 20, the average fraction is 1/3. So maybe the fraction is (distance)/(mean free path). Wait, but that would be different. \n\nSuppose that the probability to reach the detector is (distance)/(mean free path). Then, if the mean free path is \u03bc = v gamma tau0. \n\nSo P = 30/(v gamma tau0). \n\nWait, but that would be linear, which might not be the case. The exponential model is different. \n\nWait, let's see. If the probability is P = exp(-d/(\u03bc)), where \u03bc is the mean free path, then yes, that's the exponential survival. \n\nSo if \u03bc = v gamma tau0, then P = exp(-d/(v gamma tau0)). \n\nSo in this case, the same as before. \n\nSo the previous calculation holds. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought of the problem as P = d/(\u03bc), so linear, then:\n\nOriginal case: 1/3 = 30/(v gamma1 tau0) \u2192 gamma1 = (30 v)/(3 * tau0 )\n\nDesired case: 2/3 = 30/(v gamma2 tau0 ) \u2192 gamma2 = (30 v)/( (2/3) tau0 ) \u2192 so gamma2 = (30/( (2/3) tau0 )) v \u2192 but gamma1 is (30/(3 tau0 )) v \u2192 so gamma2 is (3/(2/3)) gamma1 \u2192 4.5 times gamma1? \n\nWait, 4.5*20 is 90, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model. But given that the options include 54, which matches the exponential calculation, I think the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to gamma? Because the lifetime increases with gamma, so the distance they can travel increases as gamma. So the survival probability would increase with gamma. \n\nSuppose the survival probability is proportional to gamma, but that's not the case. Because the survival probability is exp(-d/(v gamma tau0)), so it's an exponential function. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the particles must travel a certain distance, and the time taken is 30 meters divided by the speed. The time in the lab frame is t = 30/(v). The proper lifetime is tau0. The time in the particle's frame is t' = t / gamma. So the probability to survive is exp(-t'/tau0) = exp(- (30/(v gamma)) / tau0 ). \n\nWait, but that's the same as before. Because in the particle's frame, the lifetime is tau0, so the time experienced by the particle during the trip is t' = t / gamma. So the survival probability is exp(-t' / tau0). \n\nYes, so same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A)54. So I think that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor (\u03b3) for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the survival probability of the particles. \n\nThe survival probability \\( P \\) of a particle reaching the detector is given by the exponential decay formula:\n\\[\nP = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\( d = 30 \\, \\text{m} \\) (detector radius), \\( v \\approx c \\) (speed of light), \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, and \\( \\tau_0 \\) is the proper lifetime of the particle. \n\nGiven:\n- At \\( \\gamma = 20 \\), \\( P = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- We need \\( P = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nFirst, solve for the constant term using the initial condition:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30}{c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau_0}\\right)\n\\]\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau_0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{c \\cdot \\tau_0} = 20 \\ln(3)\n\\]\n\nFor the desired probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0}\n\\]\nSubstituting the earlier result:\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\gamma}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{-\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nCalculating numerically:\n\\[\n\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986, \\quad \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.4055\n\\]\n\\[\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{20 \\cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \\approx 54.2\n\\]\n\nThe closest option is **54**, so the answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",
