      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when the star has spots. The key here is understanding how the temperature change affects this ratio. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g are the statistical weights, E the energy levels, k Boltzmann's constant, and T temperature. \n\nThe question states that when there are spots, the effective temperature (Teff) drops from 6000K to 5500K. The ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N2/N1 is lower. That makes sense because lower temperature would mean lower excitation, so fewer atoms in the higher energy level (assuming E2 is higher than E1). \n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So we need to find (N2/N1)_no_spots divided by (N2/N1)_with_spots. \n\nThe transition wavelength given is 1448 \u00c5. Wait, maybe I need to find the energy difference between the two levels using that wavelength? Because the energy of a photon is E = hc/\u03bb. Since the transition corresponds to that wavelength, the energy difference \u0394E = E2 - E1 = hc/\u03bb. \n\nLet me calculate that. Let's plug in the numbers. The wavelength \u03bb is 1448 \u00c5, which is 1448e-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. So \u0394E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = ~1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nConvert that to electron volts because sometimes energy levels are in eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 \u2248 ~8.57 eV. So the energy difference is about 8.57 eV. \n\nNow, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u0394E/(k*T) ). Since we have two different temperatures (6000K and 5500K), the ratio of the ratios (N2/N1) would depend on the exponential terms divided by each other. Let's see:\n\nThe ratio without spots over with spots would be [exp( -\u0394E/(k*T1) ) ] / [exp( -\u0394E/(k*T2) ) ] where T1 is 6000K and T2 is 5500K. Wait, actually, the ratio (N2/N1) when there are no spots is higher than when there are spots. Because higher temperature would mean more atoms in the higher energy level, so the ratio increases. So the question is asking for (ratio_no_spots)/(ratio_with_spots). \n\nSo the factor is exp( (\u0394E/(k))*(1/T2 - 1/T1) )? Wait, let me check again. Let me write the ratio:\n\n(N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots = [exp(-\u0394E/(k*T1)) / exp(-\u0394E/(k*T2))] because the other terms (g2/g1) would cancel out if they are the same in both cases. So this simplifies to exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, let me re-express the ratio:\n\nThe ratio (N2/N1) is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), so the ratio between the two scenarios (no spots vs spots) would be exp( (-\u0394E/(k T1) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Wait, actually, that's exp[ (\u0394E/k)( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]? Wait, no, let me compute the exponent difference:\n\nThe exponent for no spots is -\u0394E/(k T1), and for spots it's -\u0394E/(k T2). So the ratio is exp( [ -\u0394E/(k T1) + \u0394E/(k T2) ] ) = exp( \u0394E/k ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )\n\nHmm, so the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Since T2 is lower (5500K), 1/T2 is higher than 1/T1, so the exponent is positive. Therefore, the ratio (no spots)/(with spots) is exp( positive value ), so it's a factor greater than 1, which makes sense because when there's no spots, the temperature is higher so the ratio is higher, so dividing by the lower ratio (with spots) gives a number greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers. Let's compute that exponent. \n\nFirst, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 where T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K. \n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818 (per K^-1), and 1/6000 \u2248 0.00016667. Subtracting gives 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 \u2248 0.00001513 per K^-1.\n\nSo the exponent is (\u0394E / k) * (0.00001513). \n\nBut we need to compute \u0394E/(k) first. Let's recall that \u0394E is 8.57 eV. Let's convert that to joules because k is in J/K. \n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 8.57 eV is 8.57 * 1.602e-19 \u2248 1.373e-18 J. \n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/k = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K \u2248 1.373 / 1.38 * 1e5 \u2248 approx 1e5 (since 1.373/1.38 is ~0.995). Let's just say approximately 1e5 K? Wait, the units here would be (J)/(J/K) = K. So \u0394E/k is in Kelvin? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the energy E in eV is converted to J, then dividing by k (J/K) gives E/(k) in K. Because E/(k) has units of (J)/( (J/K) ) = K. So \u0394E/(k) is in K. \n\nSo 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99500 K. Approximately 1e5 K? Let's just use the exact calculation:\n\n1.373 divided by 1.38 is roughly 0.995, so 0.995 * 1e5 = 99,500 K. \n\nSo the exponent is (99,500 K) * (0.00001513 K^-1) \n\nLet me compute that. 99500 * 0.00001513. Let's compute 100,000 * 0.00001513 = 1.513. So subtract 500*0.00001513 = 0.007565. So total is approximately 1.513 - 0.007565 \u2248 1.505. \n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.505. \n\nTherefore, the factor is exp(1.505). Let me calculate that. \n\ne^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^1.505 is a bit more. Let me see: e^1.505 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.005. \n\ne^0.005 \u2248 1.00501. So 4.48 * 1.005 \u2248 4.5. \n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5. \n\nLooking at the options, that would be option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again for errors. \n\nFirst, the energy difference. The transition wavelength is 1448 \u00c5. Let me re-calculate \u0394E. \n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m. \n\nE (in joules) is hc/\u03bb. \n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c=3e8 m/s. \n\nSo hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = ~1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. \n\nDivide by \u03bb: 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = \n\nLet me compute 1.9878 / 1.448 \u2248 ~1.372. So 1.372e-18 J. \n\nYes, same as before. \n\nConverting to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.372 / 1.602 \u2248 0.857? Wait wait a second! Wait, wait a second. Wait, I think I messed up here earlier. \n\nWait, wait! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Because 8.57 eV? Wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 1.373e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me compute that again. \n\n1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.373 /1.602) * 10^( -18 +19 ) = (0.857) *10^1 = 8.57 eV. Oh okay, that's correct. So the energy difference is 8.57 eV. So that part was right. \n\nThen, \u0394E/k is 8.57 eV divided by (k in eV/K). Wait, maybe there's a better way to handle the units. Alternatively, perhaps I can use k in eV/K. \n\nBecause Boltzmann's constant is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So maybe that's easier. Let me try that approach. \n\n\u0394E = 8.57 eV. \n\nThen, \u0394E/(k*T) would be (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T). \n\nSo let's recalculate the exponent. \n\nThe exponent in the ratio is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Wait, no, let me see. \n\nWait, the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Wait, but if we use k in eV/K, then the units would be (eV/(eV/K)) * (1/K) * K? Hmm, perhaps it's clearer this way:\n\nThe exponent in the exponential is (\u0394E/(k T)), so when we take the difference between two temperatures, the exponent difference is (\u0394E/(k T1) ) - (\u0394E/(k T2)) = \u0394E/k (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, but in the ratio (N2/N1)_no_spots over (N2/N1)_spots, the exponent part would be exp[ ( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) - ( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] = exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ].\n\nWait, so the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). \n\nLet me compute that using k in eV/K. \n\nk = 8.617e-5 eV/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's calculate that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8.617e-5:\n\n8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 \u2248 (0.994) * 1e5 \u2248 ~99,400 K. \n\nSame as before. So the exponent is (99,400 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) \n\nWait, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000). \n\nWait, but actually, 1/T2 -1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) \u2248 500/(33,000,000) \u2248 1.515e-5 per K^-1. \n\nWait, let me compute it numerically: 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818, 1/6000\u22480.000166667. Subtract gives 0.0000151515. \n\nSo the exponent is 99,400 * 0.0000151515 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute 99,400 * 0.0000151515. \n\nFirst, 100,000 * 0.0000151515 = 1.51515. \n\nSubtract 600 *0.0000151515 = 0.0090909. \n\nSo 1.51515 - 0.00909 \u2248 1.506. \n\nSo the exponent is ~1.506. \n\nThen exp(1.506) \u2248 e^1.5 is about 4.48, and 0.006 more. \n\nThe value of e^0.006 is approximately 1.006. So 4.48 * 1.006 \u2248 ~4.5. \n\nSo the ratio is approximately 4.5. So the answer should be option C, ~4.5. \n\nWait, but let me check if I have the ratio the right way. The question says \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots\". So the ratio (N2/N1) is lower when there are spots. So when comparing (no spots)/(spots), it's higher. So the factor is exp( ~1.506 ), which is ~4.5. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that seems correct. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the energy difference? Let me confirm the wavelength to energy again. \n\nWavelength \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5. So 1448 angstroms is 1448e-10 meters. \n\nThe energy in eV is (hc)/\u03bb, with hc in eV\u00b7nm. Wait, another way: hc is approximately 1240 eV\u00b7nm. \n\nSo 1448 \u00c5 is 0.1448 nm (since 1 nm = 10 \u00c5). \n\nSo E = 1240 / 0.1448 \u2248 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 let's compute that. \n\n1240 divided by 0.1448. Let's see, 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 1240 /0.14 \u2248 ~8857, but precise calculation:\n\n0.1448 * 8500 = 0.1448 *8000 = 1158.4, plus 0.1448*500=72.4 \u2192 total 1230.8. That's close to 1240. So 8500 gives 1230.8, so the difference is 9.2. So 8500 + (9.2 /0.1448) \u2248 8500 + ~63.5 \u2248 8563.5. So approximately 8560 eV? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, that would give 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 8560 eV? That would be 8.56 keV. But earlier calculation gave 8.57 eV. Wait, there's a mistake here. Oh no! Wait, I see the problem. \n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm? Wait no, 1 \u00c5 is 0.1 nm. So 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm. Oh! Oh my goodness, I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, 1 \u00c5 = 1e-10 m = 0.1 nm. So 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm. \n\nSo the previous calculation using hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm. \n\nSo E = 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 let's compute that. \n\n144.8 into 1240: 144.8*8 = 1158.4, so 8 eV? Because 144.8 *8 = 1158.4, so 1240-1158.4=81.6. So 81.6/144.8 \u2248 ~0.563. So total is 8.563 eV. So that's exactly what I had before! So the initial calculation was correct. \n\nSo 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm, so the energy is ~8.57 eV. So that part was right. \n\nTherefore my previous steps are correct. \n\nAnother possible error: Did I mix up the temperatures? The star without spots is hotter (6000 K) so the ratio (N2/N1) is higher. The question asks for the factor of the ratio without spots compared to with spots. So (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k))*(1/T2 -1/T1) ) = exp(1.506) \u22484.5. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be C.\n",

Let's convert that to joules because k is in J/K. \n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 8.57 eV is 8.57 * 1.602e-19 \u2248 1.373e-18 J. \n\nk is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/k = 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K \u2248 1.373 / 1.38 * 1e5 \u2248 approx 1e5 (since 1.373/1.38 is ~0.995). Let's just say approximately 1e5 K? Wait, the units here would be (J)/(J/K) = K. So \u0394E/k is in Kelvin? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the energy E in eV is converted to J, then dividing by k (J/K) gives E/(k) in K. Because E/(k) has units of (J)/( (J/K) ) = K. So \u0394E/(k) is in K. \n\nSo 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5 \u2248 0.995 * 1e5 \u2248 99500 K. Approximately 1e5 K? Let's just use the exact calculation:\n\n1.373 divided by 1.38 is roughly 0.995, so 0.995 * 1e5 = 99,500 K. \n\nSo the exponent is (99,500 K) * (0.00001513 K^-1) \n\nLet me compute that. 99500 * 0.00001513. Let's compute 100,000 * 0.00001513 = 1.513. So subtract 500*0.00001513 = 0.007565. So total is approximately 1.513 - 0.007565 \u2248 1.505. \n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.505. \n\nTherefore, the factor is exp(1.505). Let me calculate that. \n\ne^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^1.505 is a bit more. Let me see: e^1.505 \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.005. \n\ne^0.005 \u2248 1.00501. So 4.48 * 1.005 \u2248 4.5. \n\nSo the factor is approximately 4.5. \n\nLooking at the options, that would be option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again for errors. \n\nFirst, the energy difference. The transition wavelength is 1448 \u00c5. Let me re-calculate \u0394E. \n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m. \n\nE (in joules) is hc/\u03bb. \n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c=3e8 m/s. \n\nSo hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = ~1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. \n\nDivide by \u03bb: 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = \n\nLet me compute 1.9878 / 1.448 \u2248 ~1.372. So 1.372e-18 J. \n\nYes, same as before. \n\nConverting to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.372 / 1.602 \u2248 0.857? Wait wait a second! Wait, wait a second. Wait, I think I messed up here earlier. \n\nWait, wait! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Because 8.57 eV? Wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 1.373e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me compute that again. \n\n1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.373 /1.602) * 10^( -18 +19 ) = (0.857) *10^1 = 8.57 eV. Oh okay, that's correct. So the energy difference is 8.57 eV. So that part was right. \n\nThen, \u0394E/k is 8.57 eV divided by (k in eV/K). Wait, maybe there's a better way to handle the units. Alternatively, perhaps I can use k in eV/K. \n\nBecause Boltzmann's constant is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So maybe that's easier. Let me try that approach. \n\n\u0394E = 8.57 eV. \n\nThen, \u0394E/(k*T) would be (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T). \n\nSo let's recalculate the exponent. \n\nThe exponent in the ratio is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Wait, no, let me see. \n\nWait, the exponent is (\u0394E/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Wait, but if we use k in eV/K, then the units would be (eV/(eV/K)) * (1/K) * K? Hmm, perhaps it's clearer this way:\n\nThe exponent in the exponential is (\u0394E/(k T)), so when we take the difference between two temperatures, the exponent difference is (\u0394E/(k T1) ) - (\u0394E/(k T2)) = \u0394E/k (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, but in the ratio (N2/N1)_no_spots over (N2/N1)_spots, the exponent part would be exp[ ( -\u0394E/(k T1) ) - ( -\u0394E/(k T2) ) ] = exp[ \u0394E/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ].\n\nWait, so the exponent is (\u0394E/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). \n\nLet me compute that using k in eV/K. \n\nk = 8.617e-5 eV/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's calculate that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8.617e-5:\n\n8.57 / (8.617e-5) \u2248 (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 \u2248 (0.994) * 1e5 \u2248 ~99,400 K. \n\nSame as before. So the exponent is (99,400 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) \n\nWait, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000). \n\nWait, but actually, 1/T2 -1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(3.3e7) \u2248 500/(33,000,000) \u2248 1.515e-5 per K^-1. \n\nWait, let me compute it numerically: 1/5500 \u2248 0.000181818, 1/6000\u22480.000166667. Subtract gives 0.0000151515. \n\nSo the exponent is 99,400 * 0.0000151515 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute 99,400 * 0.0000151515. \n\nFirst, 100,000 * 0.0000151515 = 1.51515. \n\nSubtract 600 *0.0000151515 = 0.0090909. \n\nSo 1.51515 - 0.00909 \u2248 1.506. \n\nSo the exponent is ~1.506. \n\nThen exp(1.506) \u2248 e^1.5 is about 4.48, and 0.006 more. \n\nThe value of e^0.006 is approximately 1.006. So 4.48 * 1.006 \u2248 ~4.5. \n\nSo the ratio is approximately 4.5. So the answer should be option C, ~4.5. \n\nWait, but let me check if I have the ratio the right way. The question says \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots\". So the ratio (N2/N1) is lower when there are spots. So when comparing (no spots)/(spots), it's higher. So the factor is exp( ~1.506 ), which is ~4.5. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that seems correct. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the energy difference? Let me confirm the wavelength to energy again. \n\nWavelength \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5. So 1448 angstroms is 1448e-10 meters. \n\nThe energy in eV is (hc)/\u03bb, with hc in eV\u00b7nm. Wait, another way: hc is approximately 1240 eV\u00b7nm. \n\nSo 1448 \u00c5 is 0.1448 nm (since 1 nm = 10 \u00c5). \n\nSo E = 1240 / 0.1448 \u2248 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 let's compute that. \n\n1240 divided by 0.1448. Let's see, 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 1240 /0.14 \u2248 ~8857, but precise calculation:\n\n0.1448 * 8500 = 0.1448 *8000 = 1158.4, plus 0.1448*500=72.4 \u2192 total 1230.8. That's close to 1240. So 8500 gives 1230.8, so the difference is 9.2. So 8500 + (9.2 /0.1448) \u2248 8500 + ~63.5 \u2248 8563.5. So approximately 8560 eV? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, that would give 1240 /0.1448 \u2248 8560 eV? That would be 8.56 keV. But earlier calculation gave 8.57 eV. Wait, there's a mistake here. Oh no! Wait, I see the problem. \n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm? Wait no, 1 \u00c5 is 0.1 nm. So 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm. Oh! Oh my goodness, I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, 1 \u00c5 = 1e-10 m = 0.1 nm. So 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm. \n\nSo the previous calculation using hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm. \n\nSo E = 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 let's compute that. \n\n144.8 into 1240: 144.8*8 = 1158.4, so 8 eV? Because 144.8 *8 = 1158.4, so 1240-1158.4=81.6. So 81.6/144.8 \u2248 ~0.563. So total is 8.563 eV. So that's exactly what I had before! So the initial calculation was correct. \n\nSo 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm, so the energy is ~8.57 eV. So that part was right. \n\nTherefore my previous steps are correct. \n\nAnother possible error: Did I mix up the temperatures? The star without spots is hotter (6000 K) so the ratio (N2/N1) is higher. The question asks for the factor of the ratio without spots compared to with spots. So (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots = exp( (\u0394E/(k))*(1/T2 -1/T1) ) = exp(1.506) \u22484.5. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the factor change in the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star's temperature changes due to spots. Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio \\( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}\\right) \\). The temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K when spots are present. \n\nThe energy difference \\( \\Delta E \\) is calculated from the transition wavelength \\( \\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\). Using \\( \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\), we find \\( \\Delta E \\approx 8.57 \\, \\text{eV} \\). The ratio of the ratios (no spots vs. spots) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{no spots}}}{(N_2/N_1)_{\\text{spots}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( T_1 = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\), \\( T_2 = 5500 \\, \\text{K} \\), and \\( \\Delta E/k \\approx 99,500 \\, \\text{K} \\), the exponent becomes:\n\n\\[\n99,500 \\, \\text{K} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right) \\approx 1.506\n\\]\n\nThe exponential factor \\( \\exp(1.506) \\approx 4.5 \\), corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. Hmm. The question gives some info about the star's temperature when it's not spotted (6000K) and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots (5500K). The ratio decreases when there are spots, so when there are no spots, the ratio must be higher. We need to find the factor between the two ratios (no spots vs spots).\n\nFirst, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Since they mention LTE, this should apply.\n\nThe problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Wait, maybe I need to find the energy difference between the two levels? Since the wavelength is given, perhaps using the relation E = hc/\u03bb. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's convert wavelength to meters. 1448 \u00c5 is 1448e-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nCalculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 \u2248 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. Divided by 1448e-10 m gives E \u2248 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut since E here is the energy difference between the two levels, right? So \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. \n\nNow, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is 1 (since they don't give any info on that, maybe we can assume they're the same, or maybe it cancels out in the ratio). Wait, actually, the question is about the ratio changing when the temperature changes. Since the spots cause the overall temperature to drop from 6000K to 5500K. \n\nWait, the problem says when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500K. So the photospheric temperature is lower when there are spots. Since the population ratio depends on temperature, the ratio N2/N1 would be lower at lower temperatures. Because the exponential term would be smaller when T is lower. \n\nWait, the question states that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio (N2/N1) is higher. So the factor we need is the ratio of (N2/N1)_no_spots divided by (N2/N1)_with_spots. \n\nSo, let's denote R_no = N2/N1 at T=6000K, and R_spot = N2/N1 at T=5500K. We need to find R_no / R_spot. \n\nSince the ratio R is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), so R_no/R_spot = exp( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to exp( \u0394E/(k) [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ] )\n\nWait, let me check the algebra:\n\nLet me write R_no/R_spot = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) / (g2/g1)] divided by [exp( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) / (g2/g1)] ), so the g terms cancel. So yes, it's exp( ( -\u0394E/(k T_no) + \u0394E/(k T_spot) )) = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/T_spot - 1/T_no ) )\n\nWait, no, the exponent would be [ -\u0394E/(k T_no) + \u0394E/(k T_spot) ] = \u0394E/(k) ( -1/T_no + 1/T_spot ) = \u0394E/(k) ( (1/T_spot - 1/T_no) )\n\nSo the exponent is \u0394E/(k) * ( (T_no - T_spot)/(T_spot T_no) )\n\nHmm. Let's plug in the numbers. First, compute \u0394E/(kT). Let me compute \u0394E first. Let's compute \u0394E in terms of kT. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio using the temperatures. Let me compute the exponent term for each temperature.\n\nLet me denote x = \u0394E/(k). Then R_no/R_spot = exp( x (1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) )\n\nWait, yes. Let me compute that. Let me compute the exponent:\n\n1/(5500) - 1/(6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(5500*6000) \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n500/(5500*6000) = 1/(11*6000) = 1/(66000). Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator properly.\n\nWait 500 divided by (5500 *6000). Let me compute 5500 *6000 = 5500*6e3 = 33,000,000? Wait 5500*6000 is 5500*6*10^3 = 33,000,000? Let me see: 5500 * 6000 = 5500*6*1000 = 33000*1000 = 33,000,000? Yes. So 500 divided by 33,000,000 is 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000). Wait, 500 divided by 33,000,000 is 500/33e6 = 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000). \n\nSo the exponent is x*(1/(66000)). \n\nWait, but x is \u0394E/(k). Let me compute \u0394E/(k) first. \n\nWe have \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. Let's compute that. \n\nLet me compute hc: h is 6.626e-34 J s, c is 3e8 m/s. hc = 1.9878e-25 J m. \n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m. So \u0394E = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1448e-10 m) \n\nCalculating that: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 (since 1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m) \n\nWait, 1448e-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) x 10^(-25 +7) = approx 1.372 x 10^-18 J. \n\nSo \u0394E = 1.372e-18 J. \n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 (1.372 / 1.38) x 10^5 \u2248 ~1e5? Wait, 1e-18 / 1e-23 is 1e5, so approximately 1e5 K? \n\nWait, 1.372 / 1.38 is roughly 1, so \u0394E/(k) \u2248 1e5 K. Let me calculate more accurately. \n\n1.372 divided by 1.38 is approximately 0.9942, so 0.9942 * 1e5 = ~99,420 K? \n\nWait, but that's in terms of K? Wait, the units here: \u0394E is in J, k is in J/K, so \u0394E/k has units of K. So yes, the value is about ~99,420 K. \n\nWait, so \u0394E/(k) \u2248 ~99,420 K. \n\nSo plugging back into the exponent: \n\nExponent = (99,420 K) * (1/(5500 K) - 1/(6000 K)) \n\nWait, but earlier I had 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) = (1/5500 -1/6000). \n\nWait, let me recalculate the exponent's terms properly. \n\nThe exponent is [1/(5500) -1/(6000)] multiplied by \u0394E/(k). \n\nSo let's compute 1/5500 -1/6000. Let me compute each term:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818 (since 1/5000 is 0.0002, so 1/5500 is less). \n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166666...\n\nSubtracting: 0.0001818 - 0.000166666 \u2248 0.000015133 per K. \n\nWait, but the units: 1/K. \n\nSo, 0.000015133 (1/K) multiplied by \u0394E/(k) which is ~99,420 K. \n\nSo multiplying: 0.000015133 * 99,420 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.000015133 * 100,000 = ~1.5133. \n\nBut since it's 99,420, which is 100,000 - 580. So 0.000015133*(99,420) = 0.000015133*(100,000 - 580) = 1.5133 - (0.000015133 *580). \n\n0.000015133 *580 \u2248 0.00877. \n\nSo total is approx 1.5133 - 0.00877 \u2248 1.5045. \n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5045. \n\nTherefore, the ratio R_no/R_spot is exp(1.5045). \n\nCalculating exp(1.5045). \n\nWe know that e^1.6 is about 4.95, and e^1.5 is about 4.48. Let me compute:\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817 (approx). \n\n1.5045 is a bit more than 1.5. Let me see, 1.5 +0.0045. \n\nThe derivative of e^x is e^x, so approximate the difference. \n\ne^(1.5 + 0.0045) \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.0045 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 +0.0045) \u2248 4.4817 *1.0045 \u2248 ~4.4817 + 0.0202 \u2248 4.5019. \n\nSo approximately 4.5. \n\nWait, so the ratio R_no/R_spot is about 4.5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I did all steps correctly. \n\nWait, the exponent was (\u0394E/k)*(1/T_spot -1/T_no). Wait, the exponent in R_no/R_spot is [ ( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) - ( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) ] which is \u0394E/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_no). \n\nWait, that's correct. \n\nThen the calculation steps:\n\n\u0394E/(k) was calculated as approximately 99,420 K. \n\nThen the difference in 1/T terms: (1/5500 -1/6000). \n\nYes, and that difference was 0.000015133 per 1/K. \n\nMultiplying those gives about 1.5045. \n\nExp(1.5045) \u2248 ~4.5, which matches option C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation of \u0394E/(k):\n\nLet me re-calculate \u0394E/(k):\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1448e-10) \n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. \n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = \n\n1.9878 /1.448 = approx 1.372 (since 1.448*1.372 \u2248 1.987). \n\nSo 1.372e-25 /1e-7 = 1.372e-18 J. \n\nThen, \u0394E/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator: 1.372 /1.38 \u2248 ~0.994, so 0.994e5 = ~99400 K. That's correct. \n\nThen 1/5500 is 1/(5.5e3) = ~0.0001818 per K^-1. \n\n1/6000 is ~0.00016666 per K^-1. \n\nSubtracting: 0.0001818 -0.00016666 = 0.00001513 (per K^-1). \n\nMultiply by 99400 K: 0.00001513 *99400 = \n\nLet me compute 0.00001513 *100,000 = 1.513, so subtract 0.00001513 *600 (since 100,000 -600 =99400). \n\nWait, 99400 is 100,000 -600. \n\nSo 0.00001513 *99400 = 0.00001513*(100000-600) = 1.513 - (0.00001513 *600) \n\nCalculate 0.00001513 *600 = 0.009078. \n\nSo total is 1.513 -0.009078 \u22481.5039, which is the exponent. \n\nSo e^1.5039 is indeed approximately 4.5. \n\nSo the answer should be C) ~4.5. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9. \n\nYes, so C is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but another thought: the problem mentions that when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500K. However, the question is about the photospheric temperature. Since the spots are cooler regions, but the overall Teff is given. However, does the photospheric temperature in the presence of spots refer to the average temperature, or is the local temperature in the unspotted regions still at 6000K? Wait, the question says \"the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K\". So the effective temperature is the average, so the entire photosphere (including spots) has an effective temp of 5500. But for the purpose of the population ratio, would the local temperature matter? \n\nHmm, the question states \"in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio...\" So perhaps the local temperature where the Ti lines are formed? But if the spots are on the surface, then in regions with spots, the temperature is lower. However, the problem might be assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature is averaged to 5500 when spots are present, but maybe the line forming regions are at the local temperature. Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall effective temp is 5500. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of spots lowers the average temperature, so the effective temperature (which is related to the overall radiation) is lower. However, the population ratio would depend on the actual temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed. If the spots are cooler regions, then the average temperature is lower, but maybe the line is formed in regions that are either spotted or not. \n\nWait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, implying that the temperature is lower (since the ratio decreases with lower T). Therefore, the T in the photosphere (where the lines are formed) must be lower when there are spots. \n\nTherefore, the effective temperature given (5500K when spotted) is probably the relevant temperature for the calculation. Because the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. Therefore, the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is the effective temperature. \n\nTherefore, my initial approach is correct. The calculation gives ~4.5, so option C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes between the star's unspotted and spotted states, we use the Boltzmann equation.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. Hmm. The question gives some info about the star's temperature when it's not spotted (6000K) and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots (5500K). The ratio decreases when there are spots, so when there are no spots, the ratio must be higher. We need to find the factor between the two ratios (no spots vs spots).\n\nFirst, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Since they mention LTE, this should apply.\n\nThe problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 \u00c5. Wait, maybe I need to find the energy difference between the two levels? Since the wavelength is given, perhaps using the relation E = hc/\u03bb. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's convert wavelength to meters. 1448 \u00c5 is 1448e-10 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) \n\nCalculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 \u2248 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. Divided by 1448e-10 m gives E \u2248 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 \u2248 approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.\n\nBut since E here is the energy difference between the two levels, right? So \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. \n\nNow, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is 1 (since they don't give any info on that, maybe we can assume they're the same, or maybe it cancels out in the ratio). Wait, actually, the question is about the ratio changing when the temperature changes. Since the spots cause the overall temperature to drop from 6000K to 5500K. \n\nWait, the problem says when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500K. So the photospheric temperature is lower when there are spots. Since the population ratio depends on temperature, the ratio N2/N1 would be lower at lower temperatures. Because the exponential term would be smaller when T is lower. \n\nWait, the question states that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio (N2/N1) is higher. So the factor we need is the ratio of (N2/N1)_no_spots divided by (N2/N1)_with_spots. \n\nSo, let's denote R_no = N2/N1 at T=6000K, and R_spot = N2/N1 at T=5500K. We need to find R_no / R_spot. \n\nSince the ratio R is proportional to exp( -\u0394E/(k T) ), so R_no/R_spot = exp( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) / exp( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to exp( \u0394E/(k) [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) ] )\n\nWait, let me check the algebra:\n\nLet me write R_no/R_spot = [exp( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) / (g2/g1)] divided by [exp( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) / (g2/g1)] ), so the g terms cancel. So yes, it's exp( ( -\u0394E/(k T_no) + \u0394E/(k T_spot) )) = exp( \u0394E/(k) ( 1/T_spot - 1/T_no ) )\n\nWait, no, the exponent would be [ -\u0394E/(k T_no) + \u0394E/(k T_spot) ] = \u0394E/(k) ( -1/T_no + 1/T_spot ) = \u0394E/(k) ( (1/T_spot - 1/T_no) )\n\nSo the exponent is \u0394E/(k) * ( (T_no - T_spot)/(T_spot T_no) )\n\nHmm. Let's plug in the numbers. First, compute \u0394E/(kT). Let me compute \u0394E first. Let's compute \u0394E in terms of kT. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio using the temperatures. Let me compute the exponent term for each temperature.\n\nLet me denote x = \u0394E/(k). Then R_no/R_spot = exp( x (1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) )\n\nWait, yes. Let me compute that. Let me compute the exponent:\n\n1/(5500) - 1/(6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(5500*6000) \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n500/(5500*6000) = 1/(11*6000) = 1/(66000). Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator properly.\n\nWait 500 divided by (5500 *6000). Let me compute 5500 *6000 = 5500*6e3 = 33,000,000? Wait 5500*6000 is 5500*6*10^3 = 33,000,000? Let me see: 5500 * 6000 = 5500*6*1000 = 33000*1000 = 33,000,000? Yes. So 500 divided by 33,000,000 is 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000). Wait, 500 divided by 33,000,000 is 500/33e6 = 5/(330,000) = 1/(66,000). \n\nSo the exponent is x*(1/(66000)). \n\nWait, but x is \u0394E/(k). Let me compute \u0394E/(k) first. \n\nWe have \u0394E = hc/\u03bb. Let's compute that. \n\nLet me compute hc: h is 6.626e-34 J s, c is 3e8 m/s. hc = 1.9878e-25 J m. \n\n\u03bb is 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m. So \u0394E = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1448e-10 m) \n\nCalculating that: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 (since 1448e-10 is 1.448e-7 m) \n\nWait, 1448e-10 m = 1.448 x 10^-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) x 10^(-25 +7) = approx 1.372 x 10^-18 J. \n\nSo \u0394E = 1.372e-18 J. \n\nNow, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. \n\nSo \u0394E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) \u2248 (1.372 / 1.38) x 10^5 \u2248 ~1e5? Wait, 1e-18 / 1e-23 is 1e5, so approximately 1e5 K? \n\nWait, 1.372 / 1.38 is roughly 1, so \u0394E/(k) \u2248 1e5 K. Let me calculate more accurately. \n\n1.372 divided by 1.38 is approximately 0.9942, so 0.9942 * 1e5 = ~99,420 K? \n\nWait, but that's in terms of K? Wait, the units here: \u0394E is in J, k is in J/K, so \u0394E/k has units of K. So yes, the value is about ~99,420 K. \n\nWait, so \u0394E/(k) \u2248 ~99,420 K. \n\nSo plugging back into the exponent: \n\nExponent = (99,420 K) * (1/(5500 K) - 1/(6000 K)) \n\nWait, but earlier I had 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_no) = (1/5500 -1/6000). \n\nWait, let me recalculate the exponent's terms properly. \n\nThe exponent is [1/(5500) -1/(6000)] multiplied by \u0394E/(k). \n\nSo let's compute 1/5500 -1/6000. Let me compute each term:\n\n1/5500 \u2248 0.0001818 (since 1/5000 is 0.0002, so 1/5500 is less). \n\n1/6000 \u2248 0.000166666...\n\nSubtracting: 0.0001818 - 0.000166666 \u2248 0.000015133 per K. \n\nWait, but the units: 1/K. \n\nSo, 0.000015133 (1/K) multiplied by \u0394E/(k) which is ~99,420 K. \n\nSo multiplying: 0.000015133 * 99,420 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.000015133 * 100,000 = ~1.5133. \n\nBut since it's 99,420, which is 100,000 - 580. So 0.000015133*(99,420) = 0.000015133*(100,000 - 580) = 1.5133 - (0.000015133 *580). \n\n0.000015133 *580 \u2248 0.00877. \n\nSo total is approx 1.5133 - 0.00877 \u2248 1.5045. \n\nSo the exponent is approximately 1.5045. \n\nTherefore, the ratio R_no/R_spot is exp(1.5045). \n\nCalculating exp(1.5045). \n\nWe know that e^1.6 is about 4.95, and e^1.5 is about 4.48. Let me compute:\n\ne^1.5 = 4.4817 (approx). \n\n1.5045 is a bit more than 1.5. Let me see, 1.5 +0.0045. \n\nThe derivative of e^x is e^x, so approximate the difference. \n\ne^(1.5 + 0.0045) \u2248 e^1.5 * e^0.0045 \u2248 4.4817 * (1 +0.0045) \u2248 4.4817 *1.0045 \u2248 ~4.4817 + 0.0202 \u2248 4.5019. \n\nSo approximately 4.5. \n\nWait, so the ratio R_no/R_spot is about 4.5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~4.5. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I did all steps correctly. \n\nWait, the exponent was (\u0394E/k)*(1/T_spot -1/T_no). Wait, the exponent in R_no/R_spot is [ ( -\u0394E/(k T_no) ) - ( -\u0394E/(k T_spot) ) ] which is \u0394E/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_no). \n\nWait, that's correct. \n\nThen the calculation steps:\n\n\u0394E/(k) was calculated as approximately 99,420 K. \n\nThen the difference in 1/T terms: (1/5500 -1/6000). \n\nYes, and that difference was 0.000015133 per 1/K. \n\nMultiplying those gives about 1.5045. \n\nExp(1.5045) \u2248 ~4.5, which matches option C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation of \u0394E/(k):\n\nLet me re-calculate \u0394E/(k):\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1448e-10) \n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m. \n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = \n\n1.9878 /1.448 = approx 1.372 (since 1.448*1.372 \u2248 1.987). \n\nSo 1.372e-25 /1e-7 = 1.372e-18 J. \n\nThen, \u0394E/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator: 1.372 /1.38 \u2248 ~0.994, so 0.994e5 = ~99400 K. That's correct. \n\nThen 1/5500 is 1/(5.5e3) = ~0.0001818 per K^-1. \n\n1/6000 is ~0.00016666 per K^-1. \n\nSubtracting: 0.0001818 -0.00016666 = 0.00001513 (per K^-1). \n\nMultiply by 99400 K: 0.00001513 *99400 = \n\nLet me compute 0.00001513 *100,000 = 1.513, so subtract 0.00001513 *600 (since 100,000 -600 =99400). \n\nWait, 99400 is 100,000 -600. \n\nSo 0.00001513 *99400 = 0.00001513*(100000-600) = 1.513 - (0.00001513 *600) \n\nCalculate 0.00001513 *600 = 0.009078. \n\nSo total is 1.513 -0.009078 \u22481.5039, which is the exponent. \n\nSo e^1.5039 is indeed approximately 4.5. \n\nSo the answer should be C) ~4.5. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9. \n\nYes, so C is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but another thought: the problem mentions that when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500K. However, the question is about the photospheric temperature. Since the spots are cooler regions, but the overall Teff is given.
