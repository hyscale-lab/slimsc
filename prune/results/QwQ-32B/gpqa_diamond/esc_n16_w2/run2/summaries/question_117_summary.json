      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Let me think through each option step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, actually, chiral centers are the main thing here. A chiral molecule has at least one stereogenic center, usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, it's chiral and thus shows optical isomerism. Alternatively, if there's a double bond that can't rotate (like in a trans isomer), maybe that's a case too, like in geometric isomerism, but optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers, right?\n\nLet me look at each compound:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected. The substituents are nitro groups on each benzene ring at position 6, and the dicarboxylate part is at 2 and 2', connected as esters with methyl groups. Let me visualize that. The structure probably has a central biphenyl core with nitro groups on each ring's 6th carbon. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. Since biphenyls can have axes of symmetry, but with substituents, maybe there's a chiral center here? Wait, but the nitro and ester groups are on the biphenyl rings. Unless the biphenyl itself is arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations if the substituents are in different positions. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric? The 6 and 6' nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' esters. The positions might be symmetric across the central bond between the two phenyl rings. So maybe this is a meso compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall because of symmetry. That would mean no optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. Wait, the numbering might be such that the nitro groups are on one side. Let me think again. If the nitro groups are on the 6 positions (which are meta to the ester groups?), perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, then when you flip the molecule over, the nitro and ester positions would swap, but since both rings have the same substituents, it might be symmetric. So this could be a meso form, hence no optical isomerism. Or maybe it's chiral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me set that aside for a moment.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) with methanol. The structure would be CH3CO-O-CH(CH2OH) or something? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes an ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is: the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon. Wait, propanoic acid is three carbons. Let's see: the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The 2-hydroxy is on the middle carbon. The ester would replace the COOH with a methyl ester, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl group is the second carbon, and the ester is on the third. The middle carbon (the hydroxyl carbon) is bonded to: a CH3, a OH, a COOCH3, and a CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 3 (since it's propanoic acid). The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: COOCH3\n\nSo carbon 2 has four different groups: CH3 (from carbon 1), OH, a single bond to carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group), and the hydrogen on carbon 2? Wait, wait. Wait, the carbon chain is:\n\n1: CH3-\n2: CH(OH)-\n3: COOCH3\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to CH3 (carbon 1), to the OH group, to carbon 3 (which is the carbonyl carbon of the ester), and also has a hydrogen. So the four groups around carbon 2 are: CH3, OH, COOCH3 (through a single bond?), and H. Wait, actually, the carbon 2 has four substituents: the CH3 (from carbon 1), the OH, the COOCH3 (through the carbon chain), and a hydrogen. So that's four different groups. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center. Therefore, it should have optical isomers (enantiomers). Unless there's another chiral center that makes it a meso compound. Wait, in this case, there's only one chiral center (carbon 2). So it would have two enantiomers, so optical isomerism. So option 2 is correct.\n\n3. Benzophenone. That's a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to another benzene ring. Structure is (Ph)2CO. The central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and an oxygen. The central carbon is part of a ketone. Let's see if there's a chiral center here. The central carbon is bonded to two different groups: each benzene ring (but they are the same, since both are phenyl groups), the oxygen, and the other side? Wait, the structure is actually a ketone between two phenyl groups. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (as the carbonyl), and a double bond to oxygen. Wait, no. The structure of benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon (the one in the ketone) is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl. But the carbonyl is a double bond to oxygen, so the central carbon has two phenyl groups, and the carbonyl oxygen. So the central carbon has two identical groups (the two phenyl rings), so it can't be a chiral center. So no chiral centers here. So benzophenone is achiral and doesn't have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) esterified with methanol. Fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, the two COOH groups become COOCH3. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is trans. Now, does this have a chiral center? The double bond in fumarate is in the trans configuration, but the molecule itself isn't chiral. Let me see: each of the two carbonyl groups is on the same side? Wait, in fumarate, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans). The double bond restricts rotation, so the molecule can't rotate into its mirror image. But does it have a chiral center? Let's look at each carbon. The carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) are each bonded to two oxygens (as part of the carboxyl groups) but wait, no. Let's think again. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The carbons at positions 1 and 4 (the ones with the COOH groups) each have a COOH group, a single bond to the next carbon, etc. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons (2 and 3) is connected to two other carbons (except the ends). Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (COOH), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen (since it's trans, maybe the hydrogens are on opposite sides). Wait, actually, the double bond makes the molecule rigid. The carbons in the double bond can't rotate, but for chirality, we need a chiral center. Let me check each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: bonded to COOH group, carbon 2, and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid, but fumarate is the trans version of butenedioic acid. Wait, maybe I need to correct. Let me see:\n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which has a COOH group)\n- The double bond to carbon 3\n- A hydrogen (on the same side as the COOH group of carbon 1?)\n\nWait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) have substituents. Let me think of each carbon's groups.\n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to C1 (which has a COOH group)\n- The double bond to C3\n- A hydrogen (since the double bond takes two bonds, so the remaining bond is a H)\n- And the other side? Wait, the other side would be the double bond to C3. Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly. The molecule is:\n\nO=C-O-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, fumarate is a trans double bond. Wait, the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The central double bond is between C2 and C3. So for carbon 2:\n\nGroups are:\n\n- COOH (from C1)\n- CH= (the double bond to C3)\n- H (on one side)\n- The other side (the other single bond?) Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds in the double bond, so the remaining bonds are single. Carbon 2 has a single bond to C1 (with COOH), a single bond to a hydrogen (since in trans configuration, the hydrogens might be on opposite sides?), and the double bond to C3. Wait, actually, each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. For C2:\n\nSubstituents: COOH (from C1), a hydrogen, and the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think of each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3):\n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- Attached to:\n\n   - The COOH group (from C1)\n   - A hydrogen (since in trans, the hydrogens are on opposite sides)\n   - The double bond to C3.\n\nCarbon 3:\n\n- Attached to:\n\n   - The COOH group (on C4)\n   - A hydrogen (on the opposite side from C2's H)\n   - The double bond to C2.\n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents. The double bond carbons each have two groups. For example, carbon 2 has COOH (from C1) and a H. But since the double bond is between them, they can't rotate. So the molecule is planar around the double bond. But in terms of chirality, there's no chiral center here. Because each of the double bond carbons only have two different groups. Wait, for example, carbon 2 has the COOH group (which is a -COOH) and a H. The other side is the double bond. Wait, perhaps the actual groups are:\n\nWait, perhaps the carbons in the double bond have substituents. Let me think again. The structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The carbons at positions 2 and 3 (the double bond carbons) each have a hydrogen and a COOH group on the adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe each of those carbons has two substituents. For example, carbon 2 is connected to the COOH (from C1), a hydrogen, and the double bond. Wait, but the double bond is with carbon 3. So the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The COOH group (attached to C1, which is adjacent to C2)\n- A hydrogen (since the other single bond is to H)\n- The double bond to C3.\n\nSo the groups around carbon 2 are COOH (from C1), H, and the double bond. Similarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- The COOH on C4 (the next carbon)\n- A hydrogen (on the opposite side)\n- The double bond to C2.\n\nTherefore, each of these carbons (2 and 3) only have two different groups (the COOH and H). Wait, but the double bond is part of the carbon's structure. Wait, maybe I'm not considering all the substituents properly. Let's think of each carbon's groups. For carbon 2:\n\n- The two bonds in the double bond (so it's part of the C=C)\n- The single bond to the adjacent carbon (C1, which has the COOH)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen.\n\nSo the groups attached to carbon 2 are: COOH (via C1), H, and the double bond. The double bond is between C2 and C3, so that's a bond, not a substituent. Wait, substituents are atoms or groups bonded to the carbon. So the substituents on carbon 2 are the COOH (from C1), the H, and the two bonds in the double bond (but those are part of the structure, not substituents). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach. \n\nIn a double bond, each carbon has two substituents besides the double bond. For example, in CH2=CH2, each C has two H's. In fumarate, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on each are:\n\nCarbon 2 has a -COOH group attached (since C1 is COOH) and a H. The other substituent is the double bond, which is part of the structure. Wait, substituents are the atoms or groups directly attached. So for carbon 2, the substituents are:\n\n- The COOH (from C1)\n- A H\n- The double bond to C3 (but that's a bond, not a substituent)\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: the molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons has two other substituents. For carbon 2, the other substituents are the COOH (on C1) and a H. For carbon 3, it's the COOH (on C4) and a H. Since the two H's are on opposite sides (trans configuration), the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, so it has geometric isomerism (cis vs trans). But geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Since there are no chiral centers here (each double bond carbon only has two different substituents, but that's not enough for chirality), the molecule is not chiral. Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, can that lead to chirality? No, unless there are four different groups around a central carbon. Here, each double bond carbon only has two different substituents (COOH and H), so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (the ester form) would still have the same structure as fumaric acid but with the COOH groups as esters. So the double bond remains, and there's no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers (chiral centers). So fumarate (trans) doesn't have chiral centers. However, if the molecule had a chiral center, then it would. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let's see. If the molecule were in the cis form, then maybe there's a chiral center. Wait, no. For example, maleic acid (cis) has a trans isomer (fumaric). But maleic acid (cis) can have a chiral center? Wait no. Wait, let me think of the structure again. If the two COOH groups are on the same side (cis), then the molecule is still planar, but maybe there's a chiral center. Wait, no. The double bond carbons still only have two substituents each. Wait, in the case of maleic acid (cis), the structure is HOOC-CH(\u2014CH2\u2014?) No, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the COOH groups on the same side. The double bond carbons (C2 and C3) each have substituents: on C2, the COOH (from C1) and a H (same side as the other COOH?), but arranged cis. But even then, each of the double bond carbons only have two substituents. Therefore, no chiral centers. So neither cis nor trans forms have chiral centers. So fumarate (trans) doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but wait, maybe the ester form (dimethyl fumarate) has some other groups. Let me see. The dimethyl ester would replace both COOH groups with OMe (methoxy). So the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. The central double bond is still between the two carbons. Each of those carbons still has two substituents (the OMe groups on either end and the H's). So still no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, so option 4 is out. \n\nNow, looking back at option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me parse that. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The 6 and 6' positions (on each ring) have nitro groups. The 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. \n\nLet me try to visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1' (since it's 1,1'-biphenyl). \n\nSo the positions are numbered such that the two rings are connected at the 1-1' positions. Then on each ring, the 2 and 6 positions are substituted. Let me consider the biphenyl structure. \n\nIf the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of both rings, and the esters on the 2 positions. Let's see if there's a plane of symmetry. Since both rings are substituted similarly, the molecule might be symmetric. For example, if you flip the molecule over the central axis between the two phenyl rings, the nitro groups and esters would swap positions but since both rings are the same, the molecule would look the same. So this would be a meso compound. Therefore, even if there are chiral centers, the molecule as a whole is achiral because of the symmetry. Hence, it doesn't show optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement of substituents makes it chiral. Let me think again. Suppose the two rings are connected at the 1-1' positions. The 2 and 6 positions on each ring: \n\nOn the first ring (left), position 2 has an ester, position 6 has a nitro. The second ring (right) has the same. When looking at the molecule, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl axis, then flipping the molecule would superimpose the mirror image. Therefore, no optical activity. \n\nSo option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the compounds that show optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) because of the chiral center, and maybe option 4? Wait, no, I thought option 4 didn't. Wait, the question options are A)1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2. \n\nWait, but I thought option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have optical isomerism. So the correct ones are 2 and maybe another. Wait, let me recheck option 4 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with fumarate. Let me think again. \n\nFumarate is the trans form. The molecule itself is not chiral. However, when esterified, does it form a chiral center? No, because the ester groups are on both ends, so the symmetry remains. Wait, but if the fumarate is part of a different structure where a chiral center exists... No, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure would still have the same symmetry as fumaric acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the possibility of geometric isomerism, but the question specifically asks for optical isomerism (enantiomers). \n\nSo the only one that has a chiral center is option 2. \n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2 and 3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have a choice with only 2. The options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (2,3), D (1,2). So none of these include only option 2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I missed another chiral center. Let me re-examine option 4 again. \n\nWait, dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is trans, then it's not chiral. But what if the molecule has a chiral center? Wait, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. The carbons adjacent to the double bond each have an ester group on one side and a hydrogen on the other. Let me look at each carbon:\n\nThe carbons attached to the ester groups (the end carbons) each have two methyl ester groups (or wait, each end has an ester group). The central two carbons (with the double bond) have:\n\nCarbon 2 (left of double bond):\n\n- Attached to OMe (via the ester)\n- A double bond to carbon 3\n- A hydrogen (since it's trans, the hydrogens are on opposite sides)\n- The other bond is to the next carbon? Wait, no. The structure is OMe-O-C(=O)? Wait, no. Wait, the fumaric acid is butenedioic acid. The esterification would replace each COOH with an OMe group. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try again. \n\nOriginal fumaric acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nEsterifying both COOH groups with methanol gives OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, but actually, each COOH becomes an ester, so the structure would be:\n\nCH2(OOCR)\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2(OOCR), where R is methyl. Wait, no. Let me see: the two carboxylic acids are on each end. So the esterified form would be:\n\nOOCR\u2013CH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2\u2013OOCR. Wait, no. Wait, the original structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each COOH is on the end. So after esterification with methanol (MeOH), the two COOH groups become OMe groups. So the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, but that would be the ester groups attached to the end carbons. \n\nEach end carbon (the ones with the original COOH) now has an OMe group. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. So the structure is:\n\nOMe-O-C(=O)\u2013? No, wait, maybe it's OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe? No, perhaps I'm not getting the connectivity right. Let me think of the fumarate structure as:\n\nThe two ends (carbons 1 and 4) have the ester groups. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those central carbons has a hydrogen and the double bond. \n\nSo each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents. The end carbons (1 and 4) each have an ester group (OMe) and a single bond to carbon 2 or 3. \n\nLooking at carbon 1: connected to OMe, carbon 2, and two hydrogens? Wait, carbon 1 (the first carbon) is part of the CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, perhaps each end is:\n\nThe first carbon (left end) has the OMe group attached via an ester (so -O-C(=O)-?), no. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe two COOH groups are each esterified to methanol, so the structure is OMe-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct structure of fumaric acid ester is:\n\nEach of the two carboxylic acid groups (on carbons 1 and 4 of the butenedioic acid) are converted to esters. So the structure would be OMe-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate. The IUPAC name would be dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is OMe-O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-OMe. Wait, yes! Oh, I see my mistake. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, but the carbonyl groups are part of the esters. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nHOOC becomes COOCH3, so the entire molecule is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the central double bond is between the two CH groups. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no. Wait, the actual structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:\n\nOOCCH3\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3. \n\nWait, the two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the central carbons (2 and 3) has substituents: \n\nCarbon 2: attached to COOCH3 (on carbon 1?), no. Wait, let's write it properly. \n\nStructure:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2(COOCH3) \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe correct structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, the original fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester form would replace each COOH with OOCR (R = methyl). So:\n\nCarbon 1: -COOCH3 \n\nCarbon 2: CH= \n\nCarbon 3: CH \n\nCarbon 4: -COOCH3 \n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would have a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, the actual correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the ends. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So:\n\nThe molecule is (COOCH3)2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule has two ester groups on each end, connected by a central double bond. So the structure is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nYes, that's right. So the molecule is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (the ends), with the central double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the central carbons (2 and 3) has a single bond to one ester group and a double bond between them. \n\nNow, looking at each carbon's substituents:\n\nCarbon 1: connected to COOCH3 and carbon 2. It has two hydrogens? Wait, carbon 1 is part of the CH2 group? No. Wait, carbon 1 is bonded to the ester group (COOCH3) and to carbon 2. The other bonds are H and another H? Because the molecule is OOCCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So carbon 1 is CH2 (with the COOCH3 group). Wait, let me clarify:\n\nStructure: \n\nThe molecule is:\n\nOOCCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. When esterified, they become COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3?\n\nWait, that would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Then carbon 1 is CH2 (with a COOCH3 group and two H's?), and carbon 4 similarly. \n\nIn that case, each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have:\n\nCarbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (CH2), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon 3: connected to carbon 4 (CH2), the double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. \n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents: the CH2 group (with the ester) and a hydrogen. Since the molecule is trans (as fumarate is the trans isomer), the hydrogens are on opposite sides. \n\nTherefore, each central carbon has two different groups (the CH2 and H), but since they are part of a double bond, there's no chiral center here. So the molecule is not chiral. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (option4) does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the only correct option is 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). But looking at the options given, none of them have just option 2. The options are A)1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2 and 3; D)1 and 2. \n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about option 1. \n\nOption1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe biphenyl is 1,1'- connected. Each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. \n\nLet me try to imagine the numbering. In biphenyl systems, the positions are numbered such that the first ring is the left one, and the prime (') denotes the second ring. \n\nSo for each ring:\n\nOn the first ring (left), position 1 is attached to the second ring. Position 2 is next to it, and position 6 is the one opposite to position 2 (since in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are arranged in order). So the nitro groups are on position 6 of each ring. \n\nThe carboxylate esters are on position 2 of each ring. \n\nNow, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or is a meso compound. \n\nThe molecule has two phenyl rings connected at 1-1', each with substituents at 2 and 6. The substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions. Let's see if there is a plane of symmetry. \n\nIf you imagine the biphenyl structure, with the two rings connected at positions 1 and 1', and each has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. \n\nThe positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other on each ring. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. \n\nIf you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis perpendicular to the biphenyl plane and through the central bond, the substituents would swap places but since each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would look the same. Hence, it has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism. \n\nSo option1 is out. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. But the options given don't have a choice with only option2. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nWait, the only possible correct answer is D (1 and 2), but I thought option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually a different structure where a chiral center exists. \n\nWait, maybe the fumarate is part of a ring or another structure. Or maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Let me check dimethyl fumarate's structure again. \n\nLooking up in my mind, fumaric acid is trans butenedioic acid. Its dimethyl ester would have the structure (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:\n\nOOC(CH2)\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. The correct structure is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the two end carbons of the four-carbon chain. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, that's four carbons:\n\nCarbon1: COOCH3\n\nCarbon2: CH2- (no, wait, Carbon1 is connected to Carbon2 via a single bond?)\n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is OOCCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3. \n\nIn that case, each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have:\n\nCarbon2: connected to Carbon1 (CH2), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon3: connected to Carbon4 (CH2), double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. \n\nAgain, each of these carbons has two substituents (the CH2 and H). The molecule is symmetric because it's trans. So no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the ester groups are on different sides leading to a chiral center? No, the ester groups are on the ends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option4 is referring to the possibility that the double bond is in a different position that allows a chiral center. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the molecule has a chiral center when esterified. Wait, the ester groups are on the ends, so no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option2. Let me recheck option2 again. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. \n\nThe structure is:\n\nThe molecule has a chiral center at the second carbon. Let me confirm:\n\nCarbon1: CH3-\n\nCarbon2: CH(OH)-\n\nCarbon3: COOCH3\n\nThe second carbon (position2) is connected to:\n\n- CH3 (from carbon1),\n\n- OH,\n\n- COOCH3 (the ester group on carbon3),\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's a carbon with four bonds). \n\nYes, that's four different groups. So this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has two enantiomers. So option2 definitely has optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct options are 2. But looking at the given options, the only one that includes option2 is options A, C, D. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nSo the only possible answer that includes option2 is D (1 and 2), but I thought option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with option1. Let me think again. \n\nOption1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nWait, maybe the numbering is different. Suppose the substituents are not symmetrically placed. \n\nWait, perhaps the two rings are connected at 1-1', and the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', but the carboxylate esters are on 2 and 2'. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. Let me think: \n\nIn biphenyl systems, the numbering can sometimes lead to different possibilities. Let's say the first ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, and the second ring has substituents at 2' and 6'. \n\nThe key is whether the arrangement makes the molecule symmetric. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl is in a configuration where the substituents are placed such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. \n\nWait, but if the substituents are in the same positions on both rings, then flipping the molecule over the central axis would superimpose the mirror image. Hence, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, the molecule is achiral. \n\nTherefore, option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct answer must be D (1 and 2) but that would include option1 which I don't think has optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center due to the way the rings are connected. But biphenyl itself is a rigid structure but without a chiral center unless there are substituents making it asymmetric. \n\nWait, but in this case, the substituents are symmetrically placed, so it's a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question includes option4. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the ester groups are placed in a way that creates asymmetry. \n\nWait, but the structure is symmetrical. The two ester groups are on opposite ends, and the double bond is in the middle. The molecule is symmetric. \n\nSo no, no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that the double bond in fumarate allows for geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center. \n\nSo the only correct answer is option2, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, the options are A, B, C, D. The options given are:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with option3. Benzophenone. \n\nBenzophenone is (Ph)2CO. Does that have a chiral center? \n\nThe central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl. The central carbon has four groups: two phenyl groups (same), a double bond to oxygen (which is part of the carbonyl), and another oxygen? Wait, no. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. The fourth bond is the double bond to oxygen. \n\nWait, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, and the carbonyl group (which includes the double bond to O). So the four groups around the central carbon are: two phenyl groups (same), the double bond to O, and the other side? Wait, no. The carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one to the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond). Wait, that's three bonds. Wait, no, the structure is:\n\nThe central carbon is in the ketone. So:\n\nPh- C=O -Ph?\n\nNo, benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. The fourth bond is the double bond between the central carbon and oxygen. \n\nWait, the central carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. \n\nAh, right. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen via double bond, and a single bond to another oxygen? No. Wait, no, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, a double bond to oxygen, and the fourth bond is the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the central carbon has four bonds: two single bonds to the phenyl groups, and a double bond to the oxygen. So the groups around the central carbon are two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. Since the two phenyl groups are the same, the central carbon has two identical groups, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral. \n\nSo option3 is out. \n\nHmm. So the only correct option is option2. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, the options are given as:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nWait, maybe the question includes option4 for some reason. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. \n\nWait, let's think of another possibility. Maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center if the ester groups are placed in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the ester groups are on adjacent carbons? No, the structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. For instance, if one ester is on the left and the other is on a different position. But no, according to the name, it's dimethyl fumarate, which should have both COOH groups esterified. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's option4 is actually referring to maleic acid (the cis form), which can have a chiral center? Wait no, maleic acid (cis) has a central double bond with the two COOH groups on the same side. But that still doesn't create a chiral center because the central carbons still have two substituents each. \n\nWait, unless there's a third substituent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a different configuration where a chiral center exists. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is wrong, but I should stick to my analysis. \n\nGiven that option2 is correct and the others are not, but the options don't have a choice with only option2, I must have made an error somewhere. \n\nWait, let me recheck option1 again. \n\nThe first compound has the formula dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe positions 2 and 2' have the carboxylate groups (which are esterified with methyl), and positions 6 and 6' have nitro groups. \n\nThe biphenyl is connected at 1-1'. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. \n\nWait, perhaps the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane, but the ester groups are on the opposite side. \n\nWait, but the numbering would require that. \n\nAlternatively, the positions 2 and 2' are on the same side of the biphenyl, and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' are also on the same side. \n\nBut the key is whether there's a plane of symmetry. \n\nSuppose the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two rings and their substituents. For example, imagine looking at the biphenyl along the axis connecting the two phenyl rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso. \n\nTherefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. \n\nSo option1 is not optically active. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have a single answer, perhaps I made a mistake in another option. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question says \"show optical isomerism\". \n\nWait, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the substituents are different. \n\nWait, the structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? \n\nWait, no, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two ends are COOCH3 and COOCH3. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. \n\nWait, if the molecule is actually:\n\nPh-CH(OH)-COOCH3 or something else? No, that's option2. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that the double bond in fumarate can lead to a chiral center when combined with other groups. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has geometric isomerism (cis and trans) as optical isomers. But geometric isomers are not optical isomers unless they have a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option4. Let me look up the structure of dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, I can't actually look it up, but I'll think again. \n\nFumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. Its dimethyl ester would be (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the two end carbons of the four-carbon chain. The double bond is between the second and third carbons. \n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Since it's the trans isomer, the groups are opposite, so the molecule is symmetric. Hence, no chiral center. \n\nTherefore, option4 is out. \n\nSo the only correct answer is option2, but since none of the options include only that, perhaps I made a mistake with option3 or something else. \n\nWait, option3 is benzophenone. \n\nWait, maybe benzophenone has a chiral center. Let me think again. \n\nBenzophenone's structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl. The four groups around the central carbon are two phenyl groups (same), the carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another bond? \n\nWait, the central carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, a double bond to the oxygen, and the fourth bond is to the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the central carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. \n\nAh! Wait, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen via a double bond, and what's the fourth bond? \n\nThe central carbon must have four bonds. The structure is actually:\n\nPh- C(=O)-Ph. So the carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, an oxygen via a double bond, and the fourth bond is to another oxygen? No, no. \n\nWait, the central carbon has four bonds: two to the phenyl groups, one double bond to oxygen, and the fourth bond is the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, and a double bond to the oxygen. The double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond. The carbon has four bonds: two single (to phenyl), and two from the double bond (one sigma, one pi). \n\nTherefore, the four groups around the central carbon are: two phenyl groups and the double bond to oxygen. Since two groups are the same (the phenyl groups), the central carbon is not a chiral center. \n\nSo benzophenone is achiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have a standalone option2, I must have made an error. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nWait, the only possibility that includes option2 is D (1 and2) and A. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option1. Perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, if the biphenyl has substituents that are not symmetrically placed. For instance, maybe the nitro groups are on different positions. \n\nWait, the question states \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\". \n\nThe 6 and 6' positions are the same on each ring. The 2 and 2' are also symmetric. \n\nThus, the substituents are placed symmetrically, leading to a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, no optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option2 only. Since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question includes option4. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually the cis isomer (maleic acid ester). But the name \"fumarate\" specifically refers to the trans isomer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has a chiral center due to the ester groups being in a different configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option2. \n\nWait, the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at carbon2. Yes. So it has optical isomerism. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have that, I must have made a mistake elsewhere. \n\nWait, looking at the options again, optionD is 1 and2. \n\nIf option1 has optical isomerism, then D would be correct. But I thought option1 is a meso compound. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I was wrong about option1. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl compound has chiral centers. \n\nFor example, the substituents are placed in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. \n\nWait, if the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', and the ester groups are on 2 and 2', then the molecule has two planes of symmetry. \n\nWait, the positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other on each ring. So if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, the substituents would align. Hence, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, option1 is not optically active. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options provided, the closest is optionD (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's first compound does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center because the substituents are not placed symmetrically. \n\nWait, the positions 6 and 6' are on both rings. \n\nWait, in biphenyl, the numbering can sometimes be such that the substituents are on different positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro groups are on 6 and 2' or something else. \n\nWait, the name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe 6 and 6' are the substituents on each ring. The 2 and 2' are the ester groups. \n\nSo the substituents are symmetrically placed. \n\nTherefore, the molecule is a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D (1 and2), but I think option1 is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually a different compound where the double bond is part of a ring, allowing a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is D (1 and2), but I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option1 does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, let's think of another approach. \n\nThe question asks which show optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers. \n\nOption2 has a chiral center. \n\nOption1: if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, but according to the name, they are symmetric. \n\nOption4: no chiral center. \n\nThus, only option2. \n\nSince the options don't have that, but the closest is D (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl itself can be in a conformation that creates a chiral center. \n\nWait, biphenyl can have different conformations (s-cis or s-trans), but those are conformational isomers, not stereoisomers. \n\nThe question specifies stereoisomers (optical isomerism requires a chiral center). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center at the point where the two rings are connected? \n\nNo, the connection is a single bond between two carbons (the 1-1' positions). That single bond can rotate freely, so there's no chiral center there. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not listed as a standalone option, perhaps the question has a mistake, but among the given options, the best possible answer is D (1 and2) because I might have made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing that option1 has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has substituents that make it asymmetric. \n\nWait, the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring. Let's say the biphenyl is in a configuration where the nitro groups are on one side and the esters on the other. \n\nBut the numbering implies that the substituents are placed symmetrically. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not an option, I must choose between the given options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question says \"optical isomerism\" which is enantiomers (chiral centers). \n\nOption4: dimethyl fumarate (trans) has no chiral centers. \n\nOption2: has a chiral center. \n\nSo the correct answer is option2. \n\nSince the options don't include it, but looking at the choices, the only one that includes option2 is D (1 and2), but I think option1 is not. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the substituents are not symmetrically placed. \n\nWait, the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring. Position6 is opposite to position2 on each ring. \n\nSo, if you have a biphenyl connected at 1-1', and each has a nitro at 6 and an ester at2, then the substituents are placed symmetrically. \n\nThus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is meso. \n\nTherefore, no optical activity. \n\nThus, the correct answer must be option2 only. \n\nBut since the options don't have that, I might have to choose the closest option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option4. \n\nWait, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the double bond is in a different position. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is trans-but-2-enedioic acid. \n\nIf the double bond were in a different position, but no, the name specifies but-2-en. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the double bond in fumarate allows for geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical. \n\nThus, the only correct option is2, but since it's not available, I must choose the best possible answer. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the answer is D)1 and2, but I think I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option1 has optical isomerism. \n\nWait, if the substituents are placed such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. \n\nSuppose the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring, but the ester groups are on position2 of one ring and position3 of the other. But the name specifies 2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThus, they are on 2 and2', so symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer is D)1 and2, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, if the biphenyl has substituents that make it asymmetric. \n\nWait, the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl plane. \n\nFor example, the nitro groups are on the top of their rings, and the esters are on the bottom. \n\nBut since they are symmetric, flipping the molecule would superimpose. \n\nThus, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question's first option is correct. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center at the point where the rings are connected. \n\nThe single bond between the two rings can rotate, so no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option3. \n\nWait, benzophenone has a central carbon connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. \n\nWait, perhaps the oxygen is part of a chiral center? \n\nNo, the central carbon has two phenyl groups (same), and the oxygen via a double bond. So no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with option D)1 and2, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is option D. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps option1 has a chiral center because the substituents are placed in a way that breaks symmetry. \n\nFor example, if the biphenyl is in a specific conformation that makes the molecule chiral. But conformational isomerism doesn't create optical isomerism unless it's a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center due to the nitro groups and esters being in different orientations. \n\nBut if they are placed symmetrically, it's a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to proceed with the best answer I can. Since option2 is correct and the only other option that includes it is D, I'll choose D. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I think I'm missing something. \n\nWait, option4: dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that the double bond can lead to optical isomerism. \n\nWait, trans double bonds can have geometric isomerism but not optical. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question includes geometric isomerism as optical isomerism, which is incorrect. \n\nIf that's the case, then option4 would have geometric isomerism (but trans is one form), so maybe not. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to choose the answer based on the analysis that option2 is correct. Since the options don't have that, perhaps there's an error, but among the options, the best possible is D (1 and2), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake and option1 does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, another approach: the question asks which show optical isomerism. \n\nOption2 has a chiral center \u2192 yes. \n\nOption4 has no chiral center \u2192 no. \n\nOption1 is meso \u2192 no. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option2. Since none of the options have just option2, perhaps there's a mistake in the options. \n\nBut the closest is D (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option1. \n\nWait, the first compound has two phenyl rings with substituents on both rings. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it would have optical isomerism. \n\nFor example, if the nitro groups are on one ring's position6 and the other's position5, but the name says 6,6'. \n\nThus, they are symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not listed, I'll go with option D, even though I'm unsure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is optionD. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nWait, the question says \"organic moieties\". Maybe \"moiety\" refers to a part of a larger molecule, so maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. \n\nBut the substituents are nitro and ester groups, which are symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is D)1 and2, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is option2 and the options are wrong, but since I must choose, I'll go with D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chiral centers or symmetry considerations:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   - The biphenyl structure has nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2 on both rings.  \n   - Due to symmetric substitution (same groups on both rings), the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   - The molecule contains a chiral center at the second carbon (bonded to CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H).  \n   - **Yes, optical isomerism** due to the chiral center.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**:  \n   - The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an oxygen (double bond).  \n   - No chiral center due to identical substituents on the central carbon.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   - The trans configuration of the double bond in fumarate does not create chiral centers.  \n   - Symmetric arrangement of substituents around the double bond means no chiral centers.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\nThe only compound showing optical isomerism is **option 2**.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Let me think through each option step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, actually, chiral centers are the main thing here. A chiral molecule has at least one stereogenic center, usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, it's chiral and thus shows optical isomerism. Alternatively, if there's a double bond that can't rotate (like in a trans isomer), maybe that's a case too, like in geometric isomerism, but optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers, right?\n\nLet me look at each compound:\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected. The substituents are nitro groups on each benzene ring at position 6, and the dicarboxylate part is at 2 and 2', connected as esters with methyl groups. Let me visualize that. The structure probably has a central biphenyl core with nitro groups on each ring's 6th carbon. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. Since biphenyls can have axes of symmetry, but with substituents, maybe there's a chiral center here? Wait, but the nitro and ester groups are on the biphenyl rings. Unless the biphenyl itself is arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations if the substituents are in different positions. Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetric? The 6 and 6' nitro groups, and the 2 and 2' esters. The positions might be symmetric across the central bond between the two phenyl rings. So maybe this is a meso compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall because of symmetry. That would mean no optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. Wait, the numbering might be such that the nitro groups are on one side. Let me think again. If the nitro groups are on the 6 positions (which are meta to the ester groups?), perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, then when you flip the molecule over, the nitro and ester positions would swap, but since both rings have the same substituents, it might be symmetric. So this could be a meso form, hence no optical isomerism. Or maybe it's chiral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me set that aside for a moment.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) with methanol. The structure would be CH3CO-O-CH(CH2OH) or something? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methanol, the COOH becomes an ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is: the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon. Wait, propanoic acid is three carbons. Let's see: the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The 2-hydroxy is on the middle carbon. The ester would replace the COOH with a methyl ester, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl group is the second carbon, and the ester is on the third. The middle carbon (the hydroxyl carbon) is bonded to: a CH3, a OH, a COOCH3, and a CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 3 (since it's propanoic acid). The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:\n\nCarbon 1: CH3-\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\nCarbon 3: COOCH3\n\nSo carbon 2 has four different groups: CH3 (from carbon 1), OH, a single bond to carbon 3 (which is part of the COOCH3 group), and the hydrogen on carbon 2? Wait, wait. Wait, the carbon chain is:\n\n1: CH3-\n2: CH(OH)-\n3: COOCH3\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to CH3 (carbon 1), to the OH group, to carbon 3 (which is the carbonyl carbon of the ester), and also has a hydrogen. So the four groups around carbon 2 are: CH3, OH, COOCH3 (through a single bond?), and H. Wait, actually, the carbon 2 has four substituents: the CH3 (from carbon 1), the OH, the COOCH3 (through the carbon chain), and a hydrogen. So that's four different groups. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center. Therefore, it should have optical isomers (enantiomers). Unless there's another chiral center that makes it a meso compound. Wait, in this case, there's only one chiral center (carbon 2). So it would have two enantiomers, so optical isomerism. So option 2 is correct.\n\n3. Benzophenone. That's a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to another benzene ring. Structure is (Ph)2CO. The central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and an oxygen. The central carbon is part of a ketone. Let's see if there's a chiral center here. The central carbon is bonded to two different groups: each benzene ring (but they are the same, since both are phenyl groups), the oxygen, and the other side? Wait, the structure is actually a ketone between two phenyl groups. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (as the carbonyl), and a double bond to oxygen. Wait, no. The structure of benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon (the one in the ketone) is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl. But the carbonyl is a double bond to oxygen, so the central carbon has two phenyl groups, and the carbonyl oxygen. So the central carbon has two identical groups (the two phenyl rings), so it can't be a chiral center. So no chiral centers here. So benzophenone is achiral and doesn't have optical isomers. So option 3 is out.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) esterified with methanol. Fumaric acid is trans-2-butenedioic acid. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, the two COOH groups become COOCH3. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The molecule is trans. Now, does this have a chiral center? The double bond in fumarate is in the trans configuration, but the molecule itself isn't chiral. Let me see: each of the two carbonyl groups is on the same side? Wait, in fumarate, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans). The double bond restricts rotation, so the molecule can't rotate into its mirror image. But does it have a chiral center? Let's look at each carbon. The carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) are each bonded to two oxygens (as part of the carboxyl groups) but wait, no. Let's think again. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The carbons at positions 1 and 4 (the ones with the COOH groups) each have a COOH group, a single bond to the next carbon, etc. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons (2 and 3) is connected to two other carbons (except the ends). Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (COOH), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen (since it's trans, maybe the hydrogens are on opposite sides). Wait, actually, the double bond makes the molecule rigid. The carbons in the double bond can't rotate, but for chirality, we need a chiral center. Let me check each carbon:\n\nCarbon 1: bonded to COOH group, carbon 2, and two hydrogens? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic acid, but fumarate is the trans version of butenedioic acid. Wait, maybe I need to correct. Let me see:\n\nFumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Each of the carbons in the double bond (positions 2 and 3) have the following groups:\n\nCarbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (which has a COOH group)\n- The double bond to carbon 3\n- A hydrogen (on the same side as the COOH group of carbon 1?)\n\nWait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) have substituents. Let me think of each carbon's groups.\n\nCarbon 2 has:\n\n- One single bond to C1 (which has a COOH group)\n- The double bond to C3\n- A hydrogen (since the double bond takes two bonds, so the remaining bond is a H)\n- And the other side? Wait, the other side would be the double bond to C3. Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly. The molecule is:\n\nO=C-O-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, fumarate is a trans double bond. Wait, the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The central double bond is between C2 and C3. So for carbon 2:\n\nGroups are:\n\n- COOH (from C1)\n- CH= (the double bond to C3)\n- H (on one side)\n- The other side (the other single bond?) Wait, carbon 2 has two bonds in the double bond, so the remaining bonds are single. Carbon 2 has a single bond to C1 (with COOH), a single bond to a hydrogen (since in trans configuration, the hydrogens might be on opposite sides?), and the double bond to C3. Wait, actually, each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond. For C2:\n\nSubstituents: COOH (from C1), a hydrogen, and the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think of each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3):\n\nCarbon 2:\n\n- Attached to:\n\n   - The COOH group (from C1)\n   - A hydrogen (since in trans, the hydrogens are on opposite sides)\n   - The double bond to C3.\n\nCarbon 3:\n\n- Attached to:\n\n   - The COOH group (on C4)\n   - A hydrogen (on the opposite side from C2's H)\n   - The double bond to C2.\n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents. The double bond carbons each have two groups. For example, carbon 2 has COOH (from C1) and a H. But since the double bond is between them, they can't rotate. So the molecule is planar around the double bond. But in terms of chirality, there's no chiral center here. Because each of the double bond carbons only have two different groups. Wait, for example, carbon 2 has the COOH group (which is a -COOH) and a H. The other side is the double bond. Wait, perhaps the actual groups are:\n\nWait, perhaps the carbons in the double bond have substituents. Let me think again. The structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The carbons at positions 2 and 3 (the double bond carbons) each have a hydrogen and a COOH group on the adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe each of those carbons has two substituents. For example, carbon 2 is connected to the COOH (from C1), a hydrogen, and the double bond. Wait, but the double bond is with carbon 3. So the substituents on carbon 2 are:\n\n- The COOH group (attached to C1, which is adjacent to C2)\n- A hydrogen (since the other single bond is to H)\n- The double bond to C3.\n\nSo the groups around carbon 2 are COOH (from C1), H, and the double bond. Similarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- The COOH on C4 (the next carbon)\n- A hydrogen (on the opposite side)\n- The double bond to C2.\n\nTherefore, each of these carbons (2 and 3) only have two different groups (the COOH and H). Wait, but the double bond is part of the carbon's structure. Wait, maybe I'm not considering all the substituents properly. Let's think of each carbon's groups. For carbon 2:\n\n- The two bonds in the double bond (so it's part of the C=C)\n- The single bond to the adjacent carbon (C1, which has the COOH)\n- A single bond to a hydrogen.\n\nSo the groups attached to carbon 2 are: COOH (via C1), H, and the double bond. The double bond is between C2 and C3, so that's a bond, not a substituent. Wait, substituents are atoms or groups bonded to the carbon. So the substituents on carbon 2 are the COOH (from C1), the H, and the two bonds in the double bond (but those are part of the structure, not substituents). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach. \n\nIn a double bond, each carbon has two substituents besides the double bond. For example, in CH2=CH2, each C has two H's. In fumarate, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents on each are:\n\nCarbon 2 has a -COOH group attached (since C1 is COOH) and a H. The other substituent is the double bond, which is part of the structure. Wait, substituents are the atoms or groups directly attached. So for carbon 2, the substituents are:\n\n- The COOH (from C1)\n- A H\n- The double bond to C3 (but that's a bond, not a substituent)\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: the molecule has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Each of these carbons has two other substituents. For carbon 2, the other substituents are the COOH (on C1) and a H. For carbon 3, it's the COOH (on C4) and a H. Since the two H's are on opposite sides (trans configuration), the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, so it has geometric isomerism (cis vs trans). But geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Since there are no chiral centers here (each double bond carbon only has two different substituents, but that's not enough for chirality), the molecule is not chiral. Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, can that lead to chirality? No, unless there are four different groups around a central carbon. Here, each double bond carbon only has two different substituents (COOH and H), so they can't be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (the ester form) would still have the same structure as fumaric acid but with the COOH groups as esters. So the double bond remains, and there's no chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers (chiral centers). So fumarate (trans) doesn't have chiral centers. However, if the molecule had a chiral center, then it would. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let's see. If the molecule were in the cis form, then maybe there's a chiral center. Wait, no. For example, maleic acid (cis) has a trans isomer (fumaric). But maleic acid (cis) can have a chiral center? Wait no. Wait, let me think of the structure again. If the two COOH groups are on the same side (cis), then the molecule is still planar, but maybe there's a chiral center. Wait, no. The double bond carbons still only have two substituents each. Wait, in the case of maleic acid (cis), the structure is HOOC-CH(\u2014CH2\u2014?) No, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the COOH groups on the same side. The double bond carbons (C2 and C3) each have substituents: on C2, the COOH (from C1) and a H (same side as the other COOH?), but arranged cis. But even then, each of the double bond carbons only have two substituents. Therefore, no chiral centers. So neither cis nor trans forms have chiral centers. So fumarate (trans) doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but wait, maybe the ester form (dimethyl fumarate) has some other groups. Let me see. The dimethyl ester would replace both COOH groups with OMe (methoxy). So the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. The central double bond is still between the two carbons. Each of those carbons still has two substituents (the OMe groups on either end and the H's). So still no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate does not have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, so option 4 is out. \n\nNow, looking back at option 1 again. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me parse that. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The 6 and 6' positions (on each ring) have nitro groups. The 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups, which are esterified with methyl. \n\nLet me try to visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1' (since it's 1,1'-biphenyl). \n\nSo the positions are numbered such that the two rings are connected at the 1-1' positions. Then on each ring, the 2 and 6 positions are substituted. Let me consider the biphenyl structure. \n\nIf the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of both rings, and the esters on the 2 positions. Let's see if there's a plane of symmetry. Since both rings are substituted similarly, the molecule might be symmetric. For example, if you flip the molecule over the central axis between the two phenyl rings, the nitro groups and esters would swap positions but since both rings are the same, the molecule would look the same. So this would be a meso compound. Therefore, even if there are chiral centers, the molecule as a whole is achiral because of the symmetry. Hence, it doesn't show optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement of substituents makes it chiral. Let me think again. Suppose the two rings are connected at the 1-1' positions. The 2 and 6 positions on each ring: \n\nOn the first ring (left), position 2 has an ester, position 6 has a nitro. The second ring (right) has the same. When looking at the molecule, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl axis, then flipping the molecule would superimpose the mirror image. Therefore, no optical activity. \n\nSo option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the compounds that show optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) because of the chiral center, and maybe option 4? Wait, no, I thought option 4 didn't. Wait, the question options are A)1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2. \n\nWait, but I thought option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) doesn't have optical isomerism. So the correct ones are 2 and maybe another. Wait, let me recheck option 4 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with fumarate. Let me think again. \n\nFumarate is the trans form. The molecule itself is not chiral. However, when esterified, does it form a chiral center? No, because the ester groups are on both ends, so the symmetry remains. Wait, but if the fumarate is part of a different structure where a chiral center exists... No, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure would still have the same symmetry as fumaric acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the possibility of geometric isomerism, but the question specifically asks for optical isomerism (enantiomers). \n\nSo the only one that has a chiral center is option 2. \n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2 and 3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have a choice with only 2. The options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (2,3), D (1,2). So none of these include only option 2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I missed another chiral center. Let me re-examine option 4 again. \n\nWait, dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is trans, then it's not chiral. But what if the molecule has a chiral center? Wait, perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. The carbons adjacent to the double bond each have an ester group on one side and a hydrogen on the other. Let me look at each carbon:\n\nThe carbons attached to the ester groups (the end carbons) each have two methyl ester groups (or wait, each end has an ester group). The central two carbons (with the double bond) have:\n\nCarbon 2 (left of double bond):\n\n- Attached to OMe (via the ester)\n- A double bond to carbon 3\n- A hydrogen (since it's trans, the hydrogens are on opposite sides)\n- The other bond is to the next carbon? Wait, no. The structure is OMe-O-C(=O)? Wait, no. Wait, the fumaric acid is butenedioic acid. The esterification would replace each COOH with an OMe group. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try again. \n\nOriginal fumaric acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. \n\nEsterifying both COOH groups with methanol gives OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, but actually, each COOH becomes an ester, so the structure would be:\n\nCH2(OOCR)\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2(OOCR), where R is methyl. Wait, no. Let me see: the two carboxylic acids are on each end. So the esterified form would be:\n\nOOCR\u2013CH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2\u2013OOCR. Wait, no. Wait, the original structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each COOH is on the end. So after esterification with methanol (MeOH), the two COOH groups become OMe groups. So the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, but that would be the ester groups attached to the end carbons. \n\nEach end carbon (the ones with the original COOH) now has an OMe group. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. So the structure is:\n\nOMe-O-C(=O)\u2013? No, wait, maybe it's OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe? No, perhaps I'm not getting the connectivity right. Let me think of the fumarate structure as:\n\nThe two ends (carbons 1 and 4) have the ester groups. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of those central carbons has a hydrogen and the double bond. \n\nSo each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents. The end carbons (1 and 4) each have an ester group (OMe) and a single bond to carbon 2 or 3. \n\nLooking at carbon 1: connected to OMe, carbon 2, and two hydrogens? Wait, carbon 1 (the first carbon) is part of the CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is OMe-O-C-CH=CH-C-O-OMe. Wait, perhaps each end is:\n\nThe first carbon (left end) has the OMe group attached via an ester (so -O-C(=O)-?), no. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe two COOH groups are each esterified to methanol, so the structure is OMe-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct structure of fumaric acid ester is:\n\nEach of the two carboxylic acid groups (on carbons 1 and 4 of the butenedioic acid) are converted to esters. So the structure would be OMe-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate. The IUPAC name would be dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The structure is OMe-O-C(=O)-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-OMe. Wait, yes! Oh, I see my mistake. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, but the carbonyl groups are part of the esters. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified with methanol, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nHOOC becomes COOCH3, so the entire molecule is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the central double bond is between the two CH groups. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no. Wait, the actual structure is:\n\nThe molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:\n\nOOCCH3\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3. \n\nWait, the two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4. The central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the central carbons (2 and 3) has substituents: \n\nCarbon 2: attached to COOCH3 (on carbon 1?), no. Wait, let's write it properly. \n\nStructure:\n\nCarbon 1: CH2(COOCH3) \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe correct structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, that would be a different structure. Wait, the original fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester form would replace each COOH with OOCR (R = methyl). So:\n\nCarbon 1: -COOCH3 \n\nCarbon 2: CH= \n\nCarbon 3: CH \n\nCarbon 4: -COOCH3 \n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would have a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, the actual correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the ends. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So:\n\nThe molecule is (COOCH3)2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule has two ester groups on each end, connected by a central double bond. So the structure is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nYes, that's right. So the molecule is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on carbons 1 and 4 (the ends), with the central double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the central carbons (2 and 3) has a single bond to one ester group and a double bond between them. \n\nNow, looking at each carbon's substituents:\n\nCarbon 1: connected to COOCH3 and carbon 2. It has two hydrogens? Wait, carbon 1 is part of the CH2 group? No. Wait, carbon 1 is bonded to the ester group (COOCH3) and to carbon 2. The other bonds are H and another H? Because the molecule is OOCCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. So carbon 1 is CH2 (with the COOCH3 group). Wait, let me clarify:\n\nStructure: \n\nThe molecule is:\n\nOOCCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. When esterified, they become COOCH3. So the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3?\n\nWait, that would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Then carbon 1 is CH2 (with a COOCH3 group and two H's?), and carbon 4 similarly. \n\nIn that case, each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have:\n\nCarbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (CH2), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon 3: connected to carbon 4 (CH2), the double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. \n\nSo each of these carbons (2 and 3) have two substituents: the CH2 group (with the ester) and a hydrogen. Since the molecule is trans (as fumarate is the trans isomer), the hydrogens are on opposite sides. \n\nTherefore, each central carbon has two different groups (the CH2 and H), but since they are part of a double bond, there's no chiral center here. So the molecule is not chiral. \n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate (option4) does not have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the only correct option is 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). But looking at the options given, none of them have just option 2. The options are A)1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2 and 3; D)1 and 2. \n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about option 1. \n\nOption1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe biphenyl is 1,1'- connected. Each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. \n\nLet me try to imagine the numbering. In biphenyl systems, the positions are numbered such that the first ring is the left one, and the prime (') denotes the second ring. \n\nSo for each ring:\n\nOn the first ring (left), position 1 is attached to the second ring. Position 2 is next to it, and position 6 is the one opposite to position 2 (since in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are arranged in order). So the nitro groups are on position 6 of each ring. \n\nThe carboxylate esters are on position 2 of each ring. \n\nNow, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or is a meso compound. \n\nThe molecule has two phenyl rings connected at 1-1', each with substituents at 2 and 6. The substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions. Let's see if there is a plane of symmetry. \n\nIf you imagine the biphenyl structure, with the two rings connected at positions 1 and 1', and each has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. \n\nThe positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other on each ring. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. \n\nIf you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis perpendicular to the biphenyl plane and through the central bond, the substituents would swap places but since each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would look the same. Hence, it has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism. \n\nSo option1 is out. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. But the options given don't have a choice with only option2. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nWait, the only possible correct answer is D (1 and 2), but I thought option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually a different structure where a chiral center exists. \n\nWait, maybe the fumarate is part of a ring or another structure. Or maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Let me check dimethyl fumarate's structure again. \n\nLooking up in my mind, fumaric acid is trans butenedioic acid. Its dimethyl ester would have the structure (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:\n\nOOC(CH2)\u2013CH=CH\u2013COOCH3? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. The correct structure is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the two end carbons of the four-carbon chain. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCOOCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, that's four carbons:\n\nCarbon1: COOCH3\n\nCarbon2: CH2- (no, wait, Carbon1 is connected to Carbon2 via a single bond?)\n\nWait, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nThe molecule is OOCCH2\u2013CH=CH\u2013CH2COOCH3. \n\nIn that case, each of the central carbons (2 and 3) have:\n\nCarbon2: connected to Carbon1 (CH2), the double bond to C3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon3: connected to Carbon4 (CH2), double bond to C2, and a hydrogen. \n\nAgain, each of these carbons has two substituents (the CH2 and H). The molecule is symmetric because it's trans. So no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the ester groups are on different sides leading to a chiral center? No, the ester groups are on the ends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option4 is referring to the possibility that the double bond is in a different position that allows a chiral center. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the molecule has a chiral center when esterified. Wait, the ester groups are on the ends, so no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option2. Let me recheck option2 again. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. \n\nThe structure is:\n\nThe molecule has a chiral center at the second carbon. Let me confirm:\n\nCarbon1: CH3-\n\nCarbon2: CH(OH)-\n\nCarbon3: COOCH3\n\nThe second carbon (position2) is connected to:\n\n- CH3 (from carbon1),\n\n- OH,\n\n- COOCH3 (the ester group on carbon3),\n\n- and a hydrogen (since it's a carbon with four bonds). \n\nYes, that's four different groups. So this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has two enantiomers. So option2 definitely has optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct options are 2. But looking at the given options, the only one that includes option2 is options A, C, D. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1,2,4\n\nB)3,4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and 2\n\nSo the only possible answer that includes option2 is D (1 and 2), but I thought option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake with option1. Let me think again. \n\nOption1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nWait, maybe the numbering is different. Suppose the substituents are not symmetrically placed. \n\nWait, perhaps the two rings are connected at 1-1', and the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', but the carboxylate esters are on 2 and 2'. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. Let me think: \n\nIn biphenyl systems, the numbering can sometimes lead to different possibilities. Let's say the first ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, and the second ring has substituents at 2' and 6'. \n\nThe key is whether the arrangement makes the molecule symmetric. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl is in a configuration where the substituents are placed such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. \n\nWait, but if the substituents are in the same positions on both rings, then flipping the molecule over the central axis would superimpose the mirror image. Hence, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, the molecule is achiral. \n\nTherefore, option1 doesn't have optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct answer must be D (1 and 2) but that would include option1 which I don't think has optical isomerism. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center due to the way the rings are connected. But biphenyl itself is a rigid structure but without a chiral center unless there are substituents making it asymmetric. \n\nWait, but in this case, the substituents are symmetrically placed, so it's a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question includes option4. \n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the ester groups are placed in a way that creates asymmetry. \n\nWait, but the structure is symmetrical. The two ester groups are on opposite ends, and the double bond is in the middle. The molecule is symmetric. \n\nSo no, no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that the double bond in fumarate allows for geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center. \n\nSo the only correct answer is option2, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, the options are A, B, C, D. The options given are:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with option3. Benzophenone. \n\nBenzophenone is (Ph)2CO. Does that have a chiral center? \n\nThe central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl. The central carbon has four groups: two phenyl groups (same), a double bond to oxygen (which is part of the carbonyl), and another oxygen? Wait, no. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. The fourth bond is the double bond to oxygen. \n\nWait, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, and the carbonyl group (which includes the double bond to O). So the four groups around the central carbon are: two phenyl groups (same), the double bond to O, and the other side? Wait, no. The carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one to the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond). Wait, that's three bonds. Wait, no, the structure is:\n\nThe central carbon is in the ketone. So:\n\nPh- C=O -Ph?\n\nNo, benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. The fourth bond is the double bond between the central carbon and oxygen. \n\nWait, the central carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. \n\nAh, right. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen via double bond, and a single bond to another oxygen? No. Wait, no, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, a double bond to oxygen, and the fourth bond is the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the central carbon has four bonds: two single bonds to the phenyl groups, and a double bond to the oxygen. So the groups around the central carbon are two phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen. Since the two phenyl groups are the same, the central carbon has two identical groups, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral. \n\nSo option3 is out. \n\nHmm. So the only correct option is option2. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, the options are given as:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nWait, maybe the question includes option4 for some reason. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. \n\nWait, let's think of another possibility. Maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center if the ester groups are placed in a different way. \n\nWait, perhaps the ester groups are on adjacent carbons? No, the structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. For instance, if one ester is on the left and the other is on a different position. But no, according to the name, it's dimethyl fumarate, which should have both COOH groups esterified. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's option4 is actually referring to maleic acid (the cis form), which can have a chiral center? Wait no, maleic acid (cis) has a central double bond with the two COOH groups on the same side. But that still doesn't create a chiral center because the central carbons still have two substituents each. \n\nWait, unless there's a third substituent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a different configuration where a chiral center exists. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is wrong, but I should stick to my analysis. \n\nGiven that option2 is correct and the others are not, but the options don't have a choice with only option2, I must have made an error somewhere. \n\nWait, let me recheck option1 again. \n\nThe first compound has the formula dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe positions 2 and 2' have the carboxylate groups (which are esterified with methyl), and positions 6 and 6' have nitro groups. \n\nThe biphenyl is connected at 1-1'. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. \n\nWait, perhaps the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the biphenyl plane, but the ester groups are on the opposite side. \n\nWait, but the numbering would require that. \n\nAlternatively, the positions 2 and 2' are on the same side of the biphenyl, and the nitro groups at 6 and 6' are also on the same side. \n\nBut the key is whether there's a plane of symmetry. \n\nSuppose the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two rings and their substituents. For example, imagine looking at the biphenyl along the axis connecting the two phenyl rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso. \n\nTherefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. \n\nSo option1 is not optically active. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have a single answer, perhaps I made a mistake in another option. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question says \"show optical isomerism\". \n\nWait, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the substituents are different. \n\nWait, the structure is OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? \n\nWait, no, the correct structure is:\n\nThe two ends are COOCH3 and COOCH3. The central double bond is between the two middle carbons. \n\nWait, if the molecule is actually:\n\nPh-CH(OH)-COOCH3 or something else? No, that's option2. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that the double bond in fumarate can lead to a chiral center when combined with other groups. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has geometric isomerism (cis and trans) as optical isomers. But geometric isomers are not optical isomers unless they have a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option4. Let me look up the structure of dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, I can't actually look it up, but I'll think again. \n\nFumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. Its dimethyl ester would be (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:\n\nThe two ester groups are on the two end carbons of the four-carbon chain. The double bond is between the second and third carbons. \n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Since it's the trans isomer, the groups are opposite, so the molecule is symmetric. Hence, no chiral center. \n\nTherefore, option4 is out. \n\nSo the only correct answer is option2, but since none of the options include only that, perhaps I made a mistake with option3 or something else. \n\nWait, option3 is benzophenone. \n\nWait, maybe benzophenone has a chiral center. Let me think again. \n\nBenzophenone's structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and the carbonyl. The four groups around the central carbon are two phenyl groups (same), the carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another bond? \n\nWait, the central carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, a double bond to the oxygen, and the fourth bond is to the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the central carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen. That's three bonds, but carbon must have four. \n\nAh! Wait, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, the oxygen via a double bond, and what's the fourth bond? \n\nThe central carbon must have four bonds. The structure is actually:\n\nPh- C(=O)-Ph. So the carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, an oxygen via a double bond, and the fourth bond is to another oxygen? No, no. \n\nWait, the central carbon has four bonds: two to the phenyl groups, one double bond to oxygen, and the fourth bond is the other side of the double bond. \n\nWait, the carbon has two single bonds to the phenyl groups, and a double bond to the oxygen. The double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond. The carbon has four bonds: two single (to phenyl), and two from the double bond (one sigma, one pi). \n\nTherefore, the four groups around the central carbon are: two phenyl groups and the double bond to oxygen. Since two groups are the same (the phenyl groups), the central carbon is not a chiral center. \n\nSo benzophenone is achiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have a standalone option2, I must have made an error. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1,2 and4\n\nB)3 and4\n\nC)2 and3\n\nD)1 and2\n\nWait, the only possibility that includes option2 is D (1 and2) and A. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option1. Perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, if the biphenyl has substituents that are not symmetrically placed. For instance, maybe the nitro groups are on different positions. \n\nWait, the question states \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\". \n\nThe 6 and 6' positions are the same on each ring. The 2 and 2' are also symmetric. \n\nThus, the substituents are placed symmetrically, leading to a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, no optical isomerism. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option2 only. Since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question includes option4. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually the cis isomer (maleic acid ester). But the name \"fumarate\" specifically refers to the trans isomer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has a chiral center due to the ester groups being in a different configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's options are wrong. But I have to choose from the given options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option2. \n\nWait, the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center at carbon2. Yes. So it has optical isomerism. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option2. Since the options don't have that, I must have made a mistake elsewhere. \n\nWait, looking at the options again, optionD is 1 and2. \n\nIf option1 has optical isomerism, then D would be correct. But I thought option1 is a meso compound. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I was wrong about option1. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl compound has chiral centers. \n\nFor example, the substituents are placed in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. \n\nWait, if the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', and the ester groups are on 2 and 2', then the molecule has two planes of symmetry. \n\nWait, the positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other on each ring. So if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, the substituents would align. Hence, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, option1 is not optically active. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options provided, the closest is optionD (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's first compound does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center because the substituents are not placed symmetrically. \n\nWait, the positions 6 and 6' are on both rings. \n\nWait, in biphenyl, the numbering can sometimes be such that the substituents are on different positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the nitro groups are on 6 and 2' or something else. \n\nWait, the name is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThe 6 and 6' are the substituents on each ring. The 2 and 2' are the ester groups. \n\nSo the substituents are symmetrically placed. \n\nTherefore, the molecule is a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D (1 and2), but I think option1 is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the dimethyl fumarate is actually a different compound where the double bond is part of a ring, allowing a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is D (1 and2), but I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option1 does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, let's think of another approach. \n\nThe question asks which show optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers. \n\nOption2 has a chiral center. \n\nOption1: if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, but according to the name, they are symmetric. \n\nOption4: no chiral center. \n\nThus, only option2. \n\nSince the options don't have that, but the closest is D (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl itself can be in a conformation that creates a chiral center. \n\nWait, biphenyl can have different conformations (s-cis or s-trans), but those are conformational isomers, not stereoisomers. \n\nThe question specifies stereoisomers (optical isomerism requires a chiral center). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center at the point where the two rings are connected? \n\nNo, the connection is a single bond between two carbons (the 1-1' positions). That single bond can rotate freely, so there's no chiral center there. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not listed as a standalone option, perhaps the question has a mistake, but among the given options, the best possible answer is D (1 and2) because I might have made a mistake with option1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing that option1 has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has substituents that make it asymmetric. \n\nWait, the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring. Let's say the biphenyl is in a configuration where the nitro groups are on one side and the esters on the other. \n\nBut the numbering implies that the substituents are placed symmetrically. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not an option, I must choose between the given options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question says \"optical isomerism\" which is enantiomers (chiral centers). \n\nOption4: dimethyl fumarate (trans) has no chiral centers. \n\nOption2: has a chiral center. \n\nSo the correct answer is option2. \n\nSince the options don't include it, but looking at the choices, the only one that includes option2 is D (1 and2), but I think option1 is not. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the substituents are not symmetrically placed. \n\nWait, the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring. Position6 is opposite to position2 on each ring. \n\nSo, if you have a biphenyl connected at 1-1', and each has a nitro at 6 and an ester at2, then the substituents are placed symmetrically. \n\nThus, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is meso. \n\nTherefore, no optical activity. \n\nThus, the correct answer must be option2 only. \n\nBut since the options don't have that, I might have to choose the closest option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option4. \n\nWait, maybe the dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center when the double bond is in a different position. \n\nWait, fumaric acid is trans-but-2-enedioic acid. \n\nIf the double bond were in a different position, but no, the name specifies but-2-en. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the double bond in fumarate allows for geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical. \n\nThus, the only correct option is2, but since it's not available, I must choose the best possible answer. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the answer is D)1 and2, but I think I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option1 has optical isomerism. \n\nWait, if the substituents are placed such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. \n\nSuppose the nitro groups are on position6 of each ring, but the ester groups are on position2 of one ring and position3 of the other. But the name specifies 2,2'-dicarboxylate. \n\nThus, they are on 2 and2', so symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer is D)1 and2, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, if the biphenyl has substituents that make it asymmetric. \n\nWait, the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl plane. \n\nFor example, the nitro groups are on the top of their rings, and the esters are on the bottom. \n\nBut since they are symmetric, flipping the molecule would superimpose. \n\nThus, it's a meso compound. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question's first option is correct. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center at the point where the rings are connected. \n\nThe single bond between the two rings can rotate, so no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option3. \n\nWait, benzophenone has a central carbon connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. \n\nWait, perhaps the oxygen is part of a chiral center? \n\nNo, the central carbon has two phenyl groups (same), and the oxygen via a double bond. So no chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with option D)1 and2, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is option D. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps option1 has a chiral center because the substituents are placed in a way that breaks symmetry. \n\nFor example, if the biphenyl is in a specific conformation that makes the molecule chiral. But conformational isomerism doesn't create optical isomerism unless it's a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center due to the nitro groups and esters being in different orientations. \n\nBut if they are placed symmetrically, it's a meso compound. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to proceed with the best answer I can. Since option2 is correct and the only other option that includes it is D, I'll choose D. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I think I'm missing something. \n\nWait, option4: dimethyl fumarate. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that the double bond can lead to optical isomerism. \n\nWait, trans double bonds can have geometric isomerism but not optical. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question includes geometric isomerism as optical isomerism, which is incorrect. \n\nIf that's the case, then option4 would have geometric isomerism (but trans is one form), so maybe not. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to choose the answer based on the analysis that option2 is correct. Since the options don't have that, perhaps there's an error, but among the options, the best possible is D (1 and2), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake and option1 does have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, another approach: the question asks which show optical isomerism. \n\nOption2 has a chiral center \u2192 yes. \n\nOption4 has no chiral center \u2192 no. \n\nOption1 is meso \u2192 no. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option2. Since none of the options have just option2, perhaps there's a mistake in the options. \n\nBut the closest is D (1 and2), but I think that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option1. \n\nWait, the first compound has two phenyl rings with substituents on both rings. \n\nIf the substituents are placed such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it would have optical isomerism. \n\nFor example, if the nitro groups are on one ring's position6 and the other's position5, but the name says 6,6'. \n\nThus, they are symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the correct answer is option2, but since it's not listed, I'll go with option D, even though I'm unsure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is optionD. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with option1. \n\nWait, the question says \"organic moieties\". Maybe \"moiety\" refers to a part of a larger molecule, so maybe there's a chiral center in the substituent. \n\nBut the substituents are nitro and ester groups, which are symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is D)1 and2, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is option2 and the options are wrong, but since I must choose, I'll go with D.\n\n\nTo determine which compounds show optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chiral centers or symmetry considerations:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   - The biphenyl structure has nitro groups at positions 6 and ester groups at positions 2 on both rings.  \n   - Due to symmetric substitution (same groups on both rings), the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   - The molecule contains a chiral center at the second carbon (bonded to CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H).  \n   - **Yes, optical isomerism** due to the chiral center.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**:  \n   - The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an oxygen (double bond).  \n   - No chiral center due to identical substituents on the central carbon.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   - The trans configuration of the double bond in fumarate does not create chiral centers.  \n   - Symmetric arrangement of substituents around the double bond means no chiral centers.  \n   - **No optical isomerism**.\n\nThe only compound showing optical isomerism is **option 2**. However, since the given options do not include a standalone option for 2, the closest choice that includes 2 is **D (1 and 2)**. Despite uncertainty about option 1, the analysis concludes that **option 2** is correct, but the best available answer from the options provided is:\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism requires. Optical isomers, which are a type of stereoisomer, are enantiomers that have chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, they can also exist due to restricted rotation around a double bond, leading to cis-trans isomerism, but that's a different type of stereoisomerism. Wait, but cis-trans isomers are also a kind of stereoisomer, but they don't have optical activity unless they form enantiomers? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nFirst, let's go through each compound one by one.\n\nStarting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The name is a bit complex. Let me parse it. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The positions 6 and 6' have nitro groups, and positions 2 and 2' have dicarboxylate groups which are esterified with methyl. The structure would have two benzene rings linked. Now, does this have a chiral center? Since the biphenyl is connected via a single bond, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry? Wait, but if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, maybe not. Let me think. The nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. Let's imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring's 6 position would be opposite the connecting bond. If both nitro groups are on the same side (like both on the upper part of each ring when viewed in a certain way), but since they are on the 6 positions, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the dicarboxylate groups (as esters) on positions 2 and 2' might introduce asymmetry. Wait, the dicarboxylate would be on each ring's 2 position. The methyl esters would be attached there. So maybe each ring's 2 position has a -O-C(O)OCH3 group. Let me see: if the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring might be arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. However, without a chiral center, optical isomerism would not occur. Alternatively, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, the ester groups are on the carboxylate carbons, which are each attached to an oxygen, a methyl, and two other substituents. Let me check the structure again. The 2,2'-dicarboxylate would mean that each carboxyl group is on the 2 position of each benzene ring. The carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl, so each would be -O-C(O)OCH3. The carbon in the ester group (the carbonyl carbon) is bonded to two oxygen atoms, a methyl, and the aromatic ring. Since oxygen is bonded twice, that carbon can't be a chiral center. So maybe the chiral centers are elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl itself has a chiral center? No, biphenyls connected via a single bond can rotate freely, so they can't have chiral centers. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, maybe the molecule could be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on different positions in a way that creates an asymmetric arrangement. Wait, the nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. Since the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', the 6 and 6' are on the opposite side of each ring. So, perhaps the arrangement is symmetrical. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe this compound has a chiral center or not. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If so, it would not be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. The two rings are connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are each on the same position relative to the connection. The dicarboxylate groups are at 2 and 2'. Each of those positions on their respective rings would be in the same direction. So the substituents on each ring are mirror images across the plane between the rings. Therefore, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nMoving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the carboxylic acid derivative. The structure is: the carboxylic acid is on the propane chain. The 2-hydroxypropanoate is like a 3-carbon chain: the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the hydroxyl is at position 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3 (since it's methyl ester). Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be: the parent chain is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Yes, that's correct. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is: the central carbon (second carbon in the chain) has a hydroxyl, a methyl (from the first carbon), a carbonyl oxygen (from the COOCH3 group), and the next carbon (third) is the COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to: the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (which is the COO group), the hydroxyl, and the hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon in propanoate is the CH(OH) group. Let me draw it out mentally. The structure would be:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) has four groups: CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no. Wait, the second carbon is attached to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), the hydroxyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, the second carbon in propanoic acid (the middle carbon) has two single bonds: to the first carbon (CH3) and to the third carbon (which is the COOH group). So in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So when it's the ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) has bonds to: CH3 (the first carbon?), no, actually the first carbon is CH2? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure again. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon (the CH2 group becomes CH(OH)). So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up numbering. Let me think again. The carboxylic acid is the third carbon. The 2-position is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methyl, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl), its four substituents are: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, the COOCH3 group (through the third carbon), and a hydrogen? Wait, no, the second carbon has two bonds to the adjacent carbons. Let me see: the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon), the hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen. So the four groups are: CH3, H, OH, and the adjacent carbonyl carbon (the third carbon). Wait, the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, so the second carbon is connected to that. So the four groups on the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) are: CH3 (from first carbon), H, OH, and the third carbon (which is connected to the COOCH3). Therefore, that carbon has four different substituents: CH3, H, OH, and the rest of the molecule (the COOCH3 part). Wait, but the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group. So the substituents on the second carbon are: CH3 (from the first carbon), a hydrogen, OH, and the adjacent carbon (which is bonded to the carbonyl group and the ester). Since all four groups are different, that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound should have optical isomerism. So option 2 does show optical isomerism. \n\nMoving to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a ketone where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. The carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Since the carbonyl carbon has two identical groups (the two phenyls), it can't be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not have optical isomerism. \n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, with the structure HO2C-CH=CH-CH2COOH. The fumarate ester would have both carboxylic acids esterified. So dimethyl fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-CH2-COOMe. Wait, actually, fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is trans- butenedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The dimethyl ester would replace both carboxylic acids with methyl groups, so O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends are esterified. So it's O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, wait, dimethyl would mean both are methyl. So it's O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, actually, each carboxylic acid group becomes an ester. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two ends: both carboxyl groups become esters with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid's structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, both ends become COOCH3. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. Wait, the correct structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends are methyl esters. So it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the central part is CH2? Wait, no, the fumaric acid structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So when converted to dimethyl ester, it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends. Wait, each carboxylic acid is replaced by a methyl ester. So the two ends would be OOCCH2? No, the correct structure is (OOC)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. So each COOH becomes -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but there are two COOH groups. The correct structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would only esterify one. Wait, perhaps it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, the original structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each carboxyl group (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So the dimethyl fumarate would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that can't be right because there are two COOH groups. Wait, maybe the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be only one ester. Wait, perhaps the structure is (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of fumaric acid as HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would have both carboxyl groups esterified with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have one ester and one acid. Wait, no. Wait, the two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So each is replaced by COOCH3. The structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. So the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that still leaves one as an acid. Wait, perhaps it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, that would be if the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be maleic acid's structure (cis) but fumaric is trans. Wait, the confusion arises because I'm mixing cis and trans. The fumarate is the trans isomer. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the dimethyl ester would have both ends as methyl esters. So the structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 where the first COOH is esterified to OOC- (wait, no). Let me think again. Each of the two COOH groups (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So carbon 1's COOH becomes COOCH3, and carbon 4's COOH also becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me write it as OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but the carbon chain would be HOOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOH for fumaric acid, but that can't be right because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the two COOH groups on carbons 1 and 4). Therefore, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would be OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not. Wait, maybe the structure is (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as having the two ester groups on either end. So the molecule would have the structure: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that can't be, because that would only have one ester. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of it as the two carboxyl groups are on each end of the chain. So, for fumaric acid (trans), the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid when cis. Wait, no. The correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So, the four-carbon chain? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is actually three carbons: the two COOH groups are on the ends. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. That's three carbons in total. The first carbon is the COOH, then a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the third carbon is the other COOH. Wait, no, that would make it three carbons with a double bond between 2 and 3. So the first carbon is the COOH (carbonyl group?), no. Let me get this straight: fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Let me use IUPAC nomenclature. The formula is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So four atoms in the chain? Wait, no. The molecule has four carbon atoms? Let me think: the formula for fumaric acid is C4H4O4. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. That's four carbons: the first is the COOH (carbon 1), then a carbon (carbon 2) connected to carbon 1 and the double bond to carbon 3, and carbon 3 connected to carbon 2 (double bond) and carbon 4 (another COOH). So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, each COOH is on carbons 1 and 4. So when converted to dimethyl ester, both COOH groups become COOCH3. The structure becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would be only three carbons. Wait, the first COOH (carbon 1) becomes OOC- (but as an ester, it would be OOC-CH2? No. Let me think again. The structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: -COOH (originally), becomes -COOCH3.\n\nCarbon 2: CH connected to carbons 1 and 3 via double bond.\n\nCarbon 3: CH connected to carbons 2 (double bond) and 4.\n\nCarbon 4: -COOH becomes -COOCH3.\n\nTherefore, the dimethyl fumarate would have the structure OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that's three carbons? Wait, no, carbons 1 to 4. Wait, the carbons are arranged as:\n\n1: COOCH3\n\n2: CH2 (but with a double bond to carbon 3?)\n\nNo, sorry, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be if it were a single bond. Since it's a double bond between 2 and 3, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that's only three carbons? Wait, no. Let me write it as OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. That would be four carbons: the first is the COOCH3 (carbon 1), then a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the fourth is the other COOCH3. Wait, no, the carbons are arranged as:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (originally COOH)\n\nCarbon 2: CH connected to carbon 1 and double bonded to carbon 3.\n\nCarbon 3: CH connected to carbon 2 (double bond) and carbon 4.\n\nCarbon 4: COOCH3 (originally COOH)\n\nSo the full structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would be three carbons between the two COO groups. Hmm, perhaps that's correct. Now, the question is whether this compound has optical isomerism. Since fumaric acid is a trans isomer, its ester would also be trans. However, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me see: the structure OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but if both ends are the same, then there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in the dimethyl fumarate, both ends are methyl esters. Wait, no. Wait, in the original fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are the same, so when converted to methyl esters, both are OOC-CH2? No, the groups are the same. So the molecule would be symmetrical. For example, if the two ends are both OOCCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence it's achiral and does not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, the substituents on each side of the double bond must be considered. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The groups on either side are: on one side (carbon 1) is COOCH3, and on the other side (carbon 4) is also COOCH3. So each side of the double bond has the same groups. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not have optical isomerism. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the fumarate is in such a way that the groups aren't symmetric? Wait, no, in the trans configuration, the two ester groups would be on opposite sides but same in structure, leading to symmetry. Hence, no optical activity. \n\nWait, but wait, cis and trans isomers are examples of geometric isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism), but they don't have optical activity unless they are chiral. Since this molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral, so no optical isomerism. So option 4 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but what if the substituents are not symmetric? Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate would be (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the fumarate's structure, when esterified, doesn't have symmetry. Let me try to visualize again. The original fumaric acid is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When converted to methyl esters, the groups would be the same on each side. So the molecule would still be symmetrical, so no optical activity. Therefore, option 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nNow, let me recap the options. \n\n1. The first compound (biphenyl with nitro and ester groups) \u2014 I'm still a bit unsure. Let me re-examine. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, dimethyl ester. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1-1'. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are each on the same position relative to the connection. The dicarboxylate groups are on 2 and 2', so each ring has a carboxyl group at position 2 (now esterified to methyl). \n\nThe key question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring's position 6 is opposite to the connecting carbon (position 1). The nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring, so they are on the same side relative to the biphenyl linkage? Or maybe not. Let me consider the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. The numbering for biphenyls usually starts so that the first ring is the left one, numbered 1-6, and the prime is for the second ring. So position 6 on each ring would be across from the connection. If both nitro groups are on the 6 positions, they would be on the same side (if the rings are aligned in a certain way) or opposite. However, the arrangement might allow for a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images across the plane between the two rings, then the entire molecule would be symmetrical. Therefore, it might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the nitro groups and the esters on the 2 positions could create an asymmetry. Let me think of the substituents on each ring. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The positions 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are separated by three positions. Let me imagine the first ring: position 1 is connected to the other ring. Position 2 has an ester group, and position 6 has a nitro. The second ring's positions 1 (connected) and similarly, position 2 has an ester and position 6 a nitro. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions are mirrored, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Hence, no chiral centers and no optical isomerism. Therefore, compound 1 does not show optical isomerism. \n\nSo, the compounds that do show optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) because it has a chiral center. The other options (1, 3, and 4) do not. \n\nLooking at the options given in the question:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4 \u2192 but 4 doesn't, so no.\n\nB) 3 and 4 \u2192 neither, so no.\n\nC) 2 and 3 \u2192 3 doesn't, so no.\n\nD) 1 and 2 \u2192 but 1 doesn't, so only 2. Wait, the options D says 1 and 2. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. Wait, that would mean none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nHmm, but according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. So the correct answer would be only option 2. But the options given do not have an option with just 2. The options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (2,3), D (1,2). Therefore, perhaps I made an error in evaluating one of the compounds. \n\nWait, let me recheck option 4 again. Maybe I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the two ester groups on either end. If the two ester groups are the same (both methyl esters), then the molecule is symmetrical. But maybe the substituents on the double bond are different. Wait, the groups on each side of the double bond are the same (both esters), so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but perhaps the question is considering that fumarate can have geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Since the molecule is symmetrical, no chiral centers. So 4 is out. \n\nWhat about option 1? Maybe I was wrong there. Let me think again. The biphenyl with nitro and ester groups. Suppose the two rings are connected, and the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. For instance, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring (but considering their positions). Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups on the 2 positions are arranged asymmetrically. Let me try to imagine the biphenyl structure. Let's say the first ring has a nitro at 6, an ester at 2, and the second ring similarly. If the rings are in a staggered conformation, maybe the arrangement is asymmetric. But biphenyls can rotate freely around the single bond between the rings, so any asymmetry would average out, making the molecule achiral. Wait, but if there are substituents that fix the conformation (like bulky groups), but in this case, the nitro and ester groups might not be large enough to restrict rotation. Since the single bond allows free rotation, the molecule can rotate to superimpose on its mirror image. Therefore, it's not chiral. Therefore, option 1 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the only correct one is option 2. But looking at the options, the answer must be D) 1 and 2? Because D includes 1 and 2, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. Wait, but none of the options have just 2. The options given are A-D as above. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. Wait, the structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The carboxylate groups are esterified. The ester groups are on the 2 positions of each benzene ring. Each carboxylate carbon (originally from the carboxylic acid) is now an ester. The ester oxygen is bonded to the carbon. Each of those carbons (the carboxylate carbons) are connected to an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group (from the ester), the benzene ring, and another oxygen (the carbonyl oxygen). Wait, the structure of the ester group is: the carboxyl carbon (originally in the carboxylic acid) is now connected to an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl (as in -O-C(=O)-OCH3). The carbon in question (the carboxyl carbon) is bonded to: the oxygen from the ester (which is connected to methyl), the oxygen from the carbonyl (double bond), and the benzene ring. Wait, so that carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene ring, the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond), and the -OCH3 group (through the single bond). Therefore, that carbon has only three substituents (since the double bond is to an oxygen, which is part of the same group). Therefore, that carbon can't be a chiral center. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different chiral center in the structure. For example, the biphenyl itself. But biphenyl linked via a single bond can rotate, so any chiral arrangement would be averaged out. So no, the molecule would not be chiral. \n\nTherefore, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with just 2. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nSo the closest would be D, which includes 1 and 2, but according to my analysis, 1 is not. So perhaps I made a mistake with option 1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a chiral center in the first compound. Let me think again. The biphenyl with nitro groups on 6 and 6', and esters on 2 and 2'. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl is in such a way that the substituents on each ring make the molecule chiral. For example, if the nitro groups and esters are arranged asymmetrically. Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are at 6 on each ring, which are on the opposite side of the connection. The esters are at 2 on each ring. The positions 2 on each ring are adjacent to the connection (position 1). \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if on one ring the nitro is in a certain orientation relative to the ester, and on the other ring it's the opposite. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely around the single bond between the rings, any such asymmetry would allow the molecule to rotate into its mirror image. Hence, the molecule would not be chiral. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are such that they prevent rotation (like large groups), but nitro and ester groups might not be large enough. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. \n\nHmm. Then the only correct answer is option 2. But since the options don't have an answer with only option 2, perhaps there's an error in my analysis. Alternatively, maybe option 4 does have optical isomerism?\n\nLet me re-express option 4 again. The compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is trans, so the dimethyl ester would also be trans. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (assuming the two ester groups are on the ends). Wait, but if the two ester groups are the same (both methyl), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Hence, it's achiral. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents on the double bond are different. Wait, in the case of fumarate, the two groups on each side of the double bond are the same (both are esters), so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism. \n\nHmm. Then, the only correct answer is option 2, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back, the options given are A to D. The question lists the options as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is a diene, but in the ester form. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, fumaric acid's ester: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH and CH. Each of those carbons has two substituents. For example, the carbon next to the first ester (carbon 2) has a double bond to carbon 3, a single bond to the first ester's carbon (COOCH3), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, it's a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3), each has two substituents. Carbon 2 is connected to the first ester (COOCH3?), no. Wait, the first carbon is the COOCH3 group. The second carbon is CH2? No, it's CH with a double bond to carbon 3. \n\nCarbon 2: connected to the first carbon (COOCH3), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon 3: connected to carbon 2 via double bond, the fourth carbon (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. \n\nWait, in this case, each of carbons 2 and 3 has a hydrogen and the other substituents. So, for example, carbon 2 has: \n\n- a single bond to carbon 1 (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon),\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- a double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a single bond to carbon 4 (the other COOCH3 group),\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, each of these carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents (the double bond counts as one group, but in terms of chiral centers, the double bond restricts rotation, but the carbons are sp2 hybridized. Chiral centers require sp3 hybridization. So the carbons in the double bond can't be chiral centers. \n\nTherefore, no chiral centers. So the molecule is achiral. \n\nHmm. Then, the only compound with optical isomerism is option 2. Since the options given don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made an error in evaluating option 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. What if the compound is not symmetrical? For example, if the two ester groups are different. Wait, the question says dimethyl fumarate, so both esters are methyl. Therefore, the groups are the same. \n\nHmm. Now I'm confused because according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the first compound? Let me think again. \n\nThe first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center. Wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The single bond allows free rotation, so any configuration can rotate to its mirror image. Therefore, it can't be chiral unless there's a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the nitro groups and the esters are placed asymmetrically in a way that creates a chiral center. But how? \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl itself isn't a chiral center, but the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. The 2 positions on each benzene ring are adjacent to the connection point (position 1). \n\nSuppose the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring. The 6 position is three carbons away from the connection. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if on one ring the nitro is in a different orientation relative to the ester compared to the other ring. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely, any such arrangement would allow the molecule to rotate to match its mirror image. Hence, no chirality. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are such that they are not symmetric. Wait, the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', so they are on the same relative positions on each ring. The esters are on 2 and 2', which are also symmetric. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not chiral. \n\nHmm. This is perplexing because the options don't have an option with just 2. The options are A-D as listed. The only possibility left is that I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to fumarate as having geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. However, geometric isomerism (cis-trans) does not give optical activity unless the molecule is chiral. Since the trans form has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But if it were the cis form, then it might also have a plane of symmetry? Wait, cis would have the two substituents on the same side of the double bond. In that case, if the substituents are the same (both methyl esters), then it would have a plane of symmetry as well. So neither cis nor trans would be chiral. \n\nTherefore, option 4 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm. Then the only correct answer is option 2. Since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option 1. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of the ester groups. The ester groups are on the 2 positions of each ring. The 2 positions are adjacent to the connection between the rings. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) would be bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group, and another oxygen (from the carbonyl). Wait, the ester structure is: \n\nThe carboxyl carbon (originally part of the carboxylic acid) is now part of an ester: \n\nThe structure is -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one that was the carboxyl carbon) is bonded to:\n\n- the benzene ring (via a single bond),\n\n- the carbonyl oxygen (double bond),\n\n- an oxygen from the ester (single bond),\n\n- a methyl group (through the ester oxygen?).\n\nWait, the carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene ring, the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond), and the -OCH3 group (as a single bond). Since the double bond counts as one substituent (the oxygen), the carbon has three substituents, so it's not a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, no chiral centers there. \n\nHmm. So I'm back to the conclusion that only option 2 is correct. Since the given options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 3 (benzophenone). \n\nWait, benzophenone is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It has two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Since two substituents are the same (the two phenyl groups), that carbon can't be chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, so it's achiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question includes other types of stereoisomerism? The question says \"show optical isomerism\". Optical isomerism is enantiomerism, requiring a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center I'm not seeing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, biphenyls are connected via a single bond. Unless there are substituents that make it chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. Let me think of the biphenyl with nitro groups on the 6 positions and esters on the 2 positions. \n\nSuppose the two rings are arranged such that the nitro groups are on opposite sides. But because the single bond allows free rotation, the molecule can rotate to superimpose any such arrangement on its mirror image. Hence, no chirality. \n\nHmm. I think my analysis is correct, but the options don't include option 2 alone. Maybe there's an error in the options, but I must choose from the given options. Let me look again at the options. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe only one that includes option 2 is D and A. Since I think 1 is not, so D is incorrect. Option A includes 1, 2,4 which I think are wrong except 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH and CH. Let me consider each carbon. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH next to the first ester):\n\n- bonded to COOCH3 (carbon 1),\n\n- double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nCarbon 3 (the second CH next to the second ester):\n\n- bonded to carbon 4 (COOCH3),\n\n- double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nEach of these carbons has three substituents (since the double bond is to another carbon), but they are sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the trans form has a plane of symmetry and thus is not chiral, but the cis form would have no plane of symmetry. However, the question refers to dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Since cis and trans are geometric isomers, but not chiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the ester groups. \n\nWait, the ester groups are on the 2 positions of the biphenyl rings. The carbon in the ester (the carbonyl carbon) is bonded to an oxygen, a methyl group, and the benzene ring. Since that's three substituents (the double bond counts as one), it's not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with my analysis and choose the option that has option 2. Among the options given, the only one that includes option 2 and excludes others is D) 1 and 2. But since I think 1 is not correct, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of option 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, the biphenyl itself can't have a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl is fused with another ring or something? No, the name is biphenyl, so two rings connected via a single bond. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe question says \"optical isomerism\" which requires a chiral center. \n\nOption 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the second carbon), so yes.\n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center, no.\n\nOption 1: the first compound has no chiral centers, so no.\n\nOption 3: benzophenone: no.\n\nSo the only correct is option 2. Since the options don't have an answer with only 2, perhaps there's an error. But given the options, the closest is D (1 and 2), but I think it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 1 does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl with the substituents has a chiral center. For example, if the nitro groups are on different positions. Wait, the question says 6,6'-dinitro. That means both nitro groups are on the 6 position of each ring. So they are symmetric. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the answer should be only option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D, assuming I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents. Let me imagine the biphenyl with nitro on 6 and ester on 2. The position 2 is adjacent to the connection point (position 1). The position 6 is opposite. The substituents on each ring are symmetric. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is chiral because the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl plane? But if they can rotate freely, then it can become its mirror image. \n\nHmm. I think I'll have to proceed with the analysis I have. The only correct answer is option 2, which is part of option D (along with 1 which I think is incorrect). Since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think once more. \n\nWait, fumarate's ester: dimethyl fumarate. If the double bond has different groups on each side, but in this case, both are the same (methyl esters), so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has a chiral center in the form of the ester carbons? But they are sp2 hybridized. \n\nHmm. I think I'll have to choose D as the closest possible, even though I'm not certain about option 1. Alternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl's 2 positions have different substituents. Wait, no, the question says 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so both are the same. \n\nHmm. I'm really not sure. But according to my analysis, the correct answer is only option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, assuming I made a mistake with option 1. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4 and it does have optical activity. \n\nWait, let me think of another angle. For optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral, meaning it has no plane of symmetry and has at least one chiral center. \n\nOption 2 has a chiral center. \n\nOption 4: the molecule is symmetric, so no. \n\nOption 1: if the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Let me think again. Suppose the biphenyl is in a conformation where the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl's plane, and the esters are also on the same side. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely, it can be rotated to the mirror image. Hence, the molecule is not chiral. \n\nThus, I think the only correct answer is option 2. Since the options don't include that, perhaps the question has a mistake. But given the options, the best possible is D) 1 and 2. However, I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that fumarate has optical isomerism because of the double bond's arrangement, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. \n\nHmm. I think I have to go with my original conclusion that option 2 is correct. Since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the closest is D, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the ester groups. Let me think again. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) is bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group, and the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond). Since the double bond is part of the carbonyl group, the carbon has three substituents. Not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, given the options, and my analysis pointing to option 2, which is part of option D, I'll go with D, assuming I made an error in evaluating option 1. Alternatively, maybe the first compound does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center due to the arrangement of the substituents. For example, if the nitro groups and esters are placed in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. Let me think of the biphenyl as two rings connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are each opposite the connection. The esters are on 2 and 2'. \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed such that when viewed from one side, the nitro on one ring is up and the other is down, but the esters are arranged oppositely. But due to the free rotation around the single bond, this can be rotated to the mirror image. \n\nTherefore, no, it's not chiral. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo and the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that fumarate has optical isomerism because of the trans/cis isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I'll have to choose the option that includes only option 2. The closest is option C (2 and 3), but 3 is wrong. Option D includes 1 and 2. Since I think 1 is not, but if I must choose, perhaps D is the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first compound. Let me think of another angle. The first compound has the formula: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The presence of two nitro groups and two ester groups on each ring. The positions are symmetric, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the biphenyl connection. Hence, it's not chiral. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question considers that the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center in the form of a fused ring or something else. No, the name is biphenyl, so two rings connected by a single bond. \n\nHmm. I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1 and it does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center when the substituents are not symmetric. For example, if the nitro groups were on different positions, but the question specifies 6,6', so symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I'll have to choose the answer based on my analysis, which is option 2 is correct. Since the options don't have that, but option D includes it along with 1, which I think is incorrect, perhaps the correct answer is D. Alternatively, the question might have a mistake. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nIf I'm confident that only option 2 is correct, then none of the options are correct, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of the ester groups on the 2 positions. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) is bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from ester), a methyl group, and the carbonyl oxygen (double bond). Not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll settle on option D being the intended answer, even though I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, dimethyl fumarate is trans, so it has a plane of symmetry, no. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer must be D) 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I think only 2 is correct. \n\nWait, the question says \"show optical isomerism\". Let me recheck option 4 once more. \n\nFumarate's ester: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So mirror image is itself. Hence, not chiral. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question has an error. But given the options, the closest is D, so I'll choose D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify molecules with chiral centers. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers (carbons with four different substituents) or other structural features that prevent a plane of symmetry.\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   - The biphenyl structure allows free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.  \n   - The nitro groups (6 and 6') and ester groups (2 and 2') are symmetrically arranged, creating a plane of symmetry.  \n   - No chiral centers exist, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   - The structure is **CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3**.  \n   - The central carbon (second carbon) has four different substituents: CH3, OH, H, and the adjacent carbonyl group.  \n   - This creates a **chiral center**, so **optical isomerism is present**.\n\n3. **benzophenone**:  \n   - Structure: **Ph-CO-Ph**.  \n   - The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups and an oxygen, giving it a plane of symmetry.  \n   - **No chiral center**, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   - Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid.  \n   - Structure: **OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3**.  \n   - Both ends have identical substituents (methyl esters), creating a plane of symmetry through the double bond.  \n   - **No chiral center**, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\nThe only compound showing optical isomerism is **option 2**.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism requires. Optical isomers, which are a type of stereoisomer, are enantiomers that have chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, they can also exist due to restricted rotation around a double bond, leading to cis-trans isomerism, but that's a different type of stereoisomerism. Wait, but cis-trans isomers are also a kind of stereoisomer, but they don't have optical activity unless they form enantiomers? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nFirst, let's go through each compound one by one.\n\nStarting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The name is a bit complex. Let me parse it. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The positions 6 and 6' have nitro groups, and positions 2 and 2' have dicarboxylate groups which are esterified with methyl. The structure would have two benzene rings linked. Now, does this have a chiral center? Since the biphenyl is connected via a single bond, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry? Wait, but if the substituents are placed asymmetrically, maybe not. Let me think. The nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. Let's imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring's 6 position would be opposite the connecting bond. If both nitro groups are on the same side (like both on the upper part of each ring when viewed in a certain way), but since they are on the 6 positions, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the dicarboxylate groups (as esters) on positions 2 and 2' might introduce asymmetry. Wait, the dicarboxylate would be on each ring's 2 position. The methyl esters would be attached there. So maybe each ring's 2 position has a -O-C(O)OCH3 group. Let me see: if the two rings are connected, the substituents on each ring might be arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. However, without a chiral center, optical isomerism would not occur. Alternatively, maybe there's a chiral center here. Wait, the ester groups are on the carboxylate carbons, which are each attached to an oxygen, a methyl, and two other substituents. Let me check the structure again. The 2,2'-dicarboxylate would mean that each carboxyl group is on the 2 position of each benzene ring. The carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl, so each would be -O-C(O)OCH3. The carbon in the ester group (the carbonyl carbon) is bonded to two oxygen atoms, a methyl, and the aromatic ring. Since oxygen is bonded twice, that carbon can't be a chiral center. So maybe the chiral centers are elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl itself has a chiral center? No, biphenyls connected via a single bond can rotate freely, so they can't have chiral centers. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, maybe the molecule could be chiral. For example, if the nitro groups are on different positions in a way that creates an asymmetric arrangement. Wait, the nitro groups are on the 6 and 6' positions. Since the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', the 6 and 6' are on the opposite side of each ring. So, perhaps the arrangement is symmetrical. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe this compound has a chiral center or not. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If so, it would not be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. The two rings are connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are each on the same position relative to the connection. The dicarboxylate groups are at 2 and 2'. Each of those positions on their respective rings would be in the same direction. So the substituents on each ring are mirror images across the plane between the rings. Therefore, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nMoving on to option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the carboxylic acid derivative. The structure is: the carboxylic acid is on the propane chain. The 2-hydroxypropanoate is like a 3-carbon chain: the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the hydroxyl is at position 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3 (since it's methyl ester). Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be: the parent chain is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). The 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Yes, that's correct. The carbon at position 2 (the middle carbon) has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is: the central carbon (second carbon in the chain) has a hydroxyl, a methyl (from the first carbon), a carbonyl oxygen (from the COOCH3 group), and the next carbon (third) is the COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to: the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (which is the COO group), the hydroxyl, and the hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the second carbon in propanoate is the CH(OH) group. Let me draw it out mentally. The structure would be:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) has four groups: CH3 (from the first carbon?), wait no. Wait, the second carbon is attached to the first (CH3), the third (COOCH3), the hydroxyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, the second carbon in propanoic acid (the middle carbon) has two single bonds: to the first carbon (CH3) and to the third carbon (which is the COOH group). So in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So when it's the ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon) has bonds to: CH3 (the first carbon?), no, actually the first carbon is CH2? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure again. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon (the CH2 group becomes CH(OH)). So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up numbering. Let me think again. The carboxylic acid is the third carbon. The 2-position is the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. When esterified with methyl, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl), its four substituents are: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, the COOCH3 group (through the third carbon), and a hydrogen? Wait, no, the second carbon has two bonds to the adjacent carbons. Let me see: the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to the first carbon (CH3), the third carbon (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon), the hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen. So the four groups are: CH3, H, OH, and the adjacent carbonyl carbon (the third carbon). Wait, the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, so the second carbon is connected to that. So the four groups on the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) are: CH3 (from first carbon), H, OH, and the third carbon (which is connected to the COOCH3). Therefore, that carbon has four different substituents: CH3, H, OH, and the rest of the molecule (the COOCH3 part). Wait, but the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group. So the substituents on the second carbon are: CH3 (from the first carbon), a hydrogen, OH, and the adjacent carbon (which is bonded to the carbonyl group and the ester). Since all four groups are different, that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound should have optical isomerism. So option 2 does show optical isomerism. \n\nMoving to option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is a ketone where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. The carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Since the carbonyl carbon has two identical groups (the two phenyls), it can't be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not have optical isomerism. \n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, with the structure HO2C-CH=CH-CH2COOH. The fumarate ester would have both carboxylic acids esterified. So dimethyl fumarate would be O2C-CH=CH-CH2-COOMe. Wait, actually, fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is trans- butenedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The dimethyl ester would replace both carboxylic acids with methyl groups, so O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends are esterified. So it's O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, wait, dimethyl would mean both are methyl. So it's O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, actually, each carboxylic acid group becomes an ester. So the structure would be O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, the two ends: both carboxyl groups become esters with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is (OOCCH2)-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid's structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, both ends become COOCH3. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. Wait, the correct structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, both ends are methyl esters. So it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the central part is CH2? Wait, no, the fumaric acid structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the central double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So when converted to dimethyl ester, it's OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, both ends. Wait, each carboxylic acid is replaced by a methyl ester. So the two ends would be OOCCH2? No, the correct structure is (OOC)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would have both COOH groups replaced by COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. So each COOH becomes -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the structure is O2C-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but there are two COOH groups. The correct structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would only esterify one. Wait, perhaps it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, the original structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So each carboxyl group (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So the dimethyl fumarate would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that can't be right because there are two COOH groups. Wait, maybe the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would be only one ester. Wait, perhaps the structure is (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of fumaric acid as HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would have both carboxyl groups esterified with methyl. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have one ester and one acid. Wait, no. Wait, the two carboxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So each is replaced by COOCH3. The structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH2CH3? No, methyl is -OCH3. So the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that still leaves one as an acid. Wait, perhaps it's OOCCH2-CH=CH-CH2COOCH3? No, that would be if the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be maleic acid's structure (cis) but fumaric is trans. Wait, the confusion arises because I'm mixing cis and trans. The fumarate is the trans isomer. The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So the dimethyl ester would have both ends as methyl esters. So the structure would be OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 where the first COOH is esterified to OOC- (wait, no). Let me think again. Each of the two COOH groups (on carbons 1 and 4) becomes an ester. So carbon 1's COOH becomes COOCH3, and carbon 4's COOH also becomes COOCH3. So the structure is OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me write it as OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but the carbon chain would be HOOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOH for fumaric acid, but that can't be right because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the two COOH groups on carbons 1 and 4). Therefore, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate would be OOC-CH=CH-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not. Wait, maybe the structure is (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, perhaps it's better to think of the molecule as having the two ester groups on either end. So the molecule would have the structure: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, that can't be, because that would only have one ester. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of it as the two carboxyl groups are on each end of the chain. So, for fumaric acid (trans), the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's maleic acid when cis. Wait, no. The correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The two COOH groups are on carbons 1 and 4. So, the four-carbon chain? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is actually three carbons: the two COOH groups are on the ends. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. That's three carbons in total. The first carbon is the COOH, then a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the third carbon is the other COOH. Wait, no, that would make it three carbons with a double bond between 2 and 3. So the first carbon is the COOH (carbonyl group?), no. Let me get this straight: fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So the structure is OOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no. Let me use IUPAC nomenclature. The formula is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So four atoms in the chain? Wait, no. The molecule has four carbon atoms? Let me think: the formula for fumaric acid is C4H4O4. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. That's four carbons: the first is the COOH (carbon 1), then a carbon (carbon 2) connected to carbon 1 and the double bond to carbon 3, and carbon 3 connected to carbon 2 (double bond) and carbon 4 (another COOH). So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, each COOH is on carbons 1 and 4. So when converted to dimethyl ester, both COOH groups become COOCH3. The structure becomes OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would be only three carbons. Wait, the first COOH (carbon 1) becomes OOC- (but as an ester, it would be OOC-CH2? No. Let me think again. The structure is: \n\nCarbon 1: -COOH (originally), becomes -COOCH3.\n\nCarbon 2: CH connected to carbons 1 and 3 via double bond.\n\nCarbon 3: CH connected to carbons 2 (double bond) and 4.\n\nCarbon 4: -COOH becomes -COOCH3.\n\nTherefore, the dimethyl fumarate would have the structure OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that's three carbons? Wait, no, carbons 1 to 4. Wait, the carbons are arranged as:\n\n1: COOCH3\n\n2: CH2 (but with a double bond to carbon 3?)\n\nNo, sorry, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be if it were a single bond. Since it's a double bond between 2 and 3, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that's only three carbons? Wait, no. Let me write it as OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. That would be four carbons: the first is the COOCH3 (carbon 1), then a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the fourth is the other COOCH3. Wait, no, the carbons are arranged as:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (originally COOH)\n\nCarbon 2: CH connected to carbon 1 and double bonded to carbon 3.\n\nCarbon 3: CH connected to carbon 2 (double bond) and carbon 4.\n\nCarbon 4: COOCH3 (originally COOH)\n\nSo the full structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but that would be three carbons between the two COO groups. Hmm, perhaps that's correct. Now, the question is whether this compound has optical isomerism. Since fumaric acid is a trans isomer, its ester would also be trans. However, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me see: the structure OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but if both ends are the same, then there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, in the dimethyl fumarate, both ends are methyl esters. Wait, no. Wait, in the original fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are the same, so when converted to methyl esters, both are OOC-CH2? No, the groups are the same. So the molecule would be symmetrical. For example, if the two ends are both OOCCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence it's achiral and does not have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, the substituents on each side of the double bond must be considered. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The groups on either side are: on one side (carbon 1) is COOCH3, and on the other side (carbon 4) is also COOCH3. So each side of the double bond has the same groups. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) does not have optical isomerism. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the fumarate is in such a way that the groups aren't symmetric? Wait, no, in the trans configuration, the two ester groups would be on opposite sides but same in structure, leading to symmetry. Hence, no optical activity. \n\nWait, but wait, cis and trans isomers are examples of geometric isomerism (a type of stereoisomerism), but they don't have optical activity unless they are chiral. Since this molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral, so no optical isomerism. So option 4 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but what if the substituents are not symmetric? Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate would be (OOCCH2)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OOCCH3)? No, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the fumarate's structure, when esterified, doesn't have symmetry. Let me try to visualize again. The original fumaric acid is trans, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When converted to methyl esters, the groups would be the same on each side. So the molecule would still be symmetrical, so no optical activity. Therefore, option 4 does not exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nNow, let me recap the options. \n\n1. The first compound (biphenyl with nitro and ester groups) \u2014 I'm still a bit unsure. Let me re-examine. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, dimethyl ester. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1-1'. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are each on the same position relative to the connection. The dicarboxylate groups are on 2 and 2', so each ring has a carboxyl group at position 2 (now esterified to methyl). \n\nThe key question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. Each ring's position 6 is opposite to the connecting carbon (position 1). The nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring, so they are on the same side relative to the biphenyl linkage? Or maybe not. Let me consider the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. The numbering for biphenyls usually starts so that the first ring is the left one, numbered 1-6, and the prime is for the second ring. So position 6 on each ring would be across from the connection. If both nitro groups are on the 6 positions, they would be on the same side (if the rings are aligned in a certain way) or opposite. However, the arrangement might allow for a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images across the plane between the two rings, then the entire molecule would be symmetrical. Therefore, it might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the nitro groups and the esters on the 2 positions could create an asymmetry. Let me think of the substituents on each ring. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. The positions 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are separated by three positions. Let me imagine the first ring: position 1 is connected to the other ring. Position 2 has an ester group, and position 6 has a nitro. The second ring's positions 1 (connected) and similarly, position 2 has an ester and position 6 a nitro. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions are mirrored, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Hence, no chiral centers and no optical isomerism. Therefore, compound 1 does not show optical isomerism. \n\nSo, the compounds that do show optical isomerism are option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) because it has a chiral center. The other options (1, 3, and 4) do not. \n\nLooking at the options given in the question:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4 \u2192 but 4 doesn't, so no.\n\nB) 3 and 4 \u2192 neither, so no.\n\nC) 2 and 3 \u2192 3 doesn't, so no.\n\nD) 1 and 2 \u2192 but 1 doesn't, so only 2. Wait, the options D says 1 and 2. But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. Wait, that would mean none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nHmm, but according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct. So the correct answer would be only option 2. But the options given do not have an option with just 2. The options are A (1,2,4), B (3,4), C (2,3), D (1,2). Therefore, perhaps I made an error in evaluating one of the compounds. \n\nWait, let me recheck option 4 again. Maybe I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate. Let me think again. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, but that would have the two ester groups on either end. If the two ester groups are the same (both methyl esters), then the molecule is symmetrical. But maybe the substituents on the double bond are different. Wait, the groups on each side of the double bond are the same (both esters), so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but perhaps the question is considering that fumarate can have geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center. Since the molecule is symmetrical, no chiral centers. So 4 is out. \n\nWhat about option 1? Maybe I was wrong there. Let me think again. The biphenyl with nitro and ester groups. Suppose the two rings are connected, and the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry. For instance, if the nitro groups are on the same side of each ring (but considering their positions). Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups on the 2 positions are arranged asymmetrically. Let me try to imagine the biphenyl structure. Let's say the first ring has a nitro at 6, an ester at 2, and the second ring similarly. If the rings are in a staggered conformation, maybe the arrangement is asymmetric. But biphenyls can rotate freely around the single bond between the rings, so any asymmetry would average out, making the molecule achiral. Wait, but if there are substituents that fix the conformation (like bulky groups), but in this case, the nitro and ester groups might not be large enough to restrict rotation. Since the single bond allows free rotation, the molecule can rotate to superimpose on its mirror image. Therefore, it's not chiral. Therefore, option 1 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nTherefore, the only correct one is option 2. But looking at the options, the answer must be D) 1 and 2? Because D includes 1 and 2, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. Wait, but none of the options have just 2. The options given are A-D as above. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. Wait, the structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The carboxylate groups are esterified. The ester groups are on the 2 positions of each benzene ring. Each carboxylate carbon (originally from the carboxylic acid) is now an ester. The ester oxygen is bonded to the carbon. Each of those carbons (the carboxylate carbons) are connected to an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group (from the ester), the benzene ring, and another oxygen (the carbonyl oxygen). Wait, the structure of the ester group is: the carboxyl carbon (originally in the carboxylic acid) is now connected to an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl (as in -O-C(=O)-OCH3). The carbon in question (the carboxyl carbon) is bonded to: the oxygen from the ester (which is connected to methyl), the oxygen from the carbonyl (double bond), and the benzene ring. Wait, so that carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene ring, the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond), and the -OCH3 group (through the single bond). Therefore, that carbon has only three substituents (since the double bond is to an oxygen, which is part of the same group). Therefore, that carbon can't be a chiral center. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different chiral center in the structure. For example, the biphenyl itself. But biphenyl linked via a single bond can rotate, so any chiral arrangement would be averaged out. So no, the molecule would not be chiral. \n\nTherefore, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with just 2. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nSo the closest would be D, which includes 1 and 2, but according to my analysis, 1 is not. So perhaps I made a mistake with option 1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a chiral center in the first compound. Let me think again. The biphenyl with nitro groups on 6 and 6', and esters on 2 and 2'. \n\nSuppose the biphenyl is in such a way that the substituents on each ring make the molecule chiral. For example, if the nitro groups and esters are arranged asymmetrically. Let me imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are at 6 on each ring, which are on the opposite side of the connection. The esters are at 2 on each ring. The positions 2 on each ring are adjacent to the connection (position 1). \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if on one ring the nitro is in a certain orientation relative to the ester, and on the other ring it's the opposite. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely around the single bond between the rings, any such asymmetry would allow the molecule to rotate into its mirror image. Hence, the molecule would not be chiral. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are such that they prevent rotation (like large groups), but nitro and ester groups might not be large enough. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. \n\nHmm. Then the only correct answer is option 2. But since the options don't have an answer with only option 2, perhaps there's an error in my analysis. Alternatively, maybe option 4 does have optical isomerism?\n\nLet me re-express option 4 again. The compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is trans, so the dimethyl ester would also be trans. The structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (assuming the two ester groups are on the ends). Wait, but if the two ester groups are the same (both methyl), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Hence, it's achiral. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents on the double bond are different. Wait, in the case of fumarate, the two groups on each side of the double bond are the same (both are esters), so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism. \n\nHmm. Then, the only correct answer is option 2, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back, the options given are A to D. The question lists the options as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is a diene, but in the ester form. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, fumaric acid's ester: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH and CH. Each of those carbons has two substituents. For example, the carbon next to the first ester (carbon 2) has a double bond to carbon 3, a single bond to the first ester's carbon (COOCH3), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me draw it out. The structure is:\n\nOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, it's a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. \n\nThe correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. \n\nLooking at the carbons adjacent to the double bond (positions 2 and 3), each has two substituents. Carbon 2 is connected to the first ester (COOCH3?), no. Wait, the first carbon is the COOCH3 group. The second carbon is CH2? No, it's CH with a double bond to carbon 3. \n\nCarbon 2: connected to the first carbon (COOCH3), the double bond to carbon 3, and a hydrogen. \n\nCarbon 3: connected to carbon 2 via double bond, the fourth carbon (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. \n\nWait, in this case, each of carbons 2 and 3 has a hydrogen and the other substituents. So, for example, carbon 2 has: \n\n- a single bond to carbon 1 (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon),\n\n- a double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nSimilarly, carbon 3 has:\n\n- a double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a single bond to carbon 4 (the other COOCH3 group),\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, each of these carbons (2 and 3) has two substituents (the double bond counts as one group, but in terms of chiral centers, the double bond restricts rotation, but the carbons are sp2 hybridized. Chiral centers require sp3 hybridization. So the carbons in the double bond can't be chiral centers. \n\nTherefore, no chiral centers. So the molecule is achiral. \n\nHmm. Then, the only compound with optical isomerism is option 2. Since the options given don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made an error in evaluating option 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. What if the compound is not symmetrical? For example, if the two ester groups are different. Wait, the question says dimethyl fumarate, so both esters are methyl. Therefore, the groups are the same. \n\nHmm. Now I'm confused because according to my analysis, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Maybe I made a mistake in the first compound? Let me think again. \n\nThe first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center. Wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The single bond allows free rotation, so any configuration can rotate to its mirror image. Therefore, it can't be chiral unless there's a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the nitro groups and the esters are placed asymmetrically in a way that creates a chiral center. But how? \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl itself isn't a chiral center, but the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. The 2 positions on each benzene ring are adjacent to the connection point (position 1). \n\nSuppose the nitro groups are on the 6 positions of each ring. The 6 position is three carbons away from the connection. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if on one ring the nitro is in a different orientation relative to the ester compared to the other ring. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely, any such arrangement would allow the molecule to rotate to match its mirror image. Hence, no chirality. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are such that they are not symmetric. Wait, the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', so they are on the same relative positions on each ring. The esters are on 2 and 2', which are also symmetric. So the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not chiral. \n\nHmm. This is perplexing because the options don't have an option with just 2. The options are A-D as listed. The only possibility left is that I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to fumarate as having geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. However, geometric isomerism (cis-trans) does not give optical activity unless the molecule is chiral. Since the trans form has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. But if it were the cis form, then it might also have a plane of symmetry? Wait, cis would have the two substituents on the same side of the double bond. In that case, if the substituents are the same (both methyl esters), then it would have a plane of symmetry as well. So neither cis nor trans would be chiral. \n\nTherefore, option 4 does not have optical isomerism. \n\nHmm. Then the only correct answer is option 2. Since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option 1. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of the ester groups. The ester groups are on the 2 positions of each ring. The 2 positions are adjacent to the connection between the rings. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) would be bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group, and another oxygen (from the carbonyl). Wait, the ester structure is: \n\nThe carboxyl carbon (originally part of the carboxylic acid) is now part of an ester: \n\nThe structure is -O-C(=O)-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one that was the carboxyl carbon) is bonded to:\n\n- the benzene ring (via a single bond),\n\n- the carbonyl oxygen (double bond),\n\n- an oxygen from the ester (single bond),\n\n- a methyl group (through the ester oxygen?).\n\nWait, the carbon is bonded to three groups: the benzene ring, the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond), and the -OCH3 group (as a single bond). Since the double bond counts as one substituent (the oxygen), the carbon has three substituents, so it's not a chiral center. \n\nTherefore, no chiral centers there. \n\nHmm. So I'm back to the conclusion that only option 2 is correct. Since the given options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 3 (benzophenone). \n\nWait, benzophenone is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon. It has two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Since two substituents are the same (the two phenyl groups), that carbon can't be chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, so it's achiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question includes other types of stereoisomerism? The question says \"show optical isomerism\". Optical isomerism is enantiomerism, requiring a chiral center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center I'm not seeing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, biphenyls are connected via a single bond. Unless there are substituents that make it chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. Let me think of the biphenyl with nitro groups on the 6 positions and esters on the 2 positions. \n\nSuppose the two rings are arranged such that the nitro groups are on opposite sides. But because the single bond allows free rotation, the molecule can rotate to superimpose any such arrangement on its mirror image. Hence, no chirality. \n\nHmm. I think my analysis is correct, but the options don't include option 2 alone. Maybe there's an error in the options, but I must choose from the given options. Let me look again at the options. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe only one that includes option 2 is D and A. Since I think 1 is not, so D is incorrect. Option A includes 1, 2,4 which I think are wrong except 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, the structure is OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH and CH. Let me consider each carbon. \n\nCarbon 2 (the first CH next to the first ester):\n\n- bonded to COOCH3 (carbon 1),\n\n- double bond to carbon 3,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nCarbon 3 (the second CH next to the second ester):\n\n- bonded to carbon 4 (COOCH3),\n\n- double bond to carbon 2,\n\n- a hydrogen.\n\nEach of these carbons has three substituents (since the double bond is to another carbon), but they are sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the trans form has a plane of symmetry and thus is not chiral, but the cis form would have no plane of symmetry. However, the question refers to dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Since cis and trans are geometric isomers, but not chiral. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the ester groups. \n\nWait, the ester groups are on the 2 positions of the biphenyl rings. The carbon in the ester (the carbonyl carbon) is bonded to an oxygen, a methyl group, and the benzene ring. Since that's three substituents (the double bond counts as one), it's not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with my analysis and choose the option that has option 2. Among the options given, the only one that includes option 2 and excludes others is D) 1 and 2. But since I think 1 is not correct, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of option 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, the biphenyl itself can't have a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl is fused with another ring or something? No, the name is biphenyl, so two rings connected via a single bond. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe question says \"optical isomerism\" which requires a chiral center. \n\nOption 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the second carbon), so yes.\n\nOption 4: dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center, no.\n\nOption 1: the first compound has no chiral centers, so no.\n\nOption 3: benzophenone: no.\n\nSo the only correct is option 2. Since the options don't have an answer with only 2, perhaps there's an error. But given the options, the closest is D (1 and 2), but I think it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 1 does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl with the substituents has a chiral center. For example, if the nitro groups are on different positions. Wait, the question says 6,6'-dinitro. That means both nitro groups are on the 6 position of each ring. So they are symmetric. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the answer should be only option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D, assuming I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center due to the arrangement of substituents. Let me imagine the biphenyl with nitro on 6 and ester on 2. The position 2 is adjacent to the connection point (position 1). The position 6 is opposite. The substituents on each ring are symmetric. \n\nWait, maybe the molecule is chiral because the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl plane? But if they can rotate freely, then it can become its mirror image. \n\nHmm. I think I'll have to proceed with the analysis I have. The only correct answer is option 2, which is part of option D (along with 1 which I think is incorrect). Since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think once more. \n\nWait, fumarate's ester: dimethyl fumarate. If the double bond has different groups on each side, but in this case, both are the same (methyl esters), so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers that the molecule has a chiral center in the form of the ester carbons? But they are sp2 hybridized. \n\nHmm. I think I'll have to choose D as the closest possible, even though I'm not certain about option 1. Alternatively, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl's 2 positions have different substituents. Wait, no, the question says 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so both are the same. \n\nHmm. I'm really not sure. But according to my analysis, the correct answer is only option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, assuming I made a mistake with option 1. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4 and it does have optical activity. \n\nWait, let me think of another angle. For optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral, meaning it has no plane of symmetry and has at least one chiral center. \n\nOption 2 has a chiral center. \n\nOption 4: the molecule is symmetric, so no. \n\nOption 1: if the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. Let me think again. Suppose the biphenyl is in a conformation where the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl's plane, and the esters are also on the same side. But since the biphenyl can rotate freely, it can be rotated to the mirror image. Hence, the molecule is not chiral. \n\nThus, I think the only correct answer is option 2. Since the options don't include that, perhaps the question has a mistake. But given the options, the best possible is D) 1 and 2. However, I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, maybe the question considers that fumarate has optical isomerism because of the double bond's arrangement, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. \n\nHmm. I think I have to go with my original conclusion that option 2 is correct. Since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the closest is D, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the first compound has a chiral center in the ester groups. Let me think again. The ester groups are on the 2 positions. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) is bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from the ester), a methyl group, and the carbonyl oxygen (as a double bond). Since the double bond is part of the carbonyl group, the carbon has three substituents. Not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, given the options, and my analysis pointing to option 2, which is part of option D, I'll go with D, assuming I made an error in evaluating option 1. Alternatively, maybe the first compound does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, maybe the biphenyl has a chiral center due to the arrangement of the substituents. For example, if the nitro groups and esters are placed in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. Let me think of the biphenyl as two rings connected at 1-1'. The nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are each opposite the connection. The esters are on 2 and 2'. \n\nIf the substituents on each ring are placed such that when viewed from one side, the nitro on one ring is up and the other is down, but the esters are arranged oppositely. But due to the free rotation around the single bond, this can be rotated to the mirror image. \n\nTherefore, no, it's not chiral. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is option 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo and the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that fumarate has optical isomerism because of the trans/cis isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I'll have to choose the option that includes only option 2. The closest is option C (2 and 3), but 3 is wrong. Option D includes 1 and 2. Since I think 1 is not, but if I must choose, perhaps D is the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first compound. Let me think of another angle. The first compound has the formula: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The presence of two nitro groups and two ester groups on each ring. The positions are symmetric, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the biphenyl connection. Hence, it's not chiral. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question considers that the first compound has a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center in the form of a fused ring or something else. No, the name is biphenyl, so two rings connected by a single bond. \n\nHmm. I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is D) 1 and 2, but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1 and it does have a chiral center. \n\nWait, perhaps the biphenyl has a chiral center when the substituents are not symmetric. For example, if the nitro groups were on different positions, but the question specifies 6,6', so symmetric. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlright, I think I'll have to choose the answer based on my analysis, which is option 2 is correct. Since the options don't have that, but option D includes it along with 1, which I think is incorrect, perhaps the correct answer is D. Alternatively, the question might have a mistake. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\n\nB) 3 and 4\n\nC) 2 and 3\n\nD) 1 and 2\n\nIf I'm confident that only option 2 is correct, then none of the options are correct, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound has a chiral center. Let me think of the ester groups on the 2 positions. The carboxylate carbon (now ester) is bonded to the benzene ring, an oxygen (from ester), a methyl group, and the carbonyl oxygen (double bond). Not a chiral center. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll settle on option D being the intended answer, even though I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. \n\nWait, dimethyl fumarate is trans, so it has a plane of symmetry, no. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer must be D) 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is A) 1,2,4, but I think only 2 is correct. \n\nWait, the question says \"show optical isomerism\". Let me recheck option 4 once more. \n\nFumarate's ester: OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond. So mirror image is itself. Hence, not chiral. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question has an error. But given the options, the closest is D, so I'll choose D.\n\n\nTo determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify molecules with chiral centers. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers (carbons with four different substituents) or other structural features that prevent a plane of symmetry.\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:  \n   - The biphenyl structure allows free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.  \n   - The nitro groups (6 and 6') and ester groups (2 and 2') are symmetrically arranged, creating a plane of symmetry.  \n   - No chiral centers exist, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  \n   - The structure is **CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3**.  \n   - The central carbon (second carbon) has four different substituents: CH3, OH, H, and the adjacent carbonyl group.  \n   - This creates a **chiral center**, so **optical isomerism is present**.\n\n3. **benzophenone**:  \n   - Structure: **Ph-CO-Ph**.  \n   - The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups and an oxygen, giving it a plane of symmetry.  \n   - **No chiral center**, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**:  \n   - Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid.  \n   - Structure: **OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3**.  \n   - Both ends have identical substituents (methyl esters), creating a plane of symmetry through the double bond.  \n   - **No chiral center**, so **no optical isomerism**.\n\nThe only compound showing optical isomerism is **option 2**. However, among the provided options, **D (1 and 2)** includes option 2 but also includes 1, which does not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this discrepancy, the closest valid answer based on the given options is **D**, as it includes the correct compound (2) and excludes others that are definitively incorrect (3 and 4).  \n\nAnswer: D",
