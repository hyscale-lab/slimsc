Let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Pauli spin matrices \u03c3 are 2x2 matrices. The operator here is the dot product of \u03c3 with a unit vector n\u0302. The Hamiltonian is scaled by \u03b5, which has units of energy. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of H. \n\nWait, eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian depend on its matrix form. Since \u03c3\u00b7n\u0302 is a combination of the Pauli matrices, maybe I can recall that for any unit vector n, the operator \u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b11. Because the Pauli matrices, when dotted with a unit vector, the eigenvalues are always plus or minus 1, right? Like, for example, \u03c3_z has eigenvalues \u00b11, and similarly for \u03c3_x or any direction. \n\nSo if \u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then multiplying by \u03b5 would scale those eigenvalues by \u03b5. So the eigenvalues of H should be \u00b1\u03b5. Let me check the options. Option B is +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. Option C has \u03b5 multiplied by hbar over 2. Wait, but hold on. Wait a second, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they are Hermitian matrices with entries like 0 and 1, or for \u03c3_x, it's [[0,1],[1,0]], so their eigenvalues are indeed \u00b11. \n\nBut the Hamiltonian here is \u03b5 multiplied by \u03c3\u00b7n. So the eigenvalues would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. Since \u03c3\u00b7n's eigenvalues are \u00b11, so H's eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5. So that would be option B. \n\nBut wait, I have to make sure. Sometimes in the context of spin operators, there might be factors of hbar involved. Let me think. The standard form for the Hamiltonian involving spin is often written as H = \u03c9\u00b7\u03c3 \u00b7 S, but sometimes the actual operator for spin is (\u0127/2)\u03c3. Wait, maybe that's where confusion could come in. \n\nWait, the Pauli matrices themselves are 2x2 matrices with eigenvalues \u00b11, but when they are used in the context of angular momentum, the spin operator S is (\u0127/2)\u03c3. So the actual spin operator has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as \u03b5 times \u03c3\u00b7n. So unless the question is using a different convention where the spin matrices are scaled by \u0127/2, but the problem states that the components of \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. \n\nSo the problem says \"components of \u03c3 are the Pauli spin matrices\", so \u03c3 here is the standard Pauli matrices.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here about the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H equals epsilon times the dot product of the Pauli spin matrices vector and some unit vector n. Hmm, right. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Pauli spin matrices, \u03c3, are 2x2 matrices that represent spin operators in quantum mechanics. Each component of \u03c3 (like \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z) is a Pauli matrix. The Hamiltonian here is H = \u03b5 (\u03c3 \u00b7 n\u0302), where n\u0302 is a unit vector. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of H.\n\nI recall that for a Hamiltonian of the form H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n, the eigenvalues can be found by considering the properties of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of \u00b11/2 when multiplied by \u0127, but wait, actually, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of each Pauli matrix individually are \u00b11, right? Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and their eigenvalues are \u00b11. But when you have a combination like \u03c3 \u00b7 n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues of \u00b11. Because the dot product with a unit vector gives an operator whose eigenvalues are \u00b11. Then, when you multiply by \u03b5, which has units of energy, the eigenvalues should be \u00b1\u03b5. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are \u00b11, so when you take the dot product with a unit vector, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is a combination of the three Pauli matrices scaled by the components of n. But regardless of the direction of n, the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n should still be \u00b11, because the Pauli vector dotted into any direction gives an operator with eigenvalues \u00b11. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and Hermitian, and their squares are the identity matrix. So \u03c3 \u00b7 n squared would be (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = \u03c3_i \u03c3_i (since n is a unit vector, the sum of n_i squared is 1). Wait, actually, let me compute (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2. \n\nLet me compute that. The square of \u03c3 \u00b7 n is (\u03c3_x n_x + \u03c3_y n_y + \u03c3_z n_z)^2. Expanding that gives \u03c3_x\u00b2 n_x\u00b2 + \u03c3_y\u00b2 n_y\u00b2 + \u03c3_z\u00b2 n_z\u00b2 plus cross terms. Since each \u03c3_i squared is the identity matrix (\u03c3_i\u00b2 = I), so that part becomes (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) I, which is I because n is a unit vector. The cross terms like \u03c3_x \u03c3_y n_x n_y etc. But since the cross terms involve products of different Pauli matrices, which anti-commute. Wait, but when you square the sum, those cross terms would involve terms like \u03c3_x \u03c3_y + \u03c3_y \u03c3_x, but actually, for each pair, the cross terms would be 2 \u03c3_x \u03c3_y n_x n_y, but when you square the sum, each cross term is 2\u03c3_i \u03c3_j n_i n_j for i\u2260j? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again: expanding (a + b + c)^2 gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So here each cross term is 2\u03c3_i \u03c3_j n_i n_j where i < j. But the problem is, the cross terms might not vanish. However, when considering the eigenvalues, perhaps the cross terms don't affect the eigenvalues because the operator squared ends up being the identity matrix?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices satisfy \u03c3_i \u00b7 \u03c3_j = \u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k. So, the product \u03c3_i \u03c3_j = \u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k. Therefore, when we compute (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2, it would be (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)\u00b7(\u03c3 \u00b7 n) = \u03c3_i \u03c3_j n_i n_j. Summing over i and j. Using the identity above, this becomes (\u03b4_ij I + i \u03b5_{ijk} \u03c3_k) n_i n_j. The first term is \u03b4_ij n_i n_j I, which is (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) I = I. The second term is i \u03b5_{ijk} n_i n_j \u03c3_k. But the epsilon term involves a sum over i and j of \u03b5_{ijk} n_i n_j. However, notice that \u03b5_{ijk} n_i n_j is antisymmetric under exchange of i and j, but n_i n_j is symmetric. So their product is zero. Therefore, the cross terms vanish, so (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I. Therefore, the square of the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n is the identity matrix. \n\nTherefore, if (\u03c3 \u00b7 n)^2 = I, then the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n must satisfy \u03bb\u00b2 = 1, so the eigenvalues are \u00b11. Therefore, the operator \u03c3 \u00b7 n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. \n\nNow, the Hamiltonian H is \u03b5 multiplied by that operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So they should be \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), so the eigenvalues are +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is \"+\u03b5, -\u03b5\". Option C has \u03b5 multiplied by hbar over 2, but that might be a common confusion. Wait, let me think again. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves are 2x2 matrices with entries like [[0,1],[1,0]] for \u03c3_x, etc. Their eigenvalues are indeed \u00b11. But in some contexts, when dealing with spin operators, we might have S = \u0127/2 \u03c3, so the eigenvalues of S would be \u00b1\u0127/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3 \u00b7 n. So the \u03c3 here is the Pauli vector, so the eigenvalues are indeed \u00b11 multiplied by \u03b5. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Option C might be a trap if someone confuses the Pauli matrices with the actual spin operators which have factors of \u0127/2. But in the given Hamiltonian, it's just \u03b5 times the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues are \u00b1\u03b5. So the answer is B.\n",
