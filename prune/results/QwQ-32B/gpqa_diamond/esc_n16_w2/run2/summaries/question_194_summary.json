      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right? Since each spin can be either +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8?\n\nLet me think. Each spin S1, S2, S3 can be \u00b11. The energy depends on the products of pairs. The partition function Z would be the sum over all configurations of exp[-\u03b2E]. Since E is negative J times the sum of the products, substituting that in gives exp[\u03b2J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)]. So each term in the sum is e^{\u03b2J*(sum of the three pairwise products)}.\n\nI need to calculate all possible combinations. Let me try enumerating all possibilities. Let's list all possible spin configurations. Since there are three spins, each with two options, that's 8 total. Let's see:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n   Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So exponent is 3J\u03b2. So term is e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Exponent is -J\u03b2. So term is e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n   S1S2 =-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Term is e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n   S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. Term e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n   S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. Term e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n   S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3 =-1. Sum: -1+1-1 =-1. Term e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n   S1S2 =1, S1S3 =-1, S2S3 =-1. Sum:1-1-1 =-1. Term e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n   All products are 1 (since -1*-1=1). Sum is 3. So exponent 3J\u03b2. Term e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nNow, let's count how many terms have each exponent. \n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nThe first configuration (all +1) gives exponent 3J\u03b2. The eighth configuration (all -1) also gives exponent 3J\u03b2. So two terms with e^{3J\u03b2}.\n\nThe other six configurations (cases 2-7) each give exponent -J\u03b2. So six terms of e^{-J\u03b2}.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches. Wait, but let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 2 e^{-3J\u03b2} +6e^{J\u03b2} \u2192 No, the exponents are reversed here.\n\nOption B: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2} \u2192 Yes, that's exactly what I have.\n\nOption C: 2e^{2J\u03b2} +6e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 Not matching exponents.\n\nOption D: 6e^{2J\u03b2} +2e^{-2J\u03b2} \u2192 Also different exponents.\n\nTherefore the correct answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for each configuration to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTake configuration 2: S3 is -1. The products:\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1, S1S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1, S2S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct. So exponent is \u03b2J*(-1)? Wait, no, wait, the energy is E = -J*(sum). Wait, the energy is E = -J*(sum of the products). So the exponent in the partition function is -\u03b2E, which would be -\u03b2*(-J)*(sum) = \u03b2J*(sum). So yes, that part is correct. So when the sum is 3, exponent is 3\u03b2J. When the sum is -1, exponent is -\u03b2J. So all the terms are correct.\n\nTherefore, the counts are indeed two terms with e^{3\u03b2J} and six terms with e^{-\u03b2J}. So the answer is B. The options list B as the correct one.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right?\n\nFirst, each spin can be either +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I should list all the states and calculate their energies, then compute the Boltzmann factors for each and sum them up.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think. The energy expression is a sum of products of pairs. Each term in the energy is a product of two spins. Since each spin is \u00b11, each product S_iS_j is either +1 or -1. So the total energy is -J times the sum of those three terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on their energy. Let's see. The possible values of the energy depend on how many of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1 or -1. Let's see what possible values the energy can take.\n\nThe sum inside the brackets, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, can range from -3 (if all three products are -1) to +3 (if all three are +1). So the energy E would be -J*(sum), so the minimum energy is -J*3 and maximum is +3J. Wait, no, when sum is 3, E = -J*3, which is the lowest energy. Wait, actually, the energy is -J times the sum. So when the sum is maximum (3), the energy is -3J (the ground state), and when the sum is minimum (-3), the energy is +3J (the highest energy state). So the possible energies are -3J, -J, +J, +3J? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's see.\n\nWait, the sum of three terms each of which is \u00b11 can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let's see: For three terms, possible sums are 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), -3 (all -1). So the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 are 3, 1, -1, -3. Therefore, the energy E would be -J*(sum), so the possible energies are:\n\n-3J*(when sum is 3?), no wait: If the sum is 3, then E is -J*(3) = -3J. If the sum is 1, E = -J*(1) = -J. Sum -1 gives E = J. Sum -3 gives E=3J. So the possible energy levels are -3J, -J, +J, +3J.\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-\u03b2E}. So I need to find how many states correspond to each energy level, then multiply the count by e^{-\u03b2E} for each level and add them up.\n\nSo first, let's find the number of states for each energy.\n\nStarting with the energy -3J. This occurs when the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3. That happens when each of the three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is +1. Let's see what spin configurations give that.\n\nSuppose all three spins are the same. Let's see: if S1, S2, S3 are all +1, then each product is 1*1 =1. So the sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is (-1)(-1)=1, so sum is also 3. Wait, wait! Wait, if all spins are -1, then S1S2 = (+1), so the sum would still be 3. Wait, so that's two states (all +1 and all -1) where the sum is 3. Therefore, energy -3J has 2 states.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check again. Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So that's one state. Similarly, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 gives the same products, so that's another state. So total of 2 states for the highest energy (lowest energy, actually, since E=-3J). \n\nNext, the energy -J: this corresponds to the sum being 1. So how many states have the sum equal to 1?\n\nHmm. Let's think. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 =1. Let me think of possible configurations. Let's see, maybe two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but the total sum is 1? Let's see: 2*1 + (-1) = 1. So yes, two +1 and one -1 gives sum 1. Alternatively, other combinations?\n\nWait, but how do these products relate to the spins? Let's think of how the spins can be arranged so that exactly two of the three products are +1 and one is -1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider possible spin configurations and count. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten in terms of the squares. Wait, perhaps (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i\u00b2 is 1, so that gives (sum)^2 = 3 + 2*(sum of products). Therefore, the sum of products is [(sum)^2 -3]/2. So the energy E = -J*(sum of products) = -J*[(sum)^2 -3]/2. \n\nHmm, but maybe this is complicating things. Let's think in terms of how many states give each sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of states for each possible sum. Let me try to think of the possible spin configurations:\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me list all 8 possibilities, but that might take time. Alternatively, think of the number of +1 spins.\n\nCase 1: All three spins are +1. Then sum is 3, energy -3J. Count:1 state (all +1), plus another when all are -1? Wait, no. Wait, if all are -1, then each product is (+1), so sum is 3 as well. So two states here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, all spins being -1: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = (+1), S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So sum is 3. So those two states (all +1 and all -1) each give sum 3. So total of 2 states for sum 3.\n\nNow, next case: two spins +1 and one spin -1. Let's see how that affects the sum.\n\nSuppose two are +1, one -1. Let's pick S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Wait, that gives a sum of -1. Hmm, so that would be a sum of -1, leading to energy J. Wait, so for two +1 and one -1, perhaps the sum is -1?\n\nWait, let me check another example. Let me take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1 again. \n\nHmm, another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 (already considered). Let's try another two up, one down. All configurations with two +1 and one -1: there are 3 such states (since the -1 can be in any of the three spins). Each of those gives sum of -1. \n\nWait, but let's see. Let me calculate the sum for each of these three states. \n\nFirst state: (S1,S2,S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSecond state: (+1, -1, +1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =1, S2S3 =-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nThird state: (-1, +1, +1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 =-1, S1S3 =-1, S2S3 =1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 =-1. \n\nSo all three of those states give sum = -1. So their energy is E = -J*(-1) = +J. \n\nSo those three states contribute to the energy level +J. \n\nNow, what about when two spins are -1 and one is +1?\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. \n\nProducts: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1 again? Wait, no: Wait S1S2 is (-1)(-1) =1, S1S3 is (-1)(+1) =-1, S2S3 is (-1)(+1) =-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1. Wait, same as before. Wait, so even when two spins are -1 and one is +1, the sum is also -1? Wait, let's check another.\n\nTake S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then products: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =1, S2S3 =-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. \n\nHmm, so those three states (two -1 and one +1) also have sum -1. So that's another three states contributing to the same energy level of +J. Wait, so total of 6 states (3 with two +1 and one -1, and 3 with two -1 and one +1) giving sum -1? Wait, no, actually, when two are -1 and one is +1, there are 3 such states as well, so total of 6 states with sum -1? Wait, but hold on, when two are -1 and one is +1, that's three states, and when two are +1 and one -1, that's another three. So total of 6 states with sum -1. Wait, but in the first case (two +1 and one -1), each of the three gives sum -1, and similarly for the other three. So total of 6 states with sum -1. \n\nWait, so that would mean the energy +J (since sum is -1, E = -J*(-1) = J) has 6 states. \n\nWait, but then what about the other energy levels?\n\nWhat about when the sum is 1?\n\nHmm. Let's see. How can the sum of the three products be 1?\n\nTo get a sum of 1, the three terms (each \u00b11) must add up to 1. So that would be two of them are +1 and one is -1? Wait, no: 2*1 + (-1) = 1. Wait, so two +1 and one -1. But in the previous case, when we had two spins of one kind and one of the other, the sum was -1. Wait, so maybe this is conflicting?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine. \n\nWait, when the spins are two + and one -, the sum of the products was -1. But how can we get a sum of +1?\n\nHmm, perhaps when all three products are +1 except one? Wait, let me think of another scenario. For example, maybe when one spin is different from the other two, but arranged in a way that two products are +1 and one is -1, but arranged such that the total sum is 1. Wait, perhaps I need to look for configurations where the sum of products is +1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way to get a sum of +1 is when exactly two of the products are +1 and one is -1? Because 2 -1 =1. \n\nWait, but in the previous case when we had two + spins and one -, the sum of products was -1, not +1. So maybe I need to find a different configuration. \n\nWait, maybe the case when all three spins are different? Wait, but with three spins, you can't have all different. Wait, maybe the case when one spin is + and the other two are -, but arranged in a way that the products sum to 1? Hmm, maybe not. Let me try an example.\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is 3 (already considered).\n\nIf S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1, then as before, the sum is -1. \n\nWhat if the spins are arranged in a different pattern. Let me think of another configuration.\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1 again. \n\nHmm, how about another case: Let me see if there's a configuration where two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but the sum is +1. \n\nWait, let's see: Let me think of a case where two products are +1 and one is -1. Then the sum is 1. But how can that happen? Let me think of a configuration where that's possible.\n\nWait, let me try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. That gives three +1 products. \n\nWait, maybe if one spin is different, but arranged such that two products are positive and one negative. For instance, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 (all positive) gives sum 3. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider a case where two spins are +1 and one spin is -1, but arranged so that the products sum to +1. Wait, but earlier examples gave sum -1. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of another configuration. Let me take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then the products are S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different way. Let me think of a configuration where two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but arranged differently. Wait, maybe the only way for the sum to be 1 is when two of the products are +1 and one is -1. But in all the cases where two spins are + and one -, the sum of products is -1, so that doesn't give sum 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that such a configuration exists. Let me check all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum can only be 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, no, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Let me see:\n\nThe sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all over 2. Since each S_i^2 is 1, that would be ( (sum)^2 - 3 ) / 2. So the sum of products is [(sum)^2 -3]/2. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of the sum of products depend on the sum of spins. Let me let S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then sum of products is (S\u00b2 -3)/2. \n\nSo the possible values of S are: since each spin is \u00b11, the sum S can be -3, -1, +1, +3. \n\nSo when S=3 (all +1), then sum of products is (9-3)/2 = 3. That's correct. \n\nWhen S=1 (two +1 and one -1), then (1 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So the sum of products is -1. \n\nSimilarly, when S=-1 (two -1 and one +1), same as S=1 but negative, so same result. \n\nWhen S=-3 (all -1), sum of products is (9-3)/2 = 3 again. \n\nAh! So the sum of products can be 3, -1, or 3 again? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, when S=1, sum products is (1^2 -3)/2 = (1-3)/2 = -1. \n\nWhen S=-1, same as S=1, because (-1)^2 is 1, so same result. \n\nThus the sum of products can only be 3, -1, or when S=0? Wait, can the sum S be zero?\n\nWait, can S1 + S2 + S3 be zero? Since each is \u00b11, three spins: the total sum can be 3,1,-1,-3. Because 3 is all +1, 1 is two + and one -, etc. To get zero, you need an equal number of + and -, but three is odd. So S can't be zero. So the possible sums S are 3,1,-1,-3. \n\nThus, the sum of products can be 3 (when S=\u00b13), or -1 (when S=\u00b11). Therefore, the possible values of the sum of products are only 3 and -1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait:\n\nWait, let me recast this. The sum of the products can only take two possible values? \n\nWait, no. Wait, let me compute again. For S=1: sum products = (1)^2-3 /2 = (1-3)/2 = -1. \n\nFor S=3: (9-3)/2=3. \n\nFor S=-1: same as S=1, because squaring. \n\nFor S=-3: same as S=3. \n\nSo the sum of products can only be 3 or -1. Wait that's surprising. Then the possible energies are -J*(3) = -3J, and -J*(-1)=+J. \n\nWait, so there are only two possible energy levels: -3J and +J? But that contradicts my earlier thought that there might be a sum of 1. \n\nHmm, so according to this formula, the sum of products is either 3 (when all spins are same) or -1 (when two are same and one different). So that means the energy E is either -3J or +J. \n\nWait, so that would mean that the possible energies are only two levels: -3J (when all spins aligned) and +J (when two aligned and one opposite). But then where did I get the idea that sum could be 1? Because according to this formula, the sum of products can't be 1. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that I made a mistake earlier in thinking that the sum can be 1. \n\nWait, let's see: the formula says that the sum of products is (S\u00b2 - 3)/2. \n\nIf S is 1, then (1 -3)/2 = -1. So the sum of products is -1. So the energy is -J*(-1)=+J. \n\nSo the possible energy levels are:\n\n-3J (when S=\u00b13),\n\nand +J (when S=\u00b11).\n\nTherefore, there are only two energy levels. \n\nWait, then that's different from my initial thought. So that would mean that the possible energies are only two values: the lowest energy is -3J (all spins aligned), and then the other energy level is +J (when two are aligned and one opposite). \n\nTherefore, how many states correspond to each energy?\n\nFor the energy -3J: when all spins are aligned. There are two states (all +1 or all -1). \n\nFor the energy +J: when the sum of spins is \u00b11. That occurs when there are two of one spin and one of the other. \n\nThe number of such states is the number of ways to have two +1 and one -1, plus the number of ways to have two -1 and one +1. \n\nEach of these is C(3,1) = 3. So total of 3 + 3 =6 states. \n\nThus, the partition function Z is sum_{states} e^{-\u03b2E} = (number of states with energy -3J)*e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} + (number of states with energy +J)*e^{-\u03b2*(+J)}. \n\nSo that would be 2 * e^{3\u03b2J} + 6 * e^{-\u03b2J}. \n\nTherefore, the partition function Z = 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option B. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo yes, option B matches. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm that I didn't make any mistake here. Let me double-check. \n\nThe energy for all spins aligned (either all +1 or all -1) is E = -J*(3) = -3J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3\u03b2J}. And there are two such states, so 2e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nFor the other states (two of one spin and one of the other), the energy is E = -J*(-1) = +J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-\u03b2*J}. There are 6 such states (3 with two + and one -, and 3 with two - and one +), so 6e^{-\u03b2J}. \n\nSo yes, adding those gives Z=2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which is option B. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B. \n\nBut wait, initially I thought there might be an energy level at -J, but according to this, that's not the case. So I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis when I thought the sum could be 1, but according to the formula, the sum of products can only be 3 or -1. So the energies are only -3J and +J. \n\nTherefore, the correct partition function is B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right?\n\nFirst, each spin can be either +1 or -1. Since there are three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I should list all the states and calculate their energies, then compute the Boltzmann factors for each and sum them up.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think. The energy expression is a sum of products of pairs. Each term in the energy is a product of two spins. Since each spin is \u00b11, each product S_iS_j is either +1 or -1. So the total energy is -J times the sum of those three terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on their energy. Let's see. The possible values of the energy depend on how many of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1 or -1. Let's see what possible values the energy can take.\n\nThe sum inside the brackets, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, can range from -3 (if all three products are -1) to +3 (if all three are +1). So the energy E would be -J*(sum), so the minimum energy is -J*3 and maximum is +3J. Wait, no, when sum is 3, E = -J*3, which is the lowest energy. Wait, actually, the energy is -J times the sum. So when the sum is maximum (3), the energy is -3J (the ground state), and when the sum is minimum (-3), the energy is +3J (the highest energy state). So the possible energies are -3J, -J, +J, +3J? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's see.\n\nWait, the sum of three terms each of which is \u00b11 can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let's see: For three terms, possible sums are 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), -3 (all -1). So the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 are 3, 1, -1, -3. Therefore, the energy E would be -J*(sum), so the possible energies are:\n\n-3J*(when sum is 3?), no wait: If the sum is 3, then E is -J*(3) = -3J. If the sum is 1, E = -J*(1) = -J. Sum -1 gives E = J. Sum -3 gives E=3J. So the possible energy levels are -3J, -J, +J, +3J.\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-\u03b2E}. So I need to find how many states correspond to each energy level, then multiply the count by e^{-\u03b2E} for each level and add them up.\n\nSo first, let's find the number of states for each energy.\n\nStarting with the energy -3J. This occurs when the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3. That happens when each of the three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is +1. Let's see what spin configurations give that.\n\nSuppose all three spins are the same. Let's see: if S1, S2, S3 are all +1, then each product is 1*1 =1. So the sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is (-1)(-1)=1, so sum is also 3. Wait, wait! Wait, if all spins are -1, then S1S2 = (+1), so the sum would still be 3. Wait, so that's two states (all +1 and all -1) where the sum is 3. Therefore, energy -3J has 2 states.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check again. Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So that's one state. Similarly, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 gives the same products, so that's another state. So total of 2 states for the highest energy (lowest energy, actually, since E=-3J). \n\nNext, the energy -J: this corresponds to the sum being 1. So how many states have the sum equal to 1?\n\nHmm. Let's think. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 =1. Let me think of possible configurations. Let's see, maybe two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but the total sum is 1? Let's see: 2*1 + (-1) = 1. So yes, two +1 and one -1 gives sum 1. Alternatively, other combinations?\n\nWait, but how do these products relate to the spins? Let's think of how the spins can be arranged so that exactly two of the three products are +1 and one is -1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider possible spin configurations and count. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten in terms of the squares. Wait, perhaps (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1\u00b2 + S2\u00b2 + S3\u00b2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i\u00b2 is 1, so that gives (sum)^2 = 3 + 2*(sum of products). Therefore, the sum of products is [(sum)^2 -3]/2. So the energy E = -J*(sum of products) = -J*[(sum)^2 -3]/2. \n\nHmm, but maybe this is complicating things. Let's think in terms of how many states give each sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of states for each possible sum. Let me try to think of the possible spin configurations:\n\nEach spin can be +1 or -1. Let me list all 8 possibilities, but that might take time. Alternatively, think of the number of +1 spins.\n\nCase 1: All three spins are +1. Then sum is 3, energy -3J. Count:1 state (all +1), plus another when all are -1? Wait, no. Wait, if all are -1, then each product is (+1), so sum is 3 as well. So two states here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, all spins being -1: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = (+1), S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So sum is 3. So those two states (all +1 and all -1) each give sum 3. So total of 2 states for sum 3.\n\nNow, next case: two spins +1 and one spin -1. Let's see how that affects the sum.\n\nSuppose two are +1, one -1. Let's pick S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThen S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Wait, that gives a sum of -1. Hmm, so that would be a sum of -1, leading to energy J. Wait, so for two +1 and one -1, perhaps the sum is -1?\n\nWait, let me check another example. Let me take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1 again. \n\nHmm, another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 (already considered). Let's try another two up, one down. All configurations with two +1 and one -1: there are 3 such states (since the -1 can be in any of the three spins). Each of those gives sum of -1. \n\nWait, but let's see. Let me calculate the sum for each of these three states. \n\nFirst state: (S1,S2,S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nSecond state: (+1, -1, +1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =1, S2S3 =-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nThird state: (-1, +1, +1):\n\nProducts: S1S2 =-1, S1S3 =-1, S2S3 =1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 =-1. \n\nSo all three of those states give sum = -1. So their energy is E = -J*(-1) = +J. \n\nSo those three states contribute to the energy level +J. \n\nNow, what about when two spins are -1 and one is +1?\n\nLet's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. \n\nProducts: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1 again? Wait, no: Wait S1S2 is (-1)(-1) =1, S1S3 is (-1)(+1) =-1, S2S3 is (-1)(+1) =-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1. Wait, same as before. Wait, so even when two spins are -1 and one is +1, the sum is also -1? Wait, let's check another.\n\nTake S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then products: S1S2 = -1, S1S3 =1, S2S3 =-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. \n\nHmm, so those three states (two -1 and one +1) also have sum -1. So that's another three states contributing to the same energy level of +J. Wait, so total of 6 states (3 with two +1 and one -1, and 3 with two -1 and one +1) giving sum -1? Wait, no, actually, when two are -1 and one is +1, there are 3 such states as well, so total of 6 states with sum -1? Wait, but hold on, when two are -1 and one is +1, that's three states, and when two are +1 and one -1, that's another three. So total of 6 states with sum -1. Wait, but in the first case (two +1 and one -1), each of the three gives sum -1, and similarly for the other three. So total of 6 states with sum -1. \n\nWait, so that would mean the energy +J (since sum is -1, E = -J*(-1) = J) has 6 states. \n\nWait, but then what about the other energy levels?\n\nWhat about when the sum is 1?\n\nHmm. Let's see. How can the sum of the three products be 1?\n\nTo get a sum of 1, the three terms (each \u00b11) must add up to 1. So that would be two of them are +1 and one is -1? Wait, no: 2*1 + (-1) = 1. Wait, so two +1 and one -1. But in the previous case, when we had two spins of one kind and one of the other, the sum was -1. Wait, so maybe this is conflicting?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine. \n\nWait, when the spins are two + and one -, the sum of the products was -1. But how can we get a sum of +1?\n\nHmm, perhaps when all three products are +1 except one? Wait, let me think of another scenario. For example, maybe when one spin is different from the other two, but arranged in a way that two products are +1 and one is -1, but arranged such that the total sum is 1. Wait, perhaps I need to look for configurations where the sum of products is +1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way to get a sum of +1 is when exactly two of the products are +1 and one is -1? Because 2 -1 =1. \n\nWait, but in the previous case when we had two + spins and one -, the sum of products was -1, not +1. So maybe I need to find a different configuration. \n\nWait, maybe the case when all three spins are different? Wait, but with three spins, you can't have all different. Wait, maybe the case when one spin is + and the other two are -, but arranged in a way that the products sum to 1? Hmm, maybe not. Let me try an example.\n\nSuppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: sum is 3 (already considered).\n\nIf S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1, then as before, the sum is -1. \n\nWhat if the spins are arranged in a different pattern. Let me think of another configuration.\n\nWait, let's take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1 again. \n\nHmm, how about another case: Let me see if there's a configuration where two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but the sum is +1. \n\nWait, let's see: Let me think of a case where two products are +1 and one is -1. Then the sum is 1. But how can that happen? Let me think of a configuration where that's possible.\n\nWait, let me try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. That gives three +1 products. \n\nWait, maybe if one spin is different, but arranged such that two products are positive and one negative. For instance, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 (all positive) gives sum 3. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider a case where two spins are +1 and one spin is -1, but arranged so that the products sum to +1. Wait, but earlier examples gave sum -1. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of another configuration. Let me take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then the products are S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different way. Let me think of a configuration where two of the products are +1 and one is -1, but arranged differently. Wait, maybe the only way for the sum to be 1 is when two of the products are +1 and one is -1. But in all the cases where two spins are + and one -, the sum of products is -1, so that doesn't give sum 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that such a configuration exists. Let me check all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum can only be 3, 1, -1, -3? Wait, no, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Let me see:\n\nThe sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all over 2. Since each S_i^2 is 1, that would be ( (sum)^2 - 3 ) / 2. So the sum of products is [(sum)^2 -3]/2. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of the sum of products depend on the sum of spins. Let me let S = S1 + S2 + S3. Then sum of products is (S\u00b2 -3)/2. \n\nSo the possible values of S are: since each spin is \u00b11, the sum S can be -3, -1, +1, +3. \n\nSo when S=3 (all +1), then sum of products is (9-3)/2 = 3. That's correct. \n\nWhen S=1 (two +1 and one -1), then (1 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So the sum of products is -1. \n\nSimilarly, when S=-1 (two -1 and one +1), same as S=1 but negative, so same result. \n\nWhen S=-3 (all -1), sum of products is (9-3)/2 = 3 again. \n\nAh! So the sum of products can be 3, -1, or 3 again? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, when S=1, sum products is (1^2 -3)/2 = (1-3)/2 = -1. \n\nWhen S=-1, same as S=1, because (-1)^2 is 1, so same result. \n\nThus the sum of products can only be 3, -1, or when S=0? Wait, can the sum S be zero?\n\nWait, can S1 + S2 + S3 be zero? Since each is \u00b11, three spins: the total sum can be 3,1,-1,-3. Because 3 is all +1, 1 is two + and one -, etc. To get zero, you need an equal number of + and -, but three is odd. So S can't be zero. So the possible sums S are 3,1,-1,-3. \n\nThus, the sum of products can be 3 (when S=\u00b13), or -1 (when S=\u00b11). Therefore, the possible values of the sum of products are only 3 and -1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait:\n\nWait, let me recast this. The sum of the products can only take two possible values? \n\nWait, no. Wait, let me compute again. For S=1: sum products = (1)^2-3 /2 = (1-3)/2 = -1. \n\nFor S=3: (9-3)/2=3. \n\nFor S=-1: same as S=1, because squaring. \n\nFor S=-3: same as S=3. \n\nSo the sum of products can only be 3 or -1. Wait that's surprising. Then the possible energies are -J*(3) = -3J, and -J*(-1)=+J. \n\nWait, so there are only two possible energy levels: -3J and +J? But that contradicts my earlier thought that there might be a sum of 1. \n\nHmm, so according to this formula, the sum of products is either 3 (when all spins are same) or -1 (when two are same and one different). So that means the energy E is either -3J or +J. \n\nWait, so that would mean that the possible energies are only two levels: -3J (when all spins aligned) and +J (when two aligned and one opposite). But then where did I get the idea that sum could be 1? Because according to this formula, the sum of products can't be 1. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that I made a mistake earlier in thinking that the sum can be 1. \n\nWait, let's see: the formula says that the sum of products is (S\u00b2 - 3)/2. \n\nIf S is 1, then (1 -3)/2 = -1. So the sum of products is -1. So the energy is -J*(-1)=+J. \n\nSo the possible energy levels are:\n\n-3J (when S=\u00b13),\n\nand +J (when S=\u00b11).\n\nTherefore, there are only two energy levels. \n\nWait, then that's different from my initial thought. So that would mean that the possible energies are only two values: the lowest energy is -3J (all spins aligned), and then the other energy level is +J (when two are aligned and one opposite). \n\nTherefore, how many states correspond to each energy?\n\nFor the energy -3J: when all spins are aligned. There are two states (all +1 or all -1). \n\nFor the energy +J: when the sum of spins is \u00b11. That occurs when there are two of one spin and one of the other. \n\nThe number of such states is the number of ways to have two +1 and one -1, plus the number of ways to have two -1 and one +1. \n\nEach of these is C(3,1) = 3. So total of 3 + 3 =6 states. \n\nThus, the partition function Z is sum_{states} e^{-\u03b2E} = (number of states with energy -3J)*e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} + (number of states with energy +J)*e^{-\u03b2*(+J)}. \n\nSo that would be 2 * e^{3\u03b2J} + 6 * e^{-\u03b2J}. \n\nTherefore, the partition function Z = 2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option B. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nSo yes, option B matches. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm that I didn't make any mistake here. Let me double-check. \n\nThe energy for all spins aligned (either all +1 or all -1) is E = -J*(3) = -3J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3\u03b2J}. And there are two such states, so 2e^{3\u03b2J}.\n\nFor the other states (two of one spin and one of the other), the energy is E = -J*(-1) = +J. So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-\u03b2*J}. There are 6 such states (3 with two + and one -, and 3 with two - and one +), so 6e^{-\u03b2J}. \n\nSo yes, adding those gives Z=2e^{3J\u03b2} +6e^{-J\u03b2}, which is option B. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B. \n\nBut wait, initially I thought there might be an energy level at -J, but according to this, that's not the case. So I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis when I thought the sum could be 1, but according to the formula, the sum of products can only be 3 or -1. So the energies are only -3J and +J. \n\nTherefore, the correct partition function is B.\n\n\nThe partition function \\( Z \\) is calculated by summing \\( e^{-\\beta E} \\) over all possible states. The energy \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\). \n\nThe sum \\( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\) can be expressed using \\( (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 3 \\) divided by 2. The possible values of \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \\) (the total spin) are \\( \\pm 3 \\) or \\( \\pm 1 \\). \n\n- When the total spin is \\( \\pm 3 \\), the sum of products is \\( 3 \\), leading to energy \\( E = -3J \\). There are 2 such states (all spins \\( +1 \\) or all \\( -1 \\)).\n- When the total spin is \\( \\pm 1 \\), the sum of products is \\( -1 \\), leading to energy \\( E = +J \\). There are \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\) such states (two \\( +1 \\) and one \\( -1 \\), or two \\( -1 \\) and one \\( +1 \\)).\n\nThus, the partition function is:\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3\\beta J} + 6e^{-\\beta J}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: B) \\( Z = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} \\).\n\nANSWER: B\n\nAnswer: $B",
