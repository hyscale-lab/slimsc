      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the reactions described. I need to figure out what compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are first. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nStarting with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide or maybe a compound like copper(II) sulfate, but wait, the color red could also point to iron(III) oxide, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination compound? Wait, another possibility: the bright red solid might be something like mercury(II) iodide? Or maybe lead(II) iodide? Hmm, not sure. Let me think of common red solids that form from reactions with gases.\n\nWait, the reaction of a solid with a gas. Let me think of common reactions. For example, copper metal reacting with sulfur? But sulfur isn't a gas. Maybe iron reacting with sulfur? But again, sulfur is a solid. Alternatively, maybe the solid is a metal reacting with a gas. Let me think of another angle.\n\nThe product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.\n\nLet me think of possible candidates for the reactions. Let's see: C reacting with water to form A plus two acids. So maybe C is a metal oxide or a metal sulfide? Let's think step by step.\n\nThe bright red product C might be something like iron(III) oxide, but iron(III) oxide is more of a reddish-brown, like rust. Alternatively, maybe mercury(II) oxide? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate? Wait, another possibility: the bright red solid could be something like lead(II) iodide (PbI2), but that's yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the solid A is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? No, not sure. Alternatively, think of the reaction of copper with something. Wait, if the product C is red, perhaps it's copper(I) oxide? Copper(I) oxide is red, but maybe more likely, maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, another angle: the reaction of a solid metal with a gas to form a red product. Let me think of mercury(I) chloride? No, that's a red precipitate, but mercury(I) is Hg2^2+. But mercury(I) chloride is calomel, which is white? Or maybe Hg2Cl2 is calomel and is white. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is lead, and the gas B is something like iodine vapor? But lead and iodine reacting would form lead(II) iodide, which is yellow. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is antimony? No, not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: if C reacts with water to form A and two acids. Let's consider that. Suppose A is a metal. If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water might form the metal hydroxide plus an acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide? For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. But then where would the two acids come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? If the metal carbonate reacts with water, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's consider the product E. It's formed from C reacting with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. Then E is hazardous. Maybe E is a toxic gas? Like phosgene (COCl2) or something else. But need to see the steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the solvent H. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents made from a 1:1 reaction of two gases. For example, H could be something like sulfuric acid? No, that's not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is a compound like ethanol, but ethanol is made from ethylene and water? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is a common solvent like acetone, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, if B and D react in 1:1 to form a solvent. Let's think of possible gases. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is C2H2 (acetylene), then maybe they form something? Not sure. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is something else?\n\nWait, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol? But how would that form from gases? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They can form NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is something else.\n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of D and B forming a solvent. Let's think of common solvents made from gases. Maybe D is SO2 and B is something? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is SO3 and D is H2O, but that would form sulfuric acid. But the question says D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. Maybe H is something like ethanol? Or maybe diethyl ether?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is a common one like acetone? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is CO? Then reacting in 1:1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between CO and O2? Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps D is NO2 and B is something else?\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the product C, which when reacts with water, gives back A plus two acids F and G, with F being a strong acid and G a weak one. So perhaps C is a metal oxide? For example, if A is a metal, then maybe the oxide of the metal reacts with water to form the hydroxide (which would be A's hydroxide) plus an acid? Wait, no. Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate, but then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's think: for example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water could produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (a weak acid). But then where's the strong acid? Unless there's another product. Maybe if the metal is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate? Like Na2CO3 reacting with water would give NaOH (a strong base) and CO3^2-? Not acids.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride? But then reacting with water wouldn't give acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal oxide, like PbO. Then, reacting with water would form Pb(OH)2, which is a weak base, but maybe the other acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the oxide is something that hydrolyzes into two acids. Wait, perhaps if the oxide is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed produces both a strong and weak acid? For example, perhaps if C is a metal peroxide? No, peroxides react with water to form hydroxides and H2O2, which is a weak acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, nitrate in water would dissociate but not form acids. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, so maybe HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH, HCN, H2CO3, etc.\n\nIf the reaction of C with water gives two acids, perhaps the metal's oxide reacts with water to form the metal hydroxide (which would be a base) plus an acid? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide and the reaction with water produces an acid and the metal? Like, for example, maybe the oxide is something like Al2O3 reacting with water and acid? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, which reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (a weak acid). But then where's the strong acid? Unless there's another product. Maybe if the metal is something else. Alternatively, maybe the sulfide is of a more reactive metal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride. For example, Na3N reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and NH3 (weak base). But that's bases, not acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed forms a strong acid and another acid. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose A is a metal like lead. Let's see:\n\nSuppose solid A is Pb, and gas B is O2. But reacting Pb with O2 would form PbO, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe Pb reacts with another gas. Wait, if B is Cl2 gas, then Pb + Cl2 could form PbCl4? But lead(IV) chloride is a white solid, I think. Not red. Alternatively, maybe Pb reacting with something else.\n\nWait, another thought: the bright red product C could be mercuric iodide? Wait, HgI2 is red. Let me check. Yes, mercury(II) iodide is red. So maybe A is Hg (mercury), and B is I2 gas? Wait, but I2 is a solid at room temperature, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas. So if A is solid Hg, and B is I2 vapor, then reacting in 8 equivalents would form HgI4? Wait, the formula would need to balance. Let's see: 2 Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 2 HgI2? Wait, that's 2 Hg and 4 I2? No, that would be 2 HgI4? Wait, no. Let me calculate. Hg has a +2 charge. Each I2 is I^-? Wait, no, iodine is I2 molecules. Wait, maybe the reaction is Hg (s) + I2 (g) \u2192 HgI2 (s). But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas B) with solid A. So if the formula is HgI4, then maybe 2 Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 2 HgI4? No, that doesn't balance. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is Hg2I2? No, but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is another metal. Let me think of another possibility. Let's try to think of the reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in 8 equivalents. Maybe the metal is something like iron, and the gas is chlorine? Let's see, Fe + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3. But FeCl3 is a solid but not red. Alternatively, maybe Fe reacts with S (sulfur), but that's a solid.\n\nWait, the bright red product could be copper(II) oxide? Wait, copper(II) oxide is black. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's copper(I) oxide, which is red? I think copper(I) oxide is red. Let me confirm. Yes, copper(I) oxide is red. So if solid A is copper metal, and gas B is something like oxygen? But copper oxide would be formed with O2. The reaction might be 4 Cu + O2 \u2192 2 Cu2O (copper(I) oxide). Wait, that uses 4 Cu and 1 O2. So if the equivalents are 8 of B (O2) with A (Cu), then maybe the stoichiometry would be 8 moles of O2 per 16 moles of Cu? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with nitric acid? But B is a gas. Nitric acid is a liquid. Wait, the gas B could be NO2? If the solid is copper reacting with nitric acid (which is a liquid), but the question says gas B. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of copper with sulfur dioxide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the product E, which is hazardous. If C is Cu2O, then reacting with D (maybe a gas like HCl?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 again?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach step by step again.\n\nThe product C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E (hazardous). Also, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus acids F and G. Let's see, if C is Cu2O (copper(I) oxide), then reacting with water might not produce much. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with water is an acid-base reaction. Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that's basic, and when it reacts with water, it forms a base (like the metal hydroxide) and an acid? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the two acids are from the hydrolysis of a salt. Suppose C is a metal salt. For example, suppose C is Pb(NO3)2. Then, reacting with water might form Pb(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, and Pb(OH)2 is a weak base. But then where would the second acid come from? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a different anion. Let me think of another possibility.\n\nWait, another thought: the reaction of a metal with a halogen. Let's think of lead reacting with iodine. If A is Pb and B is I2 (gas), then the product C would be PbI2 or PbI4. Let's see, the reaction: Pb + 2 I2 \u2192 PbI4? The stoichiometry here would be 1 mole Pb with 2 moles I2. But the question states 8 equivalents of B (I2) with A (Pb). So perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe PbI4 is the product. Then the reaction would be Pb + 2 I2 \u2192 PbI4, so 1 mole Pb and 2 moles I2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B, so maybe the formula requires more. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 Pb + 4 I2 \u2192 2 PbI4? Then that would be 2 moles Pb with 4 moles I2. Still not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe the formula is PbI6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let me think of mercury. If A is Hg, then reacting with I2 would form HgI2 (mercury(II) iodide, which is red). The reaction is Hg + I2 \u2192 HgI2. So 1 mole Hg with 1 mole I2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (I2) with A (Hg), so that would require 8 moles I2 per mole Hg. That would give HgI8? Not likely. Maybe it's a different stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 HgI8? Not sure, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is something else. Let's think of the hazardous product E. If E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is toxic. To form phosgene, maybe the reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 COCl2 (phosgene), but then D would be Cl2 and B would be CO? Wait, but D is a gas that reacts with C to form E. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), but that's made from H2 and O2, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe D and B are HCl and NH3 forming NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2S and D is SO2, then they can form thiosulfuric acid? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. Wait, another possibility: the solvent H could be ethanol. Ethanol is made from ethylene (C2H4) and water, but that's a 1:1 ratio? Ethylene plus H2O in presence of catalyst forms ethanol. So if B is C2H4 and D is H2O, then 1:1. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas? Depending on conditions. Maybe under high temp/pressure, H2O could be a gas. Then H would be ethanol. But I'm not sure if that's a common solvent. Ethanol is a solvent, yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like methanol, made from CO and H2. But that requires more steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me see the options for the symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. These are point groups. The question is asking for the molecular symmetry group of E. So E must be a molecule whose point group is one of these. Let's think of what molecules have those symmetry groups.\n\nC2: a molecule with a C2 axis and no other symmetry elements. For example, something like trans-1,2-dichloroethylene might have C2 symmetry? Or maybe a bent molecule with two different substituents on the ends. Wait, maybe like a molecule with a C2 axis but no planes. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a linear molecule with two different atoms on each end, but that would have C\u221ev symmetry. Hmm.\n\nD4h: This is the symmetry of a square planar molecule, like XeF4 or [PtCl4]^2-.\n\nD\u221eh: Linear molecules like O2, CO, HCl. These have infinite symmetry along the axis, so their point group is D\u221eh.\n\nC2v: A molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, like water (H2O), or methane (CH4)? Wait, methane is tetrahedral, which is Td symmetry. Wait, C2v is like a molecule with a C2 axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes. For example, something like H2O (bent shape with angle 104.5\u00b0), or something like NH3? Wait, NH3 has C3v symmetry. Wait, maybe something like COCl2 (phosgene), which is planar with C2v symmetry? Because phosgene is O=C=O with Cl on each side? Wait, no. Phosgene is O=C=Cl? No, phosgene is Cl2CO, so the structure is O=C=O? Wait, no. Let me think. Phosgene is Cl2CO, so the structure is O=C=O? No, it's actually O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached to the central carbon? Wait, no. The structure is actually a central carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and a chlorine on each side? No, wait, the correct structure of phosgene is Cl2C=O. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar, with the carbon in the center, double bond to O, and two Cl. The structure would be trigonal planar? Wait, carbon has four bonds: double bond to O and single bonds to two Cl and one more? Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2CO, which is O=C=Cl? Wait, no, the formula is Cl2CO. The structure is O=C-Cl? No, the correct structure is O=C=O with two Cl substituents? Wait, no, actually, phosgene is Cl2C=O. The central carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar, with the central carbon in a trigonal planar arrangement? Wait, carbon in phosgene has three regions of electron density: the double bond to O, and two single bonds to Cl. Wait, double bond counts as one region. So trigonal planar geometry, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The point group would be C2v? Let me think: the molecule is planar, with a C2 axis along the molecule's axis (perpendicular to the plane?), and two mirror planes. So yes, C2v symmetry.\n\nWait, D4h is for square planar, like XeF4. D\u221eh is for linear molecules like CO2 or O2. C2v is for molecules like H2O or phosgene. C2 would be something with only a C2 axis, like maybe a molecule that's not planar. Hmm.\n\nSo if the question is about E's symmetry group, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which would have C2v symmetry. That would make option D) C2v the answer. But I need to confirm that E is indeed phosgene.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the reactions again with this assumption.\n\nAssuming E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then the reaction to form E is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D. Let's see. If D is Cl2 gas, and C is something that can combine with Cl2 to form phosgene. Wait, but phosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. The reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO (phosgene). So in that case, C would be CO (carbon monoxide) and D is Cl2. Then, the formation of E would be CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO. So D is Cl2, and C is CO. But CO is a gas, but the question states that C is a product formed from solid A and gas B. Let me see:\n\nIf C is CO, then how is it formed from A and B? Let's see: solid A reacting with gas B to form CO. For example, if A is carbon (solid) and B is O2, then 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. So that would be forming CO from solid carbon and O2. The product C would be CO, which is a gas. But the question states that C is a bright red product. CO is a colorless gas, so that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is something else. Let's see, if E is phosgene, then D is Cl2 and C is CO. But how does CO come from A and B?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the product C is a metal oxide. Let's think of another possibility where the hazardous product E is something else. Let me consider another approach.\n\nLet me think of the solvent H. If D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's think of H being something like ethanol. If B is ethylene (C2H4) and D is water (H2O), then the reaction would be C2H4 + H2O \u2192 C2H5OH (ethanol). But H2O is a liquid, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas. Then B would be ethylene gas and D is water vapor. Then H is ethanol. That could fit. Then B is ethylene (C2H4), D is H2O. Then the reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D (water) would produce E. Wait, but the question says C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. If D is H2O (gas), then maybe C is something that reacts with two waters. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe H is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). The reaction would require H2 and O2, but they form H2O, not H2O2. Alternatively, maybe another solvent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3). To form that, perhaps the reaction is between two molecules of CH3OH, but that's not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B and D are ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Their reaction gives NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is tough. Let me try to think of the hazardous product E again. Another possibility is that E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is extremely toxic. To form HCN, perhaps the reaction is between C and D, where D is something like NH3 and C is something else. For example, maybe C is a metal cyanide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), but that's a gas, but maybe not considered extremely hazardous. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: the reaction of C with water gives A and two acids. Suppose C is a metal carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, reacting with water would give NaOH (a strong base) and H2CO3 (a weak acid). But the problem states two acids, so maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfate. For example, PbSO4. But reacting with water would not produce acids.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then reacting with water would form Fe(OH)2 (a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). But where's the strong acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is something like lead, so PbS reacting with water gives Pb(OH)2 and H2S. Pb(OH)2 is a weak base, H2S is a weak acid. So again, no strong acid.\n\nHmm. Wait, the strong acid could be HCl. Suppose F is HCl and G is something else. Let's see, if C is a metal chloride, but how would that react with water? Maybe if the metal is something like AlCl3, which in water can form HCl and Al(OH)3. AlCl3 in water hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). But the problem states two acids. So maybe the product is two acids, but one is a base. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces both an acid and a salt. Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Like Pb(NO3)2. Then reacting with water would dissociate into Pb^2+ and nitrate, but nitric acid is a strong acid. But the other product? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with water produces a metal hydroxide (a base) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide that can form two different acids upon hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that can form both a strong and weak acid? For instance, maybe the metal is something like aluminum. Let's think:\n\nIf C is Al2O3, then reacting with water might not do much, but reacting with acid or base. Alternatively, if it's in acidic conditions, maybe it forms Al^3+ and releases H+? Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the strong acid F is H2SO4 and the weak acid G is H3PO4, but that seems random.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is a metal that forms a strong acid when reacted with water. Wait, like Na2O reacts with water to form NaOH (a strong base) and maybe something else. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the first reaction again: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 bright red product C. The bright red color is key here. Maybe the product is mercury(II) iodide (HgI2), which is red. So if A is Hg and B is I2. Let's see:\n\nThe reaction would be Hg (solid) + I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. The stoichiometry is 1:1. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. That doesn't fit. Unless it's a different stoichiometry. Wait, maybe HgI4? Like Hg2I4? Let me think: 2 Hg + 2 I2 \u2192 2 HgI2. So 2 moles Hg with 2 moles I2. Still not 8 equivalents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is PbI2, which is yellow, so that's not red. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: the bright red solid could be iron(III) oxide, but I thought it was more brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), which is red. Let me check: copper(I) oxide is indeed a red solid. So if A is copper and B is oxygen, then the reaction would be 4 Cu + O2 \u2192 2 Cu2O. So here, 4 moles of Cu and 1 mole O2. So the equivalents of B (O2) would be 1 per 4 Cu. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the reaction is scaled up. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 8 Cu + 2 O2 \u2192 4 Cu2O. So that's 8 moles Cu with 2 moles O2. So the ratio is 4:1 Cu to O2. So for 1 mole of A (Cu), you need 0.25 moles of B (O2). But the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction requires more oxygen. For example, if the product is copper(II) oxide (CuO), which is black, but maybe under certain conditions, a different product. Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let me think of another angle. The product E is formed from C reacting with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. Suppose E is a molecule like COCl2 (phosgene), which is formed from CO + Cl2. So if D is Cl2, then C must be CO. But how does CO form from the first reaction?\n\nIf A is carbon (solid) and B is O2, then the reaction would be 2 C (s) + O2 \u2192 2 CO (g). So here, for each mole of A (carbon), you need 0.5 moles of B (O2). But the question states 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let's see: suppose the reaction is 8 C + 4 O2 \u2192 8 CO. Then, for each mole of A (C), 0.5 moles of B (O2). Still not 8 equivalents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between carbon and something else. For example, if B is S (sulfur), but that's a solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl. Wait, Ni(CO)4. The reaction could be Ni (s) + 4 CO \u2192 Ni(CO)4. But the product would be a liquid, not a solid. And Ni(CO)4 is highly toxic, so maybe that's E? But then the bright red product C would be Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Not solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between iron and CO to form Fe(CO)5, but again liquid.\n\nHmm. This is getting me stuck. Let me think of the solvent H again. If H is a solvent made from B and D in 1:1. Let's say H is H2O, but that's a liquid. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: if B is NH3 and D is HCl, their reaction gives NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2O and D is something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if the solvent H is something like sulfuric acid? But that's not a solvent commonly used. Alternatively, maybe it's nitric acid, but again, not a solvent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is a common one like ethanol. As I thought before, maybe the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and water gives ethanol. Then B is C2H4 (ethylene) and D is H2O. But H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something like acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The reaction between acetylene (C2H2) and water could form acetaldehyde, but that requires catalysts.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try to think of the products and their symmetries again. Let's see the options again. The symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, and C2v. The question is about E's symmetry.\n\nIf E is phosgene (Cl2CO), its symmetry is C2v. That would be option D. Alternatively, if E is something like carbon dioxide (O=C=O), which has D\u221eh symmetry (linear molecule). So that would be option C. But CO2 is not hazardous in the same way as phosgene. Phosgene is much more toxic.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like O2 (oxygen), which is diatomic, so D\u221eh symmetry. But O2 is not extremely hazardous, except in high concentrations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has C2v symmetry. SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2v point group. SO2 is toxic, but maybe not as extremely hazardous as phosgene. But the question says \"extremely hazardous\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which has a linear structure (HCN), so D\u221eh symmetry. HCN is extremely toxic. Wait, the structure of HCN is linear, so its point group is D\u221eh. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry group would be D\u221eh (option C).\n\nLet me think if that fits. Let's see:\n\nIf E is HCN, then how would it form?\n\nC reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form HCN. Suppose C is a compound that contains carbon and nitrogen. Let's think of the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 C (bright red).\n\nSuppose A is carbon (solid) and B is NH3. Wait, but NH3 is a gas. Let's see: maybe the reaction is C (solid) + NH3 \u2192 some compound. But getting to HCN requires a reaction with another substance. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with D (maybe Cl2) produces HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide. For example, if C is NaCN, then reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base) and HCN (a weak acid). But then the acids would be HCN (weak acid) and maybe another? The problem states two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So if F is HCN, but it's weak, then maybe that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a strong acid and a weak acid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal cyanide like KCN. Then reacting with water would form KOH (strong base) and HCN (weak acid). So the acids would be HCN (weak) and maybe another? Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is really tricky. Let me try to think again of the reactions step by step.\n\nLet me try to assume that E is phosgene (Cl2CO). Then:\n\nC must be CO (carbon monoxide), and D must be Cl2 gas. So the reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO (phosgene). Then, the formation of C (CO) would come from A and B. If A is carbon (solid) and B is O2 (gas), then the reaction would be 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. So A is C, B is O2. The ratio is 2 moles C to 1 mole O2. The question states that the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A. Wait, but if A is carbon, then 2 moles of C react with 1 mole O2. So for each mole of A (C), you need 0.5 moles B (O2). So 8 equivalents of B would mean 8 times more B than A. So maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 8 C + 4 O2 \u2192 8 CO. Here, 8 moles C with 4 moles O2, so for each mole of C (A), 0.5 moles O2 (B). But the question states \"8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C\". So perhaps the problem is using equivalents in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the product is a different compound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bright red product C is not CO but something else. Let's think of another possibility where C is a metal oxide that forms phosgene. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a metal chloride. For example, if C reacts with Cl2 (D) to form E. Suppose E is a metal chloride, but that's not extremely hazardous. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like CS2, which has D\u221eh symmetry (linear). CS2 is toxic but maybe not as hazardous as phosgene. The point group would be D\u221eh (option C). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If B and D form H in 1:1 ratio. Suppose B is NH3 and D is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is SO2 and D is H2O, forming H2SO3. That's a weak acid, but not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: the solvent H could be something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). But that's made from CH3COOH itself. Not from gases.\n\nWait, maybe B is CO and D is H2O. Then, their reaction in 1:1 could form HCOOH (formic acid), but that's a weak acid. Not a solvent.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the symmetry groups again. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. The question is about E's symmetry.\n\nIf E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then it's C2v. If it's HCN, it's D\u221eh. If it's something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is bent, so C2v. Alternatively, O2 is D\u221eh.\n\nThe question states that E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene and HCN are both extremely toxic. Which one is more likely?\n\nPhosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. If that's the case, then let's see the other reactions:\n\nC is CO, formed from A (C) and B (O2). The reaction would be 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. Then when C (CO) reacts with D (Cl2), you get phosgene (Cl2CO). Then, C (CO) reacting with water would reform A (C?) and two acids. Wait, CO reacting with water doesn't directly form carbon and acids. Hmm. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction of C with water is different. Let me see:\n\nIf C is PbO (lead(II) oxide), then reacting with water would form Pb(OH)2 and an acid? Not sure. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbonate like Na2CO3, reacting with water gives NaOH and H2CO3. But H2CO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So maybe the two acids are not formed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then FeS + 2 H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, H2S is a weak acid. Not two acids. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, if C is a metal sulfate, like PbSO4, then reacting with water would not produce acids. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: the two acids F and G could be a strong acid and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a salt. Suppose C is a metal nitrate like Pb(NO3)2. Then, reacting with water would produce Pb(OH)2 (weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). So F is HNO3 (strong acid), G is maybe H2O? But H2O isn't an acid. Or maybe another product. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride like AlCl3. AlCl3 in water hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). So F would be HCl (strong acid), and maybe the other acid is not present. Hmm, but the problem says two acids, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide of a metal that can form two different acids. Like, maybe the metal is something like lead. Let me think:\n\nIf C is PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), then reacting with water might form Pb(OH)4^2- (which dissociates into Pb^2+ and OH-), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with excess acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with water produces two acids through hydrolysis. For example, if C is a metal perchlorate. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to look for another angle. The solvent H is made from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Let's suppose that solvent is something like H2O. But that requires B and D to be H2 and O2, but they form H2O in a 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like ethanol. Ethanol can be formed from ethylene and water, but as before, the ratio is 1:1 if it's C2H4 + H2O \u2192 C2H5OH. So if B is ethylene (C2H4) and D is water (H2O), then their reaction forms ethanol. But water is a liquid, but under certain conditions, maybe it's a gas. So D would be H2O gas, and B is C2H4 gas. Then H is ethanol.\n\nThen, going back to the reaction of C with D (H2O) to form A and two acids. So C reacting with H2O gives A plus F and G. If A is a metal, then maybe the metal oxide is involved. For example, if C is PbO2, then reacting with H2O and acid would form Pb^2+ and O2, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydride?\n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal hydroxide. For example, if C is NaOH, then reacting with H2O would just dissolve it. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to think of the product E's symmetry group again. If I can't figure out the exact molecules, maybe I can reason based on common hazardous molecules and their symmetries.\n\nPhosgene (Cl2CO) has C2v symmetry. HCN has D\u221eh. Another possibility: the extremely hazardous product could be something like sarin gas (GB), but that's more complex. Or maybe something like chlorine gas (Cl2), which has D\u221eh symmetry. But Cl2 is diatomic, so D\u221eh. But the question says C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is Cl2, then maybe the reaction is with another substance.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule like CS2 (carbon disulfide), which has D\u221eh symmetry. CS2 is linear, so yes. CS2 is toxic and flammable. \n\nWait, let's see: if E is CS2, then how would that form? Suppose C reacts with D (which is S gas?), then maybe C is CO and D is S2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, and reacting with sulfur gas forms CS2? Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is taking too long. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on common compounds and their symmetries.\n\nThe most likely candidate for E being a toxic product with a common symmetry is phosgene (Cl2CO), which has C2v symmetry (option D). Alternatively, HCN has D\u221eh (option C).\n\nBut let's see the other reactions. If E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then:\n\nC is CO, formed from solid A (carbon) and B (O2) in a 2:1 ratio. The question says 8 equivalents of B. So if the reaction is 16 C + 8 O2 \u2192 16 CO, then that would be 8 equivalents of B (O2) per 16 moles of A (C). So per mole of A, 0.5 moles B. So the ratio is 2:1 A to B. But the question says 8 equivalents of B per A. That would require the reaction to be 1 A with 8 B, which doesn't fit. So maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is not carbon. Let me think of another possibility where the ratio of B to A is 8:1.\n\nSuppose A is Ni (nickel), and B is CO. The reaction Ni (s) + 4 CO \u2192 Ni(CO)4. So here, 1 mole Ni with 4 CO. To have 8 equivalents of B (CO) per A (Ni), the reaction would need to be Ni + 8 CO \u2192 something. Maybe Ni(CO)5 or something else, but that's less common. Ni(CO)4 is a liquid, so the product wouldn't be a bright red solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is Fe and B is CO. Then Fe + CO \u2192 Fe(CO)5. The reaction would need 5 CO per Fe. To get 8 equivalents of CO per Fe, maybe the product is Fe(CO)5, but that still requires 5 CO per Fe. Not 8.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the symmetry group options again. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. If E is phosgene (Cl2CO), its symmetry is C2v. If it's HCN, D\u221eh. If it's CO2, D\u221eh. If it's O2, D\u221eh. \n\nThe question states that when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids. If the strong acid is HCl and the weak acid is something else, maybe the reaction involves Cl. So perhaps E is Cl2CO (phosgene), which uses Cl. Then the symmetry group is C2v, so answer D.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCN, then D\u221eh is option C. But which is more likely?\n\nAnother angle: the solvent H is formed from B and D in 1:1. If B is CO and D is Cl2, then their reaction would need to form a solvent. But CO + Cl2 forms phosgene, which is a liquid under certain conditions but not a common solvent. The solvent could be something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nGiven the options and the most common toxic product with a known symmetry, I think phosgene is more likely. So the symmetry group would be C2v (option D). Therefore, I'll go with D) C2v.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E based on given reactions. \n\n1. **Reaction Analysis**: \n   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A likely candidate for C is copper(I) oxide (Cu\u2082O), but the key is the hazardous product E.\n   - C reacts with gas D to form E (extremely hazardous). Common toxic products include phosgene (Cl\u2082CO) or HCN.\n   - C reacting with water reforms A and produces two acids (F: strong, G: weak). This suggests hydrolysis reactions, such as AlCl\u2083 producing HCl (strong) and Al(OH)\u2083 (weak base), but the exact compounds aren't critical for symmetry.\n\n2. **Symmetry Group Determination**:\n   - **Phosgene (Cl\u2082CO)**: Has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the reactions described. I need to figure out what compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are first. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nStarting with the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide or maybe a compound like copper(II) sulfate, but wait, the color red could also point to iron(III) oxide, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination compound? Wait, another possibility: the bright red solid might be something like mercury(II) iodide? Or maybe lead(II) iodide? Hmm, not sure. Let me think of common red solids that form from reactions with gases.\n\nWait, the reaction of a solid with a gas. Let me think of common reactions. For example, copper metal reacting with sulfur? But sulfur isn't a gas. Maybe iron reacting with sulfur? But again, sulfur is a solid. Alternatively, maybe the solid is a metal reacting with a gas. Let me think of another angle.\n\nThe product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.\n\nLet me think of possible candidates for the reactions. Let's see: C reacting with water to form A plus two acids. So maybe C is a metal oxide or a metal sulfide? Let's think step by step.\n\nThe bright red product C might be something like iron(III) oxide, but iron(III) oxide is more of a reddish-brown, like rust. Alternatively, maybe mercury(II) oxide? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate? Wait, another possibility: the bright red solid could be something like lead(II) iodide (PbI2), but that's yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the solid A is copper, and gas B is sulfur dioxide? No, not sure. Alternatively, think of the reaction of copper with something. Wait, if the product C is red, perhaps it's copper(I) oxide? Copper(I) oxide is red, but maybe more likely, maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, another angle: the reaction of a solid metal with a gas to form a red product. Let me think of mercury(I) chloride? No, that's a red precipitate, but mercury(I) is Hg2^2+. But mercury(I) chloride is calomel, which is white? Or maybe Hg2Cl2 is calomel and is white. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is lead, and the gas B is something like iodine vapor? But lead and iodine reacting would form lead(II) iodide, which is yellow. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid is antimony? No, not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: if C reacts with water to form A and two acids. Let's consider that. Suppose A is a metal. If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water might form the metal hydroxide plus an acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide? For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. But then where would the two acids come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? If the metal carbonate reacts with water, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's consider the product E. It's formed from C reacting with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. Then E is hazardous. Maybe E is a toxic gas? Like phosgene (COCl2) or something else. But need to see the steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the solvent H. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents made from a 1:1 reaction of two gases. For example, H could be something like sulfuric acid? No, that's not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is a compound like ethanol, but ethanol is made from ethylene and water? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is a common solvent like acetone, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, if B and D react in 1:1 to form a solvent. Let's think of possible gases. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is C2H2 (acetylene), then maybe they form something? Not sure. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is something else?\n\nWait, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol? But how would that form from gases? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. They can form NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is something else.\n\nWait, let me think of the reaction of D and B forming a solvent. Let's think of common solvents made from gases. Maybe D is SO2 and B is something? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is SO3 and D is H2O, but that would form sulfuric acid. But the question says D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. Maybe H is something like ethanol? Or maybe diethyl ether?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is a common one like acetone? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is CO? Then reacting in 1:1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between CO and O2? Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps D is NO2 and B is something else?\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the product C, which when reacts with water, gives back A plus two acids F and G, with F being a strong acid and G a weak one. So perhaps C is a metal oxide? For example, if A is a metal, then maybe the oxide of the metal reacts with water to form the hydroxide (which would be A's hydroxide) plus an acid? Wait, no. Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate, but then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's think: for example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water could produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (a weak acid). But then where's the strong acid? Unless there's another product. Maybe if the metal is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate? Like Na2CO3 reacting with water would give NaOH (a strong base) and CO3^2-? Not acids.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride? But then reacting with water wouldn't give acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal oxide, like PbO. Then, reacting with water would form Pb(OH)2, which is a weak base, but maybe the other acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the oxide is something that hydrolyzes into two acids. Wait, perhaps if the oxide is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed produces both a strong and weak acid? For example, perhaps if C is a metal peroxide? No, peroxides react with water to form hydroxides and H2O2, which is a weak acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, nitrate in water would dissociate but not form acids. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the acids F and G. F is a strong acid, so maybe HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH, HCN, H2CO3, etc.\n\nIf the reaction of C with water gives two acids, perhaps the metal's oxide reacts with water to form the metal hydroxide (which would be a base) plus an acid? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide and the reaction with water produces an acid and the metal? Like, for example, maybe the oxide is something like Al2O3 reacting with water and acid? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, which reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (a weak acid). But then where's the strong acid? Unless there's another product. Maybe if the metal is something else. Alternatively, maybe the sulfide is of a more reactive metal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal nitride. For example, Na3N reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and NH3 (weak base). But that's bases, not acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed forms a strong acid and another acid. Let me think of another possibility. Suppose A is a metal like lead. Let's see:\n\nSuppose solid A is Pb, and gas B is O2. But reacting Pb with O2 would form PbO, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe Pb reacts with another gas. Wait, if B is Cl2 gas, then Pb + Cl2 could form PbCl4? But lead(IV) chloride is a white solid, I think. Not red. Alternatively, maybe Pb reacting with something else.\n\nWait, another thought: the bright red product C could be mercuric iodide? Wait, HgI2 is red. Let me check. Yes, mercury(II) iodide is red. So maybe A is Hg (mercury), and B is I2 gas? Wait, but I2 is a solid at room temperature, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas. So if A is solid Hg, and B is I2 vapor, then reacting in 8 equivalents would form HgI4? Wait, the formula would need to balance. Let's see: 2 Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 2 HgI2? Wait, that's 2 Hg and 4 I2? No, that would be 2 HgI4? Wait, no. Let me calculate. Hg has a +2 charge. Each I2 is I^-? Wait, no, iodine is I2 molecules. Wait, maybe the reaction is Hg (s) + I2 (g) \u2192 HgI2 (s). But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas B) with solid A. So if the formula is HgI4, then maybe 2 Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 2 HgI4? No, that doesn't balance. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is Hg2I2? No, but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A is another metal. Let me think of another possibility. Let's try to think of the reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in 8 equivalents. Maybe the metal is something like iron, and the gas is chlorine? Let's see, Fe + Cl2 \u2192 FeCl3. But FeCl3 is a solid but not red. Alternatively, maybe Fe reacts with S (sulfur), but that's a solid.\n\nWait, the bright red product could be copper(II) oxide? Wait, copper(II) oxide is black. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's copper(I) oxide, which is red? I think copper(I) oxide is red. Let me confirm. Yes, copper(I) oxide is red. So if solid A is copper metal, and gas B is something like oxygen? But copper oxide would be formed with O2. The reaction might be 4 Cu + O2 \u2192 2 Cu2O (copper(I) oxide). Wait, that uses 4 Cu and 1 O2. So if the equivalents are 8 of B (O2) with A (Cu), then maybe the stoichiometry would be 8 moles of O2 per 16 moles of Cu? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with nitric acid? But B is a gas. Nitric acid is a liquid. Wait, the gas B could be NO2? If the solid is copper reacting with nitric acid (which is a liquid), but the question says gas B. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction of copper with sulfur dioxide? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the product E, which is hazardous. If C is Cu2O, then reacting with D (maybe a gas like HCl?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 again?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach step by step again.\n\nThe product C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E (hazardous). Also, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus acids F and G. Let's see, if C is Cu2O (copper(I) oxide), then reacting with water might not produce much. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with water is an acid-base reaction. Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that's basic, and when it reacts with water, it forms a base (like the metal hydroxide) and an acid? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the two acids are from the hydrolysis of a salt. Suppose C is a metal salt. For example, suppose C is Pb(NO3)2. Then, reacting with water might form Pb(OH)2 and HNO3. HNO3 is a strong acid, and Pb(OH)2 is a weak base. But then where would the second acid come from? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a different anion. Let me think of another possibility.\n\nWait, another thought: the reaction of a metal with a halogen. Let's think of lead reacting with iodine. If A is Pb and B is I2 (gas), then the product C would be PbI2 or PbI4. Let's see, the reaction: Pb + 2 I2 \u2192 PbI4? The stoichiometry here would be 1 mole Pb with 2 moles I2. But the question states 8 equivalents of B (I2) with A (Pb). So perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe PbI4 is the product. Then the reaction would be Pb + 2 I2 \u2192 PbI4, so 1 mole Pb and 2 moles I2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B, so maybe the formula requires more. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 Pb + 4 I2 \u2192 2 PbI4? Then that would be 2 moles Pb with 4 moles I2. Still not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe the formula is PbI6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let me think of mercury. If A is Hg, then reacting with I2 would form HgI2 (mercury(II) iodide, which is red). The reaction is Hg + I2 \u2192 HgI2. So 1 mole Hg with 1 mole I2. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (I2) with A (Hg), so that would require 8 moles I2 per mole Hg. That would give HgI8? Not likely. Maybe it's a different stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Hg + 4 I2 \u2192 HgI8? Not sure, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is something else. Let's think of the hazardous product E. If E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is toxic. To form phosgene, maybe the reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 COCl2 (phosgene), but then D would be Cl2 and B would be CO? Wait, but D is a gas that reacts with C to form E. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the solvent H. If H is a common solvent made from gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), but that's made from H2 and O2, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe D and B are HCl and NH3 forming NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2S and D is SO2, then they can form thiosulfuric acid? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. Wait, another possibility: the solvent H could be ethanol. Ethanol is made from ethylene (C2H4) and water, but that's a 1:1 ratio? Ethylene plus H2O in presence of catalyst forms ethanol. So if B is C2H4 and D is H2O, then 1:1. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas? Depending on conditions. Maybe under high temp/pressure, H2O could be a gas. Then H would be ethanol. But I'm not sure if that's a common solvent. Ethanol is a solvent, yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like methanol, made from CO and H2. But that requires more steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me see the options for the symmetry group. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. These are point groups. The question is asking for the molecular symmetry group of E. So E must be a molecule whose point group is one of these. Let's think of what molecules have those symmetry groups.\n\nC2: a molecule with a C2 axis and no other symmetry elements. For example, something like trans-1,2-dichloroethylene might have C2 symmetry? Or maybe a bent molecule with two different substituents on the ends. Wait, maybe like a molecule with a C2 axis but no planes. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a linear molecule with two different atoms on each end, but that would have C\u221ev symmetry. Hmm.\n\nD4h: This is the symmetry of a square planar molecule, like XeF4 or [PtCl4]^2-.\n\nD\u221eh: Linear molecules like O2, CO, HCl. These have infinite symmetry along the axis, so their point group is D\u221eh.\n\nC2v: A molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, like water (H2O), or methane (CH4)? Wait, methane is tetrahedral, which is Td symmetry. Wait, C2v is like a molecule with a C2 axis, and two perpendicular mirror planes. For example, something like H2O (bent shape with angle 104.5\u00b0), or something like NH3? Wait, NH3 has C3v symmetry. Wait, maybe something like COCl2 (phosgene), which is planar with C2v symmetry? Because phosgene is O=C=O with Cl on each side? Wait, no. Phosgene is O=C=Cl? No, phosgene is Cl2CO, so the structure is O=C=O? Wait, no. Let me think. Phosgene is Cl2CO, so the structure is O=C=O? No, it's actually O=C=O with two Cl atoms attached to the central carbon? Wait, no. The structure is actually a central carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and a chlorine on each side? No, wait, the correct structure of phosgene is Cl2C=O. So the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar, with the carbon in the center, double bond to O, and two Cl. The structure would be trigonal planar? Wait, carbon has four bonds: double bond to O and single bonds to two Cl and one more? Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2CO, which is O=C=Cl? Wait, no, the formula is Cl2CO. The structure is O=C-Cl? No, the correct structure is O=C=O with two Cl substituents? Wait, no, actually, phosgene is Cl2C=O. The central carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar, with the central carbon in a trigonal planar arrangement? Wait, carbon in phosgene has three regions of electron density: the double bond to O, and two single bonds to Cl. Wait, double bond counts as one region. So trigonal planar geometry, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The point group would be C2v? Let me think: the molecule is planar, with a C2 axis along the molecule's axis (perpendicular to the plane?), and two mirror planes. So yes, C2v symmetry.\n\nWait, D4h is for square planar, like XeF4. D\u221eh is for linear molecules like CO2 or O2. C2v is for molecules like H2O or phosgene. C2 would be something with only a C2 axis, like maybe a molecule that's not planar. Hmm.\n\nSo if the question is about E's symmetry group, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which would have C2v symmetry. That would make option D) C2v the answer. But I need to confirm that E is indeed phosgene.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the reactions again with this assumption.\n\nAssuming E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then the reaction to form E is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D. Let's see. If D is Cl2 gas, and C is something that can combine with Cl2 to form phosgene. Wait, but phosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. The reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO (phosgene). So in that case, C would be CO (carbon monoxide) and D is Cl2. Then, the formation of E would be CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO. So D is Cl2, and C is CO. But CO is a gas, but the question states that C is a product formed from solid A and gas B. Let me see:\n\nIf C is CO, then how is it formed from A and B? Let's see: solid A reacting with gas B to form CO. For example, if A is carbon (solid) and B is O2, then 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. So that would be forming CO from solid carbon and O2. The product C would be CO, which is a gas. But the question states that C is a bright red product. CO is a colorless gas, so that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is something else. Let's see, if E is phosgene, then D is Cl2 and C is CO. But how does CO come from A and B?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the product C is a metal oxide. Let's think of another possibility where the hazardous product E is something else. Let me consider another approach.\n\nLet me think of the solvent H. If D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's think of H being something like ethanol. If B is ethylene (C2H4) and D is water (H2O), then the reaction would be C2H4 + H2O \u2192 C2H5OH (ethanol). But H2O is a liquid, but maybe under certain conditions it's a gas. Then B would be ethylene gas and D is water vapor. Then H is ethanol. That could fit. Then B is ethylene (C2H4), D is H2O. Then the reaction of C with 2 equivalents of D (water) would produce E. Wait, but the question says C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. If D is H2O (gas), then maybe C is something that reacts with two waters. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe H is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). The reaction would require H2 and O2, but they form H2O, not H2O2. Alternatively, maybe another solvent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3). To form that, perhaps the reaction is between two molecules of CH3OH, but that's not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B and D are ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Their reaction gives NH4Cl, but that's a salt, not a solvent. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is tough. Let me try to think of the hazardous product E again. Another possibility is that E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is extremely toxic. To form HCN, perhaps the reaction is between C and D, where D is something like NH3 and C is something else. For example, maybe C is a metal cyanide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), but that's a gas, but maybe not considered extremely hazardous. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: the reaction of C with water gives A and two acids. Suppose C is a metal carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, reacting with water would give NaOH (a strong base) and H2CO3 (a weak acid). But the problem states two acids, so maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal sulfate. For example, PbSO4. But reacting with water would not produce acids.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then reacting with water would form Fe(OH)2 (a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). But where's the strong acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is something like lead, so PbS reacting with water gives Pb(OH)2 and H2S. Pb(OH)2 is a weak base, H2S is a weak acid. So again, no strong acid.\n\nHmm. Wait, the strong acid could be HCl. Suppose F is HCl and G is something else. Let's see, if C is a metal chloride, but how would that react with water? Maybe if the metal is something like AlCl3, which in water can form HCl and Al(OH)3. AlCl3 in water hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). But the problem states two acids. So maybe the product is two acids, but one is a base. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces both an acid and a salt. Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitrate. Like Pb(NO3)2. Then reacting with water would dissociate into Pb^2+ and nitrate, but nitric acid is a strong acid. But the other product? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with water produces a metal hydroxide (a base) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide that can form two different acids upon hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that can form both a strong and weak acid? For instance, maybe the metal is something like aluminum. Let's think:\n\nIf C is Al2O3, then reacting with water might not do much, but reacting with acid or base. Alternatively, if it's in acidic conditions, maybe it forms Al^3+ and releases H+? Not sure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the strong acid F is H2SO4 and the weak acid G is H3PO4, but that seems random.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water forms a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is a metal that forms a strong acid when reacted with water. Wait, like Na2O reacts with water to form NaOH (a strong base) and maybe something else. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the first reaction again: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 bright red product C. The bright red color is key here. Maybe the product is mercury(II) iodide (HgI2), which is red. So if A is Hg and B is I2. Let's see:\n\nThe reaction would be Hg (solid) + I2 (gas) \u2192 HgI2. The stoichiometry is 1:1. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. That doesn't fit. Unless it's a different stoichiometry. Wait, maybe HgI4? Like Hg2I4? Let me think: 2 Hg + 2 I2 \u2192 2 HgI2. So 2 moles Hg with 2 moles I2. Still not 8 equivalents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is PbI2, which is yellow, so that's not red. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: the bright red solid could be iron(III) oxide, but I thought it was more brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), which is red. Let me check: copper(I) oxide is indeed a red solid. So if A is copper and B is oxygen, then the reaction would be 4 Cu + O2 \u2192 2 Cu2O. So here, 4 moles of Cu and 1 mole O2. So the equivalents of B (O2) would be 1 per 4 Cu. But the question says 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the reaction is scaled up. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 8 Cu + 2 O2 \u2192 4 Cu2O. So that's 8 moles Cu with 2 moles O2. So the ratio is 4:1 Cu to O2. So for 1 mole of A (Cu), you need 0.25 moles of B (O2). But the question states 8 equivalents of B per A. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction requires more oxygen. For example, if the product is copper(II) oxide (CuO), which is black, but maybe under certain conditions, a different product. Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let me think of another angle. The product E is formed from C reacting with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. Suppose E is a molecule like COCl2 (phosgene), which is formed from CO + Cl2. So if D is Cl2, then C must be CO. But how does CO form from the first reaction?\n\nIf A is carbon (solid) and B is O2, then the reaction would be 2 C (s) + O2 \u2192 2 CO (g). So here, for each mole of A (carbon), you need 0.5 moles of B (O2). But the question states 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let's see: suppose the reaction is 8 C + 4 O2 \u2192 8 CO. Then, for each mole of A (C), 0.5 moles of B (O2). Still not 8 equivalents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between carbon and something else. For example, if B is S (sulfur), but that's a solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl. Wait, Ni(CO)4. The reaction could be Ni (s) + 4 CO \u2192 Ni(CO)4. But the product would be a liquid, not a solid. And Ni(CO)4 is highly toxic, so maybe that's E? But then the bright red product C would be Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Not solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is between iron and CO to form Fe(CO)5, but again liquid.\n\nHmm. This is getting me stuck. Let me think of the solvent H again. If H is a solvent made from B and D in 1:1. Let's say H is H2O, but that's a liquid. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is something else.\n\nWait, another possibility: if B is NH3 and D is HCl, their reaction gives NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is H2O and D is something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, what if the solvent H is something like sulfuric acid? But that's not a solvent commonly used. Alternatively, maybe it's nitric acid, but again, not a solvent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is a common one like ethanol. As I thought before, maybe the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and water gives ethanol. Then B is C2H4 (ethylene) and D is H2O. But H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something like acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). The reaction between acetylene (C2H2) and water could form acetaldehyde, but that requires catalysts.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try to think of the products and their symmetries again. Let's see the options again. The symmetry groups are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, and C2v. The question is about E's symmetry.\n\nIf E is phosgene (Cl2CO), its symmetry is C2v. That would be option D. Alternatively, if E is something like carbon dioxide (O=C=O), which has D\u221eh symmetry (linear molecule). So that would be option C. But CO2 is not hazardous in the same way as phosgene. Phosgene is much more toxic.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like O2 (oxygen), which is diatomic, so D\u221eh symmetry. But O2 is not extremely hazardous, except in high concentrations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which has C2v symmetry. SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2v point group. SO2 is toxic, but maybe not as extremely hazardous as phosgene. But the question says \"extremely hazardous\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is something like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which has a linear structure (HCN), so D\u221eh symmetry. HCN is extremely toxic. Wait, the structure of HCN is linear, so its point group is D\u221eh. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry group would be D\u221eh (option C).\n\nLet me think if that fits. Let's see:\n\nIf E is HCN, then how would it form?\n\nC reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form HCN. Suppose C is a compound that contains carbon and nitrogen. Let's think of the first reaction: solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 C (bright red).\n\nSuppose A is carbon (solid) and B is NH3. Wait, but NH3 is a gas. Let's see: maybe the reaction is C (solid) + NH3 \u2192 some compound. But getting to HCN requires a reaction with another substance. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with D (maybe Cl2) produces HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide. For example, if C is NaCN, then reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base) and HCN (a weak acid). But then the acids would be HCN (weak acid) and maybe another? The problem states two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So if F is HCN, but it's weak, then maybe that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a strong acid and a weak acid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal cyanide like KCN. Then reacting with water would form KOH (strong base) and HCN (weak acid). So the acids would be HCN (weak) and maybe another? Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is really tricky. Let me try to think again of the reactions step by step.\n\nLet me try to assume that E is phosgene (Cl2CO). Then:\n\nC must be CO (carbon monoxide), and D must be Cl2 gas. So the reaction is CO + Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CO (phosgene). Then, the formation of C (CO) would come from A and B. If A is carbon (solid) and B is O2 (gas), then the reaction would be 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. So A is C, B is O2. The ratio is 2 moles C to 1 mole O2. The question states that the reaction uses 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A. Wait, but if A is carbon, then 2 moles of C react with 1 mole O2. So for each mole of A (C), you need 0.5 moles B (O2). So 8 equivalents of B would mean 8 times more B than A. So maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 8 C + 4 O2 \u2192 8 CO. Here, 8 moles C with 4 moles O2, so for each mole of C (A), 0.5 moles O2 (B). But the question states \"8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C\". So perhaps the problem is using equivalents in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the product is a different compound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bright red product C is not CO but something else. Let's think of another possibility where C is a metal oxide that forms phosgene. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a metal chloride. For example, if C reacts with Cl2 (D) to form E. Suppose E is a metal chloride, but that's not extremely hazardous. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is a molecule like CS2, which has D\u221eh symmetry (linear). CS2 is toxic but maybe not as hazardous as phosgene. The point group would be D\u221eh (option C). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If B and D form H in 1:1 ratio. Suppose B is NH3 and D is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a salt. Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is SO2 and D is H2O, forming H2SO3. That's a weak acid, but not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: the solvent H could be something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). But that's made from CH3COOH itself. Not from gases.\n\nWait, maybe B is CO and D is H2O. Then, their reaction in 1:1 could form HCOOH (formic acid), but that's a weak acid. Not a solvent.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the symmetry groups again. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. The question is about E's symmetry.\n\nIf E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then it's C2v. If it's HCN, it's D\u221eh. If it's something like sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is bent, so C2v. Alternatively, O2 is D\u221eh.\n\nThe question states that E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene and HCN are both extremely toxic. Which one is more likely?\n\nPhosgene is formed from CO and Cl2. If that's the case, then let's see the other reactions:\n\nC is CO, formed from A (C) and B (O2). The reaction would be 2 C + O2 \u2192 2 CO. Then when C (CO) reacts with D (Cl2), you get phosgene (Cl2CO). Then, C (CO) reacting with water would reform A (C?) and two acids. Wait, CO reacting with water doesn't directly form carbon and acids. Hmm. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction of C with water is different. Let me see:\n\nIf C is PbO (lead(II) oxide), then reacting with water would form Pb(OH)2 and an acid? Not sure. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbonate like Na2CO3, reacting with water gives NaOH and H2CO3. But H2CO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So maybe the two acids are not formed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then FeS + 2 H2O \u2192 Fe(OH)2 + H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a weak base, H2S is a weak acid. Not two acids. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, if C is a metal sulfate, like PbSO4, then reacting with water would not produce acids. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: the two acids F and G could be a strong acid and a weak acid from the hydrolysis of a salt. Suppose C is a metal nitrate like Pb(NO3)2. Then, reacting with water would produce Pb(OH)2 (weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). So F is HNO3 (strong acid), G is maybe H2O? But H2O isn't an acid. Or maybe another product. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride like AlCl3. AlCl3 in water hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). So F would be HCl (strong acid), and maybe the other acid is not present. Hmm, but the problem says two acids, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction of C with water produces two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide of a metal that can form two different acids. Like, maybe the metal is something like lead. Let me think:\n\nIf C is PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), then reacting with water might form Pb(OH)4^2- (which dissociates into Pb^2+ and OH-), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with excess acid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of C with water produces two acids through hydrolysis. For example, if C is a metal perchlorate. Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to look for another angle. The solvent H is made from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Let's suppose that solvent is something like H2O. But that requires B and D to be H2 and O2, but they form H2O in a 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent is something like ethanol. Ethanol can be formed from ethylene and water, but as before, the ratio is 1:1 if it's C2H4 + H2O \u2192 C2H5OH. So if B is ethylene (C2H4) and D is water (H2O), then their reaction forms ethanol. But water is a liquid, but under certain conditions, maybe it's a gas. So D would be H2O gas, and B is C2H4 gas. Then H is ethanol.\n\nThen, going back to the reaction of C with D (H2O) to form A and two acids. So C reacting with H2O gives A plus F and G. If A is a metal, then maybe the metal oxide is involved. For example, if C is PbO2, then reacting with H2O and acid would form Pb^2+ and O2, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydride?\n\nAlternatively, suppose C is a metal hydroxide. For example, if C is NaOH, then reacting with H2O would just dissolve it. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to think of the product E's symmetry group again. If I can't figure out the exact molecules, maybe I can reason based on common hazardous molecules and their symmetries.\n\nPhosgene (Cl2CO) has C2v symmetry. HCN has D\u221eh. Another possibility: the extremely hazardous product could be something like sarin gas (GB), but that's more complex. Or maybe something like chlorine gas (Cl2), which has D\u221eh symmetry. But Cl2 is diatomic, so D\u221eh. But the question says C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If D is Cl2, then maybe the reaction is with another substance.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a molecule like CS2 (carbon disulfide), which has D\u221eh symmetry. CS2 is linear, so yes. CS2 is toxic and flammable. \n\nWait, let's see: if E is CS2, then how would that form? Suppose C reacts with D (which is S gas?), then maybe C is CO and D is S2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, and reacting with sulfur gas forms CS2? Not sure.\n\nHmm. This is taking too long. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on common compounds and their symmetries.\n\nThe most likely candidate for E being a toxic product with a common symmetry is phosgene (Cl2CO), which has C2v symmetry (option D). Alternatively, HCN has D\u221eh (option C).\n\nBut let's see the other reactions. If E is phosgene (Cl2CO), then:\n\nC is CO, formed from solid A (carbon) and B (O2) in a 2:1 ratio. The question says 8 equivalents of B. So if the reaction is 16 C + 8 O2 \u2192 16 CO, then that would be 8 equivalents of B (O2) per 16 moles of A (C). So per mole of A, 0.5 moles B. So the ratio is 2:1 A to B. But the question says 8 equivalents of B per A. That would require the reaction to be 1 A with 8 B, which doesn't fit. So maybe the reaction is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid A is not carbon. Let me think of another possibility where the ratio of B to A is 8:1.\n\nSuppose A is Ni (nickel), and B is CO. The reaction Ni (s) + 4 CO \u2192 Ni(CO)4. So here, 1 mole Ni with 4 CO. To have 8 equivalents of B (CO) per A (Ni), the reaction would need to be Ni + 8 CO \u2192 something. Maybe Ni(CO)5 or something else, but that's less common. Ni(CO)4 is a liquid, so the product wouldn't be a bright red solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is Fe and B is CO. Then Fe + CO \u2192 Fe(CO)5. The reaction would need 5 CO per Fe. To get 8 equivalents of CO per Fe, maybe the product is Fe(CO)5, but that still requires 5 CO per Fe. Not 8.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the symmetry group options again. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. If E is phosgene (Cl2CO), its symmetry is C2v. If it's HCN, D\u221eh. If it's CO2, D\u221eh. If it's O2, D\u221eh. \n\nThe question states that when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids. If the strong acid is HCl and the weak acid is something else, maybe the reaction involves Cl. So perhaps E is Cl2CO (phosgene), which uses Cl. Then the symmetry group is C2v, so answer D.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCN, then D\u221eh is option C. But which is more likely?\n\nAnother angle: the solvent H is formed from B and D in 1:1. If B is CO and D is Cl2, then their reaction would need to form a solvent. But CO + Cl2 forms phosgene, which is a liquid under certain conditions but not a common solvent. The solvent could be something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nGiven the options and the most common toxic product with a known symmetry, I think phosgene is more likely. So the symmetry group would be C2v (option D). Therefore, I'll go with D) C2v.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E based on given reactions. \n\n1. **Reaction Analysis**: \n   - Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A likely candidate for C is copper(I) oxide (Cu\u2082O), but the key is the hazardous product E.\n   - C reacts with gas D to form E (extremely hazardous). Common toxic products include phosgene (Cl\u2082CO) or HCN.\n   - C reacting with water reforms A and produces two acids (F: strong, G: weak). This suggests hydrolysis reactions, such as AlCl\u2083 producing HCl (strong) and Al(OH)\u2083 (weak base), but the exact compounds aren't critical for symmetry.\n\n2. **Symmetry Group Determination**:\n   - **Phosgene (Cl\u2082CO)**: Has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. This gives it **C\u2082v symmetry** (option D).\n   - **HCN**: Linear molecule with **D\u221eh symmetry** (option C). However, phosgene is a more common hazardous product formed from CO and Cl\u2082, fitting the reaction steps better.\n\n3. **Reaction Pathway**:\n   - Assuming E is phosgene, C is CO (formed from carbon and O\u2082), and D is Cl\u2082. The solvent H (e.g., ethanol) could form from ethylene (B) and water (D), but symmetry focus remains on E.\n\n**Answer: D** (C\u2082v symmetry for phosgene).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the reactions described. Alright, first I need to figure out what each of these compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are. Let's start by going through each part step by step.\n\nThe first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but wait, maybe it's a different compound. Wait, another common bright red solid in chemistry is lead(II) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like iron(II) sulfide? Wait, no. Wait, the bright red product C could be something like iron(III) oxide, but let me think again. Oh! Wait, maybe C is iron(III) oxide, but the reaction with 8 equivalents of B... Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that compound C is a coordination complex. For example, maybe B is a gas like O2, and A is a metal. Let's see. Let's consider the reactions again.\n\nThe second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like phosgene (COCl2) or maybe hydrogen cyanide? But not sure yet.\n\nThird reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A (the original solid), plus two acids. So, perhaps the acids could be sulfuric acid (strong) and another weak acid like maybe sulfurous acid? Wait, but sulfuric acid is H2SO4, which is strong, and sulfurous acid H2SO3 is weaker. Alternatively, maybe nitric acid and another?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of a metal oxide reacting with water. Wait, if A is a metal, then maybe C is a metal oxide. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me go back to the first reaction. Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 C (bright red). Let me think of possible metals that form bright red oxides or other compounds. For example, lead(II) oxide is yellow, I think. Iron(III) oxide is red, like rust. But iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3. Let's see, if A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe reacting with O2 would form FeO (iron(II) oxide), but FeO is black. Wait, Fe2O3 is red. To form Fe2O3, the reaction would need 3 O2 molecules. Let me see the formula:\n\n4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So that's 3 equivalents of O2 per 2 moles of Fe2O3. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A to form C. So if A is Fe, and B is O2, then maybe the stoichiometry doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let's think of another scenario. If B is a different gas. Maybe B is Cl2? Let me think. For example, copper reacting with Cl2. Copper(II) chloride? But that's not bright red. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe compound C is a coordination complex. For example, if A is iron, and B is carbon monoxide (CO), but CO is a gas. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, perhaps Fe(CO)5? But that's pentacarbonyliron. But that requires 5 equivalents of CO. Not 8. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the bright red product C is something like iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3. Let me check the first reaction again. If A is Fe, and B is O2, then the reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So here, for each mole of Fe2O3, you need 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2?) are used. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let's think of lead. Lead(II) oxide is PbO, which is yellow. Lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is brown. Not red.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red is a different compound. Let me think of sulfur. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but maybe not solid. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is chromium. Chromium(III) oxide is green. Hmm. Alternatively, mercury(II) oxide? Mercury(II) oxide decomposes into mercury and oxygen when heated, but that's not forming a product.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other reactions. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (COCl2). To get phosgene, you might need CO and Cl2? Wait, but then D could be Cl2 and B could be CO? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's consider the last part. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio. For example, sulfuric acid? No, but maybe something like HCl and another gas? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is HCl gas and D is something else. Wait, if H is a solvent made from B and D, perhaps D is ammonia (NH3) and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, B is O2, D is H2? Then H2 and O2 would form H2O, but that's a solvent. Wait, but the solvent is H2O, but the problem says \"used as a solvent\" which could be water, but water is common. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something else like methanol, but that's not from a 1:1 gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2? Then HCl, which is a gas, but solvent could be HCl dissolved in something else? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's think of the product E being extremely hazardous. The most dangerous common compounds are things like phosgene (COCl2), cyanide (HCN), chlorine gas, etc. Let's think of phosgene first. To form phosgene, you need CO and Cl2. So if C reacts with Cl2 (D) to form phosgene (E), then C would need to have a CO group. Wait, but where would the CO come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Fe(CO)5. Then, if D is Cl2, then reacting Fe(CO)5 with Cl2 might produce something. But the problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. Let's see, if D is Cl2, then 2 equivalents would be 2 moles of Cl2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the hydrolysis reaction. C reacts with water to form A plus acids F and G. If A is a metal oxide, then maybe C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives the metal (A) plus two acids. Let me think: for example, if C is a metal nitrate, but that's not an oxide. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide? For example, FeS. Then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH) (A?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metal is in a higher oxidation state. Let's think of a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives the metal plus two acids. For example, maybe C is PbO2. Then hydrolysis could form Pb(OH)2 and some acids? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? Then hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide and CO2, but that's not two acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids could be like H2CO3, H3PO4 (if it's in a lower state?), or something like acetic acid. Let me think of a scenario where two acids are formed. For instance, if C is a metal sulfate, then hydrolysis might produce the metal and sulfuric acid? Wait, no, maybe if C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is iron and C is FeS, then reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (which is a weak acid) but then where is the strong acid? Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the metal is something else. Let me think of a metal that when oxidized in a reaction with O2 forms an oxide, then when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and another.\n\nWait, maybe the oxide is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). But that's not bright red. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think of the first reaction again. Solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B to form C (bright red). Let's think of vanadium. Vanadium(IV) oxide is black, but vanadium(V) oxide is yellow. Not red. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is chromium and B is oxygen, forming Cr2O3? But that's green. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red product is mercury(II) oxide? But I don't think that's red. Wait, maybe the solid A is lead, and B is oxygen, but lead oxide is yellow. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is sulfur? No, sulfur is yellow.\n\nWait, perhaps the solid is a metal sulfide. For example, lead(II) sulfide (PbS) is black. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a coordination compound. Let me think of a bright red coordination compound. For example, Vaska's complex (bis(ethylenediamine)trichloroaurate(III) is bright red. But that's probably too obscure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is iron(III) thiocyanate, which is blood red. That's possible. The reaction could involve Fe^3+ with thiocyanate (SCN-). But the question says solid A reacts with gas B. So perhaps A is iron, and B is a gas that forms thiocyanate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Like lead(II) nitrate, which is yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a metal oxide. Let's think of a metal that forms a red oxide when reacted with a gas. Let me think of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is reddish. To make Fe2O3, the reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. Here, each mole of Fe2O3 requires 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of gas B are used. So if A is Fe and B is O2, then for 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, it's 1.5 O2. So if the question states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C (Fe2O3), then the ratio would have to be different. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for 4 moles Fe, you need 3 O2. So per mole of Fe, O2 is 0.75. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A (Fe). That doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a different metal. Let's think of copper. Copper(II) oxide is black. Not red. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red compound is a different type. Let me think of NO2, but that's a gas. Not a solid. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a halogen. For example, copper reacting with Cl2 forms CuCl2, which is a green solid. Not red. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a transition metal and B is CO. For example, Ni(CO)4. But Ni(CO)4 is a liquid. Wait, but the question says solid A. If A is nickel metal, reacting with 4 CO molecules to form Ni(CO)4. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe a different complex. For example, Fe(CO)5 requires 5 CO molecules. Still not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is something like V(CO)6, but I'm not sure. Maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let me think of the hydrolysis part again. C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. Suppose C is a metal carbonyl complex. For example, if C is Fe(CO)5, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)3 (A?), but also CO2 and H+ ions. Wait, maybe the two acids are H2CO3 (which is a weak acid) and another? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide chloride? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the solvent H. The problem states that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio: maybe HCl and another? Wait, H2O is from H2 and O2, but that's 2:1. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Not a solvent.\n\nWait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is C2H2 (acetylene), but that's a gas. Cl2 and C2H2 could form C2H2Cl4? Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, then maybe they form H2SO4 when mixed with water, but that's not the solvent H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent H is something like ethanol, but that's not from a gas reaction. Wait, maybe the solvent is something like benzene? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2. Then forming H2O, which is a solvent. But H2O is a solvent, and the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe B is CO and D is Cl2. Then reacting them in 1:1 gives COCl2 (phosgene), which is a liquid? But phosgene is a gas at room temperature. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if H is a solvent like CS2 (carbon disulfide), but how would that form from two gases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is CH3OH? No, that's a liquid.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look at the hazardous product E. If E is phosgene, then the reaction would be CO (from C) plus Cl2 (D). So if C has CO in it, then when it reacts with D (Cl2), it forms COCl2 (E). So C must have CO groups. That makes me think that C is a metal carbonyl complex. For example, if C is Ni(CO)4, then reacting with Cl2 (D) might produce NiCl2 and COCl2 (phosgene). But then the stoichiometry would be?\n\nWait, let's think of the first reaction again. Solid A (maybe Ni) reacting with 8 equivalents of B (CO) to form C. Ni(CO)4 requires 4 CO molecules. To get 8 equivalents of B (CO) would mean 2 molecules of Ni(CO)4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is Fe. Fe(CO)5 requires 5 CO molecules. If 8 equivalents of CO are used, maybe there's some other stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the metal is something else. Let's say the formula of C is M(CO)8. Then A would be M, and B is CO. So solid M + 8 CO \u2192 M(CO)8. That would fit the first reaction. Then when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (maybe Cl2?), then the reaction could be M(CO)8 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 MCl2 + 8 COCl2. But that would produce multiple phosgene molecules. But the problem says it produces E, which is phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Os(CO)9 or another complex. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different type of compound. Let me think of the hydrolysis part again. If C is a metal carbonyl, hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide (or oxide?), plus CO2 (a weak acid when dissolved in water, as carbonic acid) and maybe H+ ions. But the problem states two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps when C (metal carbonyl) hydrolyzes, it forms the metal (A) plus H2CO3 (weak acid) and another acid which is strong. Wait, maybe the metal is in a high oxidation state, so when hydrolyzed, it releases strong acid like HNO3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4? Then perhaps C is a metal chloride and sulfate? Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. These are point groups in symmetry. The possible molecules for E could be, for example, COCl2 (phosgene) which has C2v symmetry. D4h would be something like benzene, but that's a ring. D\u221eh is linear molecules like CO2 or O2. C2 is a lower symmetry, like something with a C2 axis but not much else.\n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is C2v. Because the molecule has a central carbon double-bonded to O and single bonds to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar with three atoms around the central atom, so the symmetry would be C2v. So if E is phosgene, then the answer is D) C2v.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something else like Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which has a bent structure, its point group would be C2v as well. Wait, but maybe another structure.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is linear, so D\u221eh symmetry. But HCN is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N, so yes, D\u221eh. But HCN is very toxic, so that fits the \"extremely hazardous\" part. Let me see:\n\nIf E is HCN, then how does it form? Let's see. The reaction between C and D would need to produce HCN. Let's see:\n\nSuppose C is a metal cyanide? Then reacting with D (maybe a gas like H2O?) but not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonyl, and D is NH3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if D is H2 and B is N2? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think again. If E is HCN, then D could be NH3 and B is something else. Wait, the reaction between D and B forms H, the solvent. If H is, say, NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if D is NH3 and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, but again, solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CH4 and B is something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is something like ethanol, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the first reaction. Let's try to think of a metal that when reacted with a gas forms a bright red product. Bright red makes me think of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). So maybe A is Fe, B is O2, and C is Fe2O3. Let's see the stoichiometry. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for each 2 moles of Fe2O3, we need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, that's 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So unless the reaction is different, perhaps the solid A isn't Fe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is sulfur and B is O2, forming SO3? But SO3 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Not bright red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS (iron sulfide) is black. Not red.\n\nHmm, maybe the first reaction is between a metal and a different gas. Let's think of carbon monoxide. If A is Ni, and B is CO, then Ni reacts with CO to form Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Not solid. But the problem states solid A, so maybe the product C is a solid carbonyl complex? Like Fe(CO)5 is a solid at low temps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is chromium(II) oxide? No, chromium oxides are usually green or black.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a metal nitrate. For example, lead(II) nitrate is yellow. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is a compound like mercuric iodide, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit too stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers. The symmetry groups given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v.\n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its point group is C2v. So the answer would be D) C2v. Alternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine monoxide), which is bent, also C2v. Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), but that's bent, C2v. Alternatively, if E is something like BF3, which is trigonal planar (D3h), but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D\u221eh symmetry, then the answer would be C) D\u221eh. But CO2 is not extremely hazardous except in high concentrations, but maybe the question considers it as hazardous.\n\nAlternatively, if E is sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is non-toxic, so no.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a gas, linear (D\u221eh). But HF is a weak acid, but the question says F is a strong acid. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCl, which is linear (D\u221eh). But HCl is a strong acid, but the problem states that F is the strong acid. Wait, in the hydrolysis reaction, C reacts with water to form A plus F and G. So E must be a different product.\n\nWait, maybe E is a compound like chlorine gas (Cl2), which has D\u221eh symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so D\u221eh. But is Cl2 considered extremely hazardous? Yes, it's toxic. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group would be D\u221eh (option C). But how would Cl2 form from C and D?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction steps again. Let me try to assume E is phosgene (COCl2). Let's see:\n\nIf C is a metal carbonyl complex, like Ni(CO)4. Then reacting with Cl2 (D), maybe:\n\nNi(CO)4 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 NiCl2 + 4 COCl2. Here, 2 equivalents of Cl2 (D) would produce 4 moles of COCl2. But the problem states that the product is E, so maybe E is COCl2. That fits.\n\nThen, the first reaction would be solid Ni (A) reacting with 4 CO (B) to form Ni(CO)4 (C). But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe it's a different stoichiometry. For example, if C is Fe(CO)5, then A (Fe) plus 5 CO. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Maybe the formula is different, like a different metal carbonyl that uses 8 CO molecules. Like Os(CO)9? Not sure. But perhaps the exact stoichiometry isn't critical here as long as C is a carbonyl complex.\n\nThen, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2), forming E (COCl2). That would require the reaction to produce COCl2. The solvent H is made from B (CO) and D (Cl2) in 1:1 ratio. Wait, if B is CO and D is Cl2, then reacting them 1:1 would give COCl2 (phosgene), which is E. But the problem says that D reacts with B to form H (the solvent). So H would be phosgene, but phosgene is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe H is another compound. If B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2. Then their reaction forms H2O (solvent). But the ratio would be 2:1. But the problem states 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. Then they form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is SO2 and D is O2. They form SO3, which when dissolved in water is H2SO4. But the solvent would be sulfuric acid, but that's not a solvent typically considered like ethanol or something else.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solvent H is something like H2O, formed from H2 and O2, but again, the ratio is 2:1. Not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol (C2H5OH) formed from a reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and H2O? But that's not a gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CO and B is Cl2. Then reacting them gives COCl2 (phosgene), but that's E. So H would be the same as E, but the problem states that H is the solvent. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the symmetry groups again. If the answer is C2v, then the molecule must have that symmetry. Let's think of possible E candidates.\n\nPhosgene (COCl2): structure is trigonal planar, with C at center, O and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, so the point group is C2v. Yes, that's correct. So that's C2v (option D).\n\nAlternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which has a bent structure, so also C2v. But phosgene is more likely as a hazardous product.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear (D\u221eh symmetry), but HCN is extremely toxic. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry is D\u221eh (option C). But how would that fit?\n\nLet me think of the reactions again. Suppose E is HCN. Then, how is it formed? C reacts with D to produce HCN. Let's say C is a metal cyanide, and D is H2? Not sure. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbide, like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to form acetylene. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonyl complex, and reacting with NH3 (D) to form HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Fe(CO)5, and D is NH3. Then, perhaps some reaction produces HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If D is NH3 and B is HCl, then H is NH4Cl, but that's solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, forming H2O (solvent). Then the solvent is water. The hazardous product E would then be from C reacting with D (O2). If C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with O2 could form SO2 (which is hazardous), but the product E would be SO2. The symmetry of SO2 is C2v, because it's bent. So then the answer would be D) C2v.\n\nAlternatively, if C reacts with O2 (D) to form SO2, which is a hazardous gas. Then the symmetry is C2v.\n\nBut how does C form from A and B?\n\nLet me try this scenario again:\n\nSuppose:\n\nA is FeS (solid), B is O2? Wait, FeS + O2 would form FeO and SO2? Not sure. Not getting the bright red product.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and a different gas. Let me think of sulfur trioxide. If A is S and B is O2, then 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. SO3 is a solid at low temps, and it's white. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal like Pb, and B is NO2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red solid is a nitrate. For example, lead(II) nitrate is yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: the bright red solid might be a mercury(II) compound, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a metal oxide like Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish. Let's try this again:\n\nA is Fe, B is O2. Reaction: 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 (C). The problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. Wait, for 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, that's 1.5 O2. If the reaction is written as A (Fe) plus 8 equivalents of O2 to form C, then maybe the ratio is different. Let's see, if 4 Fe + 8 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3, but that would require more O2 than needed. The correct ratio is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So this doesn't fit the 8 equivalents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a different gas. Suppose B is Cl2. Then, A is Fe, reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3. FeCl3 is a reddish-brown solid. Maybe that's the bright red product C. The reaction would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. So for each mole of FeCl3, you need 1.5 moles of Cl2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per A (Fe). So for example, if the reaction is 1 Fe + 8 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl8? No, that's not possible. Iron typically has a +3 oxidation state. So FeCl3 is the max.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a different metal. Let's think of vanadium. V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl3. Not sure about the color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. Suppose A is FeS and B is O2. Then, FeS + O2 \u2192 FeO + SO2. Not sure about the product being bright red.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that E is phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry (option D). Then the answer is D. Alternatively, if E is HCN (symmetry D\u221eh), then the answer would be C. But which is more likely?\n\nThe problem states that E is extremely hazardous. Both phosgene and HCN are very toxic. However, the reaction between C and D would need to produce E. Let's see:\n\nIf C is a metal carbonyl like Ni(CO)4, and D is Cl2. The reaction could be:\n\nNi(CO)4 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 NiCl2 + 4 COCl2. Here, the product E is COCl2. So that fits. The solvent H is made from B (CO) and D (Cl2) in 1:1 ratio. But CO and Cl2 in 1:1 would form COCl2 (E), which is the same as E, but the problem says H is a solvent. So maybe H is another product, but that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is HCl and D is something else. Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CO. Then D reacts with B (Cl2) in 1:1 to form COCl2 (H?), but H is the solvent. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, the solvent H could be something like CHCl3 (chloroform), which is a solvent made from CH4 and Cl2. But that's a substitution reaction, not a 1:1 gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is CH3Cl and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is something like H2O, formed from H2 and O2 (even if the ratio isn't 1:1), but the problem says 1:1. So perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, but that gives H2O with a 2:1 ratio. Not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Since the symmetry groups given include C2v (option D), and if E is phosgene, then that's correct. Alternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which is also C2v. Or maybe O3 (ozone). Both have C2v symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D\u221eh symmetry (option C). But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous except in high concentrations. The problem says \"extremely hazardous\", so maybe phosgene is more likely.\n\nThus, I think the answer is D) C2v.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the reactions described. \n\n1. **Reaction Analysis**:\n   - **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A common bright red solid is iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), but the stoichiometry does not fit. Alternatively, a metal carbonyl complex like Ni(CO)\u2084 or Fe(CO)\u2085 could be C. For example, if A is Ni and B is CO, the reaction would form a carbonyl complex.\n   - **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form hazardous product E. If C is a carbonyl complex (e.g., Ni(CO)\u2084), reacting with Cl\u2082 (D) could produce phosgene (COCl\u2082), a highly toxic gas.\n   - **Hydrolysis of C**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids (F and G). A carbonyl complex hydrolyzing could release CO\u2082 (weak acid) and another acid (e.g., HCl if Cl\u2082 is involved).\n   - **Reaction of D and B**: D reacts with B (1:1) to form solvent H. If B is CO and D is Cl\u2082, their 1:1 reaction would produce COCl\u2082 (phosgene), but phosgene is not a solvent. Alternatively, if solvent H is water (from H\u2082 and O\u2082), but the ratio is 2:1. However, this is less likely.\n\n2. **Molecular Symmetry**:\n   - **Phosgene (COCl\u2082)** has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. This structure belongs to the **C\u2082v point group**, which includes symmetry elements like a C\u2082 axis and two mirror planes.\n   - **Other candidates** like HCN (linear, D\u221eh symmetry) or Cl\u2082O (bent, C\u2082v symmetry) are considered, but phosgene better fits the hazardous nature and reaction context.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E (likely phosgene) is **C\u2082v**.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the reactions described. Alright, first I need to figure out what each of these compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are. Let's start by going through each part step by step.\n\nThe first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but wait, maybe it's a different compound. Wait, another common bright red solid in chemistry is lead(II) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like iron(II) sulfide? Wait, no. Wait, the bright red product C could be something like iron(III) oxide, but let me think again. Oh! Wait, maybe C is iron(III) oxide, but the reaction with 8 equivalents of B... Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that compound C is a coordination complex. For example, maybe B is a gas like O2, and A is a metal. Let's see. Let's consider the reactions again.\n\nThe second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like phosgene (COCl2) or maybe hydrogen cyanide? But not sure yet.\n\nThird reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A (the original solid), plus two acids. So, perhaps the acids could be sulfuric acid (strong) and another weak acid like maybe sulfurous acid? Wait, but sulfuric acid is H2SO4, which is strong, and sulfurous acid H2SO3 is weaker. Alternatively, maybe nitric acid and another?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of a metal oxide reacting with water. Wait, if A is a metal, then maybe C is a metal oxide. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me go back to the first reaction. Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B \u2192 C (bright red). Let me think of possible metals that form bright red oxides or other compounds. For example, lead(II) oxide is yellow, I think. Iron(III) oxide is red, like rust. But iron(III) oxide is Fe2O3. Let's see, if A is Fe, and B is O2, then Fe reacting with O2 would form FeO (iron(II) oxide), but FeO is black. Wait, Fe2O3 is red. To form Fe2O3, the reaction would need 3 O2 molecules. Let me see the formula:\n\n4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So that's 3 equivalents of O2 per 2 moles of Fe2O3. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (gas) with A to form C. So if A is Fe, and B is O2, then maybe the stoichiometry doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let's think of another scenario. If B is a different gas. Maybe B is Cl2? Let me think. For example, copper reacting with Cl2. Copper(II) chloride? But that's not bright red. Hmm.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe compound C is a coordination complex. For example, if A is iron, and B is carbon monoxide (CO), but CO is a gas. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, perhaps Fe(CO)5? But that's pentacarbonyliron. But that requires 5 equivalents of CO. Not 8. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the bright red product C is something like iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3. Let me check the first reaction again. If A is Fe, and B is O2, then the reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So here, for each mole of Fe2O3, you need 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2?) are used. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is another metal. Let's think of lead. Lead(II) oxide is PbO, which is yellow. Lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is brown. Not red.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red is a different compound. Let me think of sulfur. For example, sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a gas, but maybe not solid. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is chromium. Chromium(III) oxide is green. Hmm. Alternatively, mercury(II) oxide? Mercury(II) oxide decomposes into mercury and oxygen when heated, but that's not forming a product.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other reactions. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (COCl2). To get phosgene, you might need CO and Cl2? Wait, but then D could be Cl2 and B could be CO? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's consider the last part. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio. For example, sulfuric acid? No, but maybe something like HCl and another gas? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is HCl gas and D is something else. Wait, if H is a solvent made from B and D, perhaps D is ammonia (NH3) and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, B is O2, D is H2? Then H2 and O2 would form H2O, but that's a solvent. Wait, but the solvent is H2O, but the problem says \"used as a solvent\" which could be water, but water is common. Alternatively, maybe the solvent is something else like methanol, but that's not from a 1:1 gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2? Then HCl, which is a gas, but solvent could be HCl dissolved in something else? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's think of the product E being extremely hazardous. The most dangerous common compounds are things like phosgene (COCl2), cyanide (HCN), chlorine gas, etc. Let's think of phosgene first. To form phosgene, you need CO and Cl2. So if C reacts with Cl2 (D) to form phosgene (E), then C would need to have a CO group. Wait, but where would the CO come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Fe(CO)5. Then, if D is Cl2, then reacting Fe(CO)5 with Cl2 might produce something. But the problem states that C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. Let's see, if D is Cl2, then 2 equivalents would be 2 moles of Cl2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the hydrolysis reaction. C reacts with water to form A plus acids F and G. If A is a metal oxide, then maybe C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives the metal (A) plus two acids. Let me think: for example, if C is a metal nitrate, but that's not an oxide. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide? For example, FeS. Then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH) (A?), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metal is in a higher oxidation state. Let's think of a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives the metal plus two acids. For example, maybe C is PbO2. Then hydrolysis could form Pb(OH)2 and some acids? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? Then hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide and CO2, but that's not two acids. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids could be like H2CO3, H3PO4 (if it's in a lower state?), or something like acetic acid. Let me think of a scenario where two acids are formed. For instance, if C is a metal sulfate, then hydrolysis might produce the metal and sulfuric acid? Wait, no, maybe if C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is iron and C is FeS, then reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S (which is a weak acid) but then where is the strong acid? Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the metal is something else. Let me think of a metal that when oxidized in a reaction with O2 forms an oxide, then when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and another.\n\nWait, maybe the oxide is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2). But that's not bright red. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think of the first reaction again. Solid A plus 8 equivalents of gas B to form C (bright red). Let's think of vanadium. Vanadium(IV) oxide is black, but vanadium(V) oxide is yellow. Not red. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is chromium and B is oxygen, forming Cr2O3? But that's green. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red product is mercury(II) oxide? But I don't think that's red. Wait, maybe the solid A is lead, and B is oxygen, but lead oxide is yellow. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is sulfur? No, sulfur is yellow.\n\nWait, perhaps the solid is a metal sulfide. For example, lead(II) sulfide (PbS) is black. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product C is a coordination compound. Let me think of a bright red coordination compound. For example, Vaska's complex (bis(ethylenediamine)trichloroaurate(III) is bright red. But that's probably too obscure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is iron(III) thiocyanate, which is blood red. That's possible. The reaction could involve Fe^3+ with thiocyanate (SCN-). But the question says solid A reacts with gas B. So perhaps A is iron, and B is a gas that forms thiocyanate? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Like lead(II) nitrate, which is yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a metal oxide. Let's think of a metal that forms a red oxide when reacted with a gas. Let me think of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), which is reddish. To make Fe2O3, the reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. Here, each mole of Fe2O3 requires 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of gas B are used. So if A is Fe and B is O2, then for 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, it's 1.5 O2. So if the question states that solid A (Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2) to form C (Fe2O3), then the ratio would have to be different. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the reaction is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for 4 moles Fe, you need 3 O2. So per mole of Fe, O2 is 0.75. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (O2) per A (Fe). That doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a different metal. Let's think of copper. Copper(II) oxide is black. Not red. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the bright red compound is a different type. Let me think of NO2, but that's a gas. Not a solid. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a halogen. For example, copper reacting with Cl2 forms CuCl2, which is a green solid. Not red. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a transition metal and B is CO. For example, Ni(CO)4. But Ni(CO)4 is a liquid. Wait, but the question says solid A. If A is nickel metal, reacting with 4 CO molecules to form Ni(CO)4. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe a different complex. For example, Fe(CO)5 requires 5 CO molecules. Still not 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solid is something like V(CO)6, but I'm not sure. Maybe the stoichiometry is different. Let me think of the hydrolysis part again. C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. Suppose C is a metal carbonyl complex. For example, if C is Fe(CO)5, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)3 (A?), but also CO2 and H+ ions. Wait, maybe the two acids are H2CO3 (which is a weak acid) and another? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide chloride? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the solvent H. The problem states that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents made from two gases in 1:1 ratio: maybe HCl and another? Wait, H2O is from H2 and O2, but that's 2:1. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, forming NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Not a solvent.\n\nWait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is C2H2 (acetylene), but that's a gas. Cl2 and C2H2 could form C2H2Cl4? Not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is SO2, then maybe they form H2SO4 when mixed with water, but that's not the solvent H.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solvent H is something like ethanol, but that's not from a gas reaction. Wait, maybe the solvent is something like benzene? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2. Then forming H2O, which is a solvent. But H2O is a solvent, and the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe B is CO and D is Cl2. Then reacting them in 1:1 gives COCl2 (phosgene), which is a liquid? But phosgene is a gas at room temperature. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if H is a solvent like CS2 (carbon disulfide), but how would that form from two gases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is CH3OH? No, that's a liquid.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look at the hazardous product E. If E is phosgene, then the reaction would be CO (from C) plus Cl2 (D). So if C has CO in it, then when it reacts with D (Cl2), it forms COCl2 (E). So C must have CO groups. That makes me think that C is a metal carbonyl complex. For example, if C is Ni(CO)4, then reacting with Cl2 (D) might produce NiCl2 and COCl2 (phosgene). But then the stoichiometry would be?\n\nWait, let's think of the first reaction again. Solid A (maybe Ni) reacting with 8 equivalents of B (CO) to form C. Ni(CO)4 requires 4 CO molecules. To get 8 equivalents of B (CO) would mean 2 molecules of Ni(CO)4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal is Fe. Fe(CO)5 requires 5 CO molecules. If 8 equivalents of CO are used, maybe there's some other stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the metal is something else. Let's say the formula of C is M(CO)8. Then A would be M, and B is CO. So solid M + 8 CO \u2192 M(CO)8. That would fit the first reaction. Then when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (maybe Cl2?), then the reaction could be M(CO)8 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 MCl2 + 8 COCl2. But that would produce multiple phosgene molecules. But the problem says it produces E, which is phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Os(CO)9 or another complex. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different type of compound. Let me think of the hydrolysis part again. If C is a metal carbonyl, hydrolysis would produce the metal hydroxide (or oxide?), plus CO2 (a weak acid when dissolved in water, as carbonic acid) and maybe H+ ions. But the problem states two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps when C (metal carbonyl) hydrolyzes, it forms the metal (A) plus H2CO3 (weak acid) and another acid which is strong. Wait, maybe the metal is in a high oxidation state, so when hydrolyzed, it releases strong acid like HNO3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two acids are HCl and H2SO4? Then perhaps C is a metal chloride and sulfate? Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v. These are point groups in symmetry. The possible molecules for E could be, for example, COCl2 (phosgene) which has C2v symmetry. D4h would be something like benzene, but that's a ring. D\u221eh is linear molecules like CO2 or O2. C2 is a lower symmetry, like something with a C2 axis but not much else.\n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its structure is trigonal planar, so the point group is C2v. Because the molecule has a central carbon double-bonded to O and single bonds to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar with three atoms around the central atom, so the symmetry would be C2v. So if E is phosgene, then the answer is D) C2v.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something else like Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which has a bent structure, its point group would be C2v as well. Wait, but maybe another structure.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is linear, so D\u221eh symmetry. But HCN is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N, so yes, D\u221eh. But HCN is very toxic, so that fits the \"extremely hazardous\" part. Let me see:\n\nIf E is HCN, then how does it form? Let's see. The reaction between C and D would need to produce HCN. Let's see:\n\nSuppose C is a metal cyanide? Then reacting with D (maybe a gas like H2O?) but not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonyl, and D is NH3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if D is H2 and B is N2? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's think again. If E is HCN, then D could be NH3 and B is something else. Wait, the reaction between D and B forms H, the solvent. If H is, say, NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if D is NH3 and B is HCl, then they form NH4Cl, but again, solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CH4 and B is something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is something like ethanol, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should go back to the first reaction. Let's try to think of a metal that when reacted with a gas forms a bright red product. Bright red makes me think of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). So maybe A is Fe, B is O2, and C is Fe2O3. Let's see the stoichiometry. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So for each 2 moles of Fe2O3, we need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, that's 1.5 moles of O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So unless the reaction is different, perhaps the solid A isn't Fe. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is sulfur and B is O2, forming SO3? But SO3 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Not bright red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS (iron sulfide) is black. Not red.\n\nHmm, maybe the first reaction is between a metal and a different gas. Let's think of carbon monoxide. If A is Ni, and B is CO, then Ni reacts with CO to form Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Not solid. But the problem states solid A, so maybe the product C is a solid carbonyl complex? Like Fe(CO)5 is a solid at low temps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is chromium(II) oxide? No, chromium oxides are usually green or black.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a metal nitrate. For example, lead(II) nitrate is yellow. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red product is a compound like mercuric iodide, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit too stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers. The symmetry groups given are C2, D4h, D\u221eh, C2v.\n\nIf E is phosgene (COCl2), its point group is C2v. So the answer would be D) C2v. Alternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine monoxide), which is bent, also C2v. Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), but that's bent, C2v. Alternatively, if E is something like BF3, which is trigonal planar (D3h), but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D\u221eh symmetry, then the answer would be C) D\u221eh. But CO2 is not extremely hazardous except in high concentrations, but maybe the question considers it as hazardous.\n\nAlternatively, if E is sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which is non-toxic, so no.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a gas, linear (D\u221eh). But HF is a weak acid, but the question says F is a strong acid. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if E is HCl, which is linear (D\u221eh). But HCl is a strong acid, but the problem states that F is the strong acid. Wait, in the hydrolysis reaction, C reacts with water to form A plus F and G. So E must be a different product.\n\nWait, maybe E is a compound like chlorine gas (Cl2), which has D\u221eh symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so D\u221eh. But is Cl2 considered extremely hazardous? Yes, it's toxic. So if E is Cl2, then the symmetry group would be D\u221eh (option C). But how would Cl2 form from C and D?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the reaction steps again. Let me try to assume E is phosgene (COCl2). Let's see:\n\nIf C is a metal carbonyl complex, like Ni(CO)4. Then reacting with Cl2 (D), maybe:\n\nNi(CO)4 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 NiCl2 + 4 COCl2. Here, 2 equivalents of Cl2 (D) would produce 4 moles of COCl2. But the problem states that the product is E, so maybe E is COCl2. That fits.\n\nThen, the first reaction would be solid Ni (A) reacting with 4 CO (B) to form Ni(CO)4 (C). But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, maybe it's a different stoichiometry. For example, if C is Fe(CO)5, then A (Fe) plus 5 CO. But the problem says 8 equivalents. Maybe the formula is different, like a different metal carbonyl that uses 8 CO molecules. Like Os(CO)9? Not sure. But perhaps the exact stoichiometry isn't critical here as long as C is a carbonyl complex.\n\nThen, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2), forming E (COCl2). That would require the reaction to produce COCl2. The solvent H is made from B (CO) and D (Cl2) in 1:1 ratio. Wait, if B is CO and D is Cl2, then reacting them 1:1 would give COCl2 (phosgene), which is E. But the problem says that D reacts with B to form H (the solvent). So H would be phosgene, but phosgene is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe H is another compound. If B is Cl2 and D is something else. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2. Then their reaction forms H2O (solvent). But the ratio would be 2:1. But the problem states 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. Then they form NH4Cl, but that's a solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is SO2 and D is O2. They form SO3, which when dissolved in water is H2SO4. But the solvent would be sulfuric acid, but that's not a solvent typically considered like ethanol or something else.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solvent H is something like H2O, formed from H2 and O2, but again, the ratio is 2:1. Not 1:1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solvent H is something like ethanol (C2H5OH) formed from a reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and H2O? But that's not a gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D is CO and B is Cl2. Then reacting them gives COCl2 (phosgene), but that's E. So H would be the same as E, but the problem states that H is the solvent. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the symmetry groups again. If the answer is C2v, then the molecule must have that symmetry. Let's think of possible E candidates.\n\nPhosgene (COCl2): structure is trigonal planar, with C at center, O and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, so the point group is C2v. Yes, that's correct. So that's C2v (option D).\n\nAlternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which has a bent structure, so also C2v. But phosgene is more likely as a hazardous product.\n\nAlternatively, if E is something like HCN, which is linear (D\u221eh symmetry), but HCN is extremely toxic. So if E is HCN, then the symmetry is D\u221eh (option C). But how would that fit?\n\nLet me think of the reactions again. Suppose E is HCN. Then, how is it formed? C reacts with D to produce HCN. Let's say C is a metal cyanide, and D is H2? Not sure. Alternatively, if C is a metal carbide, like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to form acetylene. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonyl complex, and reacting with NH3 (D) to form HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is Fe(CO)5, and D is NH3. Then, perhaps some reaction produces HCN? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the solvent H. If D is NH3 and B is HCl, then H is NH4Cl, but that's solid. Not a solvent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, forming H2O (solvent). Then the solvent is water. The hazardous product E would then be from C reacting with D (O2). If C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with O2 could form SO2 (which is hazardous), but the product E would be SO2. The symmetry of SO2 is C2v, because it's bent. So then the answer would be D) C2v.\n\nAlternatively, if C reacts with O2 (D) to form SO2, which is a hazardous gas. Then the symmetry is C2v.\n\nBut how does C form from A and B?\n\nLet me try this scenario again:\n\nSuppose:\n\nA is FeS (solid), B is O2? Wait, FeS + O2 would form FeO and SO2? Not sure. Not getting the bright red product.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and a different gas. Let me think of sulfur trioxide. If A is S and B is O2, then 2 S + 3 O2 \u2192 2 SO3. SO3 is a solid at low temps, and it's white. Not red.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a metal like Pb, and B is NO2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bright red solid is a nitrate. For example, lead(II) nitrate is yellow. Hmm.\n\nWait, another idea: the bright red solid might be a mercury(II) compound, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bright red product is a metal oxide like Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide), which is reddish. Let's try this again:\n\nA is Fe, B is O2. Reaction: 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3 (C). The problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. Wait, for 2 moles of Fe2O3, you need 3 moles of O2. So per mole of Fe2O3, that's 1.5 O2. If the reaction is written as A (Fe) plus 8 equivalents of O2 to form C, then maybe the ratio is different. Let's see, if 4 Fe + 8 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3, but that would require more O2 than needed. The correct ratio is 4 Fe + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Fe2O3. So this doesn't fit the 8 equivalents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is with a different gas. Suppose B is Cl2. Then, A is Fe, reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3. FeCl3 is a reddish-brown solid. Maybe that's the bright red product C. The reaction would be 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 \u2192 2 FeCl3. So for each mole of FeCl3, you need 1.5 moles of Cl2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per A (Fe). So for example, if the reaction is 1 Fe + 8 Cl2 \u2192 FeCl8? No, that's not possible. Iron typically has a +3 oxidation state. So FeCl3 is the max.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a different metal. Let's think of vanadium. V + Cl2 \u2192 VCl3. Not sure about the color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the solid A is a metal sulfide. Suppose A is FeS and B is O2. Then, FeS + O2 \u2192 FeO + SO2. Not sure about the product being bright red.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that E is phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry (option D). Then the answer is D. Alternatively, if E is HCN (symmetry D\u221eh), then the answer would be C. But which is more likely?\n\nThe problem states that E is extremely hazardous. Both phosgene and HCN are very toxic. However, the reaction between C and D would need to produce E. Let's see:\n\nIf C is a metal carbonyl like Ni(CO)4, and D is Cl2. The reaction could be:\n\nNi(CO)4 + 2 Cl2 \u2192 NiCl2 + 4 COCl2. Here, the product E is COCl2. So that fits. The solvent H is made from B (CO) and D (Cl2) in 1:1 ratio. But CO and Cl2 in 1:1 would form COCl2 (E), which is the same as E, but the problem says H is a solvent. So maybe H is another product, but that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is HCl and D is something else. Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CO. Then D reacts with B (Cl2) in 1:1 to form COCl2 (H?), but H is the solvent. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, the solvent H could be something like CHCl3 (chloroform), which is a solvent made from CH4 and Cl2. But that's a substitution reaction, not a 1:1 gas reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is CH3Cl and D is something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the solvent H is something like H2O, formed from H2 and O2 (even if the ratio isn't 1:1), but the problem says 1:1. So perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, but that gives H2O with a 2:1 ratio. Not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Since the symmetry groups given include C2v (option D), and if E is phosgene, then that's correct. Alternatively, if E is Cl2O (dichlorine oxide), which is also C2v. Or maybe O3 (ozone). Both have C2v symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D\u221eh symmetry (option C). But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous except in high concentrations. The problem says \"extremely hazardous\", so maybe phosgene is more likely.\n\nThus, I think the answer is D) C2v.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on the reactions described. \n\n1. **Reaction Analysis**:\n   - **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A common bright red solid is iron(III) oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083), but the stoichiometry does not fit. Alternatively, a metal carbonyl complex like Ni(CO)\u2084 or Fe(CO)\u2085 could be C. For example, if A is Ni and B is CO, the reaction would form a carbonyl complex.\n   - **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form hazardous product E. If C is a carbonyl complex (e.g., Ni(CO)\u2084), reacting with Cl\u2082 (D) could produce phosgene (COCl\u2082), a highly toxic gas.\n   - **Hydrolysis of C**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids (F and G). A carbonyl complex hydrolyzing could release CO\u2082 (weak acid) and another acid (e.g., HCl if Cl\u2082 is involved).\n   - **Reaction of D and B**: D reacts with B (1:1) to form solvent H. If B is CO and D is Cl\u2082, their 1:1 reaction would produce COCl\u2082 (phosgene), but phosgene is not a solvent. Alternatively, if solvent H is water (from H\u2082 and O\u2082), but the ratio is 2:1. However, this is less likely.\n\n2. **Molecular Symmetry**:\n   - **Phosgene (COCl\u2082)** has a trigonal planar structure with a central carbon atom bonded to O and two Cl atoms. This structure belongs to the **C\u2082v point group**, which includes symmetry elements like a C\u2082 axis and two mirror planes.\n   - **Other candidates** like HCN (linear, D\u221eh symmetry) or Cl\u2082O (bent, C\u2082v symmetry) are considered, but phosgene better fits the hazardous nature and reaction context.\n\nThus, the molecular symmetry group of E (likely phosgene) is **C\u2082v**.\n\nAnswer: D",
