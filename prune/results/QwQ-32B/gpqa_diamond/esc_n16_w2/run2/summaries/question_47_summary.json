      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the compound is C9H11NO2. We need to figure out which option it is based on the given IR and NMR data. Let me start by going through each piece of data step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the IR spectrum. The problem states there's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. That's a carbonyl group, right? Because carbonyl absorptions are usually around 1700-1750 cm\u207b\u00b9. So that suggests there's a ketone, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the formula has an oxygen count of two. Let me see the options again. The options include things like ethyl esters, benzamides, etc. \n\nThe IR also has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those are around the area where N-H stretches occur. For example, amide N-H is around 3300, and primary amines are a bit higher, maybe 3400-3500. The two peaks here might be due to two different N-H groups or maybe the amide and something else. Wait, but amides have two N-H bonds if it's a primary amide. Or maybe an amide with another NH group? Hmm.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's a methyl group, probably from an ethyl group since the triplet is a CH3. The next peak is 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 broad singlet could be an amine group (NH2?), but sometimes ester oxygens can cause some shifts. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so maybe an NH2 group? Or maybe something else. Then 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 that's the methylene next to the ethoxy group? Because a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen would give a quartet, but the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet? Wait, the 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl, so the 4.5 would be the CH2CH3's CH2? Wait, no, the ethyl group would have the CH2 between the oxygen and the CH3. So the ethyl group would have the CH2 as a quartet at around 4 ppm. Wait, the 4.0 is a singlet, maybe something else. Let me think again.\n\nThe NMR peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): that's the methyl of an ethyl group (since a methyl adjacent to an oxygen would have a triplet here, J around 7 Hz).\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet. Could be an amine group. Since amines are usually broad because of exchange with water. So maybe NH2?\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): the CH2 group next to the oxygen in the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group structure would be -O-CH2-CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH3) at around 4 ppm, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe the environment is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl is part of an ester? Like an ethyl ester group. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks are aromatic. The 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H) \u2013 that looks like a substituted benzene with two doublets. The pattern of two doublets each of 2H suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. Because in para, you'd get two sets of doublets. For example, if there's a group on the 4-position, then the protons would split into two doublets. Wait, maybe an ortho group would give more complex splitting, but here it's two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the aromatic protons are in a meta arrangement? Wait, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are para. Let me see.\n\nPutting this together: the molecule has an aromatic ring with substituents. The IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), so maybe an ester (since esters have COOR groups, with the carbonyl at ~1740 but here it's 1720, which is a bit lower, but that's still in the ballpark). Also, the presence of N-H at 3420 and 3325 suggests an amide or an amine. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's parse that. The formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has a carboxylate ester (COOEt) and an NH2 group on the para position. Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's check the formula. \n\nEthyl benzoate would be C7H7O2, but adding an amino group (NH2) would make it C7H8NO2. Wait, but ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2? Let me count. The benzene ring (C6H5), then the ester: COOCH2CH3 (so that's adding 2 O and 4 C and 7 H?), Wait, maybe better to do the calculation. \n\nThe molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The benzene ring with -COOEt and -NH2. The formula would be C6H5-COOCH2CH3 + NH2. Wait, the benzene (C6H5), the carboxylate ester is -OOCR where R is ethyl (C2H5). So the formula would be C6 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from the COO group) + the NH2 adds N. Wait, maybe better to compute:\n\nThe formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2 (benzene is C6H5, plus COOEt: COO is 2 O and 2 C from the ester group, plus the ethyl gives 2 more C, so total C: 6+3=9? Wait: benzene (C6H5), the carboxylic acid is COOH (2 more C?), but when esterified with ethanol (C2H5-O-), so the ester would be C6H5-COO-C2H5. That's 6 + 3 (from COO and ethyl) = 9 C. The H: benzene is 5 H, the ethyl group is 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H?), so total H: 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the other H from the ester? Wait, the ester group: COO-C2H5. The COO has 2 O, so the ester is -O-CO-C2H5. Wait, maybe better to count all:\n\nEthyl benzoate: C6H5COOCH2CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 3 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 11 C? Wait, no. The formula for benzoate ester: the benzene ring (C6), the COO is 2 more C (from the COO group?), but actually the COO is part of the benzene's side chain. Wait, the structure is:\n\nPhenyl group (C6H5) connected to a COOCH2CH3 group. So the total carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (from the COO and the ethyl? Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is 4 carbons (C=O, O, then CH2CH3). Wait, the COO is part of the carboxylate. Let's see, the formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Because:\n\nPhenyl (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (which is 3 carbons from the COO and ethyl? Wait, COOCH2CH3 is a 4-carbon group? Wait:\n\nThe structure is:\n\nBenzene ring (6 C) + the COO group (which is part of the carboxylic acid esterified with ethanol. So the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons are 6 (benzene) + 3 (from the COO and the ethyl? Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the formula for the ester part is: the COO is part of the carboxyl group, so the total would be:\n\nThe benzene ring (C6), the COO is part of the ester, so the ester is -OOCR where R is ethyl (C2H5). So the formula is C6 + 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from the COO group? Wait, no, the COO is two carbons? Wait no, the COO is part of the carboxylic acid. Wait, the benzene ring has a -COOEt group. The COO is two oxygens, but the carbons are: the benzene's 6, plus the COO's carbon (the one from the carboxylic acid) plus the ethyl's two carbons. So total carbons: 6 + 1 (from the COO's carbonyl carbon) + 2 (ethyl) = 9. So yes, C9. The hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (since the COO group takes one H), then the COOCH2CH3: the COO has no H (since it's esterified), the ethyl has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H: 2 on the CH2 and 3 on the CH3). Wait, the benzene ring's H would be 5 (since one is replaced by the COO group). Then the ethyl group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H?), so total H: 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the H from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is ester, so no H there. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the formula again. Ethyl benzoate is indeed C9H10O2. But the problem's formula is C9H11NO2. So if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino adds an NH2 group. So replacing the hydrogen on the benzene (the 4-position) with NH2. So the formula would be C9H10O2 (ethyl benzoate) plus NH2 (adding 2 H and N). Wait, the original formula would be:\n\nThe aminobenzoate would have the same carbons (since replacing a H with NH2 doesn't change the C count). So the formula would be C9H10O2N? Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: the original ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) instead of a H would add 2 H (since NH2 has two H's, replacing one H from the benzene). So total H would be 10 (from ethyl benzoate) minus 1 (the H replaced by NH2) plus 2 (from NH2) \u2192 11 H. So the formula becomes C9H11NO2. That matches exactly. So D would fit the formula.\n\nNow let's check the NMR. Let's see. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the following groups:\n\nThe aromatic ring with -COOEt and -NH2 on para positions. The NMR peaks:\n\nThe 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group (since the ethyl is O-CH2-CH3). The CH2 would be a quartet (from the CH3) at around 4.2 ppm maybe? The problem's data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). Close enough, maybe due to the nearby carbonyl or other groups causing a slight shift. Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH2 group. Since amines are broad singlets. \n\nThe aromatic peaks: the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's think about the substitution pattern. The benzene ring has a COOEt group and an NH2 group on the para positions. So the protons adjacent to the substituents would be in different positions. The para positions mean that the substituents are opposite each other. The NH2 and COOEt are on opposite carbons. The aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to both substituents. Wait, the protons on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6? Let's see:\n\nThe structure is:\n\nO2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Wait, no, the NH2 is on the 4-position (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), so the COOEt is on the carboxylic acid's position (position 1?), so maybe the numbering is different. Wait, in benzoate, the carboxyl group is on the benzene ring's position 1. So the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the 4th carbon (relative to the COO group). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). \n\nThe aromatic protons would then be in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 (meta to each other and ortho to one substituent) and 3 and 5 (meta to each substituent). Wait, perhaps the substitution pattern leads to two sets of doublets. For instance, the protons in positions 2 and 6 (which are ortho to either the COO or NH2) might be one set, and the others another. Alternatively, maybe the coupling constants would lead to two doublets. Let me think of the actual chemical shifts.\n\nIn benzene rings with substituents, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like COOEt) and electron-donating groups (like NH2) would affect the chemical shifts. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing (since esters are somewhat deactivating), while the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons adjacent to the NH2 would be deshielded (higher ppm?), but maybe the combination causes splitting. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0. The 8.0 ppm is a higher field, so maybe those are the protons meta to the electron-withdrawing group (COOEt), which would be deshielded. Wait, usually electron-withdrawing groups deshield the adjacent protons (higher ppm). So the protons next to the COOEt would be around 8 ppm, and those next to the NH2 (which is electron-donating, making the ring less electron-rich, so maybe lower ppm? Or maybe the opposite). Alternatively, the para positions: the NH2 and COOEt are opposite each other. The ortho and meta positions would have different shifts.\n\nAlternatively, the two doublets (each 2H) could correspond to the two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, the two meta protons to both substituents, and the ortho ones. Hmm, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 are from the two different sets of aromatic protons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is such that the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 are the ortho and meta protons. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take 4-aminobenzoic acid. Its NMR would have certain peaks, but when esterified, the ester might shift things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is the CH2 of the ethyl group, which is adjacent to the oxygen, so that's consistent. The 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is broad. \n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's check. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would add 2 C and 5 H (since replacing a H with OCH2CH3). So total C:7 + 3 (OCH2CH3?) Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 C (ethoxy). So benzene (C6) plus CONH2 (adding 1 C?), wait the benzamide is C6H5CONH2 \u2192 C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) on the 3-position would make it C6H5-OCH2CH3-CONH2? Wait, no. Wait, the 3-ethoxybenzamide would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene at position 3, and the CONH2 at position? Wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the amide is on the benzene. Wait, benzamide is the amide at position 1 (the carboxylic acid's position). So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy on position 3, and the amide (CONH2) on the carboxylic acid's position (position 1). The formula would be C8H9NO2? Wait, let me count:\n\nBenzene (C6) + ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds 2 C and 5 H (since replacing a H with OCH2CH3). The amide is CONH2, which adds 1 C (from the CO) and 2 N and 2 H? Wait, the benzamide structure is: the benzene ring has a -CONH2 group. So the formula for benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) on the 3-position would add 2 carbons (from the ethoxy) and 5 H (since the ethoxy has 5 H: OCH2CH3 has 5 H). Wait, the original benzamide has 7 C, adding 2 gives 9 C. The H count: original benzamide has 7 H. Adding ethoxy: replacing one H with OCH2CH3, so H becomes 7-1 +5 (from ethoxy) = 11 H. The N is still 1 (from the amide), O is 2 (one from the amide's carbonyl and one from the ethoxy). Wait, the ethoxy adds another O? Yes, so O is 3? Wait, benzamide has the CO (one O in the carbonyl) and the amide's NH2. Wait, the benzamide's formula is C7H7NO2: the carbonyl (C=O) and the amide's O (from CONH2) so two O's. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds another O, so total O would be 3. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So that's three O's but the formula has only two. So this would not fit. So option A is out.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. Here it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure would be HCONH-4-ethoxyphenyl. The formula would be: the formamide part is HCONH- (so H2N-COH), attached to the phenyl group. The phenyl group has an ethoxy on the 4-position. Let's count the formula. The phenyl is C6H5. The ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (adding 2 C and 5 H). The formamide part: the HCONH- group is H2N-C(=O)-, which adds 1 C (the carbonyl carbon) and some H. Let's do total carbons: phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide's carbonyl (1) \u2192 total 9 C. Hydrogens: phenyl (5 H on the ring) plus ethoxy (5 H) plus the formamide part. The formamide's HCONH- has: the carbonyl (no H), the H2N (2 H), and the H from the formamide's methyl? Wait, formamide is HCONH2. Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So the N is connected to two H and the carbonyl. So the formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:\n\nThe phenyl group (C6H5) with an ethoxy on 4 (so C6H4-OCH2CH3), attached to the formamide group (HCONH-). The full structure would be H2N-C(=O)-O-C6H4-OCH2CH3? Wait no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: the formamide is HCONR2 where one R is H and the other is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So it's H2NC(=O)-4-ethoxyphenyl. \n\nThe formula would be:\n\nFormamide part: H2NC(=O)- (so 1 C from the carbonyl). The phenyl group with ethoxy (C6H4-OCH2CH3). So total carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide carbonyl) = 9 C. The hydrogens: \n\nPhenyl with ethoxy: the phenyl group has 5 H (since one H is replaced by OCH2CH3). The ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The formamide part: the H2N contributes 2 H, the carbonyl has no H, and the phenyl group attached. Wait, the phenyl group's H is already counted. So total H: \n\nPhenyl (5 H) + ethoxy (5 H) + formamide's H2N (2 H). Also, the formamide's carbonyl is attached to the phenyl, so there's no extra H there. So total H: 5+5+2 = 12 H? Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me count again.\n\nWait, the formamide's structure is H2N-C(=O)-Phenyl. The phenyl has 5 H (since one position is taken by the formamide). Wait, no. The phenyl group is attached via the nitrogen. Wait, the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is H2N-C(=O)-Ph- where Ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the phenyl group (C6H5) with an ethoxy on 4. So the total H:\n\nPhenyl group (C6H4-OCH2CH3) has 5 H on the ring (since the 4-position has the OCH2CH3). The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (as before). The formamide's H2N gives 2 H. The carbonyl's oxygen has no H. \n\nSo total H: \n\nPhenyl ring: 5 (from the ring) +5 (ethoxy) = 10? Wait no, the phenyl ring's H are 5, and the ethoxy's H are 5, plus the formamide's 2 H. Plus the formamide's carbonyl is connected to the phenyl. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's count all atoms:\n\nThe formula would be: \n\nC: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) +1 (carbonyl) = 9 C. \n\nH: \n\nPhenyl ring (with ethoxy) has 5 (since one H is replaced by the OCH2CH3). Wait, the phenyl group is part of the 4-ethoxyphenyl, so the phenyl has 5 H (since one is replaced by OCH2CH3). The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (the ethoxy group). The formamide's H2N contributes 2 H. The carbonyl group has no H. \n\nPlus the formamide's carbonyl is connected to the phenyl, so the phenyl's attachment point is the 4-position (already accounted for). \n\nWait, so total H: 5 (ring) + 5 (ethoxy) + 2 (from H2N) = 12 H. \n\nThe formula would be C9H12NO2. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So that's one H less. So option B is not matching the formula. So B is out.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me see. That would be a propionate ester attached to the 4-aminophenyl group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- (wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH?), no, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the propionate ester would be OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3? No, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate would be -COOCH2CH2CH3. \n\nThe structure would be 4-aminophenyl propionate: the benzene ring with an NH2 on 4 and a COOCH2CH2CH3 group. \n\nFormula: benzene (C6) + COO (carbonyl and O) plus propyl (C3H7). Wait, the ester group is COOCH2CH2CH3. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) +1 (carbonyl) = 10 C? Wait, the carbonyl is part of the COO. So the COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons (COO is two oxygens but the carbons are the carbonyl (1) plus the propyl (3) \u2192 total 4 C in the ester part. So total C: 6 +4 = 10. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so that's too many C. So option C is out.\n\nSo the only possible option is D. Let me check the NMR again for D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate).\n\nThe structure is:\n\nBenzene ring with a COOEt group and an NH2 group on the para positions.\n\nThe 1H NMR peaks:\n\nThe ethyl group's CH3 is at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's correct for a CH3 adjacent to an oxygen.\n\nThe CH2 of the ethyl is at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 that's a quartet, which makes sense from the coupling with the CH3.\n\nThe NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 amines are often broad due to exchange, so that fits.\n\nThe aromatic peaks: the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. \n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets. Let's consider the substitution. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing, and the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the NH2 would be more shielded (lower ppm?), and those ortho to the COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm). The meta protons would be in between. Since it's para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. The two sets of aromatic protons would be the ones adjacent to each substituent. \n\nThe peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 could correspond to these two sets. The 8.0 ppm is higher, so that's likely the protons near the electron-withdrawing COOEt group (since they're deshielded), and the 7.0 is near the NH2 (electron-donating, so less deshielded). The doublets suggest coupling with neighboring protons. Since they're on a benzene ring, the coupling constants are usually around 8 Hz, leading to doublets. \n\nSo all the data points align with option D. The other options either don't fit the molecular formula or the NMR peaks. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound in question is C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating a carbonyl group (likely an ester). The medium to strong bands at ~3400 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggest N-H groups (amide or amine). The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of an ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 adjacent to the ethyl oxygen), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (likely an NH\u2082 group). The aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate para substitution on the benzene ring. \n\n**Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)** fits the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and the NMR data: the ethyl group accounts for the CH\u2083 and CH\u2082 signals, the NH\u2082 provides the broad singlet, and the para-substituted aromatic ring matches the doublet peaks. Other options either fail the molecular formula (A, B, C) or do not align with the NMR data (e.g., B has too many hydrogens, C has excess carbons). \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the compound is C9H11NO2. We need to figure out which option it is based on the given IR and NMR data. Let me start by going through each piece of data step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the IR spectrum. The problem states there's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. That's a carbonyl group, right? Because carbonyl absorptions are usually around 1700-1750 cm\u207b\u00b9. So that suggests there's a ketone, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the formula has an oxygen count of two. Let me see the options again. The options include things like ethyl esters, benzamides, etc. \n\nThe IR also has medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those are around the area where N-H stretches occur. For example, amide N-H is around 3300, and primary amines are a bit higher, maybe 3400-3500. The two peaks here might be due to two different N-H groups or maybe the amide and something else. Wait, but amides have two N-H bonds if it's a primary amide. Or maybe an amide with another NH group? Hmm.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's a methyl group, probably from an ethyl group since the triplet is a CH3. The next peak is 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 broad singlet could be an amine group (NH2?), but sometimes ester oxygens can cause some shifts. Wait, but the integration is 2H, so maybe an NH2 group? Or maybe something else. Then 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 that's the methylene next to the ethoxy group? Because a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen would give a quartet, but the ethyl group's CH2 would be a quartet? Wait, the 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl, so the 4.5 would be the CH2CH3's CH2? Wait, no, the ethyl group would have the CH2 between the oxygen and the CH3. So the ethyl group would have the CH2 as a quartet at around 4 ppm. Wait, the 4.0 is a singlet, maybe something else. Let me think again.\n\nThe NMR peaks:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): that's the methyl of an ethyl group (since a methyl adjacent to an oxygen would have a triplet here, J around 7 Hz).\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet. Could be an amine group. Since amines are usually broad because of exchange with water. So maybe NH2?\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): the CH2 group next to the oxygen in the ethyl group. Wait, the ethyl group structure would be -O-CH2-CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH3) at around 4 ppm, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe the environment is different. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl is part of an ester? Like an ethyl ester group. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe 7.0 and 8.0 ppm peaks are aromatic. The 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H) \u2013 that looks like a substituted benzene with two doublets. The pattern of two doublets each of 2H suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. Because in para, you'd get two sets of doublets. For example, if there's a group on the 4-position, then the protons would split into two doublets. Wait, maybe an ortho group would give more complex splitting, but here it's two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the aromatic protons are in a meta arrangement? Wait, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are para. Let me see.\n\nPutting this together: the molecule has an aromatic ring with substituents. The IR shows a carbonyl (1720 cm\u207b\u00b9), so maybe an ester (since esters have COOR groups, with the carbonyl at ~1740 but here it's 1720, which is a bit lower, but that's still in the ballpark). Also, the presence of N-H at 3420 and 3325 suggests an amide or an amine. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's parse that. The formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has a carboxylate ester (COOEt) and an NH2 group on the para position. Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's check the formula. \n\nEthyl benzoate would be C7H7O2, but adding an amino group (NH2) would make it C7H8NO2. Wait, but ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2? Let me count. The benzene ring (C6H5), then the ester: COOCH2CH3 (so that's adding 2 O and 4 C and 7 H?), Wait, maybe better to do the calculation. \n\nThe molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The benzene ring with -COOEt and -NH2. The formula would be C6H5-COOCH2CH3 + NH2. Wait, the benzene (C6H5), the carboxylate ester is -OOCR where R is ethyl (C2H5). So the formula would be C6 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from the COO group) + the NH2 adds N. Wait, maybe better to compute:\n\nThe formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2 (benzene is C6H5, plus COOEt: COO is 2 O and 2 C from the ester group, plus the ethyl gives 2 more C, so total C: 6+3=9? Wait: benzene (C6H5), the carboxylic acid is COOH (2 more C?), but when esterified with ethanol (C2H5-O-), so the ester would be C6H5-COO-C2H5. That's 6 + 3 (from COO and ethyl) = 9 C. The H: benzene is 5 H, the ethyl group is 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H?), so total H: 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the other H from the ester? Wait, the ester group: COO-C2H5. The COO has 2 O, so the ester is -O-CO-C2H5. Wait, maybe better to count all:\n\nEthyl benzoate: C6H5COOCH2CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 3 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 11 C? Wait, no. The formula for benzoate ester: the benzene ring (C6), the COO is 2 more C (from the COO group?), but actually the COO is part of the benzene's side chain. Wait, the structure is:\n\nPhenyl group (C6H5) connected to a COOCH2CH3 group. So the total carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (from the COO and the ethyl? Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is 4 carbons (C=O, O, then CH2CH3). Wait, the COO is part of the carboxylate. Let's see, the formula for ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Because:\n\nPhenyl (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (which is 3 carbons from the COO and ethyl? Wait, COOCH2CH3 is a 4-carbon group? Wait:\n\nThe structure is:\n\nBenzene ring (6 C) + the COO group (which is part of the carboxylic acid esterified with ethanol. So the COO is part of the ester, so the total carbons are 6 (benzene) + 3 (from the COO and the ethyl? Wait, the COO is part of the ester, so the formula for the ester part is: the COO is part of the carboxyl group, so the total would be:\n\nThe benzene ring (C6), the COO is part of the ester, so the ester is -OOCR where R is ethyl (C2H5). So the formula is C6 + 2 (from ethyl) + 2 (from the COO group? Wait, no, the COO is two carbons? Wait no, the COO is part of the carboxylic acid. Wait, the benzene ring has a -COOEt group. The COO is two oxygens, but the carbons are: the benzene's 6, plus the COO's carbon (the one from the carboxylic acid) plus the ethyl's two carbons. So total carbons: 6 + 1 (from the COO's carbonyl carbon) + 2 (ethyl) = 9. So yes, C9. The hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (since the COO group takes one H), then the COOCH2CH3: the COO has no H (since it's esterified), the ethyl has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H: 2 on the CH2 and 3 on the CH3). Wait, the benzene ring's H would be 5 (since one is replaced by the COO group). Then the ethyl group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3 has 5 H?), so total H: 5 (benzene) + 5 (ethyl) + the H from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is ester, so no H there. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the formula again. Ethyl benzoate is indeed C9H10O2. But the problem's formula is C9H11NO2. So if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the amino adds an NH2 group. So replacing the hydrogen on the benzene (the 4-position) with NH2. So the formula would be C9H10O2 (ethyl benzoate) plus NH2 (adding 2 H and N). Wait, the original formula would be:\n\nThe aminobenzoate would have the same carbons (since replacing a H with NH2 doesn't change the C count). So the formula would be C9H10O2N? Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: the original ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) instead of a H would add 2 H (since NH2 has two H's, replacing one H from the benzene). So total H would be 10 (from ethyl benzoate) minus 1 (the H replaced by NH2) plus 2 (from NH2) \u2192 11 H. So the formula becomes C9H11NO2. That matches exactly. So D would fit the formula.\n\nNow let's check the NMR. Let's see. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the following groups:\n\nThe aromatic ring with -COOEt and -NH2 on para positions. The NMR peaks:\n\nThe 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is the CH3 of the ethyl group (since the ethyl is O-CH2-CH3). The CH2 would be a quartet (from the CH3) at around 4.2 ppm maybe? The problem's data has a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). Close enough, maybe due to the nearby carbonyl or other groups causing a slight shift. Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is the NH2 group. Since amines are broad singlets. \n\nThe aromatic peaks: the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let's think about the substitution pattern. The benzene ring has a COOEt group and an NH2 group on the para positions. So the protons adjacent to the substituents would be in different positions. The para positions mean that the substituents are opposite each other. The NH2 and COOEt are on opposite carbons. The aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to both substituents. Wait, the protons on the ring would be in positions 2,3,5,6? Let's see:\n\nThe structure is:\n\nO2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Wait, no, the NH2 is on the 4-position (since it's 4-aminobenzoate), so the COOEt is on the carboxylic acid's position (position 1?), so maybe the numbering is different. Wait, in benzoate, the carboxyl group is on the benzene ring's position 1. So the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group on the 4th carbon (relative to the COO group). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). \n\nThe aromatic protons would then be in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 (meta to each other and ortho to one substituent) and 3 and 5 (meta to each substituent). Wait, perhaps the substitution pattern leads to two sets of doublets. For instance, the protons in positions 2 and 6 (which are ortho to either the COO or NH2) might be one set, and the others another. Alternatively, maybe the coupling constants would lead to two doublets. Let me think of the actual chemical shifts.\n\nIn benzene rings with substituents, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like COOEt) and electron-donating groups (like NH2) would affect the chemical shifts. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing (since esters are somewhat deactivating), while the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons adjacent to the NH2 would be deshielded (higher ppm?), but maybe the combination causes splitting. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0. The 8.0 ppm is a higher field, so maybe those are the protons meta to the electron-withdrawing group (COOEt), which would be deshielded. Wait, usually electron-withdrawing groups deshield the adjacent protons (higher ppm). So the protons next to the COOEt would be around 8 ppm, and those next to the NH2 (which is electron-donating, making the ring less electron-rich, so maybe lower ppm? Or maybe the opposite). Alternatively, the para positions: the NH2 and COOEt are opposite each other. The ortho and meta positions would have different shifts.\n\nAlternatively, the two doublets (each 2H) could correspond to the two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, the two meta protons to both substituents, and the ortho ones. Hmm, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 are from the two different sets of aromatic protons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is such that the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 are the ortho and meta protons. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take 4-aminobenzoic acid. Its NMR would have certain peaks, but when esterified, the ester might shift things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is the CH2 of the ethyl group, which is adjacent to the oxygen, so that's consistent. The 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is broad. \n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's check. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would add 2 C and 5 H (since replacing a H with OCH2CH3). So total C:7 + 3 (OCH2CH3?) Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 C (ethoxy). So benzene (C6) plus CONH2 (adding 1 C?), wait the benzamide is C6H5CONH2 \u2192 C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) on the 3-position would make it C6H5-OCH2CH3-CONH2? Wait, no. Wait, the 3-ethoxybenzamide would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene at position 3, and the CONH2 at position? Wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the amide is on the benzene. Wait, benzamide is the amide at position 1 (the carboxylic acid's position). So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the ethoxy on position 3, and the amide (CONH2) on the carboxylic acid's position (position 1). The formula would be C8H9NO2? Wait, let me count:\n\nBenzene (C6) + ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds 2 C and 5 H (since replacing a H with OCH2CH3). The amide is CONH2, which adds 1 C (from the CO) and 2 N and 2 H? Wait, the benzamide structure is: the benzene ring has a -CONH2 group. So the formula for benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) on the 3-position would add 2 carbons (from the ethoxy) and 5 H (since the ethoxy has 5 H: OCH2CH3 has 5 H). Wait, the original benzamide has 7 C, adding 2 gives 9 C. The H count: original benzamide has 7 H. Adding ethoxy: replacing one H with OCH2CH3, so H becomes 7-1 +5 (from ethoxy) = 11 H. The N is still 1 (from the amide), O is 2 (one from the amide's carbonyl and one from the ethoxy). Wait, the ethoxy adds another O? Yes, so O is 3? Wait, benzamide has the CO (one O in the carbonyl) and the amide's NH2. Wait, the benzamide's formula is C7H7NO2: the carbonyl (C=O) and the amide's O (from CONH2) so two O's. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds another O, so total O would be 3. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So that's three O's but the formula has only two. So this would not fit. So option A is out.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. Here it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure would be HCONH-4-ethoxyphenyl. The formula would be: the formamide part is HCONH- (so H2N-COH), attached to the phenyl group. The phenyl group has an ethoxy on the 4-position. Let's count the formula. The phenyl is C6H5. The ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (adding 2 C and 5 H). The formamide part: the HCONH- group is H2N-C(=O)-, which adds 1 C (the carbonyl carbon) and some H. Let's do total carbons: phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide's carbonyl (1) \u2192 total 9 C. Hydrogens: phenyl (5 H on the ring) plus ethoxy (5 H) plus the formamide part. The formamide's HCONH- has: the carbonyl (no H), the H2N (2 H), and the H from the formamide's methyl? Wait, formamide is HCONH2. Wait, formamide is H2N-C(=O)-H. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So the N is connected to two H and the carbonyl. So the formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:\n\nThe phenyl group (C6H5) with an ethoxy on 4 (so C6H4-OCH2CH3), attached to the formamide group (HCONH-). The full structure would be H2N-C(=O)-O-C6H4-OCH2CH3? Wait no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: the formamide is HCONR2 where one R is H and the other is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So it's H2NC(=O)-4-ethoxyphenyl. \n\nThe formula would be:\n\nFormamide part: H2NC(=O)- (so 1 C from the carbonyl). The phenyl group with ethoxy (C6H4-OCH2CH3). So total carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide carbonyl) = 9 C. The hydrogens: \n\nPhenyl with ethoxy: the phenyl group has 5 H (since one H is replaced by OCH2CH3). The ethoxy has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The formamide part: the H2N contributes 2 H, the carbonyl has no H, and the phenyl group attached. Wait, the phenyl group's H is already counted. So total H: \n\nPhenyl (5 H) + ethoxy (5 H) + formamide's H2N (2 H). Also, the formamide's carbonyl is attached to the phenyl, so there's no extra H there. So total H: 5+5+2 = 12 H? Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me count again.\n\nWait, the formamide's structure is H2N-C(=O)-Phenyl. The phenyl has 5 H (since one position is taken by the formamide). Wait, no. The phenyl group is attached via the nitrogen. Wait, the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is H2N-C(=O)-Ph- where Ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the phenyl group (C6H5) with an ethoxy on 4. So the total H:\n\nPhenyl group (C6H4-OCH2CH3) has 5 H on the ring (since the 4-position has the OCH2CH3). The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (as before). The formamide's H2N gives 2 H. The carbonyl's oxygen has no H. \n\nSo total H: \n\nPhenyl ring: 5 (from the ring) +5 (ethoxy) = 10? Wait no, the phenyl ring's H are 5, and the ethoxy's H are 5, plus the formamide's 2 H. Plus the formamide's carbonyl is connected to the phenyl. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's count all atoms:\n\nThe formula would be: \n\nC: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) +1 (carbonyl) = 9 C. \n\nH: \n\nPhenyl ring (with ethoxy) has 5 (since one H is replaced by the OCH2CH3). Wait, the phenyl group is part of the 4-ethoxyphenyl, so the phenyl has 5 H (since one is replaced by OCH2CH3). The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (the ethoxy group). The formamide's H2N contributes 2 H. The carbonyl group has no H. \n\nPlus the formamide's carbonyl is connected to the phenyl, so the phenyl's attachment point is the 4-position (already accounted for). \n\nWait, so total H: 5 (ring) + 5 (ethoxy) + 2 (from H2N) = 12 H. \n\nThe formula would be C9H12NO2. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So that's one H less. So option B is not matching the formula. So B is out.\n\nOption C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let me see. That would be a propionate ester attached to the 4-aminophenyl group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO- (wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH?), no, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the propionate ester would be OOCR where R is propyl (CH2CH2CH3? No, propyl is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, the propionate would be -COOCH2CH2CH3. \n\nThe structure would be 4-aminophenyl propionate: the benzene ring with an NH2 on 4 and a COOCH2CH2CH3 group. \n\nFormula: benzene (C6) + COO (carbonyl and O) plus propyl (C3H7). Wait, the ester group is COOCH2CH2CH3. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) +1 (carbonyl) = 10 C? Wait, the carbonyl is part of the COO. So the COOCH2CH2CH3 is 4 carbons (COO is two oxygens but the carbons are the carbonyl (1) plus the propyl (3) \u2192 total 4 C in the ester part. So total C: 6 +4 = 10. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so that's too many C. So option C is out.\n\nSo the only possible option is D. Let me check the NMR again for D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate).\n\nThe structure is:\n\nBenzene ring with a COOEt group and an NH2 group on the para positions.\n\nThe 1H NMR peaks:\n\nThe ethyl group's CH3 is at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's correct for a CH3 adjacent to an oxygen.\n\nThe CH2 of the ethyl is at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 that's a quartet, which makes sense from the coupling with the CH3.\n\nThe NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 amines are often broad due to exchange, so that fits.\n\nThe aromatic peaks: the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. \n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets. Let's consider the substitution. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing, and the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons ortho to the NH2 would be more shielded (lower ppm?), and those ortho to the COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm). The meta protons would be in between. Since it's para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. The two sets of aromatic protons would be the ones adjacent to each substituent. \n\nThe peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 could correspond to these two sets. The 8.0 ppm is higher, so that's likely the protons near the electron-withdrawing COOEt group (since they're deshielded), and the 7.0 is near the NH2 (electron-donating, so less deshielded). The doublets suggest coupling with neighboring protons. Since they're on a benzene ring, the coupling constants are usually around 8 Hz, leading to doublets. \n\nSo all the data points align with option D. The other options either don't fit the molecular formula or the NMR peaks. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nThe compound in question is C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating a carbonyl group (likely an ester). The medium to strong bands at ~3400 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggest N-H groups (amide or amine). The 1H NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of an ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 adjacent to the ethyl oxygen), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (likely an NH\u2082 group). The aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate para substitution on the benzene ring. \n\n**Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)** fits the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and the NMR data: the ethyl group accounts for the CH\u2083 and CH\u2082 signals, the NH\u2082 provides the broad singlet, and the para-substituted aromatic ring matches the doublet peaks. Other options either fail the molecular formula (A, B, C) or do not align with the NMR data (e.g., B has too many hydrogens, C has excess carbons). \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. I need to analyze each piece of data and match it with the possible structures.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of the IR peaks might indicate. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those high-intensity peaks around 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9 could be from N-H bonds, like in amides or amines. The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a carboxylic acid derivative, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), so maybe an ester or amide. Since there are N-H peaks, maybe it's an amide. Wait, but the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is more typical for esters (around 1740-1720) or maybe an amide's carbonyl? Hmm, amide carbonyls are around 1650-1680, I think. So the 1720 is more likely an ester. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group? Let me think again. Wait, the peaks at 3420 and 3325 could also be from an amide's N-H (since amides have two N-H in primary amines?), but if it's a primary amide (RCONH2), then there would be two N-H peaks. But the question's IR has two bands in that region. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine (like aniline) with two N-H? Or perhaps an ester with an alcohol? Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the molecular formula. Let's count: C9H11NO2. The formula for ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2 (since benzoate is C7H5O2 and ethyl adds C2H5?), but here there's an extra H and an N. Wait, the presence of N means it's an amine or amide. So the compound must have an amide or amine group along with an ester or another group.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's parse that. Ethyl benzoate would be the ester (benzene ring with -COOEt). The 4-aminobenzoate part would mean the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and the ester group is on another position. Wait, actually, the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4, and an ester group (COOEt) at another position, say position 1 or 2. Wait, the formula would be: the benzoate part (C7H5O2) plus the ethyl (C2H5) and the NH2 adds a NH2. So the total formula would be C7 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) + 1 (from COO) plus the amino? Let me count:\n\nThe formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The benzoate ester is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, when you esterify with ethanol, you lose a water, so the ester would be C7H5O2 plus the ethyl group. Wait, actually, the ester group (COOEt) would be adding a -COOCH2CH3. So the formula would be: benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (which is C3H6O2) plus the NH2. Wait, the benzene ring has the amino group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (from COOEt) = 9. Then H: Let's see, benzene is 5 H in the ring (since two substituents?), but maybe the aminobenzoate is like: the benzene ring has -NH2 and -COOEt. So each substituent takes a position. So the H count would need to be calculated. Let me see, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have: The benzene ring with -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3. So the total formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from NH2) ? Wait, the N is in the NH2. The COOEt adds 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3). So total carbons: 6 + 3 = 9. The oxygens: the ester has two O (COO) and the amine has none, so total O2. Wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. The N comes from the NH2 group. So the H count: Let's count each group. The benzene ring with two substituents (so 4 H on the ring?), but maybe the positions matter. Alternatively, perhaps the H count is better done by formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The ester group (COOCH2CH3) contributes: COO has two O, the ethyl is CH2CH3. The amino group is NH2. The benzene ring has 6 C. Let's count all H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so each substituent takes a position, so the remaining 4 positions have H). Let's see:\n\nThe benzene ring structure: let's say positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). The rest of the ring has 4 H. Each substituent: the COOEt has:\n\nThe COOEt group: the ester oxygen is part of the carbonyl and the ether. The ethyl part is CH2CH3. The COOEt group contributes: the carbonyl (C=O), then the O connected to CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), but the COOEt's O is attached to the CH2, so the ethyl part is CH2CH3. So the COOCH2CH3 group has 3 C (from COO plus the ethyl's CH2CH3?), wait, COO is part of the benzene's substituent. Let me think of the formula:\n\nThe benzoate ester part (from benzoic acid esterified with ethanol) would have formula C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, minus H2O gives C7H5O2). Then adding the ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, when you make an ester from benzoic acid and ethanol, the formula would be C7H5O2 (the benzoate) plus the ethyl (C2H5) but actually, the ester is RCOOR', so the benzoic acid (RCOOH) plus ethanol (R'OH) becomes RCOOR' + H2O. So the ester would have (C7H5O2) plus (C2H5) from the ethanol. Wait, the ethanol contributes the OEt part. So the ester group is C7H5O2 (from the acid) plus the ethanol's OEt (which is O-C2H5). So the total formula for the ester would be C7 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) = 9 carbons. The hydrogens: Let's see. Benzoic acid has C7H6O2. When you replace the -OH with -OCH2CH3, you get C7H5O2 (since you lose an H from the acid's OH to form the ester). Then the ethyl group adds 5 H (from OCH2CH3?), but actually, the O is part of the ester. The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (the ethyl group has 5 H: CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3). So total H in the ester would be (benzene ring with 5 H? Let me think: the benzene ring in benzoic acid has 5 H (since the -COOH is on one carbon, so the other five carbons have H). When making the ester, the ring still has those 5 H, but the -COOEt is replacing the -COOH. So the ester would have 5 (from ring) + 5 (from ethyl group's CH2CH3) plus the H from the ester's carbonyl? Wait, the carbonyl is O=C-OEt, so the carbonyl itself has no H. So the total H would be: the benzene ring (5 H) plus the ethyl's 5 H (from CH2CH3) plus the H from the ester's other parts? Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me just calculate the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:\n\nPhenyl group with -NH2 on carbon 4 and -COOEt on another carbon (maybe 1 or 2). Let's count atoms. The benzene ring (6 C) plus the COOEt (3 C: COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (COO is two oxygens, but the carbons are C (from the benzene's COO?) Wait, the COOEt is part of the benzene ring's substituent. So the COO is part of the ester. So the total carbons: benzene (6) + the COOEt's 3 carbons (the COO is part of the benzene's substituent, so the COO is attached to the benzene's carbon. The COOEt is the ester group: so the carbons are 6 (benzene) plus 3 (COOCH2CH3?) Wait, COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (the carbonyl carbon, the O-connected CH2, and the CH3). So total C: 6+3=9. Nitrogen comes from the NH2 group (so N=1). The oxygens: the ester has two O (from the COO) plus the other O in the ether? Wait, the ester group is COOEt, so two O in the COO. The amine has no O. So total O is 2. The formula is C9H?NO2. Let's count H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so four H on the ring?), but let's think step by step. The benzene ring with -COOEt and -NH2 substituents. Each substituent takes up a position. Let's say the -COOEt is at position 1 and the -NH2 at position 4. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) have H. So four H on the ring. The -NH2 has two H. The COOEt group: the ethyl part is OCH2CH3. The COO is attached to the benzene. The COOEt has the ethyl group, which has 5 H (from CH2CH3). The COO itself doesn't add H. The benzene ring's H: 4 (from the four positions not substituted). The -NH2 contributes two H. The ethyl group's H: 5. The COO group has no H. So total H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) +5 (ethyl) = 11 H. So the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given molecular formula. So option D fits the formula.\n\nNow checking the other options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is a benzene with CONH2. The 3-ethoxy would be an OEt group on position 3. So the structure would be: benzene with -NH2 (amide) on one position and -OEt on position 3. The molecular formula: benzene (6C) plus CONH2 (adding 1 C, 1 N) and OEt (2 C). So total C: 6+1+2=9. N is 1. O: the amide has an O? Wait, the amide is RCONH2, so the carbonyl is part of the amide. The ethoxy is OEt, which has O. So total O: 1 (from amide's CO?) Wait, the amide is CO-NH2, so the carbonyl (C=O) contributes an O. The ethoxy has another O. So total O is 2. So formula is C9H?NO2. Let's count H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so four H on the ring). The CONH2: the amide's carbonyl is on the benzene. The amide group has NH2 (two H). The ethoxy group has OEt (OCH2CH3, which has 5 H). The benzene ring's remaining H: 4. The amide's NH2 has 2 H. The ethoxy's H: 5. The amide's carbonyl doesn't have H. So total H: 4 +2 +5 = 11. So the formula would also be C9H11NO2. So that also fits the formula. So both A and D have the correct formula. Hmm, so need to look at NMR and IR.\n\nLooking at the IR data again. The strong band at 1720 is an ester (since esters have a C=O around 1740-1720 cm\u207b\u00b9). An amide's C=O is around 1650-1700. So if the compound is an amide (like option A: benzamide), then the carbonyl would be around 1680, but the IR shows 1720, which is more ester-like. So that suggests it's an ester, so option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) would have an ester carbonyl (so the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 matches) whereas A's amide would have a lower frequency. So the IR points more to D than A. But need to check the NMR data.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data:\n\nThe given NMR peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H).\n\nLet's break this down. \n\nThe triplet at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is likely the CH3 group of an ethyl group (since ethyl's CH3 is around 1 ppm, and the triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2). The quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the ethyl group's CH3. Wait, but the ethyl group's CH2 is usually around 1.2 (CH3) and the CH2 adjacent would be around 4 ppm, but in an ester, the OCH2CH3: the CH2 is next to oxygen, so maybe a quartet. Wait, the ethyl group in an ester would have the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen as a quartet (from the 3H of CH3), and the CH3 as a triplet. So that matches the 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H). So that's consistent with an ethyl group (like in an ester or ether).\n\nThen the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad signals often indicate exchangeable protons, like OH or NH. Since there's an N in the formula, this is likely an NH2 group (amine) as a broad singlet. So that's two H from an amino group (NH2).\n\nThe aromatic peaks are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). The two doublets suggest a disubstituted benzene with two sets of two H each, possibly an ortho or para substitution. Let me think of the positions. The 8.0 ppm is higher field than 7.0. In an aromatic ring, meta substitution would have peaks around similar positions, but ortho or para? For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene with substituents that are electron-withdrawing or donating. Let's think of the structures:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have a benzene ring with a COOEt group (ester) and an NH2 group. Let's say the ester is at position 1 and the NH2 at position 4. Then the substituents are para (positions 1 and 4). The other substituents (if any?) Wait, the other positions (2,3,5,6) would have H. The H at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the NH2 (if the NH2 is at 4, then 5 is adjacent, but maybe the COOEt is at 1, so the other substituents are at 1 and 4. The remaining H would be on 2,3,5,6. Wait, the aromatic peaks are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. Let me think of the actual chemical shifts. \n\nThe NH2 group is electron-donating (since it's an amino group), which would deshield the adjacent aromatic protons. The ester group (COOEt) is electron-withdrawing (since it's an electron-withdrawing group). So the positions adjacent to these groups would have different shifts. Let's consider the positions:\n\nSuppose the ester is at position 1 (COOEt) and the amino at position 4 (NH2). The other substituents are para. Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (if any?) Wait, the aromatic protons not involved in substituents. Let's think:\n\nThe benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4. The remaining H are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the ester (position 1) and meta to the amino (position 4). The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to the ester and ortho to the amino (position 4). The amino group (NH2 at 4) is an electron-donating group, so the protons ortho to it (positions 3 and 5) would be shifted downfield (deshielded) compared to their normal positions. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group (since the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so the protons ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded less, maybe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are at different positions. Let me think of the NMR peaks. The two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. A para-disubstituted benzene with substituents that are electron-donating and -withdrawing could give such peaks. For example, the NH2 group (donating) and the ester (withdrawing) on opposite sides. \n\nAlternatively, the aromatic peaks might be split into two doublets because of coupling. Let me consider the structure of D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate). The ester is on, say, position 1 (COOEt) and the NH2 on 4. The remaining H are at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at 2 and 6 (ortho to ester) would be influenced by the ester (electron-withdrawing, so their chemical shifts might be a bit lower?), while the H at 3 and 5 (adjacent to NH2) would be more deshielded. Wait, maybe the H at 3 and 5 (meta to the ester) and ortho to NH2? \n\nAlternatively, the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 could correspond to two sets of protons. For instance, in a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents, the remaining H would form two doublets due to coupling. Wait, maybe the aromatic protons are split into two doublets because of diastereotopic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents (like the ester and amino), the remaining protons would be in two different environments, leading to two doublets. The amino group is more electron-donating, so the protons near it would be less shielded (higher ppm?), while the ester would cause the adjacent protons to be more shielded? Wait, maybe the protons next to the amino group (position 3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those next to the ester (positions 2 and 6). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 correspond to two pairs of protons. Let me think of actual values. For example, in aniline (NH2 on benzene), the aromatic protons are around 6.5-7.5 ppm. If there's an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester) on the opposite side (para), then the protons adjacent to the amino might be at higher ppm (like 7-8) and those adjacent to the ester at lower ppm (like 6-7). \n\nSuppose the peaks at 8.0 are the ones near the NH2 group (more deshielded), and 7.0 near the ester (less deshielded). So that would fit. \n\nNow, let's consider the other options. Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have an ethoxy group (OEt) at position 3 and an amide (CONH2) at another position (like 1 or 4). Let's say the amide is at position 1 (para to ethoxy). The amide group (CONH2) is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it would deshield the adjacent protons. The ethoxy group is electron-donating (since O is more electronegative but the ethoxy itself is a slightly electron-donating group compared to a hydrogen?), or maybe it's more electron-withdrawing? Wait, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so the ethoxy group is a deactivating group, so the adjacent protons would be deshielded (higher ppm). \n\nIn this case, the aromatic protons would be split into different environments. The amide is at position 1 (say), ethoxy at 3. The remaining protons would be at positions 2,4,5,6. The protons ortho to the amide (position 2) would be more deshielded, and those ortho to ethoxy (position 2 and 4?) Hmm, this is getting complicated. The NMR peaks for benzamide derivatives can vary. Let's think of the actual peaks given: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. For benzamide (the amide at position 1), the aromatic protons might have shifts like around 7-8 ppm. But maybe the ethoxy group complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the NMR data of the options. \n\nIn option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the ester (COOEt) is on one position (say 1) and the NH2 on 4. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, maybe. The NH2 causes a shift in adjacent protons. Let's see, the NMR spectrum shows two doublets for the aromatic region. The 8.0 ppm might be the protons ortho to the NH2 (since they are more deshielded), and 7.0 near the ester. \n\nThe other signals: the ethyl group's CH2 (4.5 ppm q, 2H) and CH3 (1.2 ppm t, 3H). The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. \n\nIn option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), the structure has an ethoxy at 3 and an amide (CONH2) at another position (maybe 1). The amide's CONH2 would have an NH2 group, which would also give a broad singlet. The ethoxy's CH2 would be at around 4 ppm (maybe?), but let's see. The ester in option D's case has an ethyl group's CH2 at 4.5 ppm, which matches the given NMR. In option A, the ethoxy's ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. The CH2 would be adjacent to oxygen, so its chemical shift would be around 4 ppm (like in an ether), so maybe the CH2 is at ~4 ppm (quartet?), but in the given data, the 4.5 is a quartet. Wait, the given data has a quartet at 4.5 and a triplet at 1.2. That matches an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is next to the oxygen. So in both options A and D, the ethyl group's signals are present. \n\nWait, but in option A, the ethoxy group's ethyl is OCH2CH3, so the CH2 is at ~4 ppm, but the given data has the quartet at 4.5. Hmm. Maybe that's okay. Let me think about the exact shifts. The OCH2CH3 in an ester (like in D) would have the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen at around 4.2-4.5 ppm, which matches the given 4.5. In an ether (like ethoxy in A), the OCH2CH3's CH2 might be around 4 ppm. So the given data's 4.5 might better fit an ester (option D) than an ether (option A). \n\nAdditionally, the NH2 in option A (benzamide) would also give a broad singlet, which matches the 4.0 ppm. But let's think of the aromatic peaks. In option A, with an amide group (CONH2) at position 1 and an ethoxy at 3, the aromatic protons would be affected by both. The amide is electron-withdrawing (carbonyl), so the protons adjacent to it (position 2) would be deshielded (higher ppm), while the ethoxy's effect might be deactivating (electron-withdrawing), so protons near it (position 2 and 4?) would also be deshielded. This might lead to overlapping peaks or different patterns. The given data has two distinct doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. \n\nAlternatively, in option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the ester is electron-withdrawing and the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons near the NH2 (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm like 8.0), while those near the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be less so (7.0 ppm). That would explain the two doublets at 7 and 8 ppm. \n\nSo putting this together, the IR shows an ester carbonyl (1720) and N-H (the broad singlet at 4 ppm is the NH2, which is N-H), so it's an amine ester. The NMR data fits better with option D, as the ethyl group's signals are at 1.2 (CH3) and 4.5 (CH2), and the aromatic peaks split into two doublets due to the substituents' effects. Option A's structure would also fit the formula but the IR's 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is more indicative of an ester (so D) rather than an amide's carbonyl (which would be lower). \n\nAnother check: the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me recall, the ethyl benzoate's ester would have the ethyl group's signals, and the amino group as a broad peak. The aromatic peaks would show the influence of the amino and ester groups. The doublets at 7 and 8 ppm make sense for such a structure. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be a -COOCH2CH2CH3 group. The molecular formula would be C9 (since phenyl is 6C + COOCH2CH2CH3 has 4C (COO is 2C, plus the propyl's 3C? Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 5 carbons: COO is two, then three in the propyl. So total C: 6 +5=11? Wait, no. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be benzene with an amino group on 4 and a propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) group on another position. The propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the carbons: benzene (6) + 3 (from the COO?) Wait, COO is two C (the carbonyl and the oxygen?), no, the propionate group is -COOCH2CH2CH3. That's 5 carbons (the benzene ring has 6, plus the COO is part of the substituent. Wait, the propionate group is a carboxylate ester: R-COO-R', where R' is propyl (CH2CH2CH3). So the propionate group contributes 3 carbons from the propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), but actually, the propionate ester would be COOCH2CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the propyl part (the COO is two oxygens but the carbons are part of the ester). So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) + 2 (from COO?) Wait, the COO is part of the ester: the COO is attached to the benzene and the propyl. So the COO adds two carbons? No, the COO is a functional group. Wait, the propionate group is: the benzene has a COOCH2CH2CH3 group. So the COO is one carbon (the carbonyl) plus the O connected to the propyl (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, the propionate group would be:\n\nThe structure would be: benzene ring with -NH2 on 4 and -COOCH2CH2CH3 on another position (like 1). The total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (from the propyl's CH2CH2CH3) + 1 (the carbonyl's C) = 10? Wait, the COO is part of the ester. The COOCH2CH2CH3 has 5 carbons? Let me count:\n\nCOOCH2CH2CH3:\n\nC (from COO) + O (but O is not a carbon), then CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons. So the COO group's carbon is the carbonyl carbon (C=O), so that's 1 C from the carbonyl, plus the three from the propyl, total 4 carbons in the propionate group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 4 =10, plus the amino doesn't add any. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2, but this would be C10..., so option C is out. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (HCO-). So the structure would be HCONH- attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The molecular formula: benzene (6C) + ethoxy (C2) + formamide (HCONH- has 2 C: the formyl group is HCO- which has one C, plus the NH2. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the formamide group contributes 2 carbons (HCO and the NH2 is not a carbon). Wait, the formamide group is H-C(=O)-NH2. So that's one carbon (the formyl group). So total carbons: benzene (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (1) =9. The N is present. O: ethoxy has one O, formamide has one O (the carbonyl), so total O2. So the formula matches. \n\nNow, the NMR data for option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has an NH2 group (since it's formamide, which is HCONH2). The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The formamide's carbonyl would be at around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 (amide carbonyl), which matches the IR's 1720? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, so the given IR's 1720 is more an ester. So the IR's 1720 would not fit formamide. Therefore, option B's IR would not match. So B is out. \n\nSo between A and D. The key difference is the carbonyl peak. D is an ester (carbonyl at 1720), A is an amide (carbonyl at lower frequency). The given IR has 1720, so D is better. \n\nThe NMR of option A (3-ethoxybenzamide): the amide's carbonyl is at lower frequency, so the IR matches. Wait, the given IR's carbonyl is at 1720, which would not be an amide. So A's amide would have a carbonyl around 1680, which doesn't match 1720. So A is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, characteristic of an ester carbonyl group (C=O), and medium-to-strong N-H stretches at ~3400 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating an amine group (NH\u2082). The 1H NMR spectrum includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 of ethyl group), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH\u2082). The aromatic peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring with electron-donating (NH\u2082) and electron-withdrawing (ester) groups. \n\n**Analysis of Options**:\n- **A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an amide (C=O) with a carbonyl around 1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, which does not match the IR's 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.

The aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are consistent with substituents causing distinct shielding effects (NH\u2082 and ester groups).\n\n**Answer: D**  \nThe correct answer is **D** as it satisfies all spectral and molecular formula criteria.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. I need to analyze each piece of data and match it with the possible structures.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of the IR peaks might indicate. The IR spectrum shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those high-intensity peaks around 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9 could be from N-H bonds, like in amides or amines. The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a carboxylic acid derivative, probably a carbonyl group (C=O), so maybe an ester or amide. Since there are N-H peaks, maybe it's an amide. Wait, but the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is more typical for esters (around 1740-1720) or maybe an amide's carbonyl? Hmm, amide carbonyls are around 1650-1680, I think. So the 1720 is more likely an ester. So maybe the compound has both an ester and an amine group? Let me think again. Wait, the peaks at 3420 and 3325 could also be from an amide's N-H (since amides have two N-H in primary amines?), but if it's a primary amide (RCONH2), then there would be two N-H peaks. But the question's IR has two bands in that region. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine (like aniline) with two N-H? Or perhaps an ester with an alcohol? Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check the molecular formula. Let's count: C9H11NO2. The formula for ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2 (since benzoate is C7H5O2 and ethyl adds C2H5?), but here there's an extra H and an N. Wait, the presence of N means it's an amine or amide. So the compound must have an amide or amine group along with an ester or another group.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's parse that. Ethyl benzoate would be the ester (benzene ring with -COOEt). The 4-aminobenzoate part would mean the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4 and the ester group is on another position. Wait, actually, the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be: the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2) at position 4, and an ester group (COOEt) at another position, say position 1 or 2. Wait, the formula would be: the benzoate part (C7H5O2) plus the ethyl (C2H5) and the NH2 adds a NH2. So the total formula would be C7 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) + 1 (from COO) plus the amino? Let me count:\n\nThe formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The benzoate ester is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, when you esterify with ethanol, you lose a water, so the ester would be C7H5O2 plus the ethyl group. Wait, actually, the ester group (COOEt) would be adding a -COOCH2CH3. So the formula would be: benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (which is C3H6O2) plus the NH2. Wait, the benzene ring has the amino group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (from COOEt) = 9. Then H: Let's see, benzene is 5 H in the ring (since two substituents?), but maybe the aminobenzoate is like: the benzene ring has -NH2 and -COOEt. So each substituent takes a position. So the H count would need to be calculated. Let me see, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have: The benzene ring with -NH2 and -COOCH2CH3. So the total formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from NH2) ? Wait, the N is in the NH2. The COOEt adds 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3). So total carbons: 6 + 3 = 9. The oxygens: the ester has two O (COO) and the amine has none, so total O2. Wait, the formula given is C9H11NO2. The N comes from the NH2 group. So the H count: Let's count each group. The benzene ring with two substituents (so 4 H on the ring?), but maybe the positions matter. Alternatively, perhaps the H count is better done by formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The ester group (COOCH2CH3) contributes: COO has two O, the ethyl is CH2CH3. The amino group is NH2. The benzene ring has 6 C. Let's count all H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so each substituent takes a position, so the remaining 4 positions have H). Let's see:\n\nThe benzene ring structure: let's say positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). The rest of the ring has 4 H. Each substituent: the COOEt has:\n\nThe COOEt group: the ester oxygen is part of the carbonyl and the ether. The ethyl part is CH2CH3. The COOEt group contributes: the carbonyl (C=O), then the O connected to CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), but the COOEt's O is attached to the CH2, so the ethyl part is CH2CH3. So the COOCH2CH3 group has 3 C (from COO plus the ethyl's CH2CH3?), wait, COO is part of the benzene's substituent. Let me think of the formula:\n\nThe benzoate ester part (from benzoic acid esterified with ethanol) would have formula C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, minus H2O gives C7H5O2). Then adding the ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, when you make an ester from benzoic acid and ethanol, the formula would be C7H5O2 (the benzoate) plus the ethyl (C2H5) but actually, the ester is RCOOR', so the benzoic acid (RCOOH) plus ethanol (R'OH) becomes RCOOR' + H2O. So the ester would have (C7H5O2) plus (C2H5) from the ethanol. Wait, the ethanol contributes the OEt part. So the ester group is C7H5O2 (from the acid) plus the ethanol's OEt (which is O-C2H5). So the total formula for the ester would be C7 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethyl) = 9 carbons. The hydrogens: Let's see. Benzoic acid has C7H6O2. When you replace the -OH with -OCH2CH3, you get C7H5O2 (since you lose an H from the acid's OH to form the ester). Then the ethyl group adds 5 H (from OCH2CH3?), but actually, the O is part of the ester. The OCH2CH3 has 5 H (the ethyl group has 5 H: CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3). So total H in the ester would be (benzene ring with 5 H? Let me think: the benzene ring in benzoic acid has 5 H (since the -COOH is on one carbon, so the other five carbons have H). When making the ester, the ring still has those 5 H, but the -COOEt is replacing the -COOH. So the ester would have 5 (from ring) + 5 (from ethyl group's CH2CH3) plus the H from the ester's carbonyl? Wait, the carbonyl is O=C-OEt, so the carbonyl itself has no H. So the total H would be: the benzene ring (5 H) plus the ethyl's 5 H (from CH2CH3) plus the H from the ester's other parts? Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me just calculate the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:\n\nPhenyl group with -NH2 on carbon 4 and -COOEt on another carbon (maybe 1 or 2). Let's count atoms. The benzene ring (6 C) plus the COOEt (3 C: COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (COO is two oxygens, but the carbons are C (from the benzene's COO?) Wait, the COOEt is part of the benzene ring's substituent. So the COO is part of the ester. So the total carbons: benzene (6) + the COOEt's 3 carbons (the COO is part of the benzene's substituent, so the COO is attached to the benzene's carbon. The COOEt is the ester group: so the carbons are 6 (benzene) plus 3 (COOCH2CH3?) Wait, COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons (the carbonyl carbon, the O-connected CH2, and the CH3). So total C: 6+3=9. Nitrogen comes from the NH2 group (so N=1). The oxygens: the ester has two O (from the COO) plus the other O in the ether? Wait, the ester group is COOEt, so two O in the COO. The amine has no O. So total O is 2. The formula is C9H?NO2. Let's count H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so four H on the ring?), but let's think step by step. The benzene ring with -COOEt and -NH2 substituents. Each substituent takes up a position. Let's say the -COOEt is at position 1 and the -NH2 at position 4. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) have H. So four H on the ring. The -NH2 has two H. The COOEt group: the ethyl part is OCH2CH3. The COO is attached to the benzene. The COOEt has the ethyl group, which has 5 H (from CH2CH3). The COO itself doesn't add H. The benzene ring's H: 4 (from the four positions not substituted). The -NH2 contributes two H. The ethyl group's H: 5. The COO group has no H. So total H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) +5 (ethyl) = 11 H. So the formula would be C9H11NO2, which matches the given molecular formula. So option D fits the formula.\n\nNow checking the other options:\n\nOption A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is a benzene with CONH2. The 3-ethoxy would be an OEt group on position 3. So the structure would be: benzene with -NH2 (amide) on one position and -OEt on position 3. The molecular formula: benzene (6C) plus CONH2 (adding 1 C, 1 N) and OEt (2 C). So total C: 6+1+2=9. N is 1. O: the amide has an O? Wait, the amide is RCONH2, so the carbonyl is part of the amide. The ethoxy is OEt, which has O. So total O: 1 (from amide's CO?) Wait, the amide is CO-NH2, so the carbonyl (C=O) contributes an O. The ethoxy has another O. So total O is 2. So formula is C9H?NO2. Let's count H:\n\nThe benzene ring with two substituents (so four H on the ring). The CONH2: the amide's carbonyl is on the benzene. The amide group has NH2 (two H). The ethoxy group has OEt (OCH2CH3, which has 5 H). The benzene ring's remaining H: 4. The amide's NH2 has 2 H. The ethoxy's H: 5. The amide's carbonyl doesn't have H. So total H: 4 +2 +5 = 11. So the formula would also be C9H11NO2. So that also fits the formula. So both A and D have the correct formula. Hmm, so need to look at NMR and IR.\n\nLooking at the IR data again. The strong band at 1720 is an ester (since esters have a C=O around 1740-1720 cm\u207b\u00b9). An amide's C=O is around 1650-1700. So if the compound is an amide (like option A: benzamide), then the carbonyl would be around 1680, but the IR shows 1720, which is more ester-like. So that suggests it's an ester, so option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) would have an ester carbonyl (so the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 matches) whereas A's amide would have a lower frequency. So the IR points more to D than A. But need to check the NMR data.\n\nLooking at the 1H NMR data:\n\nThe given NMR peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), 7.0 (d, 2H), 8.0 (d, 2H).\n\nLet's break this down. \n\nThe triplet at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is likely the CH3 group of an ethyl group (since ethyl's CH3 is around 1 ppm, and the triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2). The quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the ethyl group's CH3. Wait, but the ethyl group's CH2 is usually around 1.2 (CH3) and the CH2 adjacent would be around 4 ppm, but in an ester, the OCH2CH3: the CH2 is next to oxygen, so maybe a quartet. Wait, the ethyl group in an ester would have the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen as a quartet (from the 3H of CH3), and the CH3 as a triplet. So that matches the 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.5 (q, 2H). So that's consistent with an ethyl group (like in an ester or ether).\n\nThen the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad signals often indicate exchangeable protons, like OH or NH. Since there's an N in the formula, this is likely an NH2 group (amine) as a broad singlet. So that's two H from an amino group (NH2).\n\nThe aromatic peaks are at 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). The two doublets suggest a disubstituted benzene with two sets of two H each, possibly an ortho or para substitution. Let me think of the positions. The 8.0 ppm is higher field than 7.0. In an aromatic ring, meta substitution would have peaks around similar positions, but ortho or para? For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene with substituents that are electron-withdrawing or donating. Let's think of the structures:\n\nOption D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have a benzene ring with a COOEt group (ester) and an NH2 group. Let's say the ester is at position 1 and the NH2 at position 4. Then the substituents are para (positions 1 and 4). The other substituents (if any?) Wait, the other positions (2,3,5,6) would have H. The H at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the NH2 (if the NH2 is at 4, then 5 is adjacent, but maybe the COOEt is at 1, so the other substituents are at 1 and 4. The remaining H would be on 2,3,5,6. Wait, the aromatic peaks are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. Let me think of the actual chemical shifts. \n\nThe NH2 group is electron-donating (since it's an amino group), which would deshield the adjacent aromatic protons. The ester group (COOEt) is electron-withdrawing (since it's an electron-withdrawing group). So the positions adjacent to these groups would have different shifts. Let's consider the positions:\n\nSuppose the ester is at position 1 (COOEt) and the amino at position 4 (NH2). The other substituents are para. Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (if any?) Wait, the aromatic protons not involved in substituents. Let's think:\n\nThe benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4. The remaining H are at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the ester (position 1) and meta to the amino (position 4). The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to the ester and ortho to the amino (position 4). The amino group (NH2 at 4) is an electron-donating group, so the protons ortho to it (positions 3 and 5) would be shifted downfield (deshielded) compared to their normal positions. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group (since the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so the protons ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded less, maybe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are at different positions. Let me think of the NMR peaks. The two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. A para-disubstituted benzene with substituents that are electron-donating and -withdrawing could give such peaks. For example, the NH2 group (donating) and the ester (withdrawing) on opposite sides. \n\nAlternatively, the aromatic peaks might be split into two doublets because of coupling. Let me consider the structure of D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate). The ester is on, say, position 1 (COOEt) and the NH2 on 4. The remaining H are at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at 2 and 6 (ortho to ester) would be influenced by the ester (electron-withdrawing, so their chemical shifts might be a bit lower?), while the H at 3 and 5 (adjacent to NH2) would be more deshielded. Wait, maybe the H at 3 and 5 (meta to the ester) and ortho to NH2? \n\nAlternatively, the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 could correspond to two sets of protons. For instance, in a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents, the remaining H would form two doublets due to coupling. Wait, maybe the aromatic protons are split into two doublets because of diastereotopic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents (like the ester and amino), the remaining protons would be in two different environments, leading to two doublets. The amino group is more electron-donating, so the protons near it would be less shielded (higher ppm?), while the ester would cause the adjacent protons to be more shielded? Wait, maybe the protons next to the amino group (position 3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those next to the ester (positions 2 and 6). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 correspond to two pairs of protons. Let me think of actual values. For example, in aniline (NH2 on benzene), the aromatic protons are around 6.5-7.5 ppm. If there's an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester) on the opposite side (para), then the protons adjacent to the amino might be at higher ppm (like 7-8) and those adjacent to the ester at lower ppm (like 6-7). \n\nSuppose the peaks at 8.0 are the ones near the NH2 group (more deshielded), and 7.0 near the ester (less deshielded). So that would fit. \n\nNow, let's consider the other options. Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would have an ethoxy group (OEt) at position 3 and an amide (CONH2) at another position (like 1 or 4). Let's say the amide is at position 1 (para to ethoxy). The amide group (CONH2) is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it would deshield the adjacent protons. The ethoxy group is electron-donating (since O is more electronegative but the ethoxy itself is a slightly electron-donating group compared to a hydrogen?), or maybe it's more electron-withdrawing? Wait, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so the ethoxy group is a deactivating group, so the adjacent protons would be deshielded (higher ppm). \n\nIn this case, the aromatic protons would be split into different environments. The amide is at position 1 (say), ethoxy at 3. The remaining protons would be at positions 2,4,5,6. The protons ortho to the amide (position 2) would be more deshielded, and those ortho to ethoxy (position 2 and 4?) Hmm, this is getting complicated. The NMR peaks for benzamide derivatives can vary. Let's think of the actual peaks given: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. For benzamide (the amide at position 1), the aromatic protons might have shifts like around 7-8 ppm. But maybe the ethoxy group complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the NMR data of the options. \n\nIn option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the ester (COOEt) is on one position (say 1) and the NH2 on 4. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, maybe. The NH2 causes a shift in adjacent protons. Let's see, the NMR spectrum shows two doublets for the aromatic region. The 8.0 ppm might be the protons ortho to the NH2 (since they are more deshielded), and 7.0 near the ester. \n\nThe other signals: the ethyl group's CH2 (4.5 ppm q, 2H) and CH3 (1.2 ppm t, 3H). The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. \n\nIn option A (3-ethoxybenzamide), the structure has an ethoxy at 3 and an amide (CONH2) at another position (maybe 1). The amide's CONH2 would have an NH2 group, which would also give a broad singlet. The ethoxy's CH2 would be at around 4 ppm (maybe?), but let's see. The ester in option D's case has an ethyl group's CH2 at 4.5 ppm, which matches the given NMR. In option A, the ethoxy's ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. The CH2 would be adjacent to oxygen, so its chemical shift would be around 4 ppm (like in an ether), so maybe the CH2 is at ~4 ppm (quartet?), but in the given data, the 4.5 is a quartet. Wait, the given data has a quartet at 4.5 and a triplet at 1.2. That matches an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is next to the oxygen. So in both options A and D, the ethyl group's signals are present. \n\nWait, but in option A, the ethoxy group's ethyl is OCH2CH3, so the CH2 is at ~4 ppm, but the given data has the quartet at 4.5. Hmm. Maybe that's okay. Let me think about the exact shifts. The OCH2CH3 in an ester (like in D) would have the CH2 adjacent to the oxygen at around 4.2-4.5 ppm, which matches the given 4.5. In an ether (like ethoxy in A), the OCH2CH3's CH2 might be around 4 ppm. So the given data's 4.5 might better fit an ester (option D) than an ether (option A). \n\nAdditionally, the NH2 in option A (benzamide) would also give a broad singlet, which matches the 4.0 ppm. But let's think of the aromatic peaks. In option A, with an amide group (CONH2) at position 1 and an ethoxy at 3, the aromatic protons would be affected by both. The amide is electron-withdrawing (carbonyl), so the protons adjacent to it (position 2) would be deshielded (higher ppm), while the ethoxy's effect might be deactivating (electron-withdrawing), so protons near it (position 2 and 4?) would also be deshielded. This might lead to overlapping peaks or different patterns. The given data has two distinct doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. \n\nAlternatively, in option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the ester is electron-withdrawing and the NH2 is electron-donating. The protons near the NH2 (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded (higher ppm like 8.0), while those near the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be less so (7.0 ppm). That would explain the two doublets at 7 and 8 ppm. \n\nSo putting this together, the IR shows an ester carbonyl (1720) and N-H (the broad singlet at 4 ppm is the NH2, which is N-H), so it's an amine ester. The NMR data fits better with option D, as the ethyl group's signals are at 1.2 (CH3) and 4.5 (CH2), and the aromatic peaks split into two doublets due to the substituents' effects. Option A's structure would also fit the formula but the IR's 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is more indicative of an ester (so D) rather than an amide's carbonyl (which would be lower). \n\nAnother check: the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me recall, the ethyl benzoate's ester would have the ethyl group's signals, and the amino group as a broad peak. The aromatic peaks would show the influence of the amino and ester groups. The doublets at 7 and 8 ppm make sense for such a structure. \n\nOption C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be a -COOCH2CH2CH3 group. The molecular formula would be C9 (since phenyl is 6C + COOCH2CH2CH3 has 4C (COO is 2C, plus the propyl's 3C? Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 5 carbons: COO is two, then three in the propyl. So total C: 6 +5=11? Wait, no. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be benzene with an amino group on 4 and a propionate (COOCH2CH2CH3) group on another position. The propionate is -COOCH2CH2CH3. So the carbons: benzene (6) + 3 (from the COO?) Wait, COO is two C (the carbonyl and the oxygen?), no, the propionate group is -COOCH2CH2CH3. That's 5 carbons (the benzene ring has 6, plus the COO is part of the substituent. Wait, the propionate group is a carboxylate ester: R-COO-R', where R' is propyl (CH2CH2CH3). So the propionate group contributes 3 carbons from the propyl (CH2CH2CH3?), but actually, the propionate ester would be COOCH2CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the propyl part (the COO is two oxygens but the carbons are part of the ester). So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (propyl) + 2 (from COO?) Wait, the COO is part of the ester: the COO is attached to the benzene and the propyl. So the COO adds two carbons? No, the COO is a functional group. Wait, the propionate group is: the benzene has a COOCH2CH2CH3 group. So the COO is one carbon (the carbonyl) plus the O connected to the propyl (CH2CH2CH3). Wait, the propionate group would be:\n\nThe structure would be: benzene ring with -NH2 on 4 and -COOCH2CH2CH3 on another position (like 1). The total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (from the propyl's CH2CH2CH3) + 1 (the carbonyl's C) = 10? Wait, the COO is part of the ester. The COOCH2CH2CH3 has 5 carbons? Let me count:\n\nCOOCH2CH2CH3:\n\nC (from COO) + O (but O is not a carbon), then CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons. So the COO group's carbon is the carbonyl carbon (C=O), so that's 1 C from the carbonyl, plus the three from the propyl, total 4 carbons in the propionate group. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 4 =10, plus the amino doesn't add any. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2, but this would be C10..., so option C is out. So C is incorrect.\n\nOption B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is RCONH2 where R is formyl (HCO-). So the structure would be HCONH- attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. The molecular formula: benzene (6C) + ethoxy (C2) + formamide (HCONH- has 2 C: the formyl group is HCO- which has one C, plus the NH2. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the formamide group contributes 2 carbons (HCO and the NH2 is not a carbon). Wait, the formamide group is H-C(=O)-NH2. So that's one carbon (the formyl group). So total carbons: benzene (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (1) =9. The N is present. O: ethoxy has one O, formamide has one O (the carbonyl), so total O2. So the formula matches. \n\nNow, the NMR data for option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has an NH2 group (since it's formamide, which is HCONH2). The ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. The formamide's carbonyl would be at around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 (amide carbonyl), which matches the IR's 1720? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1660-1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, so the given IR's 1720 is more an ester. So the IR's 1720 would not fit formamide. Therefore, option B's IR would not match. So B is out. \n\nSo between A and D. The key difference is the carbonyl peak. D is an ester (carbonyl at 1720), A is an amide (carbonyl at lower frequency). The given IR has 1720, so D is better. \n\nThe NMR of option A (3-ethoxybenzamide): the amide's carbonyl is at lower frequency, so the IR matches. Wait, the given IR's carbonyl is at 1720, which would not be an amide. So A's amide would have a carbonyl around 1680, which doesn't match 1720. So A is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D.\n\n\nThe compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. The IR spectrum shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, characteristic of an ester carbonyl group (C=O), and medium-to-strong N-H stretches at ~3400 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating an amine group (NH\u2082). The 1H NMR spectrum includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH\u2083 of ethyl group), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH\u2082 of ethyl group), and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (NH\u2082). The aromatic peaks at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring with electron-donating (NH\u2082) and electron-withdrawing (ester) groups. \n\n**Analysis of Options**:\n- **A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: Contains an amide (C=O) with a carbonyl around 1680 cm\u207b\u00b9, which does not match the IR's 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. Thus, excluded.\n- **B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: The formamide's carbonyl (~1660 cm\u207b\u00b9) also does not align with the IR data, so it is incorrect.\n- **C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: The molecular formula would be C\u2081\u2080H\u2081\u2083NO\u2082, inconsistent with C9H11NO2, so excluded.\n- **D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: Matches the molecular formula. The ester carbonyl (1720 cm\u207b\u00b9) aligns with the IR. The NMR peaks for the ethyl group (1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet) and the NH\u2082 (4.0 ppm broad singlet) fit. The aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are consistent with substituents causing distinct shielding effects (NH\u2082 and ester groups).\n\n**Answer: D**  \nThe correct answer is **D** as it satisfies all spectral and molecular formula criteria.\n\nAnswer: D",
