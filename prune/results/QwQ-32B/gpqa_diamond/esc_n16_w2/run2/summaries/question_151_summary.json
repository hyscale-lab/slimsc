      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system in the given state will yield 0. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. Wait, but first I might need to find the eigenvalues of the operator P and then see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0. Then, project the state onto those eigenvectors and compute the probabilities.\n\nLet me start by writing down the given state vector and the operator matrix. The state is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So the vector |\u03c8> is:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1 ]\n     [  2 ]\n     [  1 ]\n\nThe operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write its rows:\n\nFirst row: (0, 1/\u221a2, 0)\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2)\nThird row: (0, 1/\u221a2, 0)\n\nSo matrix P is:\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2   0     ]\n[1/\u221a2     0      1/\u221a2 ]\n[0        1/\u221a2   0     ]\n\nHmm, first step is probably to find the eigenvalues of P. Since P is an observable, it should be Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. The question is about the probability of getting 0, so I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P. If yes, then find its corresponding eigenvectors and compute the projection of the state onto those vectors.\n\nLet me try to find the eigenvalues first. The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    ]\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row.\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)*[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, maybe better to write out the terms step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, the third term is multiplied by zero, so that's gone.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb multiplied by ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)^2 )\n\nThat's -\u03bb*( \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ]\n\nWait, the second minor for the (1,2) element (since it's the 1,2 entry in the first row). Let me recall the formula for determinant expansion:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = sum_{j=1 to 3} [ element (1,j) * C(1,j) ]\n\nwhere C(1,j) is the cofactor, which is (-1)^{1+j} * M_{1,j}, where M_{1,j} is the minor.\n\nSo the first element (row1, col1) is -\u03bb, its minor is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and col1:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb   ]\n\nDeterminant is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)\n\nThe cofactor is (+1) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2)\n\nThen the second element (row1, col2) is 1/\u221a2, its minor is the determinant of the submatrix removing row1 and col2:\n\n[1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2 ]\n[0       -\u03bb   ]\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nThe cofactor here is (-1)^{1+2} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb/\u221a2)\n\nWait, the cofactor for (1,2) is (-1)^(1+2) * minor. So (-1)^3 is -1, so the cofactor is - (minor). The minor was -\u03bb/\u221a2, so cofactor is - (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nThird element is 0, so term is 0.\n\nTherefore, the determinant is:\n\n[ -\u03bb * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ] + [ (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ] + 0\n\nWait, hold on: the expansion is:\n\nelement (1,1)*cofactor(1,1) + element (1,2)*cofactor(1,2) + element(1,3)*cofactor(1,3)\n\nWait, the first term is (-\u03bb)*(cofactor1,1) ?\n\nWait, no, the element is -\u03bb (from the first row first column), multiplied by its cofactor (which is (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) as we found).\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me redo this step carefully.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\nelement[1,1] * cofactor(1,1) + element[1,2] * cofactor(1,2) + element[1,3] * cofactor(1,3)\n\nElement[1,1] = -\u03bb, cofactor is (+1)*(minor for (1,1)) = (\u03bb\u00b2 -1/2).\n\nSo first term: (-\u03bb)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nSecond term: element[1,2] is (1/\u221a2), its cofactor is (-1)^{1+2}*(minor for (1,2)).\n\nMinor for (1,2) is determinant of the submatrix when removing row1, column2:\n\nThe submatrix is rows 2,3 and columns 1,3:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3 (since column2 is removed). Wait the columns after removing column2 would be columns 1 and 3. So the submatrix for minor (1,2) is:\n\nRow2 (original rows 2 and 3? Wait, original rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3? Let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix for P - \u03bb I is:\n\nRow1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo when removing row1 and column2, the minor for (1,2) is the determinant of rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:\n\nRow2: entries in columns1 and 3: 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: entries in columns1 and 3: 0 and -\u03bb\n\nThus the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nHence the cofactor is (-1)^{1+2} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb/\u221a2 )\n\nTherefore, the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nThird term is element[1,3] which is 0, so that term is 0.\n\nPutting all together, determinant is:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) \n\nPlus second term: \u03bb/2 \n\nSo overall determinant equation:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 ?\n\nWait, let's compute the first term:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2))\n\nAdding the second term (\u03bb/2):\n\nTotal is -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo determinant equation: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1) =0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1)=0.\n\nThus eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then square the norm.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let me find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ] [v1]   [0]\n[1/\u221a2     0       1/\u221a2 ] [v2] = [0]\n[0        1/\u221a2     0     ] [v3]   [0]\n\nSo three equations:\n\nFirst equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so it gives v2=0 again.\n\nThus the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, so the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). Let me check that.\n\nYes, because if v2 must be 0, and v3 = -v1, so any vector is (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1,0,-1). So that's the basis.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for 0 are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). \n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [ -1, 2, 1]^T. We need to project this onto the eigenspace of 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is the component of \u03c8 in that direction.\n\nThe projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v = (1,0,-1) is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v / ||v||\u00b2 ) * v. But since we need the probability, which is the square of the norm of the projection divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2?\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the probability is the absolute square of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, but normalized. Wait, let me recall.\n\nThe probability P is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9, but if the state is already normalized. Wait, but first, we need to check if the state vector is normalized.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute its norm squared:\n\n(-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. Therefore, to compute probabilities, I must first normalize it.\n\nWait, but in some textbooks, the state is given as a vector, and probabilities are computed with the given vector, so maybe I need to compute the inner product with the eigenvector, then square it, then divide by the norm squared of the state?\n\nAlternatively, the probability is |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nYes, that's right. Because the state is not normalized, so the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nSo first, let's compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v (which is (1,0,-1)), then square it, and divide by the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector v is (1,0,-1), but it's not normalized either. Wait, actually, in the projection, the eigenvector should be normalized. Wait, perhaps I need to use the normalized eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, but in this case, the eigenvector we found is (1,0,-1). Let me see the norm of v: (1)^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so its norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, the probability is |\u27e8 normalized_eigenvec | \u03c8 \u27e9|\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the state is not normalized, so the full formula is:\n\nProbability = |\u27e8eigenvec | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors are part of the basis, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 as |v\u27e9 = (1, 0, -1)^T. Its norm squared is 1 + 0 +1 = 2, so |v\u27e9 normalized is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe given state |\u03c8\u27e9 is (-1, 2, 1)^T with norm squared 6. So the probability is |\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by 1? Wait, no, the probability is |\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9? Wait, no, in standard QM, the probability is |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where |a\u27e9 is normalized. But since \u03c8 is not normalized, the correct formula is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, let me recall. If the state is a ket |\u03c8\u27e9, not necessarily normalized, then the probability to get eigenvalue a is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9. Because \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 is the normalization factor. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the normalized state as |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u27e9 / ||\u03c8||, then the probability is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u2080\u27e9|\u00b2 = |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / ||\u03c8||\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, the inner product between the normalized eigenvector and the given state is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] \n\n= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2 \n\nSo the absolute square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. \n\nThe norm squared of the state is 6, so the probability is (2) /6 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the eigenvector for 0 is (1,0,-1). The normalized version is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nInner product with \u03c8 (-1,2,1):\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. \n\nThe square of the absolute value is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. \n\nThen the norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. \n\nThus probability is 2/6 = 1/3. So answer C.\n\nHmm, but wait, another way: the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace of 0 is the component along the eigenvector. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the component along (1,0,-1). \n\nAlternatively, the probability is (|\u03c8 \u00b7 v|\u00b2 ) / (||\u03c8||\u00b2 ||v||\u00b2 ) * ||v||\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the probability when projecting onto an eigenvector v is:\n\nProbability = (|\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2) / (\u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 )\n\nBut if v is not normalized, then:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product, but if v is not a unit vector, then you have to divide by ||v||\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of the projection. The projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v (not necessarily normalized) is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)/ (v \u00b7 v) ) * v. The squared norm of this projection is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ). The probability is this divided by the norm squared of \u03c8. \n\nAlternatively, the probability is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)^2 ) / ( (v \u00b7 v)(\u03c8 \u00b7 \u03c8) ) )? Wait, no, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is (|\u03c8 \u00b7 v|)^2 divided by (\u03c8 \u00b7 \u03c8) times (v \u00b7 v). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is when you have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, then the probability is the square of the coefficient. But in this case, the eigenvectors may not be normalized, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo using the normalized eigenvector, as I did first, gives the right answer. So the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, so option C.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Wait, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional here, so all vectors are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So there's only one direction. Thus the calculation holds.\n\nWait, but what if there were multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Then I would have to sum over all the orthogonal projections onto each eigenvector. But here, since it's one-dimensional, just one term. So the calculation is okay.\n\nAnother check: let's see if there's another approach. Since the operator P is given, perhaps the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenvalue 0. The projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0 is |v\u27e9\u27e8v|, where |v\u27e9 is the normalized eigenvector. Then the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 |\u03c8\u27e9 is equal to the probability. \n\nSo compute \u27e8\u03c8 | (|v\u27e9\u27e8v|) |\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, which is exactly the same as before. So that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 1/3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system in the given state will yield 0.

Wait, but first I might need to find the eigenvalues of the operator P and then see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0.

The characteristic equation is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2      0     ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2    -\u03bb    ]\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row.\n\nSo determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)*[ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0*... \n\nWait, maybe better to write out the terms step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] \n+ 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, the third term is multiplied by zero, so that's gone.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb multiplied by ( (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)^2 )\n\nThat's -\u03bb*( \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) )\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) multiplied by [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ]\n\nWait, the second minor for the (1,2) element (since it's the 1,2 entry in the first row). Let me recall the formula for determinant expansion:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = sum_{j=1 to 3} [ element (1,j) * C(1,j) ]\n\nwhere C(1,j) is the cofactor, which is (-1)^{1+j} * M_{1,j}, where M_{1,j} is the minor.\n\nSo the first element (row1, col1) is -\u03bb, its minor is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row1 and col1:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2 ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb   ]\n\nDeterminant is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)\n\nThe cofactor is (+1) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2)\n\nThen the second element (row1, col2) is 1/\u221a2, its minor is the determinant of the submatrix removing row1 and col2:\n\n[1/\u221a2    1/\u221a2 ]\n[0       -\u03bb   ]\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nThe cofactor here is (-1)^{1+2} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb/\u221a2)\n\nWait, the cofactor for (1,2) is (-1)^(1+2) * minor. So (-1)^3 is -1, so the cofactor is - (minor). The minor was -\u03bb/\u221a2, so cofactor is - (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/\u221a2. \n\nThird element is 0, so term is 0.\n\nTherefore, the determinant is:\n\n[ -\u03bb * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) ] + [ (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2) ] + 0\n\nWait, hold on: the expansion is:\n\nelement (1,1)*cofactor(1,1) + element (1,2)*cofactor(1,2) + element(1,3)*cofactor(1,3)\n\nWait, the first term is (-\u03bb)*(cofactor1,1) ?\n\nWait, no, the element is -\u03bb (from the first row first column), multiplied by its cofactor (which is (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) as we found).\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me redo this step carefully.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\nelement[1,1] * cofactor(1,1) + element[1,2] * cofactor(1,2) + element[1,3] * cofactor(1,3)\n\nElement[1,1] = -\u03bb, cofactor is (+1)*(minor for (1,1)) = (\u03bb\u00b2 -1/2).\n\nSo first term: (-\u03bb)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2).\n\nSecond term: element[1,2] is (1/\u221a2), its cofactor is (-1)^{1+2}*(minor for (1,2)).\n\nMinor for (1,2) is determinant of the submatrix when removing row1, column2:\n\nThe submatrix is rows 2,3 and columns 1,3:\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWait, no, wait rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3 (since column2 is removed). Wait the columns after removing column2 would be columns 1 and 3. So the submatrix for minor (1,2) is:\n\nRow2 (original rows 2 and 3? Wait, original rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3? Let me see:\n\nOriginal matrix for P - \u03bb I is:\n\nRow1: [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow2: [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow3: [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nSo when removing row1 and column2, the minor for (1,2) is the determinant of rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:\n\nRow2: entries in columns1 and 3: 1/\u221a2 and 1/\u221a2\n\nRow3: entries in columns1 and 3: 0 and -\u03bb\n\nThus the minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nDeterminant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nHence the cofactor is (-1)^{1+2} * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb/\u221a2 )\n\nTherefore, the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nThird term is element[1,3] which is 0, so that term is 0.\n\nPutting all together, determinant is:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) \n\nPlus second term: \u03bb/2 \n\nSo overall determinant equation:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) + (\u03bb/2) = 0 ?\n\nWait, let's compute the first term:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2))\n\nAdding the second term (\u03bb/2):\n\nTotal is -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo determinant equation: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1) =0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 -1)=0.\n\nThus eigenvalues are \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. So the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So we need to find the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then square the norm.\n\nSo first, find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Let me find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nSo the matrix equation is:\n\n[ 0        1/\u221a2     0     ] [v1]   [0]\n[1/\u221a2     0       1/\u221a2 ] [v2] = [0]\n[0        1/\u221a2     0     ] [v3]   [0]\n\nSo three equations:\n\nFirst equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so it gives v2=0 again.\n\nThus the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).\n\nWait, so the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1,0,-1). Let me check that.\n\nYes, because if v2 must be 0, and v3 = -v1, so any vector is (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1,0,-1). So that's the basis.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors for 0 are all scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). \n\nNow, the state vector is \u03c8 = [ -1, 2, 1]^T. We need to project this onto the eigenspace of 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is the component of \u03c8 in that direction.\n\nThe projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v = (1,0,-1) is (\u03c8 \u00b7 v / ||v||\u00b2 ) * v. But since we need the probability, which is the square of the norm of the projection divided by ||\u03c8||\u00b2?\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the probability is the absolute square of the inner product of the state with the eigenvector, but normalized. Wait, let me recall.\n\nThe probability P is |\u27e8v|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9, but if the state is already normalized. Wait, but first, we need to check if the state vector is normalized.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute its norm squared:\n\n(-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. Therefore, to compute probabilities, I must first normalize it.\n\nWait, but in some textbooks, the state is given as a vector, and probabilities are computed with the given vector, so maybe I need to compute the inner product with the eigenvector, then square it, then divide by the norm squared of the state?\n\nAlternatively, the probability is |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nYes, that's right. Because the state is not normalized, so the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product divided by the norm squared of the state.\n\nSo first, let's compute the inner product between \u03c8 and the eigenvector v (which is (1,0,-1)), then square it, and divide by the norm squared of \u03c8.\n\nWait, but the eigenvector v is (1,0,-1), but it's not normalized either. Wait, actually, in the projection, the eigenvector should be normalized. Wait, perhaps I need to use the normalized eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, but in this case, the eigenvector we found is (1,0,-1). Let me see the norm of v: (1)^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so its norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nTherefore, the probability is |\u27e8 normalized_eigenvec | \u03c8 \u27e9|\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the state is not normalized, so the full formula is:\n\nProbability = |\u27e8eigenvec | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvectors are part of the basis, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 as |v\u27e9 = (1, 0, -1)^T. Its norm squared is 1 + 0 +1 = 2, so |v\u27e9 normalized is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe given state |\u03c8\u27e9 is (-1, 2, 1)^T with norm squared 6. So the probability is |\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by 1? Wait, no, the probability is |\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9? Wait, no, in standard QM, the probability is |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 where |a\u27e9 is normalized. But since \u03c8 is not normalized, the correct formula is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 ?\n\nWait, let me recall. If the state is a ket |\u03c8\u27e9, not necessarily normalized, then the probability to get eigenvalue a is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 divided by \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9. Because \u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 is the normalization factor. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the normalized state as |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u27e9 / ||\u03c8||, then the probability is |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u2080\u27e9|\u00b2 = |\u27e8a | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 / ||\u03c8||\u00b2.\n\nSo in this case, the inner product between the normalized eigenvector and the given state is:\n\n\u27e8v_normalized | \u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= [ -1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2 ] \n\n= -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2 \n\nSo the absolute square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. \n\nThe norm squared of the state is 6, so the probability is (2) /6 = 1/3.\n\nTherefore the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the eigenvector for 0 is (1,0,-1). The normalized version is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nInner product with \u03c8 (-1,2,1):\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\n= (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. \n\nThe square of the absolute value is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. \n\nThen the norm squared of \u03c8 is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. \n\nThus probability is 2/6 = 1/3. So answer C.\n\nHmm, but wait, another way: the projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenspace of 0 is the component along the eigenvector. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, it's just the component along (1,0,-1). \n\nAlternatively, the probability is (|\u03c8 \u00b7 v|\u00b2 ) / (||\u03c8||\u00b2 ||v||\u00b2 ) * ||v||\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the probability when projecting onto an eigenvector v is:\n\nProbability = (|\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2) / (\u27e8\u03c8 | \u03c8\u27e9 )\n\nBut if v is not normalized, then:\n\n\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9 is the inner product, but if v is not a unit vector, then you have to divide by ||v||\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of the projection. The projection of \u03c8 onto the eigenvector v (not necessarily normalized) is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)/ (v \u00b7 v) ) * v. The squared norm of this projection is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)^2 ) / (v \u00b7 v) ). The probability is this divided by the norm squared of \u03c8. \n\nAlternatively, the probability is ( (\u03c8 \u00b7 v)^2 ) / ( (v \u00b7 v)(\u03c8 \u00b7 \u03c8) ) )? Wait, no, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, the probability is (|\u03c8 \u00b7 v|)^2 divided by (\u03c8 \u00b7 \u03c8) times (v \u00b7 v). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is when you have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, then the probability is the square of the coefficient. But in this case, the eigenvectors may not be normalized, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo using the normalized eigenvector, as I did first, gives the right answer. So the steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3, so option C.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there are other eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0. Wait, the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional here, so all vectors are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So there's only one direction. Thus the calculation holds.\n\nWait, but what if there were multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0? Then I would have to sum over all the orthogonal projections onto each eigenvector. But here, since it's one-dimensional, just one term. So the calculation is okay.\n\nAnother check: let's see if there's another approach. Since the operator P is given, perhaps the probability is the expectation value of the projection operator onto the eigenvalue 0. The projection operator onto the eigenspace of 0 is |v\u27e9\u27e8v|, where |v\u27e9 is the normalized eigenvector. Then the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8 | P_0 |\u03c8\u27e9 is equal to the probability. \n\nSo compute \u27e8\u03c8 | (|v\u27e9\u27e8v|) |\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u27e8v | \u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, which is exactly the same as before. So that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 1/3.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) yielding 0 at time \\( t \\), we first determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( P \\). The characteristic equation of \\( P \\) is found to be \\( \\lambda(\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \\), yielding eigenvalues \\( 0 \\), \\( 1 \\), and \\( -1 \\). \n\nFor the eigenvalue \\( 0 \\), solving \\( P\\mathbf{v} = 0\\mathbf{v} \\) gives eigenvectors of the form \\( (v_1, 0, -v_1)^T \\). A normalized eigenvector is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \\).\n\nThe state vector is \\( |\\psi\\rangle = (-1, 2, 1)^T \\), with norm squared \\( \\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 6 \\). The inner product with the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \\left| \\psi \\right. \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe probability is the squared absolute value of this inner product divided by the norm squared of \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{|\\ -\\sqrt{2}\\ |^2}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system gives 0 at time t. The system's state is given by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, first I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P. The question is asking specifically for the probability of getting 0, so I should check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P and then find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nLet me start by writing down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). So it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observable operators are Hermitian (and real symmetric if the entries are real, which they are here). \n\nFirst step: Find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0. Let me set up that determinant. \n\nThe matrix P - \u03bbI would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2        0     ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2    ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute it. \n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)* [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, maybe it's better to write out the minors properly. Let me see:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * determinant of the minor matrix for the first element (the (2,2) and (2,3) elements? Wait, no, the minor for the first element (row 1, column 1) is the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:\n\nSo the minor for the first element (the -\u03bb in the first row first column) is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)\n\nThen the next term is the cofactor for the second element (1/\u221a2 in first row second column). Since it's the first row second column, the sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is - (1/\u221a2) * determinant of the minor matrix when removing first row and second column. That minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2   1/\u221a2 ]\n[0      -\u03bb   ]\n\nThe determinant here is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nThe third element in the first row is 0, so its term is 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/(2) \n\nWait, hold on. Wait the first term was -\u03bb*(minor determinant), but with the cofactor sign. Wait, actually, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the determinant expansion along the first row is:\n\nelement (1,1) * M11 - element (1,2)*M12 + element (1,3)*M13\n\nWait, no, the cofactor expansion alternates signs. The formula is sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} * C_{ij}, where C_{ij} is (-1)^{i+j} * M_{ij}, the minor.\n\nSo for the first row:\n\nFirst term (row 1, column 1):\n\na_{11} * C_{11} = (-\u03bb) * [ (-1)^{1+1} * M11 ]\n\nM11 is the minor determinant we computed earlier, which was \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2. So the first term is (-\u03bb)*(1)*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2)\n\nSecond term (row 1, column 2):\n\na_{12} is 1/\u221a2, multiplied by C_{12} which is (-1)^{1+2} * M12. \n\nThe minor M12 is the determinant of the submatrix when removing row1 and column2:\n\nSo the submatrix is rows 2,3 and columns 1,3:\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nRow3: [0, -\u03bb]\n\nWait, the original matrix P - \u03bbI's second row (after removing column 2) would be:\n\nOriginal second row is [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2], but removing column 2 gives [1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\nThird row (original third row [0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb], removing column2 gives [0, -\u03bb]\n\nSo the minor matrix for M12 is:\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, -\u03bb]\n\nThe determinant is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nThus, the second term is (1/\u221a2) * [ (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) ] ?\n\nWait, the cofactor C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * M12 = (-1)^3 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (-1)^3 is -1, so -1 * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/\u221a2.\n\nWait, so the second term is (1/\u221a2) * (C12) = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nWait, I might have messed up here, but let me proceed.\n\nThird term (row1, column3) is 0, so it doesn't contribute.\n\nSo total determinant is first term + second term + third term:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) \n\nWait, wait the second term was (1/\u221a2)*(C12). Wait, C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * M12 = (-1)^3 * M12. M12 was -\u03bb/\u221a2, so (-1)^3*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/\u221a2. So the cofactor C12 is \u03bb/\u221a2. Then the term is a_{12}*C12 = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nTherefore, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nWait, wait, let's do the math again:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) = -\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb\n\nSecond term is + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSo total determinant:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb) + 0.5\u03bb = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo determinant equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) =0 \u2192 \u03bb(1-\u03bb)(1+\u03bb)=0\n\nWait, solving for \u03bb: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1)=0 \u2192 so eigenvalues are \u03bb =0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. The question is about the probability of measuring 0, so we need the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 and compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector, then square the norm.\n\nTherefore, first step: find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo solving (P - 0*I)v =0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow1: 0   1/\u221a2   0\n\nRow2:1/\u221a2  0   1/\u221a2\n\nRow3:0   1/\u221a2   0\n\nSo equations:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3=0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nThus, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). Because v2 must be 0, and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector would be (1,0,-1) divided by its norm. Let's compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nWait, but there might be another eigenvector? Wait, the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1? Let me check the dimension of the eigenspace. The equations for v2=0 and v3=-v1. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait no. Wait, v1 can be any value, v2 must be 0, v3 must be -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So that's a one-dimensional subspace. Because it's determined by one parameter (v1), so the multiplicity is 1. Hmm, but maybe the algebraic multiplicity is 1, geometric as well.\n\nWait, but let me check the trace of the matrix. The trace of P is 0 +0 +0 =0. The sum of eigenvalues should be 0+1+(-1)=0, which matches.\n\nNow, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1 would be needed for other eigenvalues, but since we only need the probability for 0, we can focus on the eigenvector for 0.\n\nSo the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2,1). Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nTo find the probability that a measurement yields 0, we need the squared modulus of the inner product between |\u03c8> and the normalized eigenvector corresponding to 0, which is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nSo let's compute the inner product:\n\n<eigenvec | \u03c8> = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\nCalculates as:\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) = -1/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: 0*2 =0\n\nThird component: (-1/\u221a2)(1) = -1/\u221a2\n\nAdding them together: (-1/\u221a2) +0 + (-1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe modulus squared of this is | -\u221a2 |\u00b2 = (\u221a2)^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Wait, maybe I messed up the eigenvector?\n\nWait, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 was (1,0,-1), normalized to (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). Let me check again the inner product.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nThe eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\nYes, that's (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2? That's impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Wait, let me re-examine the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0. Let me re-derive them again.\n\nThe equations from Pv =0:\n\nFirst equation: (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: (1/\u221a2)v2=0 \u2192 same as first equation, so no new info.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are indeed (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvector is correct. \n\nBut then the inner product gives a modulus squared of 2? That can't be. Because probabilities can't exceed 1. So where's the error?\n\nAh, maybe I need to consider that the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, so the projection is onto that vector. But perhaps I need to consider all possible eigenvectors? Wait, no. The state vector is being projected onto the eigenspace. Wait, but in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the projection is onto that single eigenvector. The inner product squared is the probability. But getting a value greater than 1 is impossible, so that suggests an error in calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the inner product again step by step:\n\nEigenvector components:\n\nFirst component: 1/\u221a2 multiplied by state's first component (-1): (1/\u221a2)(-1)\n\nSecond component: 0 multiplied by 2: 0\n\nThird component: -1/\u221a2 multiplied by 1: (-1/\u221a2)(1)\n\nAdding these terms:\n\n( -1/\u221a2 ) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2 ) = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2 (since 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2). \n\nSo modulus squared is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2. Which is impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, maybe the eigenvector isn't normalized properly?\n\nWait, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so when normalized, it's (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). That's correct. So the inner product calculation is correct. But the probability can't be 2. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the eigenvalues? Let me check the eigenvalues again. The determinant equation was -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1)=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the state vector isn't normalized? Let me check the norm of the state vector given. The state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. Oh! Right, that's the problem. The state vector must be normalized for probabilities to make sense. So the given state is not a unit vector. Therefore, I need to first normalize it, then compute the inner product, then square it.\n\nAh, that's the mistake. I completely forgot to normalize the state vector. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm squared is 1 +4 +1 =6. So the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)*[-1; 2;1].\n\nTherefore, the inner product with the eigenvector (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2) is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)*[ (-1)(1/\u221a2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/\u221a2) ]\n\nCalculates as:\n\n(1/\u221a6) [ (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) ] = (1/\u221a6)(-2/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a6)( -\u221a2 )\n\nBecause 2/\u221a2 is \u221a2. So the inner product is -\u221a2 / \u221a6. \n\nThe modulus squared is ( (\u221a2 / \u221a6 ) )\u00b2 = (2/6) = 1/3. \n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe normalized state vector is (1/\u221a6)(-1,2,1). The eigenvector for 0 is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). The inner product is:\n\n( -1/\u221a6 * 1/\u221a2 ) + ( 2/\u221a6 *0 ) + (1/\u221a6 * -1/\u221a2 )\n\n= [ -1/(\u221a6 \u221a2) ) ] + 0 + [ -1/(\u221a6 \u221a2) ]\n\n= -2/(\u221a6 \u221a2 ) \n\nWhich simplifies to -2 / (\u221a12) = -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3. \n\nThe modulus squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 =1/3. \n\nAh, right, that's correct. So I made a mistake earlier in the calculation steps by not normalizing the state vector. So the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P on the system gives 0 at time t. The system's state is given by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Hmm, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, first I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P. The question is asking specifically for the probability of getting 0, so I should check if 0 is an eigenvalue of P and then find the corresponding eigenvectors.\n\nLet me start by writing down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), the second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and the third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). So it's a symmetric matrix, which is good because observable operators are Hermitian (and real symmetric if the entries are real, which they are here). \n\nFirst step: Find the eigenvalues of P. To do that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0. Let me set up that determinant. \n\nThe matrix P - \u03bbI would be:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2        0     ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2    ]\n[ 0      1/\u221a2      -\u03bb     ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix should be zero. Let's compute it. \n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)* [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ] \n\nWait, maybe it's better to write out the minors properly. Let me see:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * determinant of the minor matrix for the first element (the (2,2) and (2,3) elements? Wait, no, the minor for the first element (row 1, column 1) is the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:\n\nSo the minor for the first element (the -\u03bb in the first row first column) is the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n[ -\u03bb      1/\u221a2    ]\n[1/\u221a2    -\u03bb      ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2)\n\nThen the next term is the cofactor for the second element (1/\u221a2 in first row second column). Since it's the first row second column, the sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is - (1/\u221a2) * determinant of the minor matrix when removing first row and second column. That minor matrix is:\n\n[1/\u221a2   1/\u221a2 ]\n[0      -\u03bb   ]\n\nThe determinant here is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nSo the second term is - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nThe third element in the first row is 0, so its term is 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + \u03bb/(2) \n\nWait, hold on. Wait the first term was -\u03bb*(minor determinant), but with the cofactor sign. Wait, actually, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the determinant expansion along the first row is:\n\nelement (1,1) * M11 - element (1,2)*M12 + element (1,3)*M13\n\nWait, no, the cofactor expansion alternates signs. The formula is sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} * C_{ij}, where C_{ij} is (-1)^{i+j} * M_{ij}, the minor.\n\nSo for the first row:\n\nFirst term (row 1, column 1):\n\na_{11} * C_{11} = (-\u03bb) * [ (-1)^{1+1} * M11 ]\n\nM11 is the minor determinant we computed earlier, which was \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2.

Wait, C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * M12 = (-1)^3 * M12. M12 was -\u03bb/\u221a2, so (-1)^3*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb)/\u221a2. So the cofactor C12 is \u03bb/\u221a2. Then the term is a_{12}*C12 = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2).\n\nTherefore, the determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nWait, wait, let's do the math again:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb^3 + (\u03bb*(1/2)) = -\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb\n\nSecond term is + (\u03bb/2)\n\nSo total determinant:\n\n(-\u03bb^3 + 0.5\u03bb) + 0.5\u03bb = -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSo determinant equation is -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb(1 - \u03bb\u00b2) =0 \u2192 \u03bb(1-\u03bb)(1+\u03bb)=0\n\nWait, solving for \u03bb: -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1)=0 \u2192 so eigenvalues are \u03bb =0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1.\n\nAh, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. The question is about the probability of measuring 0, so we need the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 and compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector, then square the norm.\n\nTherefore, first step: find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nSo solving (P - 0*I)v =0 \u2192 Pv=0.\n\nThe matrix P is:\n\nRow1: 0   1/\u221a2   0\n\nRow2:1/\u221a2  0   1/\u221a2\n\nRow3:0   1/\u221a2   0\n\nSo equations:\n\n0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 +0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 (v1 + v3)/\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3=0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 +0*v3 =0 \u2192 same as first equation, so v2=0.\n\nThus, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So any scalar multiple of (1,0,-1). Because v2 must be 0, and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are spanned by (1, 0, -1).\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector would be (1,0,-1) divided by its norm. Let's compute the norm: sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nWait, but there might be another eigenvector? Wait, the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1? Let me check the dimension of the eigenspace. The equations for v2=0 and v3=-v1. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait no. Wait, v1 can be any value, v2 must be 0, v3 must be -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So that's a one-dimensional subspace. Because it's determined by one parameter (v1), so the multiplicity is 1. Hmm, but maybe the algebraic multiplicity is 1, geometric as well.\n\nWait, but let me check the trace of the matrix. The trace of P is 0 +0 +0 =0. The sum of eigenvalues should be 0+1+(-1)=0, which matches.\n\nNow, the eigenvectors for \u03bb=1 and \u03bb=-1 would be needed for other eigenvalues, but since we only need the probability for 0, we can focus on the eigenvector for 0.\n\nSo the state vector is given as a column matrix (-1, 2,1). Let me denote the state vector as |\u03c8> = [ -1; 2; 1 ].\n\nTo find the probability that a measurement yields 0, we need the squared modulus of the inner product between |\u03c8> and the normalized eigenvector corresponding to 0, which is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nSo let's compute the inner product:\n\n<eigenvec | \u03c8> = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\nCalculates as:\n\nFirst component: (1/\u221a2)(-1) = -1/\u221a2\n\nSecond component: 0*2 =0\n\nThird component: (-1/\u221a2)(1) = -1/\u221a2\n\nAdding them together: (-1/\u221a2) +0 + (-1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2.\n\nThe modulus squared of this is | -\u221a2 |\u00b2 = (\u221a2)^2 = 2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. Wait, maybe I messed up the eigenvector?\n\nWait, the eigenvector for \u03bb=0 was (1,0,-1), normalized to (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). Let me check again the inner product.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nThe eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the inner product is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) \n\nYes, that's (-1/\u221a2) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2) = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2. The square is (\u221a2)^2 = 2. But that's a probability of 2? That's impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector. Wait, let me re-examine the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0. Let me re-derive them again.\n\nThe equations from Pv =0:\n\nFirst equation: (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 \u2192 v2=0.\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v3 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0 \u2192 v3 = -v1.\n\nThird equation: (1/\u221a2)v2=0 \u2192 same as first equation, so no new info.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are indeed (v1, 0, -v1). So the eigenvector is correct. \n\nBut then the inner product gives a modulus squared of 2? That can't be. Because probabilities can't exceed 1. So where's the error?\n\nAh, maybe I need to consider that the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, so the projection is onto that vector. But perhaps I need to consider all possible eigenvectors? Wait, no. The state vector is being projected onto the eigenspace. Wait, but in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the projection is onto that single eigenvector. The inner product squared is the probability. But getting a value greater than 1 is impossible, so that suggests an error in calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the inner product again step by step:\n\nEigenvector components:\n\nFirst component: 1/\u221a2 multiplied by state's first component (-1): (1/\u221a2)(-1)\n\nSecond component: 0 multiplied by 2: 0\n\nThird component: -1/\u221a2 multiplied by 1: (-1/\u221a2)(1)\n\nAdding these terms:\n\n( -1/\u221a2 ) + 0 + (-1/\u221a2 ) = (-2)/\u221a2 = -\u221a2 (since 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2). \n\nSo modulus squared is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2. Which is impossible. So something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, maybe the eigenvector isn't normalized properly?\n\nWait, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1\u00b2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so when normalized, it's (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). That's correct. So the inner product calculation is correct. But the probability can't be 2. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the eigenvalues? Let me check the eigenvalues again. The determinant equation was -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb =0 \u2192 \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 +1)=0 \u2192 \u03bb=0, \u03bb=1, \u03bb=-1. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the state vector isn't normalized? Let me check the norm of the state vector given. The state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. Oh! Right, that's the problem. The state vector must be normalized for probabilities to make sense. So the given state is not a unit vector. Therefore, I need to first normalize it, then compute the inner product, then square it.\n\nAh, that's the mistake. I completely forgot to normalize the state vector. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the state vector is |\u03c8> = [ -1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm squared is 1 +4 +1 =6. So the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)*[-1; 2;1].\n\nTherefore, the inner product with the eigenvector (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2) is:\n\n(1/\u221a6)*[ (-1)(1/\u221a2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/\u221a2) ]\n\nCalculates as:\n\n(1/\u221a6) [ (-1/\u221a2 -1/\u221a2) ] = (1/\u221a6)(-2/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a6)( -\u221a2 )\n\nBecause 2/\u221a2 is \u221a2. So the inner product is -\u221a2 / \u221a6. \n\nThe modulus squared is ( (\u221a2 / \u221a6 ) )\u00b2 = (2/6) = 1/3. \n\nSo the probability is 1/3. So the answer should be C) 1/3.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe normalized state vector is (1/\u221a6)(-1,2,1). The eigenvector for 0 is (1/\u221a2,0,-1/\u221a2). The inner product is:\n\n( -1/\u221a6 * 1/\u221a2 ) + ( 2/\u221a6 *0 ) + (1/\u221a6 * -1/\u221a2 )\n\n= [ -1/(\u221a6 \u221a2) ) ] + 0 + [ -1/(\u221a6 \u221a2) ]\n\n= -2/(\u221a6 \u221a2 ) \n\nWhich simplifies to -2 / (\u221a12) = -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3. \n\nThe modulus squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 =1/3. \n\nAh, right, that's correct. So I made a mistake earlier in the calculation steps by not normalizing the state vector. So the correct probability is 1/3, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo calculate the probability of measuring the observable \\( P \\) as 0, we first find the eigenvalues of \\( P \\). Solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\) yields eigenvalues \\( 0 \\), \\( 1 \\), and \\( -1 \\).
