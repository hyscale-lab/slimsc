      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for different complexes. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that stability constants (\u03b2) are related to the formation constants of the complexes. The stability constants here are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u03b24. Since Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- up to four, like [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)2]^-, [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)4]^3-, right? Wait, but the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)2]^+? Or maybe the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN- ligands. Let me confirm: the dithiocyanato would be two, so that's the second complex, so \u03b22 is for the second one. The problem states the percentage of this among all cobalt species. \n\nThe given concentrations are total Co = 1e-2 M and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, the stability constants for higher complexes are decreasing here? Like \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22? Wait, \u03b23 is 63 which is higher than \u03b22's 40? Wait, but \u03b24 is 16. That seems odd because usually, the stability constants might not necessarily increase with more ligands, but maybe in this case, the trend is different. \n\nSo, the approach here is to calculate the distribution of all the cobalt species, then find the fraction that is the [Co(SCN)2]^+ complex. \n\nFirst, let's note the possible species. The cobalt can exist as Co^2+ (the free ion), [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0 (since each SCN- adds a negative charge?), wait, actually the charges need to be considered. Let me think:\n\nCo(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So, when forming a complex with n SCN- ions, the charge would be 2+ minus n*( -1?), wait no. Each SCN- is a ligand that donates a pair of electrons. The charge of the complex would be (charge of Co) plus the charges from the ligands. Since SCN- is a monodentate ligand with charge -1, each SCN- adds a -1 charge. So:\n\nThe species are:\n\nCo^2+ (no ligands)\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ -1 = +1? Wait, no: Co^2+ has charge +2. Adding one SCN- (charge -1) would give a complex with charge +2 -1 = +1? Wait, actually, when the ligand is a negative ion, the overall charge is the sum. So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have charge (2+) + (-1) = +1? So each SCN- adds -1. So:\n\nSpecies:\n\nCo^2+ \u2192 charge +2\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ \u2192 +1\n\n[Co(SCN)2]^0 \u2192 neutral (charge 0)\n\n[Co(SCN)3]^\u2212 \u2192 -1\n\n[Co(SCN)4]^2\u2212 \u2192 -2\n\nWait, so the dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is neutral. The question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\" \u2014 I think the blue color is associated with this species. \n\nNow, the stability constants \u03b2n are for the formation of n SCN- ligands. The \u03b2 values given are \u03b21=9 (for n=1), \u03b22=40 (n=2), \u03b23=63 (n=3), \u03b24=16 (n=4). Wait, so \u03b24 is lower than \u03b23. Interesting. \n\nThe formula for the concentration of each complex is based on the stability constants. The general approach is to use the equilibrium expressions and the total concentration of Co. \n\nThe total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^\u2212 + [Co(SCN)4]^2\u2212 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nThe SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M, but since SCN- is a ligand, its concentration will be affected by the complexes formed. Wait, but the problem might be assuming that the SCN- concentration is approximately constant because it's in excess? Let me see. The initial SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 10 mM, and the Co is 0.01 M (10 mM). Wait, actually, the total Co is 0.01 M, which is 10 mM, and SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 100 mM. Since the SCN- concentration is higher than the Co, it's possible that SCN- is in excess, so its concentration doesn't change much. But I need to check if that's a valid assumption here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed using the stability constants and the formula for the distribution of species. \n\nThe formula for each species is:\n\nFor n ligands, the concentration is [Co^(2+)] * ( [SCN-]^n * \u03b2n ) divided by the sum over all terms (sum_{k=0 to 4} \u03b2k [SCN-]^k )\n\nWait, actually, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:\n\nThe fraction of the nth complex is ( \u03b2n [SCN-]^n ) / ( 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4 )\n\nWait, let me think again. The total concentration of Co is given by:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-] + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^4 = c(Co)\n\nLet me denote [Co\u00b2+] as x. Then the equation becomes:\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ) = c(Co)\n\nTherefore, x = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nThen, the concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)2]^0 = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nSo the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:\n\n( \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) / ( 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nBecause the [Co\u00b2+] cancels out when taking the ratio. \n\nTherefore, the percentage is ( \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) divided by the denominator multiplied by 100. \n\nGiven that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, but since we are looking for the fraction among all species, the actual concentration of Co doesn't affect the fraction (since it's a ratio). \n\nWait, that's correct. The fraction depends only on the \u03b2 and [SCN-]. \n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. \n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nThe [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nCompute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm0 = 1 \n\nTerm1 = \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \n\nTerm2 = \u03b22 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 \n\nTerm3 = \u03b23 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063 \n\nTerm4 = \u03b24 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 \n\nAdding all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9 \n\n1.9 +0.4 = 2.3 \n\n2.3 +0.063 = 2.363 \n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 \n\nSo denominator is 2.3646 \n\nThe numerator for the dithiocyanato (n=2) is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 \n\nTherefore, the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 0.4? Let me check:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169: \n\n2 \u00d7 0.169 is 0.338, 0.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 0.0615, total \u2248 0.4, so maybe 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169? Wait, but 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which would be 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options include D)16.9%. But wait the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but according to this calculation, that's 0.4 divided by ~2.3646 gives approx 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D. But let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait the numerator is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2, which is 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4. The denominator is the sum of all terms, which is 2.3646. \n\n0.4 / 2.3646 = let me compute it more accurately:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 = ?\n\n0.169 * 2 = 0.338\n\n0.169 * 0.3646 \u2248 0.169 * 0.3 = 0.0507, plus 0.169 * 0.0646 \u2248 ~0.0109, so total \u2248 0.0507 +0.0109 = 0.0616, so total is 0.338 +0.0616= 0.4, so yes, 0.169 gives exactly 0.4. So the fraction is 0.169, so 16.9%, which would be option D. \n\nBut wait, the options have A)42.3, B)25.6, C)38.1, D)16.9. Hmm. But I need to check if I considered the correct complex. Wait, the dithiocyanato is the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0. \n\nWait, but wait another thought: the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. But in the formula, we assumed that the denominator is the sum of the terms, and the [Co^2+] is c(Co) divided by that sum. So the calculation for the fraction is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the \u03b2 values? Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nYes. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm, so according to this, the answer is D)16.9%. But wait, the options include 42.3%, which is higher than the n=1 term. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the term for n=1 is \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 *0.1 =0.9. The term for n=2 is 0.4. Wait, but the denominator's largest term is actually the first term (term1=0.9?), no. Wait:\n\nWait the terms:\n\nTerm0 =1, term1=0.9, term2=0.4, term3=0.063, term4=0.0016. The sum is 2.3646. The largest term is term0 (1) and term1 (0.9) are the largest. Wait, so the largest term is term1 (0.9) and term0 (1) so the first two terms are the largest. So the dominant species would be the free Co^2+ (term0) and the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ (term1). \n\nWait, so the fraction for n=0 (free Co^2+) is 1/(2.3646) \u2248 0.423, so 42.3%. So the free Co is the most abundant, then the first complex. The second complex (n=2) is 0.4/2.3646 \u2248 16.9%, but that's D. \n\nWait but why is the answer not 42.3%? The question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex. \n\nHmm, so according to my calculation, it's 16.9%, which is option D. But maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me rederive the fraction. \n\nThe formula for the concentration of the nth species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^n \n\nThe total concentration of Co is:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4) = c(Co) \n\nTherefore, [Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / denominator. \n\nThus, the concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^0 is \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 (c(Co)/denominator) [SCN-]^2 \n\nThe total concentration of all species is c(Co). \n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) \n\nWait, because [Co(SCN)2]^0 = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nDivide by total Co (c(Co)), you get [Co(SCN)2]^0 / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) \n\nYes, so the fraction is indeed \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 divided by the denominator. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the calculation is correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nWait, but the problem states the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe I made a mistake in the charge? Let me confirm the dithiocyanato complex's charge. \n\nWait, Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So adding two SCN- gives +2 -2*(1) = 0. So the charge is 0, so the species is [Co(SCN)2]^0. \n\nIs there another possible complex that's blue? For example, sometimes different complexes have different colors. Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanate complex is actually a different one? Wait, maybe the problem refers to the tetraammine or something else? No, the question specifies \"dithiocyanato\", which would be two SCN- ligands. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the stability constants. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nYes. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the answer options have 42.3% as option A. That's the fraction of free Co^2+, which is term0 (1) divided by denominator (2.3646), so 1/2.3646 \u22480.423, so 42.3%, which is option A. But that's the free ion, not the complex. \n\nSo the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complex (n=2), so the answer is D) 16.9%. \n\nWait, but why is the \u03b23 so high? \u03b23=63. Let's see the term for n=3 is 63*(0.1)^3= 63*0.001=0.063. So that term is smaller than term2's 0.4. \n\nWait, so the third complex (n=3) contributes 0.063 to the denominator, so its fraction is 0.063/2.3646\u2248 ~2.66%. \n\nThe fourth complex (n=4) is 0.0016, so negligible. \n\nSo the distribution is:\n\nFree Co: ~42.3%\n\nFirst complex (n=1): 0.9/2.3646 \u2248 0.380 \u2192 38.0% \n\nSecond complex (n=2): ~16.9%\n\nThird: ~2.66%\n\nFourth: ~0.068%\n\nWait, adding all those up: 42.3 +38.0 is 80.3, plus 16.9 is 97.2, plus 2.66 is ~99.86, and the last is 0.068 gives ~99.93. Close enough considering rounding. \n\nSo the blue complex (n=2) is indeed ~16.9%, which is option D. \n\nHmm. Then the answer must be D. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is asking for the dithiocyanato complex as the third one? Like maybe I miscounted the ligands? Let me check. \n\nWait, \"dithiocyanato\" means di- (two) thiocyanato ligands, so yes, two SCN- ligands. So n=2. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of stability constants. Sometimes, stability constants are given as log values, but here they are given as \u03b2 values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses \u03b2 values for the formation of each successive ligand instead of cumulative. Wait, no, the standard \u03b2 is the cumulative stability constant. For example, \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN]^2). So my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the units. The concentrations are given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M and SCN- is 0.1 M. Let me check if the assumption that [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 is valid. \n\nThe total SCN- consumed would be the sum over n (n*[Co(SCN)n]). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nThe concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] = c(Co)/denominator \u2248 1e-2 / 2.3646 \u2248 ~0.00423 M \n\nFirst complex (n=1): \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN]^2? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ has concentration \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]. \n\nSo [Co(SCN)]^+ = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.00423 * 0.1 \u2248 0.003807 M \n\nSimilarly, the second complex: \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-]^2 =40 *0.00423*(0.1)^2 =40*0.00423*0.01= 40*0.0000423= ~0.00169 M \n\nThird complex: \u03b23*[Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^3=63 *0.00423*(0.1)^3=63*0.00423*0.001\u22480.000266 M \n\nFourth complex: \u03b24*[Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^4=16 *0.00423*(0.0001)= negligible. \n\nTotal SCN- consumed: \n\nFor each species, the contribution is n*[Co(SCN)n]^n. \n\nWait, the total SCN- used is sum_{n=1 to4} n*[Co(SCN)n] \n\nSo:\n\nFirst complex (n=1) contributes 1 * [Co(SCN)]^+ = ~0.003807 M \n\nSecond complex (n=2) contributes 2 * 0.00169 \u2248 0.00338 \n\nThird complex (n=3) contributes 3 *0.000266 \u22480.0008 \n\nFourth: negligible. \n\nTotal consumed SCN- is ~0.003807 +0.00338 +0.0008 \u2248 ~0.008 M. \n\nThe initial SCN- is 0.1 M, so remaining SCN- is 0.1 -0.008 \u22480.092 M. \n\nThus, the assumption that [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 is reasonable because only ~0.008 M is consumed. So the approximation holds. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is valid, and the correct answer is D) 16.9%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for different complexes. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that stability constants (\u03b2) are related to the formation constants of the complexes. The stability constants here are given as \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u03b24. Since Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- up to four, like [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)2]^-, [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and [Co(SCN)4]^3-, right? Wait, but the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)2]^+? Or maybe the dithiocyanato refers to two SCN- ligands. Let me confirm: the dithiocyanato would be two, so that's the second complex, so \u03b22 is for the second one. The problem states the percentage of this among all cobalt species. \n\nThe given concentrations are total Co = 1e-2 M and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, the stability constants for higher complexes are decreasing here? Like \u03b23 is higher than \u03b22? Wait, \u03b23 is 63 which is higher than \u03b22's 40? Wait, but \u03b24 is 16. That seems odd because usually, the stability constants might not necessarily increase with more ligands, but maybe in this case, the trend is different. \n\nSo, the approach here is to calculate the distribution of all the cobalt species, then find the fraction that is the [Co(SCN)2]^+ complex. \n\nFirst, let's note the possible species. The cobalt can exist as Co^2+ (the free ion), [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0 (since each SCN- adds a negative charge?), wait, actually the charges need to be considered. Let me think:\n\nCo(II) is Co^2+. Each SCN- is -1. So, when forming a complex with n SCN- ions, the charge would be 2+ minus n*( -1?), wait no. Each SCN- is a ligand that donates a pair of electrons. The charge of the complex would be (charge of Co) plus the charges from the ligands. Since SCN- is a monodentate ligand with charge -1, each SCN- adds a -1 charge. So:\n\nThe species are:\n\nCo^2+ (no ligands)\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ -1 = +1? Wait, no: Co^2+ has charge +2. Adding one SCN- (charge -1) would give a complex with charge +2 -1 = +1? Wait, actually, when the ligand is a negative ion, the overall charge is the sum. So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have charge (2+) + (-1) = +1? So each SCN- adds -1. So:\n\nSpecies:\n\nCo^2+ \u2192 charge +2\n\n[Co(SCN)]^+ \u2192 +1\n\n[Co(SCN)2]^0 \u2192 neutral (charge 0)\n\n[Co(SCN)3]^\u2212 \u2192 -1\n\n[Co(SCN)4]^2\u2212 \u2192 -2\n\nWait, so the dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)2]^0, which is neutral. The question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\" \u2014 I think the blue color is associated with this species. \n\nNow, the stability constants \u03b2n are for the formation of n SCN- ligands. The \u03b2 values given are \u03b21=9 (for n=1), \u03b22=40 (n=2), \u03b23=63 (n=3), \u03b24=16 (n=4). Wait, so \u03b24 is lower than \u03b23. Interesting. \n\nThe formula for the concentration of each complex is based on the stability constants. The general approach is to use the equilibrium expressions and the total concentration of Co. \n\nThe total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^\u2212 + [Co(SCN)4]^2\u2212 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nThe SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M, but since SCN- is a ligand, its concentration will be affected by the complexes formed. Wait, but the problem might be assuming that the SCN- concentration is approximately constant because it's in excess? Let me see. The initial SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 10 mM, and the Co is 0.01 M (10 mM). Wait, actually, the total Co is 0.01 M, which is 10 mM, and SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 100 mM. Since the SCN- concentration is higher than the Co, it's possible that SCN- is in excess, so its concentration doesn't change much. But I need to check if that's a valid assumption here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed using the stability constants and the formula for the distribution of species. \n\nThe formula for each species is:\n\nFor n ligands, the concentration is [Co^(2+)] * ( [SCN-]^n * \u03b2n ) divided by the sum over all terms (sum_{k=0 to 4} \u03b2k [SCN-]^k )\n\nWait, actually, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:\n\nThe fraction of the nth complex is ( \u03b2n [SCN-]^n ) / ( 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4 )\n\nWait, let me think again. The total concentration of Co is given by:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] + \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-] + \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^4 = c(Co)\n\nLet me denote [Co\u00b2+] as x. Then the equation becomes:\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ) = c(Co)\n\nTherefore, x = c(Co) / (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nThen, the concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)2]^0 = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nSo the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:\n\n( \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) / ( 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 )\n\nBecause the [Co\u00b2+] cancels out when taking the ratio. \n\nTherefore, the percentage is ( \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) divided by the denominator multiplied by 100. \n\nGiven that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, but since we are looking for the fraction among all species, the actual concentration of Co doesn't affect the fraction (since it's a ratio). \n\nWait, that's correct. The fraction depends only on the \u03b2 and [SCN-]. \n\nSo let's plug in the numbers. \n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nThe [SCN-] is 0.1 M. \n\nCompute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm0 = 1 \n\nTerm1 = \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \n\nTerm2 = \u03b22 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 \n\nTerm3 = \u03b23 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063 \n\nTerm4 = \u03b24 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016 \n\nAdding all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9 \n\n1.9 +0.4 = 2.3 \n\n2.3 +0.063 = 2.363 \n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 \n\nSo denominator is 2.3646 \n\nThe numerator for the dithiocyanato (n=2) is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4 \n\nTherefore, the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me see:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 0.4? Let me check:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169: \n\n2 \u00d7 0.169 is 0.338, 0.3646 \u00d7 0.169 \u2248 0.0615, total \u2248 0.4, so maybe 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169? Wait, but 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which would be 16.9%. \n\nWait, but the options include D)16.9%. But wait the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but according to this calculation, that's 0.4 divided by ~2.3646 gives approx 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D. But let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait the numerator is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2, which is 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4. The denominator is the sum of all terms, which is 2.3646. \n\n0.4 / 2.3646 = let me compute it more accurately:\n\n2.3646 \u00d7 0.169 = ?\n\n0.169 * 2 = 0.338\n\n0.169 * 0.3646 \u2248 0.169 * 0.3 = 0.0507, plus 0.169 * 0.0646 \u2248 ~0.0109, so total \u2248 0.0507 +0.0109 = 0.0616, so total is 0.338 +0.0616= 0.4, so yes, 0.169 gives exactly 0.4. So the fraction is 0.169, so 16.9%, which would be option D. \n\nBut wait, the options have A)42.3, B)25.6, C)38.1, D)16.9. Hmm. But I need to check if I considered the correct complex. Wait, the dithiocyanato is the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0. \n\nWait, but wait another thought: the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. But in the formula, we assumed that the denominator is the sum of the terms, and the [Co^2+] is c(Co) divided by that sum. So the calculation for the fraction is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the \u03b2 values? Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe stability constants given are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nYes. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm, so according to this, the answer is D)16.9%. But wait, the options include 42.3%, which is higher than the n=1 term. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the term for n=1 is \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 *0.1 =0.9. The term for n=2 is 0.4. Wait, but the denominator's largest term is actually the first term (term1=0.9?), no. Wait:\n\nWait the terms:\n\nTerm0 =1, term1=0.9, term2=0.4, term3=0.063, term4=0.0016. The sum is 2.3646. The largest term is term0 (1) and term1 (0.9) are the largest. Wait, so the largest term is term1 (0.9) and term0 (1) so the first two terms are the largest. So the dominant species would be the free Co^2+ (term0) and the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ (term1). \n\nWait, so the fraction for n=0 (free Co^2+) is 1/(2.3646) \u2248 0.423, so 42.3%. So the free Co is the most abundant, then the first complex. The second complex (n=2) is 0.4/2.3646 \u2248 16.9%, but that's D. \n\nWait but why is the answer not 42.3%? The question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex. \n\nHmm, so according to my calculation, it's 16.9%, which is option D. But maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me rederive the fraction. \n\nThe formula for the concentration of the nth species is:\n\n[Co(SCN)n] = \u03b2n [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^n \n\nThe total concentration of Co is:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] (1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + ... + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4) = c(Co) \n\nTherefore, [Co\u00b2+] = c(Co) / denominator. \n\nThus, the concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^0 is \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 (c(Co)/denominator) [SCN-]^2 \n\nThe total concentration of all species is c(Co). \n\nTherefore, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) \n\nWait, because [Co(SCN)2]^0 = \u03b22 [Co\u00b2+] [SCN-]^2 \n\nDivide by total Co (c(Co)), you get [Co(SCN)2]^0 / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) \n\nYes, so the fraction is indeed \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 divided by the denominator. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the calculation is correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option D. \n\nWait, but the problem states the blue dithiocyanato complex. Maybe I made a mistake in the charge? Let me confirm the dithiocyanato complex's charge. \n\nWait, Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So adding two SCN- gives +2 -2*(1) = 0. So the charge is 0, so the species is [Co(SCN)2]^0. \n\nIs there another possible complex that's blue? For example, sometimes different complexes have different colors. Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanate complex is actually a different one? Wait, maybe the problem refers to the tetraammine or something else? No, the question specifies \"dithiocyanato\", which would be two SCN- ligands. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the stability constants. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe stability constants are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. \n\nYes. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but the answer options have 42.3% as option A. That's the fraction of free Co^2+, which is term0 (1) divided by denominator (2.3646), so 1/2.3646 \u22480.423, so 42.3%, which is option A. But that's the free ion, not the complex. \n\nSo the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complex (n=2), so the answer is D) 16.9%. \n\nWait, but why is the \u03b23 so high? \u03b23=63. Let's see the term for n=3 is 63*(0.1)^3= 63*0.001=0.063. So that term is smaller than term2's 0.4. \n\nWait, so the third complex (n=3) contributes 0.063 to the denominator, so its fraction is 0.063/2.3646\u2248 ~2.66%. \n\nThe fourth complex (n=4) is 0.0016, so negligible. \n\nSo the distribution is:\n\nFree Co: ~42.3%\n\nFirst complex (n=1): 0.9/2.3646 \u2248 0.380 \u2192 38.0% \n\nSecond complex (n=2): ~16.9%\n\nThird: ~2.66%\n\nFourth: ~0.068%\n\nWait, adding all those up: 42.3 +38.0 is 80.3, plus 16.9 is 97.2, plus 2.66 is ~99.86, and the last is 0.068 gives ~99.93. Close enough considering rounding. \n\nSo the blue complex (n=2) is indeed ~16.9%, which is option D. \n\nHmm. Then the answer must be D. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is asking for the dithiocyanato complex as the third one? Like maybe I miscounted the ligands? Let me check. \n\nWait, \"dithiocyanato\" means di- (two) thiocyanato ligands, so yes, two SCN- ligands. So n=2. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of stability constants. Sometimes, stability constants are given as log values, but here they are given as \u03b2 values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses \u03b2 values for the formation of each successive ligand instead of cumulative. Wait, no, the standard \u03b2 is the cumulative stability constant. For example, \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN]^2). So my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the units. The concentrations are given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M and SCN- is 0.1 M. Let me check if the assumption that [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 is valid. \n\nThe total SCN- consumed would be the sum over n (n*[Co(SCN)n]). \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nThe concentration of each species is:\n\n[Co\u00b2+] = c(Co)/denominator \u2248 1e-2 / 2.3646 \u2248 ~0.00423 M \n\nFirst complex (n=1): \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN]^2? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ has concentration \u03b21 [Co\u00b2+][SCN-]. \n\nSo [Co(SCN)]^+ = \u03b21 * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.00423 * 0.1 \u2248 0.003807 M \n\nSimilarly, the second complex: \u03b22 * [Co\u00b2+] * [SCN-]^2 =40 *0.00423*(0.1)^2 =40*0.00423*0.01= 40*0.0000423= ~0.00169 M \n\nThird complex: \u03b23*[Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^3=63 *0.00423*(0.1)^3=63*0.00423*0.001\u22480.000266 M \n\nFourth complex: \u03b24*[Co\u00b2+][SCN-]^4=16 *0.00423*(0.0001)= negligible. \n\nTotal SCN- consumed: \n\nFor each species, the contribution is n*[Co(SCN)n]^n. \n\nWait, the total SCN- used is sum_{n=1 to4} n*[Co(SCN)n] \n\nSo:\n\nFirst complex (n=1) contributes 1 * [Co(SCN)]^+ = ~0.003807 M \n\nSecond complex (n=2) contributes 2 * 0.00169 \u2248 0.00338 \n\nThird complex (n=3) contributes 3 *0.000266 \u22480.0008 \n\nFourth: negligible. \n\nTotal consumed SCN- is ~0.003807 +0.00338 +0.0008 \u2248 ~0.008 M. \n\nThe initial SCN- is 0.1 M, so remaining SCN- is 0.1 -0.008 \u22480.092 M. \n\nThus, the assumption that [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 is reasonable because only ~0.008 M is consumed. So the approximation holds. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is valid, and the correct answer is D) 16.9%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)\u2082]\u2070) among all cobalt species. The stability constants (\u03b2\u2081=9, \u03b2\u2082=40, \u03b2\u2083=63, \u03b2\u2084=16) and concentrations ([Co\u00b2\u207a]=1\u00d710\u207b\u00b2 M, [SCN\u207b]=0.1 M) are given. \n\nThe fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of } [Co(SCN)_n] = \\frac{\\beta_n [SCN^-]^n}{\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\beta_k [SCN^-]^k}\n\\]\nwhere the denominator is the sum of terms \\(1 + \\beta_1 [SCN^-] + \\beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [SCN^-]^4\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- Term\u2080 = 1\n- Term\u2081 = \u03b2\u2081[SCN\u207b] = 9 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.9\n- Term\u2082 = \u03b2\u2082[SCN\u207b]\u00b2 = 40 \u00d7 (0.1)\u00b2 = 0.4\n- Term\u2083 = \u03b2\u2083[SCN\u207b]\u00b3 = 63 \u00d7 (0.1)\u00b3 = 0.063\n- Term\u2084 = \u03b2\u2084[SCN\u207b]\u2074 = 16 \u00d7 (0.1)\u2074 = 0.0016\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator: \\(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \u2248 2.3646\\).\n\nThe numerator for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is \u03b2\u2082[SCN\u207b]\u00b2 = 0.4. Thus, the fraction is:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \u2248 0.169 \\text{ (or 16.9\\%)}.\n\\]\n\nThe free Co\u00b2\u207a (term\u2080) contributes ~42.3%, but the question specifically asks for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2). The correct answer is **D) 16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate ions, along with the stability constants for the different complexes. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the stability constants (\u03b2) are given for the formation of complexes. The problem mentions Co(II) ions reacting with thiocyanate (SCN-) to form complexes. The stability constants \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b24 probably correspond to the formation of [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4] complexes, respectively. Each \u03b2 value is the equilibrium constant for adding one more SCN- ion to the complex. \n\nThe question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex, which would be the one with two SCN- ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)2]^n+ complex. Wait, but the charge? Since Co(II) is +2, each SCN- is -1. So for the dithiocyanato complex, that would be [Co(SCN)2]^0? Hmm, but maybe the overall charge isn't important here, just the number of ligands. The color is probably due to the d-electron configuration, so the complex with two SCN- is blue. The problem wants the percentage of this species among all Co-containing species.\n\nThe given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Wait, the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M. So all forms of Co (free ion plus complexes) add up to 1e-2 M. Similarly, the total SCN- is 0.1 M, but some of it is tied up in complexes. \n\nTo find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2], I need to calculate the fraction of Co in that form relative to all species. The approach here would be to use the stability constants and set up the equations for the distribution of the complexes.\n\nStability constants (\u03b2) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because typically, \u03b2 values increase with more ligands, but here \u03b24 is smaller than \u03b23. Hmm, maybe I need to check that. Wait, perhaps \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. So \u03b21 is [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN-], \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN-]^2), but actually, the stability constants for complexes are the cumulative constants. Wait, actually, there's a confusion here between stepwise and cumulative stability constants. Let me recall: the cumulative stability constant \u03b2n is the product of the stepwise constants. For example, \u03b22 = K1*K2, where K1 is the first step (adding first SCN-), K2 the second step. But here, the problem states the stability constants \u03b21 to \u03b24 are given for each complex. So \u03b21 is for the first complex (monothiocyanato), \u03b22 for the second (dithiocyanato), etc. So the \u03b2 values are cumulative.\n\nTherefore, the formula for each complex's concentration would be:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 * [Co][SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co][SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 * [Co][SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 * [Co][SCN-]^4\n\nWait, but actually, the general form for the cumulative \u03b2n is [Co(SCN)n]/([Co][SCN-]^n) = \u03b2n. So rearranged, the concentration of the nth complex is \u03b2n * [Co][SCN-]^n. But [Co] here would be the free cobalt ion concentration, which is part of the unknowns. So we need to set up equations considering all species.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate concentration is:\n\n[SCN-] + [Co(SCN)] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] +4[Co(SCN)4] = 0.1 M.\n\nBut solving this system might be complicated. Since the problem gives \u03b2 values, perhaps we can assume that the free [Co] is negligible compared to the complexes? Or maybe not, but we need to calculate properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distribution of complexes. The distribution coefficient (or fraction) for each complex can be calculated using the \u03b2 values and the concentration of SCN-.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt (C_total) is the sum of all species. Let\u2019s denote [Co] as x. Then the concentrations of the complexes are:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN-]^4\n\nTherefore, the total cobalt is:\n\nx + \u03b21 x [SCN-] + \u03b22 x [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN-]^4 = C_total\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ] = C_total\n\nSo solving for x (free Co):\n\nx = C_total / [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ]\n\nOnce we have x, we can compute each complex's concentration. The fraction of [Co(SCN)2] would be [Co(SCN)2]/C_total = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2) / C_total.\n\nAlternatively, since x = C_total / denominator, substituting that gives:\n\nfraction = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * [SCN-]^2 ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate. Let me write the fraction of [Co(SCN)2] as:\n\nfrac_2 = [Co(SCN)2] / C_total = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2 ) / C_total \n\nBut x = C_total / denominator, so substituting:\n\nfrac_2 = (\u03b22 * (C_total / denominator) * [SCN-]^2 ) / C_total \n\nThe C_total cancels:\n\nfrac_2 = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 ) / denominator \n\nWhere denominator = 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 \n\nSo the fraction is \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 divided by that denominator.\n\nGiven the numbers:\n\n\u03b21 = 9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16\n\n[SCN-] = 0.1 M\n\nLet me compute each term in the denominator:\n\nTerm1: 1\n\nTerm2: \u03b21 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nTerm3: \u03b22 * [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4\n\nTerm4: \u03b23*[SCN-]^3 =63*(0.001)=0.063\n\nTerm5: \u03b24*[SCN-]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016\n\nAdding all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016\u22482.3646.\n\nSo denominator \u22482.3646.\n\nThe numerator for [Co(SCN)2] is \u03b22 * [SCN-]^2 =40*(0.01)=0.4.\n\nThus, frac_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691.\n\nWait, 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so that's about 16.9%.\n\nBut the options have D) 16.9%, but there is also A) 42.3% and C) 38.1%. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculation?\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait the denominator:\n\nLet me recalculate each term step by step:\n\nTerm1 =1\n\nTerm2 = \u03b21 * [SCN-] =9 *0.1 =0.9 \u2192 total so far 1.9\n\nTerm3 = \u03b22*(SCN)^2 =40*(0.1)^2 =40*0.01=0.4 \u2192 total 1.9+0.4=2.3\n\nTerm4 = \u03b23*(SCN)^3 =63*(0.1)^3 =63*0.001=0.063 \u2192 total 2.363\n\nTerm5 = \u03b24*(SCN)^4 =16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 \u2192 total 2.3646.\n\nSo that's correct. The denominator is 2.3646.\n\nNumerator for the second complex (\u03b22 term) is 0.4.\n\n0.4 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.1691, so 16.91%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but the question says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\", which is the [Co(SCN)2]. So according to this calculation, that's ~16.9%, which is option D. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the \u03b2 terms. Let me check if the \u03b2 values are for the different complexes correctly.\n\nWait the problem states: stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16. So \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 SCN-), \u03b22 for the second (2 SCN-), etc. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. Then why is the answer not matching one of the options? Wait the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. So D is 16.9% which matches my calculation. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the \u03b23 and \u03b24 terms? Let me check the given \u03b2 values again.\n\nWait the problem states \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b23 is 63, which is higher than \u03b22. So when calculating term4 (for the third complex, with 3 SCN-), that term is 63*(0.001)=0.063. That's correct. Term5 for 4 SCN- is 16*(0.0001)=0.0016, so correct.\n\nHmm, so the calculation seems right. So the answer is D?\n\nWait, but maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The formula for the fraction of [Co(SCN)n] is (\u03b2n * [SCN-]^n) divided by the sum over all terms (including the 1 for free Co).\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. So the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2) / denominator.\n\nHmm, so then why is the answer option D? The options do have D as 16.9%, so that's correct. But let me check if the problem is perhaps considering the \u03b24 as lower, which might affect the denominator. Wait, the denominator is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 \u2248 2.3646. So yes, so the fraction is 0.4/2.3646\u22480.169. So 16.9% is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". The blue complex is [Co(SCN)2], so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the fourth complex having a lower \u03b2, so perhaps the third complex is more dominant. Let me see the terms:\n\nThe terms in the denominator:\n\nTerm1:1\n\nTerm2:0.9 (from \u03b21 and SCN)\n\nTerm3:0.4 (from \u03b22 and SCN squared)\n\nTerm4:0.063 (from \u03b23 and SCN cubed)\n\nTerm5:0.0016 (from \u03b24 and SCN^4)\n\nSo the largest term after the first is term2 (0.9), then term3 (0.4), then term4 (0.063), etc. So the first complex (monothiocyanato) has a term of 0.9, so its fraction would be 0.9/(2.3646)= ~0.38, which is about 38%, which would be option C. Wait, but that's for the first complex. The second complex (dithiocyanato) is 0.4, so 16.9%, which is D. The third complex (trithiocyanato) is 0.063, so ~2.66%, and the fourth is negligible. The free cobalt is 1/2.3646 \u22480.423, so about 42.3%, which is option A. Wait a minute! Wait, the free cobalt is the first term (1) divided by denominator. So its fraction is 1/2.3646\u22480.423, so 42.3%. That would be the fraction of free Co^2+ ions, which is option A. \n\nBut the question is asking for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (the second one), which is 0.4/2.3646\u224816.9%, which is D. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". So the answer should be D. But why is the free Co fraction 42%? That's the largest term. Hmm, but that's possible. For instance, if the stability constants aren't that high, then the free ion could be the major species. Let me check the given \u03b2 values again. The \u03b21 is 9, which is [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN-] =9. So, if [SCN-] is 0.1 M, then the concentration of the first complex would be 9*[Co]*0.1. \n\nBut the total concentration of Co is 0.01 M. Let's see, if [Co] is x, then:\n\nx + 9x*0.1 +40x*(0.01) +63x*(0.001)+16x*(0.0001) = 0.01\n\nWhich is x*(1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) =0.01 \u2192 x=0.01 /2.3646\u22480.00423 M. \n\nSo free Co is 0.00423 M, which is about 4.23 mM. The total is 10 mM. So the fraction of free Co is 0.00423/0.01 = ~0.423 \u2192 42.3% (option A). \n\nThe first complex's concentration is 9 * x *0.1 =9*(0.00423)*0.1 = 0.003807 M, so its fraction is 0.003807/0.01 = ~38.1%, which is option C. \n\nThe second complex [Co(SCN)2] is 40 *x*(0.1)^2=40*(0.00423)*0.01= 0.001692 M \u2192 1.692/10 \u2192 16.9%, so that's D. \n\nSo the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D) 16.9%. So I think that's right. Maybe I was confused earlier thinking the free ion was part of the answer but the question specifically asks for the dithiocyanato complex. So the calculation is correct.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate ions, along with the stability constants for the different complexes. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the stability constants (\u03b2) are given for the formation of complexes. The problem mentions Co(II) ions reacting with thiocyanate (SCN-) to form complexes. The stability constants \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b24 probably correspond to the formation of [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3], and [Co(SCN)4] complexes, respectively. Each \u03b2 value is the equilibrium constant for adding one more SCN- ion to the complex. \n\nThe question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complex, which would be the one with two SCN- ligands, so that's the [Co(SCN)2]^n+ complex. Wait, but the charge? Since Co(II) is +2, each SCN- is -1. So for the dithiocyanato complex, that would be [Co(SCN)2]^0? Hmm, but maybe the overall charge isn't important here, just the number of ligands. The color is probably due to the d-electron configuration, so the complex with two SCN- is blue. The problem wants the percentage of this species among all Co-containing species.\n\nThe given concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. Wait, the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M. So all forms of Co (free ion plus complexes) add up to 1e-2 M. Similarly, the total SCN- is 0.1 M, but some of it is tied up in complexes. \n\nTo find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2], I need to calculate the fraction of Co in that form relative to all species. The approach here would be to use the stability constants and set up the equations for the distribution of the complexes.\n\nStability constants (\u03b2) are given as \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because typically, \u03b2 values increase with more ligands, but here \u03b24 is smaller than \u03b23. Hmm, maybe I need to check that. Wait, perhaps \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 for the second, etc. So \u03b21 is [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN-], \u03b22 is [Co(SCN)2]/([Co][SCN-]^2), but actually, the stability constants for complexes are the cumulative constants. Wait, actually, there's a confusion here between stepwise and cumulative stability constants. Let me recall: the cumulative stability constant \u03b2n is the product of the stepwise constants. For example, \u03b22 = K1*K2, where K1 is the first step (adding first SCN-), K2 the second step. But here, the problem states the stability constants \u03b21 to \u03b24 are given for each complex. So \u03b21 is for the first complex (monothiocyanato), \u03b22 for the second (dithiocyanato), etc. So the \u03b2 values are cumulative.\n\nTherefore, the formula for each complex's concentration would be:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 * [Co][SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co][SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 * [Co][SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 * [Co][SCN-]^4\n\nWait, but actually, the general form for the cumulative \u03b2n is [Co(SCN)n]/([Co][SCN-]^n) = \u03b2n. So rearranged, the concentration of the nth complex is \u03b2n * [Co][SCN-]^n. But [Co] here would be the free cobalt ion concentration, which is part of the unknowns. So we need to set up equations considering all species.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:\n\n[Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.\n\nSimilarly, the total thiocyanate concentration is:\n\n[SCN-] + [Co(SCN)] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3] +4[Co(SCN)4] = 0.1 M.\n\nBut solving this system might be complicated. Since the problem gives \u03b2 values, perhaps we can assume that the free [Co] is negligible compared to the complexes? Or maybe not, but we need to calculate properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distribution of complexes. The distribution coefficient (or fraction) for each complex can be calculated using the \u03b2 values and the concentration of SCN-.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt (C_total) is the sum of all species. Let\u2019s denote [Co] as x. Then the concentrations of the complexes are:\n\n[Co(SCN)] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN-]^4\n\nTherefore, the total cobalt is:\n\nx + \u03b21 x [SCN-] + \u03b22 x [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN-]^4 = C_total\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ] = C_total\n\nSo solving for x (free Co):\n\nx = C_total / [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 ]\n\nOnce we have x, we can compute each complex's concentration. The fraction of [Co(SCN)2] would be [Co(SCN)2]/C_total = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2) / C_total.\n\nAlternatively, since x = C_total / denominator, substituting that gives:\n\nfraction = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * [SCN-]^2 ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate.

So when calculating term4 (for the third complex, with 3 SCN-), that term is 63*(0.001)=0.063. That's correct. Term5 for 4 SCN- is 16*(0.0001)=0.0016, so correct.\n\nHmm, so the calculation seems right. So the answer is D?\n\nWait, but maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The formula for the fraction of [Co(SCN)n] is (\u03b2n * [SCN-]^n) divided by the sum over all terms (including the 1 for free Co).\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. So the fraction for n=2 is (\u03b22 [SCN]^2) / denominator.\n\nHmm, so then why is the answer option D? The options do have D as 16.9%, so that's correct. But let me check if the problem is perhaps considering the \u03b24 as lower, which might affect the denominator. Wait, the denominator is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 \u2248 2.3646. So yes, so the fraction is 0.4/2.3646\u22480.169. So 16.9% is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". The blue complex is [Co(SCN)2], so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the fourth complex having a lower \u03b2, so perhaps the third complex is more dominant. Let me see the terms:\n\nThe terms in the denominator:\n\nTerm1:1\n\nTerm2:0.9 (from \u03b21 and SCN)\n\nTerm3:0.4 (from \u03b22 and SCN squared)\n\nTerm4:0.063 (from \u03b23 and SCN cubed)\n\nTerm5:0.0016 (from \u03b24 and SCN^4)\n\nSo the largest term after the first is term2 (0.9), then term3 (0.4), then term4 (0.063), etc. So the first complex (monothiocyanato) has a term of 0.9, so its fraction would be 0.9/(2.3646)= ~0.38, which is about 38%, which would be option C. Wait, but that's for the first complex. The second complex (dithiocyanato) is 0.4, so 16.9%, which is D. The third complex (trithiocyanato) is 0.063, so ~2.66%, and the fourth is negligible. The free cobalt is 1/2.3646 \u22480.423, so about 42.3%, which is option A. Wait a minute! Wait, the free cobalt is the first term (1) divided by denominator. So its fraction is 1/2.3646\u22480.423, so 42.3%. That would be the fraction of free Co^2+ ions, which is option A. \n\nBut the question is asking for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (the second one), which is 0.4/2.3646\u224816.9%, which is D. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". So the answer should be D. But why is the free Co fraction 42%? That's the largest term. Hmm, but that's possible. For instance, if the stability constants aren't that high, then the free ion could be the major species. Let me check the given \u03b2 values again. The \u03b21 is 9, which is [Co(SCN)]/[Co][SCN-] =9. So, if [SCN-] is 0.1 M, then the concentration of the first complex would be 9*[Co]*0.1. \n\nBut the total concentration of Co is 0.01 M. Let's see, if [Co] is x, then:\n\nx + 9x*0.1 +40x*(0.01) +63x*(0.001)+16x*(0.0001) = 0.01\n\nWhich is x*(1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) =0.01 \u2192 x=0.01 /2.3646\u22480.00423 M. \n\nSo free Co is 0.00423 M, which is about 4.23 mM. The total is 10 mM. So the fraction of free Co is 0.00423/0.01 = ~0.423 \u2192 42.3% (option A). \n\nThe first complex's concentration is 9 * x *0.1 =9*(0.00423)*0.1 = 0.003807 M, so its fraction is 0.003807/0.01 = ~38.1%, which is option C. \n\nThe second complex [Co(SCN)2] is 40 *x*(0.1)^2=40*(0.00423)*0.01= 0.001692 M \u2192 1.692/10 \u2192 16.9%, so that's D. \n\nSo the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D) 16.9%. So I think that's right. Maybe I was confused earlier thinking the free ion was part of the answer but the question specifically asks for the dithiocyanato complex. So the calculation is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)\u2082]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (\u03b2\u2081 to \u03b2\u2084) and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration (c(Co)) is 10\u207b\u00b2 M, and [SCN\u207b] is 0.1 M. \n\nThe fraction of each complex is calculated using the cumulative stability constants and the concentration of SCN\u207b. The denominator for these fractions is the sum of terms involving \u03b2 values and [SCN\u207b] concentrations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Term1} &= 1, \\\\\n\\text{Term2} &= 9 \\times 0.1 = 0.9, \\\\\n\\text{Term3} &= 40 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\\\\n\\text{Term4} &= 63 \\times (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\\\\n\\text{Term5} &= 16 \\times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.\n\\]\n\nThe fraction of [Co(SCN)\u2082] is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of } [Co(SCN)_2] = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{40 \\times (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.1691 \\text{ or } 16.9\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.\n\nAnswer: D) 16.9%\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\nAnswer: D",
