      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this genetics question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about figuring out the relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose. The key here is understanding the mutant results and how they indicate the genes' interactions.\n\nFirst, let's recap the data given. The resistance levels for each mutant and double mutant are provided. The wild-type is 100%, so lower percentages mean less resistance. The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. \n\nLooking at the single mutants:\n\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance. That's a reduction but not complete loss.\n- g2 (no G2) has 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant is completely susceptible.\n- g3 (no G3) has 50% resistance. Half the wild-type's resistance.\n\nNow, the double mutants:\n\n- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n- g1g3: 10% (worse than either single mutant)\n- g2g3: 0% (same as g2 and g2g3)\n\nHmm. Let's think about epistasis and redundancy here. Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. If two genes are redundant, their combined knockout might not be worse than either alone, but here g1g3 is worse than g1 (75% vs 10%) and g3 (50%). Wait, that suggests that G1 and G3 might not be redundant. Instead, their combined loss is worse, so maybe they are in parallel pathways but additive?\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that controls both G1 and G3. Let me think through each possibility.\n\nThe fact that g2 alone is 0% suggests that G2 is essential. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of others, then its knockout would prevent expression of other genes. Let's see:\n\nSuppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in reality, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. The g1 mutant (with G2 present) has 75% resistance. So maybe G1's product is still contributing when G2 is present? Wait, but if G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 wouldn't be expressed. But in the g1 mutant (G2 is present), G1 is knocked out. So the g1 mutant's 75% suggests that even without G1, there's still some resistance, perhaps from G3? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. Let's think:\n\n- In wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. So their combined effect gives 100% resistance.\n- In g2, since G2 is missing, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So resistance drops to 0%. That matches the data.\n- In g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed (since G2 is a TF for G3?), so G3's presence gives 50% (since g3 alone is 50%). But in g1, the resistance is 75%. Wait, that's higher than g3. So maybe G1's product also contributes, but when G1 is missing, G3 alone is 50% but when G1 is present (even with G3 present?), maybe they add up. But in g1, G1 is missing but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But then why is g1's resistance 75%? Hmm, maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G1, but not for G3. Let's see:\n\nIf G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 isn't expressed, so G1's contribution is gone. But G3 is still present (if G2 doesn't control it). But then in g2, the resistance would be the same as g3 (since G3 is the only one left?), but g2's resistance is 0% and g3 is 50%. That contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G3, but not G1. Then in g2, G3 isn't expressed, so only G1's contribution remains. But in g1, G1 is missing, so only G3 (if G2 is present) is there. Let's see:\n\nIf G2 controls G3, then:\n\n- Wild type: G2 activates G3, so both G1 and G3 are active. Combined resistance is 100%.\n- g2: G3 isn't expressed (since G2 is missing), so only G1 is present. But the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. Wait, but if G1 is present, then why 0%? Unless G1 alone isn't sufficient. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, but in a way that their combined effect is necessary. Let's think of the double mutants.\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng1g2 has 0% which is same as g2. So the loss of G1 doesn't make it worse than g2. So G1's contribution is already accounted for in g2. That suggests that G1's function is dependent on G2. So if G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed, so losing G1 again (in g1g2) doesn't change anything. That makes sense if G2 is upstream of G1.\n\nSimilarly, g2g3 is 0% same as g2. So losing G3 in addition to G2 doesn't reduce further. So G3's effect is also dependent on G2. So G2 must be upstream of both G1 and G3.\n\nNow, looking at g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out but G2 is present, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance when G2 is present. Because in their double knockout (g1g3), since G2 is present, their absence removes both contributions, leading to very low resistance. \n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance (as in g2).\n\n- The single mutants:\n\n  - g1 has G2 present, so G3 is still expressed. The resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So G1's contribution plus G3's gives 75%? Wait, but if G3 alone is 50%, then adding G1's contribution would take it up to maybe 100%? But in the wild type, it's 100%. Hmm, so maybe G1 and G3 together contribute fully, but when one is missing, the other can't compensate fully. \n\nWait, the wild type has both G1 and G3 active (since G2 is there), so 100%. In g1, G3 is active (since G2 is present), so 50%? But in the data, g1 is 75%. That contradicts. Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nWait, in the g3 mutant (no G3), resistance is 50%. So G1's presence (since G2 is there, so G1 is expressed) gives 50%? Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to think numerically. Let's suppose that the total resistance is the sum of contributions from each gene. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the contribution of G1 as x, G3 as y, and maybe they are additive. Then:\n\nWild type (G1+G2+G3) gives 100% = x + y.\n\nIn g1 (no G1 but G2 present, so G3 is expressed because G2 is the TF for G3?), so resistance is y = 75%? But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. Then, if y=75%, then G3's contribution is 75%? But the g3 mutant (no G3) would have x = 100% - y = 25%. But according to the data, g3 is 50%. That doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps the model is not additive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resistance is multiplicative. Let's see:\n\nSuppose each gene contributes a certain factor. For example, each gene's presence multiplies the resistance by some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both necessary for full resistance, but can partially compensate. For instance, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then losing one reduces resistance, but losing both reduces further.\n\nWait, let's think of the double mutant g1g3. Since G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed normally except they are knocked out here. So without G1 and G3, resistance is 10%. So their combined presence is needed for full resistance, but each alone can provide some. \n\nLooking at g3 (no G3): resistance is 50%, so G1 alone gives 50% (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed). Then g1 (no G1) would have G3's contribution. But in the data, g1 has 75%, so that would mean G3's contribution is 75%. Then the total would be 75% + 50% = 125%? But wild type is 100%, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes have overlapping functions. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince g2 is 0% and all double mutants with g2 are also 0%, that suggests that G2 is essential. Without G2, resistance is gone. So G2's product is necessary for any resistance. But when G2 is present, other genes can add to resistance.\n\nLooking at the g1g3 mutant: since G2 is present (because it's only knocking out G1 and G3), but they have 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, but G2 is present, the plant still has some minimal resistance (10%). That suggests that G2 might have some resistance on its own, or maybe there's another gene involved? But the problem states that the three genes are the candidates. Wait, maybe G2's product alone isn't sufficient, but when combined with others, but when those are missing, there's a tiny bit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is present, it turns on G1 and G3. If G2 is missing, neither is expressed, so resistance is 0%.\n\nIn the g1 mutant (only missing G1), G3 is still on (since G2 is present), so resistance is 75% (which is lower than wild-type 100%, so G3 alone gives 75%?), but then in the g3 mutant (missing G3), G1 is still on, so G1 alone gives 50% resistance. So the total would be G1 (50%) plus G3 (75%) gives more than 100%? That's impossible, so maybe they are not additive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both G1 and G3 is needed for full resistance. So if either is missing, you lose some. Let's see:\n\nIf wild type has both G1 and G3 (since G2 is present), giving 100%. \n\ng1 (no G1) has only G3, which gives 75% (so G3 alone is 75%). \n\ng3 (no G3) has only G1, which gives 50% (so G1 alone is 50%). \n\nThen, if both are missing (g1g3), you have neither, so maybe that would be 0%, but in the data it's 10%. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait the g1g3 has 10%, so maybe there's a base level even without those genes, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's another pathway, but the question says these are the three candidates. Maybe the 10% is due to some residual effect, but the problem states \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of other(s)\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes are arranged in a pathway where G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are in parallel branches. Let me try to model this:\n\nSuppose G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. Each of these genes then contribute to resistance. So:\n\n- Wild type: G2 \u2192 activates G1 and G3 \u2192 full resistance (100%).\n- g2: no G2 \u2192 no G1 or G3 \u2192 0%.\n- g1: G2 is present \u2192 G3 is active. So resistance from G3 only. The data says 75% here. So G3 alone gives 75%.\n- g3: G2 present \u2192 G1 is active. G1 alone gives 50% (as per data).\n- g1g3: both G1 and G3 knocked out, so even with G2 present, since they are knocked out, no contribution. But the data shows 10%, which contradicts. Hmm, so that model doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in g1g3, the genes G1 and G3 are knocked out. Even though G2 is present, which would normally activate them, they can't be expressed because they're knocked out. So their absence would mean no contribution. But the data says 10%, which is better than 0. That suggests that maybe there's another pathway or that G2 itself has some effect. But according to the problem statement, the three genes are the candidates, so maybe there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's product has some direct effect on resistance, beyond just activating G1 and G3. For instance, G2 might produce a protein that's part of the resistance mechanism, and G1 and G3 are modifiers. But the question states that at least one gene (probably G2) is a transcription factor upstream of others. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is in the epistasis. Let's think about epistatic relationships. Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, then the presence of a non-functional G2 would make the effects of G1 and G3 irrelevant. That fits with the g2 mutant having 0% regardless of other genes (since in all double mutants with g2, the resistance is 0%).\n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nWait, redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. If they are redundant, then knocking out one would have less effect, but the data shows that g1 has 75% and g3 50%, so maybe they aren't fully redundant. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy refers to a gene affecting multiple traits, which might not be relevant here. Epistatic relationships between G1 and G3 would mean that one masks the other. \n\nWait, let's think of epistasis in the double mutant. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be masked when G1 is present. But in the g1g3 mutant, both are knocked out. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways and their combined loss reduces resistance further. So they are not redundant but additive. So redundancy would mean that their loss together doesn't reduce more than either alone, which isn't the case here.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant. But since their combined loss gives lower resistance than either alone, they can't be redundant. So D is out.\n\nOption C says they show pleiotropy. Not sure about that. \n\nOption B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure. \n\nOption A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is likely the TF.\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\n- g2 is 0%, which is worse than any other mutant except g1g2 and g2g3 (which are also 0). So G2's function is critical. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 is knocked out but G3 is active (since G2 is the TF for it). The resistance is 75%, so G3's contribution alone is 75%. \n\nIn the g3 mutant, G1 is active (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed?), and G3 is knocked out. The resistance is 50%, so G1 alone gives 50%.\n\nTherefore, the total in wild type is 100%, which is G1 (50%) + G3 (75%)? But that would be over 100. Hmm, maybe they are not additive but multiplicative. Let's see:\n\nIf the combined effect is multiplicative: 0.5 (G1) * 0.75 (G3) = 0.375, but that's 37.5% which doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each gene contributes a certain percentage. Let's say wild type is 100% (both active). \n\ng1 (no G1) has G3 only \u2192 75% \u2192 so G3 alone is 75%.\n\ng3 (no G3) has G1 only \u2192 50% \u2192 G1 alone is 50%.\n\nSo combined, they add up to 75+50=125, but the wild type is 100. That suggests they are not simply additive but maybe one is a potentiator of the other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of G1 is necessary to activate G3's function. For instance, G3's product requires G1's product to be effective. So without G1, even if G3 is present (as in g1 mutant), its contribution is reduced. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G3 is present (since G2 is active) but the resistance is 75%. That contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. But this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the double mutant g1g3. Here, G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is 10%, which is better than 0%. That suggests that maybe G2 has some function even without G1 and G3. But the problem says G2 is a transcription factor upstream, so maybe it's supposed to activate others, but if those are knocked out, then G2's own product might contribute a little. But the question states the three genes are the candidates, so maybe G2's own product is part of the resistance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's product is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3, but also has its own role. For example, G2's protein might have two functions: activating genes and being part of the resistance mechanism. \n\nBut the question states that the experiment is to find genes contributing to resistance, so maybe the three genes are all part of the resistance pathway. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2 (g2), both are off, so no resistance. \n\nIn the g1g3 mutant, even with G2 present, since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, there's no resistance except maybe a tiny bit (10%), which might be from other genes not considered here, but the problem states these are the candidates. So perhaps the 10% is an experimental error, but we have to work with the data given.\n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption C says \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy means one gene affecting multiple traits, but here maybe it's a red herring. Epistatic means G1's effect is epistatic over G3. So in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. But in the g1 mutant (no G1), G3 is present and gives 75%, which is higher than G1's 50% alone. So if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect is not seen. But in wild type, both are present and you get 100%. Maybe that would mean that G1's presence allows G3 to function, so they are synergistic, not epistatic. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's contribution is lost. But in the g1 mutant, G3 is present but the resistance is 75% (which is G3's contribution alone?), so that contradicts. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of epistasis as the interaction where the double mutant has a phenotype like one of the single mutants. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g1. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than both. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then the double mutant would look like g3. But here, g1g3 is worse than g3 (10% vs 50%). So that's not either. \n\nSo maybe the epistatic relationship isn't between G1 and G3, but between G2 and them. Since G2 is a TF upstream, it's epistatic to both. So G2's effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says \"G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\". But the data shows G2's knockout is worse, so it's more likely G2 is the TF. \n\nOption B: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". Not sure about the same promoter part, but epistatic direction might be wrong.\n\nOption D: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But redundancy would mean that their combined loss doesn't reduce further than either, which isn't the case here (g1g3 is worse). So D is out.\n\nOption C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Pleiotropy might not be the case, but the key part is the epistasis between G1 and G3. Since their combined loss gives a lower resistance, maybe they are in parallel pathways and their effects are additive, so there's no epistasis between them. \n\nWait, but the question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". So G2 is upstream of others. The other genes (G1 and G3) might not have an upstream relationship between them. So the epistasis could be between G2 and the others, but the options don't mention that. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is D? Wait, but redundancy is not supported. Let me recheck:\n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, so G2 can't activate them. But if G1 and G3 were redundant, then losing both would be the same as losing one. But here, it's worse than either single mutant. So they are not redundant. So D is incorrect. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct answer is B? Let me see option B again: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure, but the epistasis part says G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in the absence of G3 (g3), the effect of G1 is not seen. But in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, which is G1's contribution. So that contradicts. \n\nWait, maybe the epistasis is in another way. Let me think of the options again. \n\nOption C says G1 is epistatic to G3. So when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But in the wild type, both are present and resistance is 100%, which would be G1's effect. But in g3 mutant (no G3), G1's effect is 50%, so that's lower than wild type. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the epistatic relationship where the double mutant has a phenotype like one of the single mutants. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant would look like g1. But here, g1g3 is worse than g1 (75% vs 10%). So not that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no epistasis between G1 and G3, but the question requires choosing between the options given. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option D is incorrect, so maybe the correct answer is C or B. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the data for g1g3: 10% which is worse than both. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in a pathway where their combined loss is worse than either alone, implying they are in parallel pathways. So their functions are additive. \n\nThe question states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream. Since G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, their knockout would lead to lower resistance but not 0% unless G2 is also missing. \n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D says \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". But since their combined loss gives lower than either, they aren't redundant. So D is out. \n\nOption C: \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Pleiotropy is not about redundancy. If they are pleiotropic, maybe they have multiple effects, but how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D but the redundancy is not complete. Not sure. \n\nWait, the question says \"gene redundancy\" could mean that they can partially substitute for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. That might not fit redundancy. Redundancy usually means that if one is missing, the other can take over, so their combined loss is worse. Wait, actually, redundancy does mean that both are needed for full function, so losing one doesn't reduce as much as losing both. For example, if they are redundant, the single mutants have reduced resistance but the double has much less. That's exactly what's happening here: g1g3 has 10% (worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%)). So that would be gene redundancy. \n\nAh, maybe I was thinking of \"redundant\" as being completely overlapping, but redundancy can mean that they contribute additively. So if they are in parallel pathways, their combined loss is worse than either alone. So that is redundancy. So option D says \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But the epistasis part might not be necessary here. \n\nWait, but the question requires choosing the correct conclusion from the options. Let me see option D again:\n\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nThe epistasis part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3's contribution is lost. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which would be G3's contribution alone. So that contradicts. \n\nHmm. So maybe the epistasis part is incorrect. \n\nLooking at option B: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". \n\nSame promoter might mean they are coregulated, but the epistasis here would mean that when G3 is knocked out, G1's effect is not seen. But in the g3 mutant, G1 is still present and gives 50% resistance. So that contradicts. \n\nOption C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy isn't relevant here. The epistasis part again has the same issue as before. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is D, accepting that the redundancy part is correct, and the epistasis part might be a distractor. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding epistasis here. \n\nWait, another angle: The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. G2 is the TF. The other genes (G1 and G3) are downstream. \n\nIn the g1g3 mutant, since both are knocked out, their absence removes both pathways. Since G2 is present, it can't activate them, so their absence leads to lower resistance. \n\nThe fact that G1 and G3 are both needed for full resistance (their combined loss gives much lower resistance than either alone) suggests they are redundant or in parallel. So redundancy is correct. \n\nNow, the options for D say \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But epistasis would mean that the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So when G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the wild type, they are both present and you get 100%, so that wouldn't be the case. So epistasis between them is probably not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is D, and the epistasis part is a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and another gene. But the options don't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is C? Or maybe none of the options are perfect, but the best is D because of the redundancy part. \n\nAlternatively, let me think again. The problem says that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream. G2 is the TF. The other two are downstream. \n\nSo G2's knockout leads to 0%, because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. \n\nIn g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. The resistance is 75% (so G3 alone gives 75%). \n\nIn g3, G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, giving 50%. \n\nThus, the total in wild type is 100%, so the two genes (G1 and G3) together give the full resistance. Their individual contributions are additive (50+75=125, but wild type is 100% \u2014 maybe there's a ceiling). \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has both knocked out, so they can't be expressed even with G2 present, so resistance is 10% (maybe a base level from other genes not considered here, but the problem states these are the candidates). \n\nThe question is about their interaction. Since their combined loss gives worse than either alone, that indicates redundancy (they are in parallel pathways and their combined loss reduces further). So redundancy is correct. \n\nNow, looking at the options, D says \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". The epistasis part might not be correct, but maybe the redundancy is the main point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and another gene. Since G2 is upstream, it's epistatic to both. But the options don't mention that. \n\nThe options don't have an option that says G2 is a TF and G1/G3 are redundant without mentioning epistasis. So the best possible answer among the options is D. \n\nWait, but the epistasis part in D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Which would mean that when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3's contribution (75%) is seen. So that would fit if G3's effect is only visible when G1 is absent. But in the wild type, both are present, and you get 100%, which is more than G3's 75%. So that suggests that G1's presence adds to G3's effect. So G1 is not epistatic to G3. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is D despite the epistasis part being incorrect, because redundancy is correct. Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, the question says \"which conclusion can you draw\". The data clearly shows that G2 is essential (since its knockout leads to 0%), so it's likely the TF. The other two genes are redundant because their combined loss gives worse than either alone. So redundancy is a valid conclusion. \n\nThe epistasis part in D might be a trick. Maybe the correct answer is D because it has redundancy and G2 as TF. Even if the epistasis part is wrong, perhaps the other parts are correct. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nPleiotropy means each gene has multiple effects, but the question is about their interaction in the pathway. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, and the epistasis part is a mistake in the options, but since that's the best fit, I'll go with D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants. \n\n- **g2 (no G2)** has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential for resistance. \n- **g1 (no G1)** has 75% resistance, and **g3 (no G3)** has 50%, suggesting both genes contribute partially to resistance when present. \n- **g1g3 (no G1 and G3)** has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, implying redundancy between G1 and G3 (their combined loss reduces resistance further). \n- **g2g3 and g1g2** also show 0%, consistent with G2 being upstream (its loss negates all resistance regardless of other genes).\n\nG2 likely acts as a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this genetics question step by step. Hmm, the problem is about figuring out the relationship between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose. The key here is understanding the mutant results and how they indicate the genes' interactions.\n\nFirst, let's recap the data given. The resistance levels for each mutant and double mutant are provided. The wild-type is 100%, so lower percentages mean less resistance. The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. \n\nLooking at the single mutants:\n\n- g1 (knockout of G1) has 75% resistance. That's a reduction but not complete loss.\n- g2 (no G2) has 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant is completely susceptible.\n- g3 (no G3) has 50% resistance. Half the wild-type's resistance.\n\nNow, the double mutants:\n\n- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 alone)\n- g1g3: 10% (worse than either single mutant)\n- g2g3: 0% (same as g2 and g2g3)\n\nHmm. Let's think about epistasis and redundancy here. Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. If two genes are redundant, their combined knockout might not be worse than either alone, but here g1g3 is worse than g1 (75% vs 10%) and g3 (50%). Wait, that suggests that G1 and G3 might not be redundant. Instead, their combined loss is worse, so maybe they are in parallel pathways but additive?\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that controls both G1 and G3. Let me think through each possibility.\n\nThe fact that g2 alone is 0% suggests that G2 is essential. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of others, then its knockout would prevent expression of other genes. Let's see:\n\nSuppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in reality, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. The g1 mutant (with G2 present) has 75% resistance. So maybe G1's product is still contributing when G2 is present? Wait, but if G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 wouldn't be expressed. But in the g1 mutant (G2 is present), G1 is knocked out. So the g1 mutant's 75% suggests that even without G1, there's still some resistance, perhaps from G3? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. Let's think:\n\n- In wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. So their combined effect gives 100% resistance.\n- In g2, since G2 is missing, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So resistance drops to 0%. That matches the data.\n- In g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed (since G2 is a TF for G3?), so G3's presence gives 50% (since g3 alone is 50%). But in g1, the resistance is 75%. Wait, that's higher than g3. So maybe G1's product also contributes, but when G1 is missing, G3 alone is 50% but when G1 is present (even with G3 present?), maybe they add up. But in g1, G1 is missing but G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. But then why is g1's resistance 75%? Hmm, maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G1, but not for G3. Let's see:\n\nIf G2 is a TF for G1, then in g2, G1 isn't expressed, so G1's contribution is gone. But G3 is still present (if G2 doesn't control it). But then in g2, the resistance would be the same as g3 (since G3 is the only one left?), but g2's resistance is 0% and g3 is 50%. That contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G3, but not G1. Then in g2, G3 isn't expressed, so only G1's contribution remains. But in g1, G1 is missing, so only G3 (if G2 is present) is there. Let's see:\n\nIf G2 controls G3, then:\n\n- Wild type: G2 activates G3, so both G1 and G3 are active. Combined resistance is 100%.\n- g2: G3 isn't expressed (since G2 is missing), so only G1 is present. But the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. Wait, but if G1 is present, then why 0%? Unless G1 alone isn't sufficient. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, but in a way that their combined effect is necessary. Let's think of the double mutants.\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng1g2 has 0% which is same as g2. So the loss of G1 doesn't make it worse than g2. So G1's contribution is already accounted for in g2. That suggests that G1's function is dependent on G2. So if G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed, so losing G1 again (in g1g2) doesn't change anything. That makes sense if G2 is upstream of G1.\n\nSimilarly, g2g3 is 0% same as g2. So losing G3 in addition to G2 doesn't reduce further. So G3's effect is also dependent on G2. So G2 must be upstream of both G1 and G3.\n\nNow, looking at g1g3. The resistance is 10%, which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out but G2 is present, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are both contributing to resistance when G2 is present. Because in their double knockout (g1g3), since G2 is present, their absence removes both contributions, leading to very low resistance. \n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance (as in g2).\n\n- The single mutants:\n\n  - g1 has G2 present, so G3 is still expressed. The resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So G1's contribution plus G3's gives 75%? Wait, but if G3 alone is 50%, then adding G1's contribution would take it up to maybe 100%? But in the wild type, it's 100%. Hmm, so maybe G1 and G3 together contribute fully, but when one is missing, the other can't compensate fully. \n\nWait, the wild type has both G1 and G3 active (since G2 is there), so 100%. In g1, G3 is active (since G2 is present), so 50%? But in the data, g1 is 75%. That contradicts. Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nWait, in the g3 mutant (no G3), resistance is 50%. So G1's presence (since G2 is there, so G1 is expressed) gives 50%? Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to think numerically. Let's suppose that the total resistance is the sum of contributions from each gene. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the contribution of G1 as x, G3 as y, and maybe they are additive. Then:\n\nWild type (G1+G2+G3) gives 100% = x + y.\n\nIn g1 (no G1 but G2 present, so G3 is expressed because G2 is the TF for G3?), so resistance is y = 75%? But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. Then, if y=75%, then G3's contribution is 75%? But the g3 mutant (no G3) would have x = 100% - y = 25%. But according to the data, g3 is 50%. That doesn't add up. Hmm, perhaps the model is not additive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resistance is multiplicative. Let's see:\n\nSuppose each gene contributes a certain factor. For example, each gene's presence multiplies the resistance by some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both necessary for full resistance, but can partially compensate. For instance, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then losing one reduces resistance, but losing both reduces further.\n\nWait, let's think of the double mutant g1g3. Since G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed normally except they are knocked out here. So without G1 and G3, resistance is 10%. So their combined presence is needed for full resistance, but each alone can provide some. \n\nLooking at g3 (no G3): resistance is 50%, so G1 alone gives 50% (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed). Then g1 (no G1) would have G3's contribution. But in the data, g1 has 75%, so that would mean G3's contribution is 75%. Then the total would be 75% + 50% = 125%? But wild type is 100%, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes have overlapping functions. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince g2 is 0% and all double mutants with g2 are also 0%, that suggests that G2 is essential. Without G2, resistance is gone. So G2's product is necessary for any resistance. But when G2 is present, other genes can add to resistance.\n\nLooking at the g1g3 mutant: since G2 is present (because it's only knocking out G1 and G3), but they have 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are missing, but G2 is present, the plant still has some minimal resistance (10%). That suggests that G2 might have some resistance on its own, or maybe there's another gene involved? But the problem states that the three genes are the candidates. Wait, maybe G2's product alone isn't sufficient, but when combined with others, but when those are missing, there's a tiny bit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is present, it turns on G1 and G3. If G2 is missing, neither is expressed, so resistance is 0%.\n\nIn the g1 mutant (only missing G1), G3 is still on (since G2 is present), so resistance is 75% (which is lower than wild-type 100%, so G3 alone gives 75%?), but then in the g3 mutant (missing G3), G1 is still on, so G1 alone gives 50% resistance. So the total would be G1 (50%) plus G3 (75%) gives more than 100%? That's impossible, so maybe they are not additive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both G1 and G3 is needed for full resistance. So if either is missing, you lose some. Let's see:\n\nIf wild type has both G1 and G3 (since G2 is present), giving 100%. \n\ng1 (no G1) has only G3, which gives 75% (so G3 alone is 75%). \n\ng3 (no G3) has only G1, which gives 50% (so G1 alone is 50%). \n\nThen, if both are missing (g1g3), you have neither, so maybe that would be 0%, but in the data it's 10%. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait the g1g3 has 10%, so maybe there's a base level even without those genes, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's another pathway, but the question says these are the three candidates. Maybe the 10% is due to some residual effect, but the problem states \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of other(s)\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes are arranged in a pathway where G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are in parallel branches. Let me try to model this:\n\nSuppose G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. Each of these genes then contribute to resistance. So:\n\n- Wild type: G2 \u2192 activates G1 and G3 \u2192 full resistance (100%).\n- g2: no G2 \u2192 no G1 or G3 \u2192 0%.\n- g1: G2 is present \u2192 G3 is active. So resistance from G3 only. The data says 75% here. So G3 alone gives 75%.\n- g3: G2 present \u2192 G1 is active. G1 alone gives 50% (as per data).\n- g1g3: both G1 and G3 knocked out, so even with G2 present, since they are knocked out, no contribution. But the data shows 10%, which contradicts. Hmm, so that model doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in g1g3, the genes G1 and G3 are knocked out. Even though G2 is present, which would normally activate them, they can't be expressed because they're knocked out. So their absence would mean no contribution. But the data says 10%, which is better than 0. That suggests that maybe there's another pathway or that G2 itself has some effect. But according to the problem statement, the three genes are the candidates, so maybe there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's product has some direct effect on resistance, beyond just activating G1 and G3. For instance, G2 might produce a protein that's part of the resistance mechanism, and G1 and G3 are modifiers. But the question states that at least one gene (probably G2) is a transcription factor upstream of others. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is in the epistasis. Let's think about epistatic relationships. Epistasis is when one gene masks the effect of another. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, then the presence of a non-functional G2 would make the effects of G1 and G3 irrelevant. That fits with the g2 mutant having 0% regardless of other genes (since in all double mutants with g2, the resistance is 0%).\n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nWait, redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. If they are redundant, then knocking out one would have less effect, but the data shows that g1 has 75% and g3 50%, so maybe they aren't fully redundant. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy refers to a gene affecting multiple traits, which might not be relevant here. Epistatic relationships between G1 and G3 would mean that one masks the other. \n\nWait, let's think of epistasis in the double mutant. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 would be masked when G1 is present. But in the g1g3 mutant, both are knocked out. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways and their combined loss reduces resistance further. So they are not redundant but additive. So redundancy would mean that their loss together doesn't reduce more than either alone, which isn't the case here.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant. But since their combined loss gives lower resistance than either alone, they can't be redundant. So D is out.\n\nOption C says they show pleiotropy. Not sure about that. \n\nOption B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure. \n\nOption A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is likely the TF.\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\n- g2 is 0%, which is worse than any other mutant except g1g2 and g2g3 (which are also 0). So G2's function is critical. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 is knocked out but G3 is active (since G2 is the TF for it). The resistance is 75%, so G3's contribution alone is 75%. \n\nIn the g3 mutant, G1 is active (since G2 is present, so G1 is expressed?), and G3 is knocked out. The resistance is 50%, so G1 alone gives 50%.\n\nTherefore, the total in wild type is 100%, which is G1 (50%) + G3 (75%)? But that would be over 100. Hmm, maybe they are not additive but multiplicative. Let's see:\n\nIf the combined effect is multiplicative: 0.5 (G1) * 0.75 (G3) = 0.375, but that's 37.5% which doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each gene contributes a certain percentage. Let's say wild type is 100% (both active). \n\ng1 (no G1) has G3 only \u2192 75% \u2192 so G3 alone is 75%.\n\ng3 (no G3) has G1 only \u2192 50% \u2192 G1 alone is 50%.\n\nSo combined, they add up to 75+50=125, but the wild type is 100. That suggests they are not simply additive but maybe one is a potentiator of the other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of G1 is necessary to activate G3's function. For instance, G3's product requires G1's product to be effective. So without G1, even if G3 is present (as in g1 mutant), its contribution is reduced. Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G3 is present (since G2 is active) but the resistance is 75%. That contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a pathway where G1 is upstream of G3. So G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. But this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the double mutant g1g3. Here, G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is 10%, which is better than 0%. That suggests that maybe G2 has some function even without G1 and G3. But the problem says G2 is a transcription factor upstream, so maybe it's supposed to activate others, but if those are knocked out, then G2's own product might contribute a little. But the question states the three genes are the candidates, so maybe G2's own product is part of the resistance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's product is necessary for the expression of G1 and G3, but also has its own role. For example, G2's protein might have two functions: activating genes and being part of the resistance mechanism. \n\nBut the question states that the experiment is to find genes contributing to resistance, so maybe the three genes are all part of the resistance pathway. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2 (g2), both are off, so no resistance. \n\nIn the g1g3 mutant, even with G2 present, since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, there's no resistance except maybe a tiny bit (10%), which might be from other genes not considered here, but the problem states these are the candidates. So perhaps the 10% is an experimental error, but we have to work with the data given.\n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption C says \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy means one gene affecting multiple traits, but here maybe it's a red herring. Epistatic means G1's effect is epistatic over G3. So in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. But in the g1 mutant (no G1), G3 is present and gives 75%, which is higher than G1's 50% alone. So if G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is present, G3's effect is not seen. But in wild type, both are present and you get 100%. Maybe that would mean that G1's presence allows G3 to function, so they are synergistic, not epistatic. \n\nAlternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's contribution is lost. But in the g1 mutant, G3 is present but the resistance is 75% (which is G3's contribution alone?), so that contradicts. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of epistasis as the interaction where the double mutant has a phenotype like one of the single mutants. For example, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g1. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than both. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then the double mutant would look like g3. But here, g1g3 is worse than g3 (10% vs 50%). So that's not either. \n\nSo maybe the epistatic relationship isn't between G1 and G3, but between G2 and them. Since G2 is a TF upstream, it's epistatic to both. So G2's effect is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says \"G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\". But the data shows G2's knockout is worse, so it's more likely G2 is the TF. \n\nOption B: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". Not sure about the same promoter part, but epistatic direction might be wrong.\n\nOption D: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But redundancy would mean that their combined loss doesn't reduce further than either, which isn't the case here (g1g3 is worse). So D is out.\n\nOption C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Pleiotropy might not be the case, but the key part is the epistasis between G1 and G3. Since their combined loss gives a lower resistance, maybe they are in parallel pathways and their effects are additive, so there's no epistasis between them. \n\nWait, but the question says \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)\". So G2 is upstream of others. The other genes (G1 and G3) might not have an upstream relationship between them. So the epistasis could be between G2 and the others, but the options don't mention that. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is D? Wait, but redundancy is not supported. Let me recheck:\n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, so G2 can't activate them. But if G1 and G3 were redundant, then losing both would be the same as losing one. But here, it's worse than either single mutant. So they are not redundant. So D is incorrect. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct answer is B? Let me see option B again: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure, but the epistasis part says G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in the absence of G3 (g3), the effect of G1 is not seen. But in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%, which is G1's contribution. So that contradicts. \n\nWait, maybe the epistasis is in another way. Let me think of the options again. \n\nOption C says G1 is epistatic to G3. So when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But in the wild type, both are present and resistance is 100%, which would be G1's effect. But in g3 mutant (no G3), G1's effect is 50%, so that's lower than wild type. That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the epistatic relationship where the double mutant has a phenotype like one of the single mutants. For example, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant would look like g1. But here, g1g3 is worse than g1 (75% vs 10%). So not that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no epistasis between G1 and G3, but the question requires choosing between the options given. \n\nLooking at the options again, perhaps option D is incorrect, so maybe the correct answer is C or B. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the data for g1g3: 10% which is worse than both. This suggests that G1 and G3 are in a pathway where their combined loss is worse than either alone, implying they are in parallel pathways. So their functions are additive. \n\nThe question states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream. Since G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, their knockout would lead to lower resistance but not 0% unless G2 is also missing. \n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D says \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". But since their combined loss gives lower than either, they aren't redundant. So D is out. \n\nOption C: \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". Pleiotropy is not about redundancy. If they are pleiotropic, maybe they have multiple effects, but how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D but the redundancy is not complete. Not sure. \n\nWait, the question says \"gene redundancy\" could mean that they can partially substitute for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. That might not fit redundancy. Redundancy usually means that if one is missing, the other can take over, so their combined loss is worse. Wait, actually, redundancy does mean that both are needed for full function, so losing one doesn't reduce as much as losing both. For example, if they are redundant, the single mutants have reduced resistance but the double has much less. That's exactly what's happening here: g1g3 has 10% (worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%)). So that would be gene redundancy. \n\nAh, maybe I was thinking of \"redundant\" as being completely overlapping, but redundancy can mean that they contribute additively. So if they are in parallel pathways, their combined loss is worse than either alone. So that is redundancy. So option D says \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But the epistasis part might not be necessary here. \n\nWait, but the question requires choosing the correct conclusion from the options. Let me see option D again:\n\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nThe epistasis part: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3's contribution is lost. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which would be G3's contribution alone. So that contradicts. \n\nHmm. So maybe the epistasis part is incorrect. \n\nLooking at option B: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\". \n\nSame promoter might mean they are coregulated, but the epistasis here would mean that when G3 is knocked out, G1's effect is not seen. But in the g3 mutant, G1 is still present and gives 50% resistance. So that contradicts. \n\nOption C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n\nPleiotropy isn't relevant here. The epistasis part again has the same issue as before. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is D, accepting that the redundancy part is correct, and the epistasis part might be a distractor. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding epistasis here. \n\nWait, another angle: The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. G2 is the TF. The other genes (G1 and G3) are downstream. \n\nIn the g1g3 mutant, since both are knocked out, their absence removes both pathways. Since G2 is present, it can't activate them, so their absence leads to lower resistance. \n\nThe fact that G1 and G3 are both needed for full resistance (their combined loss gives much lower resistance than either alone) suggests they are redundant or in parallel. So redundancy is correct. \n\nNow, the options for D say \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". But epistasis would mean that the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So when G1 is present, G3's effect isn't seen. But in the wild type, they are both present and you get 100%, so that wouldn't be the case. So epistasis between them is probably not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is D, and the epistasis part is a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and another gene. But the options don't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is C? Or maybe none of the options are perfect, but the best is D because of the redundancy part. \n\nAlternatively, let me think again. The problem says that at least one gene is a TF acting upstream. G2 is the TF. The other two are downstream. \n\nSo G2's knockout leads to 0%, because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. \n\nIn g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. The resistance is 75% (so G3 alone gives 75%). \n\nIn g3, G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, giving 50%. \n\nThus, the total in wild type is 100%, so the two genes (G1 and G3) together give the full resistance. Their individual contributions are additive (50+75=125, but wild type is 100% \u2014 maybe there's a ceiling). \n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has both knocked out, so they can't be expressed even with G2 present, so resistance is 10% (maybe a base level from other genes not considered here, but the problem states these are the candidates). \n\nThe question is about their interaction. Since their combined loss gives worse than either alone, that indicates redundancy (they are in parallel pathways and their combined loss reduces further). So redundancy is correct. \n\nNow, looking at the options, D says \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". The epistasis part might not be correct, but maybe the redundancy is the main point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is between G2 and another gene. Since G2 is upstream, it's epistatic to both. But the options don't mention that. \n\nThe options don't have an option that says G2 is a TF and G1/G3 are redundant without mentioning epistasis. So the best possible answer among the options is D. \n\nWait, but the epistasis part in D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Which would mean that when G1 is present, G3's effect is masked. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3's contribution (75%) is seen. So that would fit if G3's effect is only visible when G1 is absent. But in the wild type, both are present, and you get 100%, which is more than G3's 75%. So that suggests that G1's presence adds to G3's effect. So G1 is not epistatic to G3. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is D despite the epistasis part being incorrect, because redundancy is correct. Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, the question says \"which conclusion can you draw\". The data clearly shows that G2 is essential (since its knockout leads to 0%), so it's likely the TF. The other two genes are redundant because their combined loss gives worse than either alone. So redundancy is a valid conclusion. \n\nThe epistasis part in D might be a trick. Maybe the correct answer is D because it has redundancy and G2 as TF. Even if the epistasis part is wrong, perhaps the other parts are correct. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: \"G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". \n\nPleiotropy means each gene has multiple effects, but the question is about their interaction in the pathway. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, and the epistasis part is a mistake in the options, but since that's the best fit, I'll go with D.\n\n\nTo determine the interaction between the genes, we analyze the resistance levels of the mutants. \n\n- **g2 (no G2)** has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential for resistance. \n- **g1 (no G1)** has 75% resistance, and **g3 (no G3)** has 50%, suggesting both genes contribute partially to resistance when present. \n- **g1g3 (no G1 and G3)** has 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, implying redundancy between G1 and G3 (their combined loss reduces resistance further). \n- **g2g3 and g1g2** also show 0%, consistent with G2 being upstream (its loss negates all resistance regardless of other genes).\n\nG2 likely acts as a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3. Their redundancy explains the severe reduction in g1g3. Among the options, **D** states G2 is a TF, G1/G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While epistasis between G1 and G3 isn't strongly supported, redundancy aligns with the data, making D the best choice.\n\nAnswer: D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\n**Answer: D**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this genetics question. Hmm, the problem is about figuring out the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in lupines. The experiment gave us knockout mutants and some double mutants, and their resistance levels. We need to determine which of the options (A-D) correctly describes their interactions.\n\nFirst, let me recall some genetics terms here. Epistasis is when one gene masks or modifies the expression of another gene. If a gene is a transcription factor, it might control the expression of other genes. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Gene redundancy would mean that two genes have overlapping functions, so losing one might not affect the trait much if the other is present, but together they're important.\n\nThe data given are the resistance levels. The control is 100%, so the wild type is fully resistant. The mutants:\n\n- g1 (knockout G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance a bit but not completely.\n- g2 (knockout G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big hit; without G2, plants are completely susceptible.\n- g3 (knockout G3) is 50% resistance. So losing G3 reduces resistance by half.\n\nThen the double mutants:\n\n- g1g3 (no G1 and G3) has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant but not as bad as g2.\n- g2g3 (no G2 and G3) is 0% like g2 alone.\n- g1g2 (no G1 and G2) also 0%, same as g2.\n\nHmm, so let's think. Since g2 alone is 0%, that suggests G2 is crucial. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for other genes to function. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the double mutants: when you knock out both G1 and G2, you still get 0%, which is the same as just G2. That might suggest that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because if G2 is needed for G1's function, then losing G2 would already prevent G1 from working, so removing G1 doesn't make it worse. Alternatively, maybe G1 is downstream of G2, so without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so knocking out G1 in addition doesn't change anything.\n\nSimilarly, the g2g3 double mutant is 0% like g2 alone. So G3's knockout doesn't affect the outcome when G2 is already missing. So that would mean G3 is also downstream of G2, perhaps? Because if G2 is a transcription factor that controls G3 and G1, then without G2, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, so their absence doesn't matter anymore.\n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: g3 is 50% resistance. So when G3 is knocked out, resistance is halved. But when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. So maybe G3 is part of a pathway that's dependent on G2, but there's another pathway (like G1) that also contributes. Wait, but in g1, resistance is 75%, so maybe G1 contributes some resistance. Let me think.\n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If each single mutant has 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), then if they were independent, you might expect their combined effect to be 75% * 50% = 37.5%, but it's actually 10%, which is much lower. That suggests that they are not independent; perhaps their functions are additive in some way, but when both are missing, the combined effect is worse. Alternatively, maybe they are part of parallel pathways. If both are needed, then their loss would be more severe.\n\nWait, but maybe the genes are in a pathway where G2 is a master regulator. Let's consider each option.\n\nOption A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, but if G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean G2's presence affects G1's expression. But G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, so if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's controlling G1 and G3. But option A says G1 is the transcription factor. Not sure yet.\n\nOption B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure how that would affect resistance. Also, epistatic G3 over G1. Not sure.\n\nOption C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, if G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence affects G3's function. But how does that fit with the data?\n\nOption D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nGene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So if one is missing, the other can compensate. Let's see:\n\nIn the single mutants, g1 is 75% resistance, g3 is 50%. If they are redundant, then losing one might reduce resistance, but the other can still contribute. But the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. If they were redundant, maybe the combined loss would lead to additive effect. Like, if each contributes 50%, then together they'd be 0%? But here it's 10%. Hmm, maybe not exactly additive. Alternatively, maybe the genes are in parallel pathways but not fully redundant. \n\nAlternatively, if G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But in the single mutants, when you knock out G1, resistance is still 75%, so that suggests that G3 is still present. So that would mean G3's expression doesn't depend on G2. Wait, but that contradicts the idea that G2 is a TF controlling them both. Wait, no\u2014if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in a g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed, so their knockout would not affect the phenotype because they're already off. But in the g1 mutant (with G2 present), G3 is still on, so you get partial resistance. \n\nWait, let's try to model this. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. \n\nIn wild type (all genes present), G2 turns on G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance. \n\nIn g1 mutant: G2 is active, so G3 is still on. So resistance is reduced but not completely (75%). \n\nIn g3 mutant: G2 is active, so G1 is on. So G1's contribution is there, but without G3, resistance is 50%. \n\nIn g2 mutant: G2 is off, so neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So no resistance (0%). \n\nNow, the double mutants:\n\ng1g2: G2 is off (so G1 and G3 are off), but G1 is also off. But since G2 is already off, the loss of G1 doesn't matter. So resistance remains 0%, which matches the data.\n\ng2g3: same as g2, since G2's absence already stops G3's expression. So 0%.\n\ng1g3: Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But if G2 is present, then maybe there's another pathway? Wait, but in this case, G1 and G3 are the only ones being considered. Wait, perhaps in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present, so it can activate other genes? Or maybe there are other genes, but the question says the three genes are the candidates. Hmm.\n\nWait, if the only resistance genes are G1 and G3, which are both turned on by G2 (the TF), then in a g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present, so it would try to activate G1 and G3, but they are knocked out. So resistance would be 0%? But the data shows g1g3 has 10% resistance. That contradicts. So maybe there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1, and G1 in turn activates G3. So the pathway is G2 \u2192 G1 \u2192 G3. Let's see:\n\nIn g2 mutant: no G2 \u2192 G1 isn't expressed \u2192 G3 isn't expressed. So 0%.\n\ng1 mutant: G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, which can activate G3. So both G1 and G3 are active, leading to full resistance? But the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3 independently, but G1 and G3 have some redundancy. Let's see:\n\nIn g1g3 mutant (both G1 and G3 are knocked out), but G2 is present, so maybe there's a third gene? Wait the question says the three genes are the candidates. So maybe in this scenario, without G1 and G3, there's no resistance, but the data shows 10%. Hmm, maybe my model is wrong.\n\nWait, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are both needed, then their absence would lead to almost no resistance, but it's 10%, so maybe there's a small contribution from another pathway or maybe the genes have other functions. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, but G3 also has another pathway. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G1, and G3 is a separate gene. Let's think:\n\n- g2 (no G2) \u2192 no G1, so resistance from G3 only. But g2 has 0% resistance, so maybe G3 isn't expressed without G2. Or maybe G3 is also regulated by G2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The key is to find which option fits the data.\n\nLooking at option D: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\"\n\nGene redundancy means that G1 and G3 can compensate each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. But in the single mutants, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. That might suggest that they are not fully redundant. If they were fully redundant, then their single mutants would have the same level of resistance. Since they don't, perhaps they have some overlapping but not identical functions. \n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor that activates both, then in a g1g3 double mutant (with G2 present), since both are knocked out, there would be no resistance. But the data shows 10% resistance. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's another gene, but the question says the three are candidates. So maybe the model isn't exactly that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Let me see:\n\n- Wild type: G2 \u2192 G1 and G3 \u2192 resistance is 100%.\n\n- g1: G3 is still active (since G2 is present), so maybe 50%? But the data says 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's presence is needed for G1 and G3 to function. Wait, in g2, resistance is 0%, so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is on. The resistance is 75%, which is three quarters. Maybe G3 contributes 25% alone? Wait, but g3 has 50% resistance. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I need to think in terms of additive effects. Let's say the wild type has all three genes, but G2 is the TF. So G1 and G3 are the effectors. If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. \n\nSo:\n\nWild type: G2 \u2192 G1 and G3 active \u2192 100% resistance.\n\ng1: G2 still active \u2192 G3 is active. But resistance is 75%. So maybe G3 alone gives 75%? But then why is g3 at 50%?\n\nWait, perhaps G3 is also a TF for another gene? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the effect is multiplicative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 50% each. But when both are present, the total is 100%. But that's additive. Wait, but if they are additive, then the combined effect would be 75 +50 = 125, which is over 100. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each gene is necessary for a certain part of the resistance. Like, G2 is essential, but G1 and G3 add to the resistance. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng1g3 has 10%. Since both G1 and G3 are missing, but G2 is present. So if G2 requires both G1 and G3, then their absence would lead to very low resistance, but not zero. But in that case, why is g2 (no G2) at 0%? Because without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g1g3, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 would be expressed normally. Wait, but they are knocked out. So their absence would mean no contribution. So then why is there 10% resistance? Maybe there's another pathway, but the question states that the three genes are the candidates. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes have a hierarchy where G2 is a TF that activates G1, and G1 activates G3. Then:\n\nIn g2, no G2 \u2192 no G1 \u2192 no G3 \u2192 0%.\n\nIn g1, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out \u2192 no G3 \u2192 resistance comes from what? If G3 is only activated by G1, then without G1, G3 isn't expressed. So in g1 mutant, the only gene left is G2, but G2 itself might have some function? Or maybe G2 has another target? But the problem states the three genes are the candidates. So maybe in g1, the resistance is from G2's own activity. But then why is the resistance 75%?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, but each contributes partially. Let's suppose that G1 and G3 each contribute 50% to the resistance, and their combined effect is 100%. So:\n\n- g1 (no G1): G3 is active (50% resistance)\n- g3 (no G3): G1 is active (50% resistance)\nBut the data shows g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 contributes more than G3. Let's say G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. Then together they sum to 100%. But then:\n\n- g1 would have only G3 (25%), but the data says 75% for g1. That's opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's presence allows the expression of both, but they have a combined effect. Let me think of the double mutant g1g3. If both are knocked out but G2 is present, then there's no resistance from them, so maybe the remaining resistance (10%) is from G2 itself or other genes not considered here. But since the question says the three genes are the candidates, maybe that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is in the double mutants involving g2. For instance, g1g2 has 0% (same as g2), which suggests that G1's presence or absence doesn't matter when G2 is missing. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly, g2g3 also 0%, so G3's absence doesn't affect when G2 is missing. That would mean G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. So that would suggest G2 is upstream of both. \n\nNow, looking at the options. Let's check option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nWait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence would mask G3's effect. But how does that fit the data?\n\nAlternatively, in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss leads to very low resistance. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse than either alone. Like if each contributes 50%, then together you get 0. But here, they have 10%. Maybe they are partially redundant. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So losing both would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. The data supports that (g1g3 is 10%, worse than 50% and 75%). \n\nAlso, G2 is a transcription factor, so it controls G1 and G3. So in g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 is active. The 75% resistance in g1 suggests that G3 alone gives 75%? But then why is g3 (no G3) at 50%? That would mean G1 alone gives 50%. So maybe G1 and G3 are not equally contributing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, and each contributes a portion. Let's say G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. Then:\n\n- g1: only G3 is active (25% \u2192 but data shows 75%). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's own function plus the contributions of G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is necessary for any resistance. So without G2, you get 0%. But when G2 is present, the other genes add to the resistance. So:\n\nWild type: G2 + G1 + G3 \u2192 100%\n\ng1: G2 + G3 \u2192 75% (so G3 contributes 75% when G2 is present?)\n\ng3: G2 + G1 \u2192 50% (so G1 contributes 50%?)\n\nThen in the double mutant g1g3: only G2 is present \u2192 but then why 10% resistance? That would imply that G2 alone gives 10%. But then why is g2 at 0%? Because without G2, you have nothing. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% (as in g2). \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance (75%). In the g3 mutant, G1 is expressed (due to G2), giving 50% resistance. \n\nThen in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since G2 is present, it would try to activate them, but they're not there. So the resistance would be whatever G2 does on its own. But the data shows 10% resistance. So maybe G2 itself has some minor function. But the question states the three genes are the candidates, so maybe the 10% is due to other factors not considered here. Alternatively, perhaps the model is that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing, and their combined loss removes most of the resistance but not all.\n\nIf G2 is a TF that activates both, then:\n\n- g1g3 would have no G1 or G3, so resistance from G2's own function (if any) plus any other genes. But since the question only considers the three genes, maybe the 10% is due to G2's direct effect, but why would it be 10%?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes are in a pathway where G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. Then:\n\n- g2: no G2 \u2192 no G1 \u2192 no G3 \u2192 0%\n- g1: G2 is active, so G1 is turned on, but G1 is knocked out \u2192 no G3. So resistance comes from G2's function? If G2 has a minor role, maybe 10%? But data shows g1 has 75%. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. So their combined loss is worse than either alone. The data supports that (g1g3 is 10% vs 75 and 50). \n\nAlso, G2 is a transcription factor. So it's upstream of G1 and G3. \n\nThe question states that at least one is a TF acting upstream of others. \n\nIn the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out (which is upstream), removing G1 doesn't change the outcome (still 0%), meaning G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly for g2g3. \n\nSo G2 is epistatic over both, meaning it's upstream. \n\nThe option D says G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, epistasis here would mean that G1's presence affects G3's effect. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redundancy means that G1 and G3 can both contribute to the same pathway. So if one is missing, the other can compensate. But their combined loss removes both, leading to much lower resistance. \n\nThe question's options: \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nEpistatic here would mean that G1's presence affects G3's function. Maybe G1's product is required for G3's product to function. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't contribute. But then in the g3 mutant, G1 is still present, so resistance would be from G1. \n\nWait, in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which would be from G1's contribution. But in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which would be from G3's contribution. That suggests that G3 contributes more than G1. \n\nIf they are redundant, their combined contribution is additive. So G1 (50%) + G3 (75%) would give 125%, but that's over 100%, so maybe they have overlapping functions. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis part: If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence affects G3's effect. Maybe when G1 is present, G3's contribution is masked. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can act, but only contributes 75%? That would explain why g1 has 75% (G3 alone) and g3 has 50% (G1 alone). \n\nIn the double mutant g1g3, neither is present, so no resistance except maybe from G2's own function (10%). \n\nThis would fit option D's description. \n\nWait, but the question says G2 is the TF. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. \n\nSo the hierarchy is G2 \u2192 G1 and G3, with G1 and G3 being redundant but epistatic in some way. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n- G2 is necessary (as its knockout gives 0%)\n- The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0%, showing G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n- The single mutants' resistance levels suggest that G1 and G3 have different contributions. \n- The double mutant g1g3's low resistance (10%) suggests their redundancy. \n\nOption D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined loss is worse), and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nThe epistasis part might mean that G1's presence suppresses G3's effect. So when G1 is present, G3's contribution is not needed, but when G1 is missing, G3 can take over. But then why does the g3 mutant have lower resistance than g1? \n\nIf G1's contribution is higher than G3's, then:\n\n- g1 (no G1) \u2192 resistance comes from G3 \u2192 50% (but data says 75%)\nWait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G3's contribution is higher. If G3 alone gives 75% (as in g1), and G1 alone gives 50% (as in g3), then they are not fully redundant but have some overlapping function. \n\nThe epistasis part (G1 epistatic over G3) could mean that when G1 is present, it enhances or is required for G3's function. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function but less effectively. But this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis might be that G1 is required for G3 to function. So in g3 mutant (no G3), you still have G1's contribution (50%). But in g1 mutant (no G1), G3 can't function, so resistance is from G2's own function? But then why would that be 75%? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis might be that G1's presence masks G3's effect. For example, if G3's product is only active when G1 is not present. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"epistatic towards\" in the options refers to the direction. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's presence determines the expression or activity of G3. \n\nGiven that the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the best fit is D. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined knockout is worse), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nThe redundancy explains the 10% in g1g3. \n\nThe epistasis might mean that G1's presence affects G3's contribution. For example, if G1 is present, it enhances G3's effect. But when G1 is missing, G3 can still contribute but less so. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is that G1's function is required for G3's function, so when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't contribute, leading to lower resistance (75% comes from G2's own function?). But I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. This redundancy is a sign of overlapping functions. \n\nThe fact that G2 is a TF that's upstream of both fits with the data. \n\nThe epistatic part in D is G1 epistatic to G3. Since when you have g1 (no G1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%, this might mean that G1's presence suppresses G3's contribution, or vice versa. \n\nWait, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So when G1 is present (wild type), G3's contribution is not needed, so G3's knockout (g3) only loses 50% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 can now contribute, but only gives 75% resistance. \n\nThis would fit the data. So:\n\n- In wild type, G1 is present, so G3's effect is masked. So losing G3 (g3) only reduces resistance by 50% (since G1 is still active). \n\n- In g1 (no G1), G3 can now contribute, giving 75% resistance. \n\n- In g1g3 (both knocked out), no contribution from either, so only G2's own effect (10%). \n\nThis would mean that G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice. \n\nThe other options don't fit as well. \n\nOption C says G1 is epistatic over G3 but G1 and G3 have pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is not directly relevant here. \n\nOption A and B involve G1 as TF or same promoter, which doesn't fit the data. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe experiment's results indicate that G2 is crucial for resistance, as its knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor upstream of other genes. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming G2's epistatic role over G1 and G3. The g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance) is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%), indicating redundancy between G1 and G3. The resistance levels in single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) suggest overlapping but distinct contributions. Since G1's absence allows G3 to contribute less effectively, G1 is epistatic toward G3. This aligns with option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this genetics question. Hmm, the problem is about figuring out the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in anthracnose resistance in lupines. The experiment gave us knockout mutants and some double mutants, and their resistance levels. We need to determine which of the options (A-D) correctly describes their interactions.\n\nFirst, let me recall some genetics terms here. Epistasis is when one gene masks or modifies the expression of another gene. If a gene is a transcription factor, it might control the expression of other genes. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Gene redundancy would mean that two genes have overlapping functions, so losing one might not affect the trait much if the other is present, but together they're important.\n\nThe data given are the resistance levels. The control is 100%, so the wild type is fully resistant. The mutants:\n\n- g1 (knockout G1) has 75% resistance. So losing G1 reduces resistance a bit but not completely.\n- g2 (knockout G2) has 0% resistance. That's a big hit; without G2, plants are completely susceptible.\n- g3 (knockout G3) is 50% resistance. So losing G3 reduces resistance by half.\n\nThen the double mutants:\n\n- g1g3 (no G1 and G3) has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant but not as bad as g2.\n- g2g3 (no G2 and G3) is 0% like g2 alone.\n- g1g2 (no G1 and G2) also 0%, same as g2.\n\nHmm, so let's think. Since g2 alone is 0%, that suggests G2 is crucial. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for other genes to function. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the double mutants: when you knock out both G1 and G2, you still get 0%, which is the same as just G2. That might suggest that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because if G2 is needed for G1's function, then losing G2 would already prevent G1 from working, so removing G1 doesn't make it worse. Alternatively, maybe G1 is downstream of G2, so without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so knocking out G1 in addition doesn't change anything.\n\nSimilarly, the g2g3 double mutant is 0% like g2 alone. So G3's knockout doesn't affect the outcome when G2 is already missing. So that would mean G3 is also downstream of G2, perhaps? Because if G2 is a transcription factor that controls G3 and G1, then without G2, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, so their absence doesn't matter anymore.\n\nNow, looking at the single mutants: g3 is 50% resistance. So when G3 is knocked out, resistance is halved. But when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. So maybe G3 is part of a pathway that's dependent on G2, but there's another pathway (like G1) that also contributes. Wait, but in g1, resistance is 75%, so maybe G1 contributes some resistance. Let me think.\n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. If each single mutant has 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), then if they were independent, you might expect their combined effect to be 75% * 50% = 37.5%, but it's actually 10%, which is much lower. That suggests that they are not independent; perhaps their functions are additive in some way, but when both are missing, the combined effect is worse. Alternatively, maybe they are part of parallel pathways. If both are needed, then their loss would be more severe.\n\nWait, but maybe the genes are in a pathway where G2 is a master regulator. Let's consider each option.\n\nOption A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, but if G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean G2's presence affects G1's expression. But G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, so if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's controlling G1 and G3. But option A says G1 is the transcription factor. Not sure yet.\n\nOption B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure how that would affect resistance. Also, epistatic G3 over G1. Not sure.\n\nOption C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, if G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence affects G3's function. But how does that fit with the data?\n\nOption D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nGene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions. So if one is missing, the other can compensate. Let's see:\n\nIn the single mutants, g1 is 75% resistance, g3 is 50%. If they are redundant, then losing one might reduce resistance, but the other can still contribute. But the double mutant g1g3 has 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. If they were redundant, maybe the combined loss would lead to additive effect. Like, if each contributes 50%, then together they'd be 0%? But here it's 10%. Hmm, maybe not exactly additive. Alternatively, maybe the genes are in parallel pathways but not fully redundant. \n\nAlternatively, if G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. But in the single mutants, when you knock out G1, resistance is still 75%, so that suggests that G3 is still present. So that would mean G3's expression doesn't depend on G2. Wait, but that contradicts the idea that G2 is a TF controlling them both. Wait, no\u2014if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in a g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed, so their knockout would not affect the phenotype because they're already off. But in the g1 mutant (with G2 present), G3 is still on, so you get partial resistance. \n\nWait, let's try to model this. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. \n\nIn wild type (all genes present), G2 turns on G1 and G3, which contribute to resistance. \n\nIn g1 mutant: G2 is active, so G3 is still on. So resistance is reduced but not completely (75%). \n\nIn g3 mutant: G2 is active, so G1 is on. So G1's contribution is there, but without G3, resistance is 50%. \n\nIn g2 mutant: G2 is off, so neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So no resistance (0%). \n\nNow, the double mutants:\n\ng1g2: G2 is off (so G1 and G3 are off), but G1 is also off. But since G2 is already off, the loss of G1 doesn't matter. So resistance remains 0%, which matches the data.\n\ng2g3: same as g2, since G2's absence already stops G3's expression. So 0%.\n\ng1g3: Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But if G2 is present, then maybe there's another pathway? Wait, but in this case, G1 and G3 are the only ones being considered. Wait, perhaps in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present, so it can activate other genes? Or maybe there are other genes, but the question says the three genes are the candidates. Hmm.\n\nWait, if the only resistance genes are G1 and G3, which are both turned on by G2 (the TF), then in a g1g3 mutant, G2 is still present, so it would try to activate G1 and G3, but they are knocked out. So resistance would be 0%? But the data shows g1g3 has 10% resistance. That contradicts. So maybe there's another possibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1, and G1 in turn activates G3. So the pathway is G2 \u2192 G1 \u2192 G3. Let's see:\n\nIn g2 mutant: no G2 \u2192 G1 isn't expressed \u2192 G3 isn't expressed. So 0%.\n\ng1 mutant: G2 is present, so G1 is expressed, which can activate G3. So both G1 and G3 are active, leading to full resistance? But the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3 independently, but G1 and G3 have some redundancy. Let's see:\n\nIn g1g3 mutant (both G1 and G3 are knocked out), but G2 is present, so maybe there's a third gene? Wait the question says the three genes are the candidates. So maybe in this scenario, without G1 and G3, there's no resistance, but the data shows 10%. Hmm, maybe my model is wrong.\n\nWait, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are both needed, then their absence would lead to almost no resistance, but it's 10%, so maybe there's a small contribution from another pathway or maybe the genes have other functions. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, but G3 also has another pathway. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a TF for G1, and G3 is a separate gene. Let's think:\n\n- g2 (no G2) \u2192 no G1, so resistance from G3 only. But g2 has 0% resistance, so maybe G3 isn't expressed without G2. Or maybe G3 is also regulated by G2.\n\nWait, let me think again. The key is to find which option fits the data.\n\nLooking at option D: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\"\n\nGene redundancy means that G1 and G3 can compensate each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. But in the single mutants, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. That might suggest that they are not fully redundant. If they were fully redundant, then their single mutants would have the same level of resistance. Since they don't, perhaps they have some overlapping but not identical functions. \n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor that activates both, then in a g1g3 double mutant (with G2 present), since both are knocked out, there would be no resistance. But the data shows 10% resistance. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's another gene, but the question says the three are candidates. So maybe the model isn't exactly that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Let me see:\n\n- Wild type: G2 \u2192 G1 and G3 \u2192 resistance is 100%.\n\n- g1: G3 is still active (since G2 is present), so maybe 50%? But the data says 75%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's presence is needed for G1 and G3 to function. Wait, in g2, resistance is 0%, so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute. \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is on. The resistance is 75%, which is three quarters. Maybe G3 contributes 25% alone? Wait, but g3 has 50% resistance. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I need to think in terms of additive effects. Let's say the wild type has all three genes, but G2 is the TF. So G1 and G3 are the effectors. If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. \n\nSo:\n\nWild type: G2 \u2192 G1 and G3 active \u2192 100% resistance.\n\ng1: G2 still active \u2192 G3 is active. But resistance is 75%. So maybe G3 alone gives 75%? But then why is g3 at 50%?\n\nWait, perhaps G3 is also a TF for another gene? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the effect is multiplicative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 50% each. But when both are present, the total is 100%. But that's additive. Wait, but if they are additive, then the combined effect would be 75 +50 = 125, which is over 100. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each gene is necessary for a certain part of the resistance. Like, G2 is essential, but G1 and G3 add to the resistance. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the double mutants:\n\ng1g3 has 10%. Since both G1 and G3 are missing, but G2 is present. So if G2 requires both G1 and G3, then their absence would lead to very low resistance, but not zero. But in that case, why is g2 (no G2) at 0%? Because without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g1g3, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 would be expressed normally. Wait, but they are knocked out. So their absence would mean no contribution. So then why is there 10% resistance? Maybe there's another pathway, but the question states that the three genes are the candidates. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes have a hierarchy where G2 is a TF that activates G1, and G1 activates G3. Then:\n\nIn g2, no G2 \u2192 no G1 \u2192 no G3 \u2192 0%.\n\nIn g1, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out \u2192 no G3 \u2192 resistance comes from what? If G3 is only activated by G1, then without G1, G3 isn't expressed. So in g1 mutant, the only gene left is G2, but G2 itself might have some function? Or maybe G2 has another target? But the problem states the three genes are the candidates. So maybe in g1, the resistance is from G2's own activity. But then why is the resistance 75%?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, but each contributes partially. Let's suppose that G1 and G3 each contribute 50% to the resistance, and their combined effect is 100%. So:\n\n- g1 (no G1): G3 is active (50% resistance)\n- g3 (no G3): G1 is active (50% resistance)\nBut the data shows g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 contributes more than G3. Let's say G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. Then together they sum to 100%. But then:\n\n- g1 would have only G3 (25%), but the data says 75% for g1. That's opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's presence allows the expression of both, but they have a combined effect. Let me think of the double mutant g1g3. If both are knocked out but G2 is present, then there's no resistance from them, so maybe the remaining resistance (10%) is from G2 itself or other genes not considered here. But since the question says the three genes are the candidates, maybe that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is in the double mutants involving g2. For instance, g1g2 has 0% (same as g2), which suggests that G1's presence or absence doesn't matter when G2 is missing. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly, g2g3 also 0%, so G3's absence doesn't affect when G2 is missing. That would mean G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. So that would suggest G2 is upstream of both. \n\nNow, looking at the options. Let's check option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n\nWait, epistasis is about one gene masking another. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence would mask G3's effect. But how does that fit the data?\n\nAlternatively, in the double mutant g1g3, their combined loss leads to very low resistance. If they are redundant, then their combined loss would be worse than either alone. Like if each contributes 50%, then together you get 0. But here, they have 10%. Maybe they are partially redundant. \n\nOption D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So losing both would lead to a worse phenotype than either alone. The data supports that (g1g3 is 10%, worse than 50% and 75%). \n\nAlso, G2 is a transcription factor, so it controls G1 and G3. So in g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G3 is active. The 75% resistance in g1 suggests that G3 alone gives 75%? But then why is g3 (no G3) at 50%? That would mean G1 alone gives 50%. So maybe G1 and G3 are not equally contributing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, and each contributes a portion. Let's say G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. Then:\n\n- g1: only G3 is active (25% \u2192 but data shows 75%). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2's own function plus the contributions of G1 and G3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is necessary for any resistance. So without G2, you get 0%. But when G2 is present, the other genes add to the resistance. So:\n\nWild type: G2 + G1 + G3 \u2192 100%\n\ng1: G2 + G3 \u2192 75% (so G3 contributes 75% when G2 is present?)\n\ng3: G2 + G1 \u2192 50% (so G1 contributes 50%?)\n\nThen in the double mutant g1g3: only G2 is present \u2192 but then why 10% resistance? That would imply that G2 alone gives 10%. But then why is g2 at 0%? Because without G2, you have nothing. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% (as in g2). \n\nIn the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed, leading to some resistance (75%). In the g3 mutant, G1 is expressed (due to G2), giving 50% resistance. \n\nThen in the g1g3 double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since G2 is present, it would try to activate them, but they're not there. So the resistance would be whatever G2 does on its own. But the data shows 10% resistance. So maybe G2 itself has some minor function. But the question states the three genes are the candidates, so maybe the 10% is due to other factors not considered here. Alternatively, perhaps the model is that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing, and their combined loss removes most of the resistance but not all.\n\nIf G2 is a TF that activates both, then:\n\n- g1g3 would have no G1 or G3, so resistance from G2's own function (if any) plus any other genes. But since the question only considers the three genes, maybe the 10% is due to G2's direct effect, but why would it be 10%?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the genes are in a pathway where G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. Then:\n\n- g2: no G2 \u2192 no G1 \u2192 no G3 \u2192 0%\n- g1: G2 is active, so G1 is turned on, but G1 is knocked out \u2192 no G3. So resistance comes from G2's function? If G2 has a minor role, maybe 10%? But data shows g1 has 75%. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption D says G1 and G3 show redundancy. So their combined loss is worse than either alone. The data supports that (g1g3 is 10% vs 75 and 50). \n\nAlso, G2 is a transcription factor. So it's upstream of G1 and G3. \n\nThe question states that at least one is a TF acting upstream of others. \n\nIn the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is already knocked out (which is upstream), removing G1 doesn't change the outcome (still 0%), meaning G2 is epistatic over G1. Similarly for g2g3. \n\nSo G2 is epistatic over both, meaning it's upstream. \n\nThe option D says G1 is epistatic over G3. Wait, epistasis here would mean that G1's presence affects G3's effect. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the redundancy means that G1 and G3 can both contribute to the same pathway. So if one is missing, the other can compensate. But their combined loss removes both, leading to much lower resistance. \n\nThe question's options: \n\nOption D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic to G3. \n\nEpistatic here would mean that G1's presence affects G3's function. Maybe G1's product is required for G3's product to function. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't contribute. But then in the g3 mutant, G1 is still present, so resistance would be from G1. \n\nWait, in the data, g3 has 50% resistance, which would be from G1's contribution. But in the g1 mutant, resistance is 75%, which would be from G3's contribution. That suggests that G3 contributes more than G1. \n\nIf they are redundant, their combined contribution is additive. So G1 (50%) + G3 (75%) would give 125%, but that's over 100%, so maybe they have overlapping functions. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis part: If G1 is epistatic over G3, then G1's presence affects G3's effect. Maybe when G1 is present, G3's contribution is masked. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can act, but only contributes 75%? That would explain why g1 has 75% (G3 alone) and g3 has 50% (G1 alone). \n\nIn the double mutant g1g3, neither is present, so no resistance except maybe from G2's own function (10%). \n\nThis would fit option D's description. \n\nWait, but the question says G2 is the TF. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. \n\nSo the hierarchy is G2 \u2192 G1 and G3, with G1 and G3 being redundant but epistatic in some way. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n- G2 is necessary (as its knockout gives 0%)\n- The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0%, showing G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3. \n- The single mutants' resistance levels suggest that G1 and G3 have different contributions. \n- The double mutant g1g3's low resistance (10%) suggests their redundancy. \n\nOption D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined loss is worse), and G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nThe epistasis part might mean that G1's presence suppresses G3's effect. So when G1 is present, G3's contribution is not needed, but when G1 is missing, G3 can take over. But then why does the g3 mutant have lower resistance than g1? \n\nIf G1's contribution is higher than G3's, then:\n\n- g1 (no G1) \u2192 resistance comes from G3 \u2192 50% (but data says 75%)\nWait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G3's contribution is higher. If G3 alone gives 75% (as in g1), and G1 alone gives 50% (as in g3), then they are not fully redundant but have some overlapping function. \n\nThe epistasis part (G1 epistatic over G3) could mean that when G1 is present, it enhances or is required for G3's function. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can still function but less effectively. But this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis might be that G1 is required for G3 to function. So in g3 mutant (no G3), you still have G1's contribution (50%). But in g1 mutant (no G1), G3 can't function, so resistance is from G2's own function? But then why would that be 75%? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the epistasis might be that G1's presence masks G3's effect. For example, if G3's product is only active when G1 is not present. But that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"epistatic towards\" in the options refers to the direction. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1's presence determines the expression or activity of G3. \n\nGiven that the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the best fit is D. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (so their combined knockout is worse), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. \n\nThe redundancy explains the 10% in g1g3. \n\nThe epistasis might mean that G1's presence affects G3's contribution. For example, if G1 is present, it enhances G3's effect. But when G1 is missing, G3 can still contribute but less so. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the epistasis is that G1's function is required for G3's function, so when G1 is knocked out, G3 can't contribute, leading to lower resistance (75% comes from G2's own function?). But I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. This redundancy is a sign of overlapping functions. \n\nThe fact that G2 is a TF that's upstream of both fits with the data. \n\nThe epistatic part in D is G1 epistatic to G3. Since when you have g1 (no G1), the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%, this might mean that G1's presence suppresses G3's contribution, or vice versa. \n\nWait, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the effect of G3 is masked by G1. So when G1 is present (wild type), G3's contribution is not needed, so G3's knockout (g3) only loses 50% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 can now contribute, but only gives 75% resistance. \n\nThis would fit the data. So:\n\n- In wild type, G1 is present, so G3's effect is masked. So losing G3 (g3) only reduces resistance by 50% (since G1 is still active). \n\n- In g1 (no G1), G3 can now contribute, giving 75% resistance. \n\n- In g1g3 (both knocked out), no contribution from either, so only G2's own effect (10%). \n\nThis would mean that G1 is epistatic over G3. \n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice. \n\nThe other options don't fit as well. \n\nOption C says G1 is epistatic over G3 but G1 and G3 have pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is not directly relevant here. \n\nOption A and B involve G1 as TF or same promoter, which doesn't fit the data. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n\nThe experiment's results indicate that G2 is crucial for resistance, as its knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor upstream of other genes. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming G2's epistatic role over G1 and G3. The g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance) is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%), indicating redundancy between G1 and G3. The resistance levels in single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) suggest overlapping but distinct contributions. Since G1's absence allows G3 to contribute less effectively, G1 is epistatic toward G3. This aligns with option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
