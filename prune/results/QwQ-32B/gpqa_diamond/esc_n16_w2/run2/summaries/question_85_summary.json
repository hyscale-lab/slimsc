      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The question gives me their masses and radii, and mentions that both have the same albedo. The options are numerical values, so I need to calculate T1_eq / T2_eq or vice versa.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = [(L/(16 * \u03c0 * \u03c3 * a\u00b2)) * (1 - A)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a is the orbital distance, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term cancels out in the ratio, so I don't need to worry about that part.\n\nThe key variables here are the star's luminosity and the orbital distance of each planet. But how do I get the orbital distances from the given data? The problem mentions that both planets were detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The radial velocity (RV) method's data gives information about the planet's mass and orbital period, but here they give the Doppler shift induced by each planet. The shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. Wait, the Doppler shift amplitude relates to the planet's mass and orbital distance. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) caused by a planet is given by K = (G(M_p) sin i)/(2\u03c0) * (P/(M_* (1 + m_p/M_*) ))^(1/3) * something... Hmm, maybe I need to recall the formula more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift amplitude relates to the planet's orbital velocity as seen from Earth. Since the shift is due to the star's motion towards/away from us caused by the planet's gravity. The maximum radial velocity of the star (K) is given by K = (G(M_p) sin i)/(2\u03c0) * (P/(M_* (1 + m_p/M_*)))^(1/3) * ... Wait, maybe there's a simpler way here. \n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is related to the velocity. The maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for the Doppler shift in terms of velocity is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. Here, the problem states the shift in angstroms. The forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the shift is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. So the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6. That would correspond to a velocity of v = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1, the maximum velocity K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 /6300)*c. \n\nThe K values (the star's velocity semi-amplitude) depend on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the orbital distance. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (G(M_p) sin i)/(2\u03c0) * (P/(M_* (1 + m_p/M_*)))^(1/3) \n\nWait, maybe it's better to recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (P^(-1/3))... but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are in circular orbits and we can assume that the inclination i is the same for both (since both are detected by RV and transit methods, which require inclination near 90 degrees for transit, so maybe sin i is 1 for both?), so maybe the ratio of K1 and K2 can be related to their masses and orbital periods?\n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + m_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3) \n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planets (since M_p is in Earth masses, and M_* is 1.5 solar masses), the term (1 + m_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So simplifying:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0) * ( P / (M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut since we don't know the orbital periods, maybe we can relate the K values through their relation to orbital distance. Alternatively, perhaps using Kepler's third law to relate the orbital period and semi-major axis.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature also depends on the orbital distance a. The equilibrium temperature formula can be written as:\n\nT_eq \u221d ( L_*(1 - A) / (a\u00b2) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince L* is the star's luminosity, which we can compute from its radius and temperature. The star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 Teff^4. \n\nSo, L* is proportional to R_*\u00b2 Teff^4. The problem gives the star's radius as 1.2 R_sun, Teff 6300 K vs the Sun's Teff (which is about 5778 K). So the star's luminosity compared to the Sun would be (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778)^4. But perhaps when taking the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the two planets, the L* cancels out? Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio between the two planets would be:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = [ (L*(1 - A)/a1\u00b2 ) / ( L*(1 - A)/a2\u00b2 ) ]^(1/4) \n\nSince (1 - A) is the same for both, so that cancels. So the ratio becomes (a2/a1)^0.5. Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\nT_eq1^4 = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) * (1 - A)/a1\u00b2 \n\nT_eq2^4 = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) * (1 - A)/a2\u00b2 \n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ( (1/a1\u00b2) / (1/a2\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to (a2 / a1)^(1/2). So the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq is sqrt(a2/a1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if T1 is proportional to (1/a1)^0.5 and T2 proportional to (1/a2)^0.5, then T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, to find T1/T2, I need the square root of (a2/a1). So I need the ratio of the orbital distances of the two planets. \n\nSo how do I get a1 and a2 from the given data? The problem mentions that the RV method gives the Doppler shifts (K1 and K2). So the K values are related to the orbital parameters.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 ) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + m_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both (since both are transiting, so inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1), and since m_p is much less than M_*, the denominator term (1 + m_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p / (2 \u03c0)) * ( P / M_* )^(1/3 )\n\nBut we can rearrange Kepler's third law to relate P and a. Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G (M_* + M_p)) ) a\u00b3. Again, since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* )) a\u00b3 \u2192 P = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* ))^(1/2) ) * a^(3/2 )\n\nSubstituting this into the K equation:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( [ ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* ))^(1/2) ) * a^(3/2) ) / M_* ] )^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, that's getting complicated. Let's see if we can find K in terms of a and M_p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write K proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (a)^(-1/2). Let's see:\n\nLet me think of Kepler's third law first. The orbital period P is related to a via P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G\u207b\u00b9 (M_* + M_p))\u207b\u00b9 a\u00b3. Since M_p << M_*, this becomes P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*). So P = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*) )^(1/2 )\n\nPlugging this into the K expression:\n\nK = (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( P / ( M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, the original K formula was:\n\nK = (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( P / ( M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me rederive the K formula.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3 ) * something?\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, let's consider that K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) divided by M_*^(2/3). Wait, perhaps there's a simpler proportionality.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that both K and a are related through the planet's mass and the star's mass. Let's see:\n\nWe can write K as proportional to (M_p) * sqrt(G/(M_*)) ) / (a^(1/2)) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1/K2 in terms of their masses and orbital distances.\n\nLet me denote K1 and K2 as the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets. Let me write the equation for K for each planet:\n\nK1 = (G M_p1 sin i) / (2 \u03c0) * ( P1^3 / ( M_*^3 (1 + m_p1/M_* )^3 ) )^(1/3) \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use Kepler's third law and the RV formula to find the relationship between K and a.\n\nLet me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( P^2 (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K in terms of a and M_p:\n\nThe formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( (P^2 a^3)/(G (M_* + M_p)) )^(1/2) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should look up the formula again mentally. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital distance. Let me see:\n\nThe acceleration of the star due to the planet's gravity is a = G M_p / a\u00b2. The centripetal acceleration of the star is a = (v\u00b2)/a, so v\u00b2/a = G M_p / a\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). But the velocity v here is the velocity of the star in its orbit around the center of mass. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, the center of mass is very close to the star's center, so the star's velocity is approximately v = sqrt( G (M_p) / a ). But the radial velocity K is the maximum velocity (since it's sinusoidal), so K \u2248 v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nWait, that might be an approximation. Let me check this. \n\nAlternatively, using Newton's version of Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to a\u00b3/(M_* + M_p). Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, this is approximately a\u00b3/M_*. \n\nThe star's velocity in its orbit is v = 2\u03c0 a_star / P, where a_star is the star's distance from the center of mass. The center of mass is at a distance a_p * M_p / (M_* + M_p) from the star, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Since M_p << M_*, this is approximately a_p * M_p / M_*. So a_star \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a_p. \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity is v = 2\u03c0 ( (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / P. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is this v, so:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G (M_* + M_p)) ) \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) \n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) )\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) ) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nsqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3/(G M_*)) ) = (2 \u03c0 a_p^(3/2)) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) )\n\nSo K = [ 2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ] / [ 2 \u03c0 a_p^(3/2) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) ) ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 cancels. The a_p terms: a_p divided by a_p^(3/2) is a_p^(-1/2). \n\nSo:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_* ) * a_p / ( a_p^(3/2) ) * ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) )\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: (M_p/M_*) * a_p \n\nDenominator: [a_p^(3/2) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSo overall:\n\nK = [ (M_p / M_*) * a_p ] * [ (G M_*)^(1/2) / a_p^(3/2) ) ]\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nThe a_p terms: a_p / a_p^(3/2) = a_p^(-1/2)\n\nThe M terms: (M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^(1/2) ) = M_p / ( M_*^(1/2) )\n\nSo:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_*^(1/2) ) * ( G^(1/2) ) * a_p^(-1/2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nK = sqrt( G ) * M_p / sqrt(M_*) * (1/ sqrt(a_p) )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nK = ( M_p / sqrt(M_*) ) * sqrt(G) / sqrt(a_p )\n\nSo solving for a_p:\n\nsqrt(a_p) = ( M_p / sqrt(M_*) ) * sqrt(G) / K \n\nSquare both sides:\n\na_p = ( M_p\u00b2 / M_* ) * G / K\u00b2 \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, let me rearrange the K equation again. Let me write it as:\n\nK = sqrt(G) * M_p / sqrt(M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a_p) )\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(a_p):\n\nK sqrt(a_p) = sqrt(G) M_p / sqrt(M_*) \n\nThen square both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 a_p = G M_p\u00b2 / M_* \n\nThus,\n\na_p = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K\u00b2 )\n\nSo this gives a_p in terms of the planet's mass, star's mass, and K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). \n\nTherefore, for each planet, their orbital distances a1 and a2 are given by:\n\na1 = ( G M_p1\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K1\u00b2 )\n\na2 = ( G M_p2\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K2\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a1 is:\n\n( G M_p2\u00b2 / ( M_* K2\u00b2 ) ) / ( G M_p1\u00b2 / ( M_* K1\u00b2 ) ) \n\nThe G and M_* terms cancel out, so:\n\na2/a1 = ( M_p2\u00b2 / M_p1\u00b2 ) * ( K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 = ( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 ) * ( (K1/K2)^2 )\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n\nK1 (for Planet1) is the shift of 0.03 \u00c5. Wait, but K is in terms of velocity. Wait, the problem states that the Doppler shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5. Earlier, I thought that the Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb is v/c. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5\". So the maximum Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb) is 0.03 \u00c5. The rest wavelength is 6300 \u00c5. \n\nThe velocity corresponding to this shift is v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). So:\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300)*c. \n\nThese velocities v1 and v2 are the K values (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). So K1 = v1, K2 = v2. \n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = (0.03/6300)/(0.04/6300) ) = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 3/4. \n\nSo (K1/K2)^2 = (9/16). \n\nNow, M_p2/M_p1 is (5/7), so squared is (25/49). \n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a1 is (25/49) * (9/16) = (25 *9)/(49 *16) \n\nCalculate that:\n\n25 *9 = 225\n\n49 *16 = 784\n\n225/784 \u2248 0.287 \n\nWait, but that gives a2/a1 \u2248 0.287, so the square root of that is sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. \n\nWait, because the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), right? Wait, earlier we had T1_eq / T2_eq = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, so the ratio T1/T2 would be approximately 0.536. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because I might have messed up the direction of the ratio. Let's see:\n\nWait, the formula was T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_eq ~ (1/a)^0.5, so if a2 is smaller than a1, then T1 (which is at a1) would be colder than T2? Wait, no, let's think again. \n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(L/a\u00b2)^(1/2) \u2192 sqrt(L/(a\u00b2))^(1/2) \u2192 (L/a\u00b2)^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5. So if a1 is larger than a2 (meaning Planet1 is farther out), then T1 would be lower than T2. \n\nBut according to the ratio a2/a1, if a2/a1 is 0.287, that means a2 is smaller than a1, so Planet2 is closer to the star, so its equilibrium temperature is higher than Planet1. Therefore, T1/T2 would be less than 1. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 0.536, so the answer would be C, ~0.53. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the a2/a1 calculation. \n\nGiven:\n\na2/a1 = ( (M_p2/M_p1)^2 ) * ( (K1/K2)^2 )\n\nM_p2 is 5, M_p1 is 7 \u2192 (5/7)^2 = 25/49\n\nK1/K2 is 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \u2192 (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nWait, 25/49 * 0.5625 \n\n25/49 is approx 0.5102, multiplied by 0.5625 gives approx 0.5102 * 0.5625 \u2248 0.287 \n\nYes, so a2/a1 is ~0.287, so sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, which is approximately 0.54, so closest to option C (0.53). \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05. So C is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the equilibrium temperature. Let me recheck that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSo if you take the ratio T1 / T2:\n\n(T1 / T2)^4 = ( L (1 - A)/a1\u00b2 ) / ( L (1 - A)/a2\u00b2 ) = (a2\u00b2 / a1\u00b2 )\n\nSo (T1/T2)^4 = (a2/a1)^2 \u2192 T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The question gives me their masses and radii, and mentions that both have the same albedo. The options are numerical values, so I need to calculate T1_eq / T2_eq or vice versa.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = [(L/(16 * \u03c0 * \u03c3 * a\u00b2)) * (1 - A)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a is the orbital distance, and A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term cancels out in the ratio, so I don't need to worry about that part.\n\nThe key variables here are the star's luminosity and the orbital distance of each planet. But how do I get the orbital distances from the given data? The problem mentions that both planets were detected using transit and radial velocity methods.

Hmm, maybe I need to recall the formula more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift amplitude relates to the planet's orbital velocity as seen from Earth. Since the shift is due to the star's motion towards/away from us caused by the planet's gravity. The maximum radial velocity of the star (K) is given by K = (G(M_p) sin i)/(2\u03c0) * (P/(M_* (1 + m_p/M_*)))^(1/3) * ... Wait, maybe there's a simpler way here. \n\nAlternatively, the Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) is related to the velocity. The maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for the Doppler shift in terms of velocity is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. Here, the problem states the shift in angstroms. The forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5, so the shift is 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. So the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 \u2248 4.76e-6. That would correspond to a velocity of v = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) * c. \n\nSo for Planet1, the maximum velocity K1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 /6300)*c. \n\nThe K values (the star's velocity semi-amplitude) depend on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the orbital distance. The formula for K is:\n\nK = (G(M_p) sin i)/(2\u03c0) * (P/(M_* (1 + m_p/M_*)))^(1/3) \n\nWait, maybe it's better to recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (P^(-1/3))... but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are in circular orbits and we can assume that the inclination i is the same for both (since both are detected by RV and transit methods, which require inclination near 90 degrees for transit, so maybe sin i is 1 for both?), so maybe the ratio of K1 and K2 can be related to their masses and orbital periods?\n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + m_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3) \n\nBut since the star's mass is much larger than the planets (since M_p is in Earth masses, and M_* is 1.5 solar masses), the term (1 + m_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So simplifying:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0) * ( P / (M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nBut since we don't know the orbital periods, maybe we can relate the K values through their relation to orbital distance. Alternatively, perhaps using Kepler's third law to relate the orbital period and semi-major axis.\n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature also depends on the orbital distance a. The equilibrium temperature formula can be written as:\n\nT_eq \u221d ( L_*(1 - A) / (a\u00b2) )^(1/4 )\n\nSince L* is the star's luminosity, which we can compute from its radius and temperature. The star's luminosity L = 4\u03c0 R_*\u00b2 \u03c3 Teff^4. \n\nSo, L* is proportional to R_*\u00b2 Teff^4. The problem gives the star's radius as 1.2 R_sun, Teff 6300 K vs the Sun's Teff (which is about 5778 K). So the star's luminosity compared to the Sun would be (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778)^4. But perhaps when taking the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the two planets, the L* cancels out? Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio between the two planets would be:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = [ (L*(1 - A)/a1\u00b2 ) / ( L*(1 - A)/a2\u00b2 ) ]^(1/4) \n\nSince (1 - A) is the same for both, so that cancels. So the ratio becomes (a2/a1)^0.5. Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me write it step by step:\n\nT_eq1^4 = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) * (1 - A)/a1\u00b2 \n\nT_eq2^4 = (L/(16\u03c0\u03c3)) * (1 - A)/a2\u00b2 \n\nSo T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ( (1/a1\u00b2) / (1/a2\u00b2) )^(1/4) ) \n\nWhich simplifies to (a2 / a1)^(1/2). So the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). Therefore, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq is sqrt(a2/a1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if T1 is proportional to (1/a1)^0.5 and T2 proportional to (1/a2)^0.5, then T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^0.5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, to find T1/T2, I need the square root of (a2/a1). So I need the ratio of the orbital distances of the two planets. \n\nSo how do I get a1 and a2 from the given data? The problem mentions that the RV method gives the Doppler shifts (K1 and K2). So the K values are related to the orbital parameters.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 ) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + m_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3 )\n\nAssuming sin i is the same for both (since both are transiting, so inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1), and since m_p is much less than M_*, the denominator term (1 + m_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p / (2 \u03c0)) * ( P / M_* )^(1/3 )\n\nBut we can rearrange Kepler's third law to relate P and a. Kepler's third law: P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G (M_* + M_p)) ) a\u00b3. Again, since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* )) a\u00b3 \u2192 P = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* ))^(1/2) ) * a^(3/2 )\n\nSubstituting this into the K equation:\n\nK \u2248 (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( [ ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 / (G M_* ))^(1/2) ) * a^(3/2) ) / M_* ] )^(1/3 )\n\nHmm, that's getting complicated. Let's see if we can find K in terms of a and M_p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write K proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (a)^(-1/2). Let's see:\n\nLet me think of Kepler's third law first. The orbital period P is related to a via P\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2 G\u207b\u00b9 (M_* + M_p))\u207b\u00b9 a\u00b3. Since M_p << M_*, this becomes P\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*). So P = ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3)/(G M_*) )^(1/2 )\n\nPlugging this into the K expression:\n\nK = (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( P / ( M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, the original K formula was:\n\nK = (G M_p / (2 \u03c0 )) * ( P / ( M_* ) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me rederive the K formula.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( P / ( M_* (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) )^(1/3 ) * something?\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, let's consider that K is proportional to (M_p) * (a)^(-1/2) divided by M_*^(2/3). Wait, perhaps there's a simpler proportionality.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that both K and a are related through the planet's mass and the star's mass. Let's see:\n\nWe can write K as proportional to (M_p) * sqrt(G/(M_*)) ) / (a^(1/2)) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of K1/K2 in terms of their masses and orbital distances.\n\nLet me denote K1 and K2 as the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets. Let me write the equation for K for each planet:\n\nK1 = (G M_p1 sin i) / (2 \u03c0) * ( P1^3 / ( M_*^3 (1 + m_p1/M_* )^3 ) )^(1/3) \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use Kepler's third law and the RV formula to find the relationship between K and a.\n\nLet me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( P^2 (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3 )\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K in terms of a and M_p:\n\nThe formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / (2 \u03c0 a) ) * ( (P^2 a^3)/(G (M_* + M_p)) )^(1/2) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe I should look up the formula again mentally. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that:\n\nThe radial velocity K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital distance. Let me see:\n\nThe acceleration of the star due to the planet's gravity is a = G M_p / a\u00b2. The centripetal acceleration of the star is a = (v\u00b2)/a, so v\u00b2/a = G M_p / a\u00b2 \u2192 v\u00b2 = G M_p /a \u2192 v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). But the velocity v here is the velocity of the star in its orbit around the center of mass. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, the center of mass is very close to the star's center, so the star's velocity is approximately v = sqrt( G (M_p) / a ). But the radial velocity K is the maximum velocity (since it's sinusoidal), so K \u2248 v = sqrt( G M_p / a ). \n\nWait, that might be an approximation. Let me check this. \n\nAlternatively, using Newton's version of Kepler's third law, the orbital period squared is proportional to a\u00b3/(M_* + M_p). Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, this is approximately a\u00b3/M_*. \n\nThe star's velocity in its orbit is v = 2\u03c0 a_star / P, where a_star is the star's distance from the center of mass. The center of mass is at a distance a_p * M_p / (M_* + M_p) from the star, where a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Since M_p << M_*, this is approximately a_p * M_p / M_*. So a_star \u2248 (M_p/M_*) a_p. \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity is v = 2\u03c0 ( (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / P. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is this v, so:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / P \n\nBut from Kepler's third law, P\u00b2 = (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G (M_* + M_p)) ) \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) \n\nSo P = sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) )\n\nSubstituting back into K:\n\nK = (2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ) / sqrt( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3)/(G M_*) ) )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nsqrt(4 \u03c0\u00b2 a_p\u00b3/(G M_*)) ) = (2 \u03c0 a_p^(3/2)) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) )\n\nSo K = [ 2 \u03c0 (M_p/M_*) a_p ] / [ 2 \u03c0 a_p^(3/2) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) ) ) ]\n\nThe 2 \u03c0 cancels. The a_p terms: a_p divided by a_p^(3/2) is a_p^(-1/2). \n\nSo:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_* ) * a_p / ( a_p^(3/2) ) * ( G M_* )^(1/2 ) )\n\nWait let me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator: (M_p/M_*) * a_p \n\nDenominator: [a_p^(3/2) / ( (G M_*)^(1/2) ) ]\n\nSo overall:\n\nK = [ (M_p / M_*) * a_p ] * [ (G M_*)^(1/2) / a_p^(3/2) ) ]\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nThe a_p terms: a_p / a_p^(3/2) = a_p^(-1/2)\n\nThe M terms: (M_p / M_*) * (M_*)^(1/2) ) = M_p / ( M_*^(1/2) )\n\nSo:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_*^(1/2) ) * ( G^(1/2) ) * a_p^(-1/2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nK = sqrt( G ) * M_p / sqrt(M_*) * (1/ sqrt(a_p) )\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nK = ( M_p / sqrt(M_*) ) * sqrt(G) / sqrt(a_p )\n\nSo solving for a_p:\n\nsqrt(a_p) = ( M_p / sqrt(M_*) ) * sqrt(G) / K \n\nSquare both sides:\n\na_p = ( M_p\u00b2 / M_* ) * G / K\u00b2 \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, let me rearrange the K equation again. Let me write it as:\n\nK = sqrt(G) * M_p / sqrt(M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a_p) )\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(a_p):\n\nK sqrt(a_p) = sqrt(G) M_p / sqrt(M_*) \n\nThen square both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 a_p = G M_p\u00b2 / M_* \n\nThus,\n\na_p = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K\u00b2 )\n\nSo this gives a_p in terms of the planet's mass, star's mass, and K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). \n\nTherefore, for each planet, their orbital distances a1 and a2 are given by:\n\na1 = ( G M_p1\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K1\u00b2 )\n\na2 = ( G M_p2\u00b2 ) / ( M_* K2\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a1 is:\n\n( G M_p2\u00b2 / ( M_* K2\u00b2 ) ) / ( G M_p1\u00b2 / ( M_* K1\u00b2 ) ) \n\nThe G and M_* terms cancel out, so:\n\na2/a1 = ( M_p2\u00b2 / M_p1\u00b2 ) * ( K1\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 )\n\nSo the ratio a2/a1 = ( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 ) * ( (K1/K2)^2 )\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers:\n\nM_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n\nM_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n\nK1 (for Planet1) is the shift of 0.03 \u00c5. Wait, but K is in terms of velocity. Wait, the problem states that the Doppler shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5. Earlier, I thought that the Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb is v/c. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5\". So the maximum Doppler shift (\u0394\u03bb) is 0.03 \u00c5. The rest wavelength is 6300 \u00c5. \n\nThe velocity corresponding to this shift is v = c*(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb). So:\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nSimilarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300)*c. \n\nThese velocities v1 and v2 are the K values (the radial velocity semi-amplitude). So K1 = v1, K2 = v2. \n\nTherefore, K1/K2 = (0.03/6300)/(0.04/6300) ) = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \n\nSo K1/K2 = 3/4. \n\nSo (K1/K2)^2 = (9/16). \n\nNow, M_p2/M_p1 is (5/7), so squared is (25/49). \n\nTherefore, the ratio a2/a1 is (25/49) * (9/16) = (25 *9)/(49 *16) \n\nCalculate that:\n\n25 *9 = 225\n\n49 *16 = 784\n\n225/784 \u2248 0.287 \n\nWait, but that gives a2/a1 \u2248 0.287, so the square root of that is sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. \n\nWait, because the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), right? Wait, earlier we had T1_eq / T2_eq = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nSo sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, so the ratio T1/T2 would be approximately 0.536. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because I might have messed up the direction of the ratio. Let's see:\n\nWait, the formula was T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nBecause T_eq ~ (1/a)^0.5, so if a2 is smaller than a1, then T1 (which is at a1) would be colder than T2? Wait, no, let's think again. \n\nWait, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(L/a\u00b2)^(1/2) \u2192 sqrt(L/(a\u00b2))^(1/2) \u2192 (L/a\u00b2)^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/a)^0.5. So if a1 is larger than a2 (meaning Planet1 is farther out), then T1 would be lower than T2. \n\nBut according to the ratio a2/a1, if a2/a1 is 0.287, that means a2 is smaller than a1, so Planet2 is closer to the star, so its equilibrium temperature is higher than Planet1. Therefore, T1/T2 would be less than 1. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 0.536, so the answer would be C, ~0.53. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check the a2/a1 calculation. \n\nGiven:\n\na2/a1 = ( (M_p2/M_p1)^2 ) * ( (K1/K2)^2 )\n\nM_p2 is 5, M_p1 is 7 \u2192 (5/7)^2 = 25/49\n\nK1/K2 is 0.03/0.04 = 0.75 \u2192 (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 \n\nWait, 25/49 * 0.5625 \n\n25/49 is approx 0.5102, multiplied by 0.5625 gives approx 0.5102 * 0.5625 \u2248 0.287 \n\nYes, so a2/a1 is ~0.287, so sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, which is approximately 0.54, so closest to option C (0.53). \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05. So C is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the equilibrium temperature. Let me recheck that. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 \u03c0 \u03c3 a\u00b2) ]^(1/4 )\n\nSo if you take the ratio T1 / T2:\n\n(T1 / T2)^4 = ( L (1 - A)/a1\u00b2 ) / ( L (1 - A)/a2\u00b2 ) = (a2\u00b2 / a1\u00b2 )\n\nSo (T1/T2)^4 = (a2/a1)^2 \u2192 T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets depends on their orbital distances from the star. Using the radial velocity (RV) method data, the orbital distances \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) can be related through the Doppler shifts and planet masses. The formula for the orbital distance \\(a\\) derived from the RV semi-amplitude \\(K\\) is \\(a \\propto \\frac{M_p^2}{K^2}\\). \n\nFor Planet1 and Planet2:\n- \\(M_{p1} = 7\\) Earth masses, \\(M_{p2} = 5\\) Earth masses\n- \\(K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\), \\(K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\)\n\nThe ratio of orbital distances is:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{5^2}{7^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.03^2}{0.04^2} \\right) = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784} \\approx 0.287\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{1,\\text{eq}}}{T_{2,\\text{eq}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.287} \\approx 0.536\n\\]\n\nThis value is closest to option **C (0.53)**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The options are ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I need to recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. The formula is usually something like T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, actually, the exact formula might be T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) or maybe I'm mixing up the terms here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature can be expressed using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L/L_sun)^(1/4)? Or wait, maybe the standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/4 )^(1/4). Wait, perhaps I should write the standard formula properly.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^(1/4) \n\nWait, maybe another approach. The equilibrium temperature formula is derived by balancing the incoming stellar energy with the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the standard formula. \n\nThe standard formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWait, actually, another way: The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula can also be written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^(1/4) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should start from the basic derivation. \n\nThe energy received by the planet is L*(R_p)^2/(4a\u00b2), but considering albedo A, the absorbed flux is F_abs = (1 - A) * L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). The planet radiates as a blackbody, so its effective temperature T_eq satisfies \u03c3 T_eq^4 = F_abs. \n\nThe star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4. \n\nPutting this into the equation for T_eq:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = (1 - A) * (4\u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4)/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1/(4\u03c0))? Wait, no, maybe better step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nThe absorbed flux F_abs = (1 - A) * L / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen, the outgoing flux is \u03c3 T_eq^4. Since the planet radiates over its surface area 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2, the energy balance is:\n\n(1 - A) * L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 / 4 ?\n\nWait, maybe better:\n\nThe incoming power is F_abs * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (the cross-sectional area). The outgoing power is \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (the surface area). So equate them:\n\n(1 - A) * (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - A) L R_p\u00b2/(4a\u00b2)\n\nRight side: 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 R_p\u00b2 \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the areas. Let me try again:\n\nThe incoming flux is F = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2). The power absorbed is F * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 * (1 - A).\n\nThe outgoing power is \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (since the surface area is 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2).\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n(1 - A) * (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nCancel R_p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(1 - A) * L/(4a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \u03c0 \n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the left side after cancellation is (1 - A) * L/(4a\u00b2) * \u03c0 * R_p\u00b2 / \u03c0 R_p\u00b2? Wait, maybe I need to check the algebra again.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step again.\n\nIncoming power (absorbed) is:\n\nP_in = F * (cross-sectional area) * (1 - A) = [L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 * (1 - A)\n\nOutgoing power is:\n\nP_out = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * (surface area) = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nSet P_in = P_out:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (1 - A) = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: L * R_p\u00b2 (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nRight side: 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 R_p\u00b2 \n\nCancel R_p\u00b2 terms from both sides:\n\nL (1 - A)/(4 a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nSo solving for T_eq^4:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 ) \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nWait, after cancelling R_p\u00b2, the equation is:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 (1 - A) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nWait, because the R_p\u00b2 cancels out. Let me see:\n\nLeft side after cancelling R_p\u00b2:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 (1 - A) = [ L (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nRight side after cancelling R_p\u00b2:\n\n4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nL (1 - A)/(4 a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThen, solving for T_eq^4:\n\nT_eq^4 = L (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 ) \n\nWait, that's L*(1 - A) divided by (4 a\u00b2 *4 \u03c0 \u03c3). Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I missed a factor. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express L in terms of the star's parameters. Since L = 4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4, substituting that into the equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4 * (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 *4 \u03c0 \u03c3) )\n\nWait, let me plug L into T_eq^4 equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - A) ] / ( 4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 )\n\nSo substituting L:\n\n= [ (4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4) (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe 4 \u03c0 cancels with the denominator's 4 \u03c0, and \u03c3 cancels with \u03c3 in the numerator and denominator. So:\n\n= [ R_Star\u00b2 T_Star^4 (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen,\n\nT_eq^4 = [ R_Star\u00b2 T_Star^4 (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen,\n\nT_eq = T_Star * R_Star / (2 a )^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake the 4th root of both sides:\n\nT_eq = T_Star * ( R_Star / (2a) )^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nAh, okay. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (R_Star/(2a))^(1/2) multiplied by (1 - A)^(1/4) and T_Star. \n\nNow, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will depend on the other factors. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq. \n\nLet me write the formula for each:\n\nT1_eq = T_Star * sqrt( R_Star/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nT2_eq = T_Star * sqrt( R_Star/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nSince (1 - A) is the same, when taking the ratio, it cancels out. Also, T_Star and R_Star are the same for both planets. \n\nThus, the ratio becomes:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = sqrt( (R_Star/(2 a1)) / (R_Star/(2 a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, sqrt(a2/a1) ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe ratio of T1_eq / T2_eq is sqrt( (R_Star/(2a1)) / (R_Star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )\n\nYes, because R_Star cancels, the 2s cancel, so the ratio inside the sqrt is a2/a1. So the ratio of the temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nWait, but that would mean that if Planet1 is closer (a1 < a2), then T1 would be higher. \n\nBut to find the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq, it's sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nTherefore, we need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. \n\nHmm, how do we get the orbital distances from the given information?\n\nThe problem mentions that both planets were detected via transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The radial velocity method gives the minimum mass (since sin i is involved), but here they state the mass directly, so perhaps we can assume that the inclination is such that the masses are as given. Also, since the orbits are circular, maybe that's important. \n\nThe key data given for each planet is the Doppler shift caused by their gravitational pull on the star. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. For Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nThe Doppler shift in the radial velocity method relates to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a) / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nWait, no, the standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (G M_p / (4 \u03c0\u00b2))^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps better to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (sin i) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, that's complicated. Alternatively, the standard formula is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to recall that K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^1.5 a^(3/2) )^(1/3) )) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of Kepler's third law. \n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. The formula is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^1.5 ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 / P ) * a )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the relation between K and the orbital parameters. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (a)^3 )^(1/2) )^(1/3) ) * (a / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use the relation between K and the planet's orbital elements. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for a circular orbit (e=0), and assuming sin i =1 (so we're seeing the orbit edge-on), then the formula simplifies. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (a)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ) ?\n\nHmm, I think I need a better approach. Let's look up the formula for K in terms of a and M_p. \n\nThe standard formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = (G / (2 \u03c0))^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0)^2 a^3 / P^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, that seems a bit tangled. Let me try to find a better way. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law in terms of the star's mass and the semi-major axis:\n\n( P^2 ) / a^3 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G (M_star + M_p) )\n\nAssuming that M_p << M_star (since the planets are Earth-like and the star is 1.5 solar masses), so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nThus,\n\nP\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_star )\n\n=> a\u00b3 \u2248 ( G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut how does this relate to K?\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (a)^2 (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P) )^( something ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me recall that:\n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity is given by v = (2 \u03c0 a sin i / P ) * ( M_p / (3 M_star ) )^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\nK = (v_earth) * (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is better expressed as:\n\nK = ( (G / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (2 \u03c0 / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to think in terms of the relation between K, a, and M_p. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ (a^(3/2)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of units. \n\nThe radial velocity K has units of velocity (km/s or similar). The Doppler shift given here is in \u00c5, but since the wavelength of the line is given, we can relate the shift to velocity via the Doppler formula. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb \u2248 v / c, where v is the velocity, c is the speed of light. \n\nThe problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5. So the velocity semi-amplitude K1 for Planet1 is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c. \n\nWait, that's important. Since the question gives the Doppler shift in \u00c5, we can compute the velocity from that. \n\nYes, exactly! The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. \n\nThe formula for the velocity shift (radial velocity) is:\n\nv = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c \n\nTherefore, K (the semi-amplitude) is this velocity. \n\nSo, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5 ) * c \n\nK2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c \n\nSo, the ratio of K2/K1 is (0.04/0.03) \u2248 1.333. \n\nSo K2 is 4/3 times K1. \n\nNow, we need to relate K to the orbital parameters. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a ) )^(1/ something ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )) )^(1/3) * ( ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / a^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(2/3) ) ) \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me use the formula for K derived from Kepler's law. \n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1 / a )^(2/3) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(2/3) ) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the standard expression. \n\nThe standard formula for K is:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (a)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm better off using the formula from the radial velocity method. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( 1 / a )^(2/3) ) * ( ( 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / P\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ) ?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in the case where M_p << M_star (since the planets are Earth-mass and the star is 1.5 solar masses), then M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) * ( ... ) ?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a circular orbit, and using Kepler's third law, we can express a in terms of K, M_p, and M_star. \n\nLet me try to derive the relation between K and a. \n\nThe radial velocity K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. \n\nUsing Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal acceleration:\n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is G M_star M_p / a\u00b2 = M_p v_p\u00b2 / a \n\nWhere v_p is the orbital speed of the planet. \n\nThe star also orbits the center of mass, so its velocity v_\u2605 is related to the planet's velocity v_p by:\n\nv_\u2605 / v_p = M_p / M_star \n\nBecause the center of mass is given by M_p a_p = M_\u2605 a_\u2605, so a_\u2605 = (M_p / (M_\u2605 + M_p )) a_p \u2248 (M_p / M_\u2605 ) a_p \n\nSince a_p is the planet's orbital radius (assuming the star is at the center, which is approximately true since M_\u2605 >> M_p). \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity v_\u2605 = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) v_p \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is equal to v_\u2605, assuming edge-on orbit (sin i =1). \n\nSo K = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) v_p \n\nNow, the orbital speed v_p of the planet is sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nThus:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nK = M_p / sqrt(M_\u2605 a) * sqrt(G) \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\nThen K = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) * v_p \n\nSubstituting v_p:\n\nK = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nK = M_p / sqrt( M_\u2605 a ) * sqrt( G ) \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nK = (M_p ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 ) / ( M_\u2605 sqrt(a) ) \n\n= (M_p ) / ( M_\u2605^(1/2) sqrt(a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nHmm, perhaps rearranged:\n\nK = ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( sqrt(M_\u2605) * sqrt(a) )\n\nThus:\n\nK = ( M_p ) / ( sqrt(M_\u2605 a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nWait, perhaps better to square both sides to eliminate square roots:\n\nK\u00b2 = ( M_p\u00b2 G M_\u2605 ) / ( M_\u2605 a ) ) ?\n\nWait, let's do it properly:\n\nStarting from K = ( M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\nThen, squaring both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 = ( M_p\u00b2 / M_\u2605\u00b2 ) * ( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\n= ( M_p\u00b2 G ) / ( M_\u2605 a )\n\nThus,\n\nK\u00b2 = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 a )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K\u00b2 )\n\nSo, the semi-major axis a is proportional to M_p\u00b2 / K\u00b2 \n\nSince G and M_\u2605 are constants here (same star), for the two planets:\n\na1 / a2 = ( (M_p1^2 / K1\u00b2 ) ) / ( (M_p2^2 / K2\u00b2 ) ) \n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 )\u00b2 * ( K2 / K1 )\u00b2 \n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )\u00b2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio a1/a2 is equal to (M_p1 / M_p2)^2 multiplied by (K2/K1)^2.\n\nGiven that M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. \n\nK1 is 0.03 \u00c5, K2 is 0.04 \u00c5. So K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 \u2248 1.333...\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\na1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * ( (0.04/0.03)^2 )\n\nWait, wait: Let me check the formula again. \n\nWait, the formula says a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )^2 )\n\nWait, because (K2/K1)^2 is in the denominator when solving for a1/a2? Wait no. Let me re-express:\n\nFrom above:\n\na1/a2 = (M_p1^2 / K1^2 ) / (M_p2^2 / K2^2 ) \n\n= ( M_p1^2 / M_p2^2 ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )\n\nYes, so:\n\na1/a2 = ( (7/5)^2 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^2 )\n\nWait, 0.04 over 0.03 is K2/K1, so squared is (0.04/0.03)^2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n7/5 = 1.4, squared is 1.96.\n\n0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333..., squared is (16/9) \u2248 1.777...\n\nMultiply 1.96 * 1.777... Let me compute that:\n\n1.96 * 1.777 \u2248 1.96 * 1.777 \u2248 3.47 (exactly, 1.96 * (16/9) = (1.96 * 16)/9 \u2248 31.36 /9 \u2248 3.4844)\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 \u2248 3.4844, so a2/a1 \u2248 1/3.4844 \u2248 0.287. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1_eq / T2_eq. Earlier, we found that T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, sqrt(0.287) \u2248 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. \n\nHmm, which is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C (0.53). \n\nWait, so that would make the answer C. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the key steps:\n\n1. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because T ~ sqrt(1/a). \n\n2. To find a1/a2, we used the relation from the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. \n\nWe had:\n\na1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )^2 )\n\nWait, but let me confirm the derivation again. \n\nFrom the formula derived earlier:\n\na = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K\u00b2 )\n\nSo, for planet 1 and 2:\n\na1 = ( G M_p1\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K1\u00b2 )\n\na2 = ( G M_p2\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K2\u00b2 )\n\nThus, a1/a2 = ( M_p1\u00b2 / K1\u00b2 ) / ( M_p2\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 ) = ( M_p1\u00b2 / M_p2\u00b2 ) * ( K2\u00b2 / K1\u00b2 )\n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nPlugging numbers:\n\nM_p1 =7, M_p2=5, so (7/5)^2 = 49/25 =1.96\n\nK2/K1 is (0.04/0.03)=4/3, so squared is 16/9\u22481.777\n\nMultiply those: 1.96 * 1.777\u22483.484\n\nThus, a1/a2\u22483.484 \u2192 a2/a1\u22480.287. \n\nThen T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, which is approximately 0.53. So option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the Doppler shift calculation again. \n\nThe K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The problem states the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb = K * \u03bb / c. Wait, the relation between the velocity and the wavelength shift is \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c. So, the velocity K is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)*c. \n\nTherefore, the ratio K2/K1 is (\u0394\u03bb2 / \u0394\u03bb1) because the wavelength \u03bb is the same for both (the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5 for both measurements). \n\nThus, K2/K1 = (0.04 / 6300 ) / (0.03 / 6300 ) = 0.04 /0.03 = 4/3. So that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nThus, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq is about 0.536, so the answer is C, which is ~0.53. \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the ratio inverted. Because the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2. \n\nBut the formula says T ~ sqrt(1/a), so if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller. \n\nWait, according to the a1/a2 ratio we found (3.484), a1 is bigger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away than Planet2. \n\nTherefore, T1 (being farther) would have a lower equilibrium temperature than Planet2, so T1/T2 would be less than 1. \n\nOur calculation gave ~0.536, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nYes, so C is the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The options are ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I need to recall the formula for equilibrium temperature. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. The formula is usually something like T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, actually, the exact formula might be T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) or maybe I'm mixing up the terms here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the equilibrium temperature can be expressed using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L/L_sun)^(1/4)? Or wait, maybe the standard formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/4 )^(1/4). Wait, perhaps I should write the standard formula properly.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature is given by:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^(1/4) \n\nWait, maybe another approach. The equilibrium temperature formula is derived by balancing the incoming stellar energy with the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the standard formula. \n\nThe standard formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)\n\nWait, actually, another way: The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula can also be written as:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A)/4 )^(1/4) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should start from the basic derivation. \n\nThe energy received by the planet is L*(R_p)^2/(4a\u00b2), but considering albedo A, the absorbed flux is F_abs = (1 - A) * L/(4\u03c0a\u00b2). The planet radiates as a blackbody, so its effective temperature T_eq satisfies \u03c3 T_eq^4 = F_abs. \n\nThe star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4. \n\nPutting this into the equation for T_eq:\n\n\u03c3 T_eq^4 = (1 - A) * (4\u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4)/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) ) * (1/(4\u03c0))? Wait, no, maybe better step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nThe absorbed flux F_abs = (1 - A) * L / (4\u03c0 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen, the outgoing flux is \u03c3 T_eq^4. Since the planet radiates over its surface area 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2, the energy balance is:\n\n(1 - A) * L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 / 4 ?\n\nWait, maybe better:\n\nThe incoming power is F_abs * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (the cross-sectional area). The outgoing power is \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (the surface area). So equate them:\n\n(1 - A) * (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 - A) L R_p\u00b2/(4a\u00b2)\n\nRight side: 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 R_p\u00b2 \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the areas. Let me try again:\n\nThe incoming flux is F = L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2). The power absorbed is F * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 * (1 - A).\n\nThe outgoing power is \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (since the surface area is 4\u03c0 R_p\u00b2).\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n(1 - A) * (L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)) * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nCancel R_p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(1 - A) * L/(4a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \u03c0 \n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, the left side after cancellation is (1 - A) * L/(4a\u00b2) * \u03c0 * R_p\u00b2 / \u03c0 R_p\u00b2? Wait, maybe I need to check the algebra again.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step again.\n\nIncoming power (absorbed) is:\n\nP_in = F * (cross-sectional area) * (1 - A) = [L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 * (1 - A)\n\nOutgoing power is:\n\nP_out = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * (surface area) = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2\n\nSet P_in = P_out:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 (1 - A) = \u03c3 T_eq^4 * 4 \u03c0 R_p\u00b2 \n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: L * R_p\u00b2 (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nRight side: 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 R_p\u00b2 \n\nCancel R_p\u00b2 terms from both sides:\n\nL (1 - A)/(4 a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nSo solving for T_eq^4:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 ) \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nWait, after cancelling R_p\u00b2, the equation is:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 (1 - A) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nWait, because the R_p\u00b2 cancels out. Let me see:\n\nLeft side after cancelling R_p\u00b2:\n\n[L/(4\u03c0 a\u00b2)] * \u03c0 (1 - A) = [ L (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nRight side after cancelling R_p\u00b2:\n\n4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nL (1 - A)/(4 a\u00b2) = 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 T_eq^4 \n\nThen, solving for T_eq^4:\n\nT_eq^4 = L (1 - A) / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 ) \n\nWait, that's L*(1 - A) divided by (4 a\u00b2 *4 \u03c0 \u03c3). Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I missed a factor. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express L in terms of the star's parameters. Since L = 4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4, substituting that into the equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4 * (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 *4 \u03c0 \u03c3) )\n\nWait, let me plug L into T_eq^4 equation:\n\nT_eq^4 = [ L (1 - A) ] / ( 4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 )\n\nSo substituting L:\n\n= [ (4 \u03c0 R_Star\u00b2 \u03c3 T_Star^4) (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 * 4 \u03c0 \u03c3 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe 4 \u03c0 cancels with the denominator's 4 \u03c0, and \u03c3 cancels with \u03c3 in the numerator and denominator. So:\n\n= [ R_Star\u00b2 T_Star^4 (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen,\n\nT_eq^4 = [ R_Star\u00b2 T_Star^4 (1 - A) ] / (4 a\u00b2 )\n\nThen,\n\nT_eq = T_Star * R_Star / (2 a )^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake the 4th root of both sides:\n\nT_eq = T_Star * ( R_Star / (2a) )^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nAh, okay. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (R_Star/(2a))^(1/2) multiplied by (1 - A)^(1/4) and T_Star. \n\nNow, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will depend on the other factors. \n\nThe question is asking for the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq. \n\nLet me write the formula for each:\n\nT1_eq = T_Star * sqrt( R_Star/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nT2_eq = T_Star * sqrt( R_Star/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nSince (1 - A) is the same, when taking the ratio, it cancels out. Also, T_Star and R_Star are the same for both planets. \n\nThus, the ratio becomes:\n\n(T1_eq / T2_eq) = sqrt( (R_Star/(2 a1)) / (R_Star/(2 a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nWait, sqrt(a2/a1) ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe ratio of T1_eq / T2_eq is sqrt( (R_Star/(2a1)) / (R_Star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) )\n\nYes, because R_Star cancels, the 2s cancel, so the ratio inside the sqrt is a2/a1. So the ratio of the temperatures is sqrt(a2/a1).\n\nWait, but that would mean that if Planet1 is closer (a1 < a2), then T1 would be higher. \n\nBut to find the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq, it's sqrt(a2/a1). \n\nTherefore, we need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. \n\nHmm, how do we get the orbital distances from the given information?\n\nThe problem mentions that both planets were detected via transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The radial velocity method gives the minimum mass (since sin i is involved), but here they state the mass directly, so perhaps we can assume that the inclination is such that the masses are as given. Also, since the orbits are circular, maybe that's important. \n\nThe key data given for each planet is the Doppler shift caused by their gravitational pull on the star. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5. For Planet2, it's 0.04 \u00c5. \n\nThe Doppler shift in the radial velocity method relates to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a) / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nWait, no, the standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = (G M_p / (4 \u03c0\u00b2))^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps better to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = (G (M_p) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2) )^(1/3) * ( (sin i) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, that's complicated. Alternatively, the standard formula is:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 a)^2 / P^2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to recall that K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^1.5 a^(3/2) )^(1/3) )) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of Kepler's third law. \n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. The formula is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (1 - e\u00b2)^1.5 ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0 / P ) * a )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the relation between K and the orbital parameters. \n\nAlternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be written as:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (a)^3 )^(1/2) )^(1/3) ) * (a / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use the relation between K and the planet's orbital elements. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for a circular orbit (e=0), and assuming sin i =1 (so we're seeing the orbit edge-on), then the formula simplifies. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (a)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ) ?\n\nHmm, I think I need a better approach. Let's look up the formula for K in terms of a and M_p. \n\nThe standard formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:\n\nK = (G / (2 \u03c0))^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * ( (2 \u03c0)^2 a^3 / P^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, that seems a bit tangled. Let me try to find a better way. \n\nAlternatively, using Kepler's third law. \n\nKepler's third law in terms of the star's mass and the semi-major axis:\n\n( P^2 ) / a^3 = 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / ( G (M_star + M_p) )\n\nAssuming that M_p << M_star (since the planets are Earth-like and the star is 1.5 solar masses), so M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nThus,\n\nP\u00b2 \u2248 (4 \u03c0\u00b2 a\u00b3 ) / ( G M_star )\n\n=> a\u00b3 \u2248 ( G M_star P\u00b2 ) / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )\n\nBut how does this relate to K?\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (a)^2 (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P) )^( something ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me recall that:\n\nThe velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity is given by v = (2 \u03c0 a sin i / P ) * ( M_p / (3 M_star ) )^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\nK = (v_earth) * (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the formula is better expressed as:\n\nK = ( (G / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 ))^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / ( (M_star)^(2/3) a^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (2 \u03c0 / P )^(2/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to think in terms of the relation between K, a, and M_p. \n\nAlternatively, let's recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/ (a^(3/2)), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of units. \n\nThe radial velocity K has units of velocity (km/s or similar). The Doppler shift given here is in \u00c5, but since the wavelength of the line is given, we can relate the shift to velocity via the Doppler formula. \n\nThe Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb \u2248 v / c, where v is the velocity, c is the speed of light. \n\nThe problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in a line at 6300 \u00c5. So the velocity semi-amplitude K1 for Planet1 is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c. \n\nSimilarly, for Planet2, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c. \n\nWait, that's important. Since the question gives the Doppler shift in \u00c5, we can compute the velocity from that. \n\nYes, exactly! The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. \n\nThe formula for the velocity shift (radial velocity) is:\n\nv = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb) * c \n\nTherefore, K (the semi-amplitude) is this velocity. \n\nSo, K1 = (0.03 \u00c5 / 6300 \u00c5 ) * c \n\nK2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) * c \n\nSo, the ratio of K2/K1 is (0.04/0.03) \u2248 1.333. \n\nSo K2 is 4/3 times K1. \n\nNow, we need to relate K to the orbital parameters. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) a ) )^(1/ something ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to recall the formula properly. \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nK = ( (G / (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )) )^(1/3) * ( ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / a^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(2/3) ) ) \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me use the formula for K derived from Kepler's law. \n\nThe formula for K is:\n\nK = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1 / a )^(2/3) ) * ( (2 \u03c0 / P )^(2/3) ) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the standard expression. \n\nThe standard formula for K is:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (a)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (4 \u03c0\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm better off using the formula from the radial velocity method. \n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK = ( ( G (M_p) sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( 1 / a )^(2/3) ) * ( ( 4 \u03c0\u00b2 / P\u00b2 )^(1/3) ) ) ?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in the case where M_p << M_star (since the planets are Earth-mass and the star is 1.5 solar masses), then M_star + M_p \u2248 M_star. \n\nSo, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = ( ( G M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) * ( ... ) ?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a circular orbit, and using Kepler's third law, we can express a in terms of K, M_p, and M_star. \n\nLet me try to derive the relation between K and a. \n\nThe radial velocity K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. \n\nUsing Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal acceleration:\n\nThe gravitational force between the star and planet is G M_star M_p / a\u00b2 = M_p v_p\u00b2 / a \n\nWhere v_p is the orbital speed of the planet. \n\nThe star also orbits the center of mass, so its velocity v_\u2605 is related to the planet's velocity v_p by:\n\nv_\u2605 / v_p = M_p / M_star \n\nBecause the center of mass is given by M_p a_p = M_\u2605 a_\u2605, so a_\u2605 = (M_p / (M_\u2605 + M_p )) a_p \u2248 (M_p / M_\u2605 ) a_p \n\nSince a_p is the planet's orbital radius (assuming the star is at the center, which is approximately true since M_\u2605 >> M_p). \n\nTherefore, the star's velocity v_\u2605 = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) v_p \n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is equal to v_\u2605, assuming edge-on orbit (sin i =1). \n\nSo K = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) v_p \n\nNow, the orbital speed v_p of the planet is sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nThus:\n\nK = ( M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nK = M_p / sqrt(M_\u2605 a) * sqrt(G) \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nv_p = sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\nThen K = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) * v_p \n\nSubstituting v_p:\n\nK = (M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nK = M_p / sqrt( M_\u2605 a ) * sqrt( G ) \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMultiply terms:\n\nK = (M_p ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 ) / ( M_\u2605 sqrt(a) ) \n\n= (M_p ) / ( M_\u2605^(1/2) sqrt(a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nHmm, perhaps rearranged:\n\nK = ( M_p sqrt(G) ) / ( sqrt(M_\u2605) * sqrt(a) )\n\nThus:\n\nK = ( M_p ) / ( sqrt(M_\u2605 a) ) * sqrt(G) \n\nWait, perhaps better to square both sides to eliminate square roots:\n\nK\u00b2 = ( M_p\u00b2 G M_\u2605 ) / ( M_\u2605 a ) ) ?\n\nWait, let's do it properly:\n\nStarting from K = ( M_p / M_\u2605 ) * sqrt( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\nThen, squaring both sides:\n\nK\u00b2 = ( M_p\u00b2 / M_\u2605\u00b2 ) * ( G M_\u2605 / a )\n\n= ( M_p\u00b2 G ) / ( M_\u2605 a )\n\nThus,\n\nK\u00b2 = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 a )\n\nRearranged:\n\na = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K\u00b2 )\n\nSo, the semi-major axis a is proportional to M_p\u00b2 / K\u00b2 \n\nSince G and M_\u2605 are constants here (same star), for the two planets:\n\na1 / a2 = ( (M_p1^2 / K1\u00b2 ) ) / ( (M_p2^2 / K2\u00b2 ) ) \n\n= ( M_p1 / M_p2 )\u00b2 * ( K2 / K1 )\u00b2 \n\nSo,\n\na1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )\u00b2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio a1/a2 is equal to (M_p1 / M_p2)^2 multiplied by (K2/K1)^2.\n\nGiven that M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. \n\nK1 is 0.03 \u00c5, K2 is 0.04 \u00c5. So K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 \u2248 1.333...\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\na1/a2 = (7/5)^2 * ( (0.04/0.03)^2 )\n\nWait, wait: Let me check the formula again. \n\nWait, the formula says a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )^2 )\n\nWait, because (K2/K1)^2 is in the denominator when solving for a1/a2? Wait no. Let me re-express:\n\nFrom above:\n\na1/a2 = (M_p1^2 / K1^2 ) / (M_p2^2 / K2^2 ) \n\n= ( M_p1^2 / M_p2^2 ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )\n\nYes, so:\n\na1/a2 = ( (7/5)^2 ) * ( (0.04/0.03)^2 )\n\nWait, 0.04 over 0.03 is K2/K1, so squared is (0.04/0.03)^2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n7/5 = 1.4, squared is 1.96.\n\n0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 \u2248 1.333..., squared is (16/9) \u2248 1.777...\n\nMultiply 1.96 * 1.777... Let me compute that:\n\n1.96 * 1.777 \u2248 1.96 * 1.777 \u2248 3.47 (exactly, 1.96 * (16/9) = (1.96 * 16)/9 \u2248 31.36 /9 \u2248 3.4844)\n\nTherefore, a1/a2 \u2248 3.4844, so a2/a1 \u2248 1/3.4844 \u2248 0.287. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1_eq / T2_eq. Earlier, we found that T1_eq / T2_eq = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nSo, sqrt(0.287) \u2248 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536. \n\nHmm, which is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C (0.53). \n\nWait, so that would make the answer C. \n\nWait, but let me check the steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, the key steps:\n\n1. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because T ~ sqrt(1/a). \n\n2. To find a1/a2, we used the relation from the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. \n\nWe had:\n\na1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( (K2 / K1 )^2 )\n\nWait, but let me confirm the derivation again. \n\nFrom the formula derived earlier:\n\na = ( G M_p\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K\u00b2 )\n\nSo, for planet 1 and 2:\n\na1 = ( G M_p1\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K1\u00b2 )\n\na2 = ( G M_p2\u00b2 ) / ( M_\u2605 K2\u00b2 )\n\nThus, a1/a2 = ( M_p1\u00b2 / K1\u00b2 ) / ( M_p2\u00b2 / K2\u00b2 ) = ( M_p1\u00b2 / M_p2\u00b2 ) * ( K2\u00b2 / K1\u00b2 )\n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nPlugging numbers:\n\nM_p1 =7, M_p2=5, so (7/5)^2 = 49/25 =1.96\n\nK2/K1 is (0.04/0.03)=4/3, so squared is 16/9\u22481.777\n\nMultiply those: 1.96 * 1.777\u22483.484\n\nThus, a1/a2\u22483.484 \u2192 a2/a1\u22480.287. \n\nThen T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) \u2248 sqrt(0.287) \u2248 0.536, which is approximately 0.53. So option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the Doppler shift calculation again. \n\nThe K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The problem states the shift is up to 0.03 \u00c5 for Planet1. The Doppler shift \u0394\u03bb = K * \u03bb / c. Wait, the relation between the velocity and the wavelength shift is \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb = v / c. So, the velocity K is (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb)*c. \n\nTherefore, the ratio K2/K1 is (\u0394\u03bb2 / \u0394\u03bb1) because the wavelength \u03bb is the same for both (the forbidden line is at 6300 \u00c5 for both measurements). \n\nThus, K2/K1 = (0.04 / 6300 ) / (0.03 / 6300 ) = 0.04 /0.03 = 4/3. So that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nThus, the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq is about 0.536, so the answer is C, which is ~0.53. \n\nWait, but let me check if I got the ratio inverted. Because the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is T1/T2. \n\nBut the formula says T ~ sqrt(1/a), so if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller. \n\nWait, according to the a1/a2 ratio we found (3.484), a1 is bigger than a2. So Planet1 is farther away than Planet2. \n\nTherefore, T1 (being farther) would have a lower equilibrium temperature than Planet2, so T1/T2 would be less than 1. \n\nOur calculation gave ~0.536, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA) ~0.98\n\nB) ~1.30\n\nC) ~0.53\n\nD) ~1.05\n\nYes, so C is the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.\n\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ratio \\( \\frac{T_{1,\\text{eq}}}{T_{2,\\text{eq}}} \\) depends on the orbital distances \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) of the planets. Using the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\), we derived the relationship between \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values \\( M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_\\oplus \\), \\( M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_\\oplus \\), \\( K_1 = 0.03 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\), and \\( K_2 = 0.04 \\, \\text{\u00c5} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{0.04}{0.03} \\right)^2 = 1.96 \\times 1.777 \\approx 3.484\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx 0.287 \\).
