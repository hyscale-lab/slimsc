      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about the uncertainty of the operator P_z when the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the uncertainty principle says. The uncertainty \u0394A of an operator A in a given state is sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). Right, so I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state, then take the square root of their difference.\n\nThe state vector provided is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me write that down as a ket vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix for P_z is diagonal, as given. The P_z matrix is:\n\nFirst row: (\u0127, 0, 0),\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0),\nThird row: (0, 0, -\u0127).\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127 for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively. \n\nTo find \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute the expectation value. The expectation value is \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write the state vector as a row vector for the conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real here (I don't see any imaginary parts mentioned in the components of the state vector), the conjugate transpose is just the same as the original but transposed. So \u03c8\u2020 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ].\n\nMultiplying this with P_z matrix:\n\nFirst element of \u03c8\u2020 times first column of P_z:\n(-1/2)(\u0127) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(0) = -\u0127/2\n\nSecond element times second column: (1/\u221a2)(0) + ... but since we're doing matrix multiplication, actually, maybe I should do it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the entire multiplication step by step. Let me write out the full matrix multiplication for \u03c8\u2020 P_z:\n\nThe resulting vector after \u03c8\u2020 multiplied by P_z would be:\n\nFirst element: (-1/2)(\u0127) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(0) = -\u0127/2\n\nSecond element: (-1/2)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(0) = 0\n\nThird element: (-1/2)(0) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u0127) = (\u0127/2)\n\nWait, but actually, the matrix multiplication for the full \u03c8\u2020 P_z would be a row vector. Then, multiplying by the column vector \u03c8 gives the expectation value.\n\nWait, maybe I need to do it step by step:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8\n\nLet me compute P_z \u03c8 first. Let's compute each component of P_z multiplied by the state vector:\n\nThe P_z matrix is diagonal, so multiplying it by the vector |\u03c8\u27e9 just multiplies each component by the corresponding diagonal entry of P_z.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst component of P_z |\u03c8\u27e9: (\u0127)(-1/2) = -\u0127/2\n\nSecond component: (0)(1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird component: (-\u0127)(-1/2) = \u0127/2\n\nSo the result of P_z |\u03c8\u27e9 is the vector [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, taking the inner product with \u03c8\u2020 (which is the conjugate transpose, so the same as the original row vector here):\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] \u2022 [ -\u0127/2, 0, \u0127/2 ]^T\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)(-\u0127/2) = (\u0127/4)\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2)(0) = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(\u0127/2) = -\u0127/4\n\nAdding them up: \u0127/4 - \u0127/4 = 0. Wait, so the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero?\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me check that again. Let's see:\n\nYes, the first term is positive \u0127/4, third term is negative \u0127/4, so they cancel. The middle term is zero. So the expectation value is indeed zero. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would just be the square of its diagonal elements. So the matrix for P_z squared would be:\n\nFirst row: (\u0127^2, 0, 0),\nSecond row: (0, 0, 0),\nThird row: (0,0, ( -\u0127 )^2 ) \u2192 which is \u0127^2.\n\nWait, because P_z has diagonal entries \u0127, 0, -\u0127, so squaring them gives \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2. So the P_z\u00b2 matrix is diagonal with entries \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, when we compute P_z squared times |\u03c8\u27e9, it's each component multiplied by the square of the P_z eigenvalue for that basis.\n\nSo, compute P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nFirst component: (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2\n\nSecond component: (0)(1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird component: (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2) = -\u0127\u00b2/2\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the third component of P_z squared is ( -\u0127 )\u00b2 = \u0127\u00b2. So when multiplied by the third component of |\u03c8\u27e9, which is -1/2, it would be \u0127\u00b2*(-1/2). Wait, that's correct. So the third component is -\u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nSo the resulting vector after P_z\u00b2 |\u03c8\u27e9 is [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9, we take the inner product of \u03c8\u2020 with this vector.\n\nSo:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ] \u2022 [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T \n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (\u0127\u00b2)/4\n\nSecond term: (1/\u221a2)(0) = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(-\u0127\u00b2/2) = (\u0127\u00b2)/4\n\nAdding them up: (\u0127\u00b2/4) + (\u0127\u00b2/4) = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = \u0127\u00b2/2.\n\nNow, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (\u0127\u00b2/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2).\n\nLooking at the options, that's option B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check everything again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of P_z squared. Let me verify:\n\nThe P_z matrix is diagonal with entries [\u0127, 0, -\u0127]. Squaring that gives [\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2], correct. So when multiplying by the state vector components, the first component is -1/2, so first term is (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2). Third component is -1/2, so third term is (\u0127\u00b2)(-1/2). So the vector after P_z squared is indeed [ -\u0127\u00b2/2, 0, -\u0127\u00b2/2 ]^T. \n\nThen the inner product with the state vector's conjugate transpose:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/(4) \n\nThird term: (-1/2) * (-\u0127\u00b2/2) = \u0127\u00b2/(4). The middle term is zero. So total is \u0127\u00b2/2. Correct. \n\nThen the difference is \u0127\u00b2/2 minus zero, so sqrt(\u0127\u00b2/2) is indeed \u0127 divided by sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the state vector is properly normalized. The problem statement says the state is given by the column vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me check the norm squared:\n\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, normalized. Good, that's important. So no issues there.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be B, which is \\hbar over root 2.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, \u0394P_z, given the state of the system. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, and the state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. \n\nFirst, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated by sqrt(\u27e8A\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8A\u27e9\u00b2). So here, \u0394P_z would be sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). \n\nBut wait, since P_z is an operator, maybe it's diagonal in its own basis? The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the matrix for P_z is already diagonal. Let me check the given matrix for P_z. The first row has (\u0127, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third (0,0,-\u0127). So the eigenvalues are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127 for the three basis states respectively. \n\nThe state vector given is a column vector: let me denote it as |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2 , 1/\u221a2 , -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis is the eigenstates of P_z, each component corresponds to the coefficients in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. \n\nTo compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to take the expectation value. That would be the sum over i of (\u03c8_i^* times P_z's eigenvalue for basis i times \u03c8_i). Wait, since the matrix of P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by |\u03c8_i|\u00b2. \n\nWait, more precisely, in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, the operator P_z is diagonal with entries being its eigenvalues. So the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is the sum over each component squared (since the basis is orthonormal) times the corresponding eigenvalue. \n\nSo let me compute each term:\n\nFirst basis vector (eigenvalue \u0127): the coefficient is -1/2. The square of the absolute value is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So contribution: (1/4)*\u0127.\n\nSecond basis vector (eigenvalue 0): coefficient 1/\u221a2. The square is (1/2). Contribution: (1/2)*0 = 0.\n\nThird basis vector (eigenvalue -\u0127): coefficient -1/2. Square is (1/4). Contribution: (1/4)*(-\u0127).\n\nAdding them up: (1/4 \u0127) + 0 + (-1/4 \u0127) = 0. So \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0?\n\nHmm. Wait, that's interesting. So the average of P_z in this state is zero. \n\nNow, what about \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would be the square of its diagonal entries. So the diagonal entries of P_z squared matrix would be (\u0127)^2, 0^2, (-\u0127)^2, so \u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum of each |\u03c8_i|\u00b2 multiplied by the corresponding (P_z eigenvalue)^2. \n\nSo first term: (1/4)*(\u0127\u00b2). Second term: (1/2)*0. Third term: (1/4)*(\u0127\u00b2). \n\nTotal \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4 + 1/4) * \u0127\u00b2 = (1/2) \u0127\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. \n\nSo the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nHmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might mix up something. \n\nWait, the state vector given is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The question says that the explicit form is the vector (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). Let me confirm if this vector is normalized. Let's compute the sum of squares of the absolute values:\n\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1/4 +1/4) = 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. Okay, so the norm is 1. Good.\n\nSo the expectation calculations are okay. \n\nThe P_z operator's expectation value is indeed 0, and the squared term gives 1/2 \u0127\u00b2, so the sqrt of that is \u0127 over sqrt(2). So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues. The P_z matrix first row is (\u0127, 0,0), so the first basis vector has eigenvalue \u0127, the second row (0,0,0) so eigenvalue 0, third row (0,0,-\u0127), so eigenvalue -\u0127. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is just the sum of |c_i|\u00b2*(eigenvalue)^2. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, then P_z squared is also diagonal with entries (eigenvalues squared), so yes, the expectation of P_z squared would be exactly that. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2)\u0127, which is \u0127 divided by sqrt(2). So option B. \n\nHmm, but wait, another thought: the question states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. The given vector is that eigenstate. But perhaps the operator P_x's matrix is given, so maybe I can check whether that vector is indeed an eigenvector of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. Let me verify that. \n\nThe P_x matrix is given as first row (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0), second row (\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2), third row (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0). \n\nSo let's multiply P_x by the given vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2]^T. \n\nFirst component: 0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) = (\u0127/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = \u0127/(2). \n\nWait, but the eigenvalue is supposed to be -\u0127. Hmm, so this product should give -\u0127 times the vector. Let's see:\n\nWait, let's compute each component. \n\nFirst component of P_x * \u03c8: \n\nRow 1 of P_x: [0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0] multiplied by the vector's components: 0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) = (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u0127/2.\n\nSecond component: Row 2 of P_x is [\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2]. So:\n\n(\u0127/\u221a2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(-1/2) = \u0127/\u221a2 [ -1/2 -1/2 ] = \u0127/\u221a2 (-1) = - \u0127/\u221a2.\n\nThird component: Row3 of P_x is [0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0]. So:\n\n0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) = same as first component: \u0127/2.\n\nSo the result of P_x * \u03c8 is the vector [ \u0127/2, - \u0127/\u221a2, \u0127/2 ]^T. \n\nNow, if this is supposed to be equal to -\u0127 * \u03c8, then let's see:\n\n-\u0127 * \u03c8 = -\u0127 * [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T = [ (\u0127/2), - \u0127/\u221a2, (\u0127/2) ]^T. \n\nWhich matches exactly with the result of P_x * \u03c8. So yes, the given vector is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, my earlier calculations for the uncertainty are okay. \n\nSo \u0394P_z is sqrt( \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 ) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). \n\nLooking at the options, B is \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}. So the answer should be B.\n",
