  "llm_tie_break_response_text": "\n\nTo determine how the number of stars per unit parallax (\\( \\text{d}N/\\text{d}plx \\)) changes with parallax (\\( plx \\)), we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \\( plx = 1/r \\), where \\( r \\) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a spherical shell between \\( r \\) and \\( r + \\text{d}r \\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \\( 4\\pi r^2 \\text{d}r \\). \n\nExpressing this in terms of parallax, we substitute \\( r = 1/plx \\) and compute the differential \\( \\text{d}r \\). Since \\( \\text{d}r/\\text{d}plx = -1/(plx)^2 \\), we have \\( \\text{d}r = - (1/plx^2) \\text{d}plx \\). Taking magnitudes, the volume element becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{d}N \\propto 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{plx} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{plx^2} \\text{d}plx = \\frac{4\\pi}{plx^4} \\text{d}plx.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to \\( 1/plx^4 \\). This result is confirmed by considering the cumulative number of stars within a distance \\( r = 1/plx \\), which scales as \\( 1/plx^3 \\), and taking its derivative with respect to \\( plx \\), yielding \\( \\text{d}N/\\text{d}plx \\propto 1/plx^4 \\).\n\nAnswer: A"
