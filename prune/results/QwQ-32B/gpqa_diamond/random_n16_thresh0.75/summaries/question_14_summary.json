PFA cross-links proteins to DNA and proteins, while DSG specifically cross-links proteins to proteins, enhancing the stability of protein complexes. The disappearance of peaks under PFA+DSG suggests that the original peaks in PFA alone were artifacts rather than true binding sites. \n\nRepeats (A) are a common source of ChIP-seq artifacts due to alignment ambiguities or non-specific binding. In PFA-only fixation, incomplete cross-linking might allow non-specific interactions or shearing in repetitive regions, leading to false peaks. When using PFA+DSG, the improved cross-linking stabilizes true protein-DNA interactions and reduces non-specific signals, eliminating artifacts in repetitive regions. \n\nActive promoters and enhancers (D) are expected to show true IKAROS binding, so their peaks should persist with better fixation. Introns (B) and random locations (C) lack a mechanistic basis for systematic artifact generation compared to repeats. Thus, the disappearing peaks most likely correspond to regions with repetitive sequences where artifacts were resolved by enhanced cross-linking.\n\nAnswer: A"
