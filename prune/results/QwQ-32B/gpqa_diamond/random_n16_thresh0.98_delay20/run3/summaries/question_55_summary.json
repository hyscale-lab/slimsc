The 7.0 ppm signal corresponds to a vinyl proton, and the 1.6 ppm methyl must be part of the propenyl/butenyl group. \n\n**Key Analysis:**\n1. **Methyl at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** Indicates a methyl group attached to a CH (e.g., -CH(CH3)-), requiring a branched structure.\n2. **7.0 ppm (doublet, J=16 Hz):** Vinyl proton coupled to another proton on the double bond.\n3. **5.5 ppm (dq):** A proton coupled to two different groups (e.g., a vinyl proton adjacent to a methyl and a methylene group).\n\n**Option Evaluation:**\n- **Propenyl acetate (C/B):** Requires a methyl branch (e.g., CH\u2082=CH-CH(CH\u2083)-OAc). This structure explains the methyl at 1.6 ppm and the vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm. However, the dq at 5.5 ppm would require complex coupling not easily resolved in a three-carbon chain.\n- **Butenyl acetate (D/A):** A trans-butenyl structure (e.g., CH\u2082-CH(CH\u2083)=CH-CH\u2082-OAc) fits better. The methyl at 1.6 ppm is on C2 (CH(CH\u2083)), coupled to its adjacent CH proton. The 5.5 ppm dq arises from the proton on C3 (vinyl), coupled to the CH\u2082 on C1 and the methyl on C2. The trans configuration ensures distinct splitting patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The trans-butenyl acetate (D) structure accounts for all peaks, including the methyl doublet and the dq signal, making it the most consistent with the data.\n\nFinal Answer: D"
