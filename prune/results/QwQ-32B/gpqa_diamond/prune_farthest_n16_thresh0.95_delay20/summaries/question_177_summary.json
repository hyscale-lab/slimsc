  "llm_tie_break_response_text": "\n\nThe problem requires calculating the luminosity ratio of two stars considering their radii, temperatures, and radial velocities. Star_1's radius and mass are 1.5 times those of Star_2. Their observed peak wavelengths are the same, implying their intrinsic temperatures differ due to Doppler shift. Using Wien's Law, the temperature of Star_2 (moving away at 700 km/s) must be slightly higher to account for the redshift. \n\nThe luminosity formula \\( L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 \\) shows luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. The radius ratio gives \\( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\). The temperature ratio \\( T_1/T_2 \\approx 1/(1 + v/c) \\approx 0.99767 \\), so \\( (T_1/T_2)^4 \\approx 0.9907 \\). Multiplying these factors: \\( 2.25 \\times 0.9907 \\approx 2.23 \\).\n\nAnswer: D"
