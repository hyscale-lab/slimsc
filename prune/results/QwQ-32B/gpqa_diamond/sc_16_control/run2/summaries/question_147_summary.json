      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation of a proton and antiproton, and I need to find the velocity of particle A. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the reaction given is p + p\u0304 \u2192 2A\u207a + 2A\u207b. The antiproton is slowly moving, which probably means we can treat its kinetic energy as negligible. The mass of A is given as m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are different fractions of the speed of light. \n\nHmm, right. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate the total energy available for the annihilation as the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton. Because when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles' energy. \n\nThe proton and antiproton each have a rest mass energy. Let me recall the mass of a proton. I think the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So the total rest mass energy would be 2 times that, right? Since both proton and antiproton are involved. So that's 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton's kinetic energy is also negligible? Or is the proton considered at rest? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest? Or are both considered to have negligible kinetic energy? Hmm. The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps the total momentum has to be considered. \n\nWait, since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is small. But in the center of mass frame, the total momentum would be the sum of the proton and antiproton's momenta. But maybe since the antiproton's speed is very low, its momentum is negligible compared to the proton's? Or perhaps they are colliding head-on? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy available is just the sum of the rest masses of the proton and antiproton. Then, that energy is converted into the kinetic and rest mass energy of the four A particles. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nTotal initial energy (E_initial) is approximately (m_p + m_p\u0304)c\u00b2. Since proton and antiproton have the same mass, that's 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. \n\nThe final products are two A+ and two A-, so total particles are four. Each A has a rest mass of m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the remaining energy must be the kinetic energy of the particles. But since in annihilation processes, the products are usually at rest if they are massive? Wait, no. Wait, if the initial particles are at rest (or moving very slowly), then the products must move in such a way that momentum is conserved. Since the initial momentum is nearly zero, the final momentum must also be zero. So all the particles must move symmetrically. \n\nSo, if the four A particles are produced, they must move in such a way that their total momentum cancels out. Since there are two positive and two negative charges, maybe they are emitted in opposite directions to cancel the momentum. \n\nAssuming that all four particles have the same speed and opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. But their kinetic energy would add up. \n\nWait, but first, let's think of energy conservation. The total energy must be equal to the initial energy. \n\nE_initial = E_final. \n\nE_initial is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nE_final is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies of all four particles. \n\nWait, but maybe since the particles are moving, their total energy is gamma*m_A c\u00b2 each, and the total would be 4*gamma*m_A c\u00b2. \n\nBecause each A particle has energy gamma*m_A c\u00b2. So total energy is 4 * gamma * m_A c\u00b2. \n\nSo, setting that equal to E_initial:\n\n4 * gamma * m_A c\u00b2 = 2 * m_p c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but m_p is 938 MeV/c\u00b2, so m_p c\u00b2 is 938 MeV. \n\nSo substituting numbers:\n\n4 * gamma * 300 MeV = 2 * 938 MeV \n\nLet me compute the right side: 2*938 = 1876. So left side is 4 * gamma * 300 = 1200 gamma. \n\nSo 1200 gamma = 1876 \u2192 gamma = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nHmm, so gamma is approximately 1.5633. \n\nThen, we can find the velocity v from gamma. \n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nSo, 1/gamma = sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nLet me compute 1/gamma first. \n\n1/1.5633 \u2248 0.64. \n\nSo sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 0.64 \u2192 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = (0.64)^2 \u2248 0.4096 \u2192 v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 \u2192 v/c = sqrt(0.5904) \u2248 0.768. \n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. \n\nWait, the assumption here is that all four particles are moving with the same speed and direction such that their momenta cancel. But how exactly? \n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair (A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ going in one direction and two A- in the opposite direction? Or each A+ and A- pair moving in opposite directions. \n\nWait, but for the total momentum to be zero, the momenta of all four particles must sum to zero. \n\nSuppose that the two A+ and two A- particles are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions. Let's say two go in the +x direction and two in -x, but with same speed. \n\nBut in that case, their momenta would be p and -p each, so total momentum is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all four are moving in different directions, but symmetrically so that vector sum is zero. \n\nAssuming that all four have the same speed and their momenta cancel. \n\nAssuming that, then each has the same kinetic energy and same gamma factor. \n\nSo the approach of using total energy as 4*gamma*m_A c^2 equals initial energy is okay. \n\nSo the calculation gives gamma \u22481.5633. \n\nThen solving for v: \n\ngamma = 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2))\n\nLet me compute 1.5633 squared: 1.5633^2 \u2248 2.4433. \n\nSo 1/(sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) squared is 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = gamma squared \u22482.4433. \n\nThus, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/2.4433 \u22480.409. \n\nTherefore v\u00b2/c\u00b2 \u22481 -0.409=0.591, so v/c= sqrt(0.591)\u22480.769, which is about 0.77c, so option A. \n\nBut the options include 0.91c and 0.96c. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the problem statement. \n\nWait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Does that mean that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is just the sum of the rest masses? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some kinetic energy. But since it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the proton and antiproton are at rest. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is at rest? Or maybe they are moving towards each other with low speed. \n\nWait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. If the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, its momentum is small. But for the final state to have zero net momentum, the products must have momentum equal and opposite. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the initial momentum is negligible, so the final momentum must also be zero, hence the four particles must have momentum vectors that cancel. \n\nBut in that case, my previous approach holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the mass. Let me check the proton mass again. \n\nProton rest mass is indeed about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So 2*938 is 1876. \n\nThen the four particles each have rest mass 300 MeV. \n\nSo the total rest mass energy is 4*300=1200 MeV. \n\nSo the kinetic energy available is 1876-1200=676 MeV. \n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier, I considered the total energy as 4*gamma*m_A c^2. \n\nWhich includes the rest mass. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nWait, let me think of energy conservation again. \n\nTotal energy before is 2*(938) MeV. \n\nTotal energy after is 4*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2). \n\nThus, 4*gamma*(300) = 2*938 \u2192 gamma = (2*938)/(4*300) = (1876)/(1200) \u22481.5633. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nThen, solving for v: \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) \u2192 sqrt(1 - (v\u00b2/c\u00b2)) = 1/gamma \u2192 \n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)) \n\nWait, let's compute that again. \n\ngamma = 1.5633 \n\ngamma squared is approx (1.5633)^2 = let me calculate more precisely. \n\n1.5 squared is 2.25, 0.0633 squared is about 0.004, cross term 2*1.5*0.0633 \u2248 0.19. So total is approx 2.25 + 0.19 +0.004 \u2248 2.444. \n\nSo 1/(gamma squared) is about 0.409. \n\nThus, 1 - 1/(gamma squared) = 0.591 \n\nsqrt(0.591) is approximately 0.769, so v \u22480.769c, so 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nHmm, but the options given include 0.91c. Maybe I made an error in the assumption? \n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered that the particles are created with zero kinetic energy? But that would mean their total energy is just their rest mass, but that would require 1200 MeV = 1876 MeV, which isn't possible. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proton and antiproton's kinetic energy is considered. Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest. Then, the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, so the total initial energy is the rest mass of proton (938) plus the rest mass of antiproton (938) plus the antiproton's kinetic energy (negligible). So that's the same as before. \n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is in the number of particles? The reaction produces 2A+ and 2A-, so four particles. Each has mass 300 MeV. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so their rest mass energy is 300 MeV each. \n\nSo total rest mass is 4 *300 =1200 MeV. \n\nTotal energy available is 1876, so the kinetic energy is 676 MeV. \n\nBut if each particle's kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_A c\u00b2, then total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma -1)*300. \n\nSo 4*(gamma -1)*300 = 676 \u2192 (gamma -1) = 676/(4*300) \u2248 676/1200 \u22480.563. \n\nThus gamma \u2248 1.563, same as before. \n\nSo same result. \n\nHmm. Then the velocity is about 0.77c, which is option A. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to use relativistic momentum conservation. \n\nWait, the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is slowly moving, so its momentum p \u2248 m_p v. Since it's moving slowly, v <<c, so gamma \u22481. \n\nThe proton is presumably at rest, so total initial momentum is p_initial \u2248 m_p v (antiproton's momentum). \n\nThe final momentum must equal this. \n\nThe final momentum is the sum of the four A particles' momenta. \n\nAssuming that the four particles are emitted symmetrically, so that their momenta cancel out except for a component in the direction of the antiproton's motion. \n\nWait, that complicates things. \n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach was too simplistic. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nIf the antiproton is moving slowly, then its initial momentum is small. Let's denote the proton as at rest (since antiproton is moving towards it), then the total initial momentum is approximately the antiproton's momentum. \n\nIn the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum. \n\nBut since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is small, so the final particles must have a net momentum in the direction of the antiproton's motion. \n\nTherefore, the four particles can't all have the same speed and direction. \n\nHmm, so maybe the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. \n\nBut since the initial momentum is small, perhaps we can approximate that the final particles are emitted with nearly equal and opposite momenta, but with a small net momentum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the non-relativistic approach? \n\nWait, but the given mass of A is 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass, so if they're moving at a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects are important. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that all the energy goes into the kinetic energy of the particles, and the rest mass is considered as part of the energy. Wait, that's what I did before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the kinetic energy each particle has. \n\nWait, another approach: The total energy of each A is gamma * m_A c\u00b2. The total energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, gamma = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = (m_p)/(2 m_A). \n\nWait, substituting the numbers: \n\nm_p c\u00b2 is 938 MeV, m_A c\u00b2 is 300 MeV. \n\nSo gamma = (938)/(2*300) = 938/600 \u2248 1.5633. \n\nSame as before. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). \n\nWait, let's compute this again precisely. \n\ngamma squared is (1.5633)^2. Let me calculate it more accurately. \n\n1.5633 * 1.5633: \n\n1.5 *1.5 =2.25 \n\n1.5 *0.0633 =0.09495 \n\n0.0633 *1.5=0.09495 \n\n0.0633 *0.0633\u22480.004 \n\nAdding them up: \n\n2.25 + (0.09495 +0.09495) +0.004 \n\n=2.25 +0.1899 +0.004 \u22482.4439 \n\nSo gamma squared \u22482.4439 \n\nThus 1/gamma squared is 1/2.4439 \u22480.4092 \n\nSo 1 - 0.4092 =0.5908 \n\nsqrt(0.5908)= approximately sqrt(0.6) is about 0.7746, but 0.5908 is a bit less. \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.5908). Let's see:\n\n0.77^2 =0.5929, which is a bit higher than 0.5908. \n\n0.769^2: 0.769*0.769 = (0.77 -0.001)^2 =0.77\u00b2 - 2*0.77*0.001 +0.000001 \n\n0.5929 -0.00154 +0.000001\u22480.59136 \n\nHmm, so 0.769^2\u22480.5914 which is still higher than 0.5908. \n\n0.768^2 = (0.768)^2 = 0.768*0.768 \n\nLet me compute:\n\n700^2=0.49, 68^2=4624, cross terms?\n\nWait, 0.768 squared:\n\n0.7^2 =0.49\n\n0.06^2 =0.0036\n\n0.008^2=0.000064\n\nBut better to do:\n\n768 *768 = ?\n\nWell, 700*700 =490000, 700*68=47600, 68*700=47600, 68^2=4624.\n\nWait, perhaps easier:\n\n768 \u00d7 768 = (700 +68)^2 =700\u00b2 + 2\u00d7700\u00d768 +68\u00b2 \n\n=490000 + 2\u00d747600 +4624 \n\n=490000 + 95200 +4624 \n\n= 490000 +95200 =585200; 585200 +4624=589,824 \n\nSo 0.768 squared is (0.768)^2 = 0.589824 \n\nAh, so 0.768 squared is 0.5898, which is very close to 0.5908. \n\nSo sqrt(0.5908) is approximately 0.7688, so about 0.769c. \n\nSo that's ~0.77c. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A) 0.77c. \n\nBut the options given include 0.91c. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the number of particles?\n\nWait, the reaction is 2A+ and 2A-, so total of four particles. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the mass of the proton? Let me check. \n\nYes, the proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the mass of A as 300 MeV, but in that case, the rest mass energy is 300 MeV, so that part is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other at non-relativistic speeds, so their kinetic energy adds to the rest mass energy? \n\nWait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. If the proton is at rest, then the antiproton's kinetic energy is (1/2)m_p v\u00b2, which is negligible compared to its rest mass. So we can ignore it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the proton is not at rest. Suppose both are moving towards each other with some speed, but since the antiproton is slow, its speed is negligible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is considering the center-of-momentum frame? \n\nWait, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the center of mass frame would have a small velocity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity in the center of mass frame. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nLet me consider that the proton is at rest. Then, the initial momentum is the antiproton's momentum. Let's denote the antiproton's speed as v_antiproton, which is small. \n\nThe total energy is then the rest energy of the proton (938 MeV) plus the total energy of the antiproton, which is gamma_antiproton * m_p c\u00b2. Since v_antiproton is small, gamma_antiproton is approximately 1 + (v_antiproton^2)/(2c^2). So the kinetic energy is negligible. \n\nTherefore, the total energy is approximately 2 * 938 MeV =1876 MeV. \n\nThe final particles must have that energy. \n\nAssuming that in the lab frame (where the proton is at rest), the antiproton has very little momentum, so the final particles must have a net momentum in the direction of the antiproton's motion. \n\nBut this complicates the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to be solved in the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system. \n\nWait, in the rest frame of the proton (since antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is considered at rest), then the total energy is the sum of the proton's rest mass and the antiproton's total energy. \n\nAssuming that the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible, so total energy is 2*938. \n\nIn this frame, the total momentum is the antiproton's momentum, which is small. \n\nTherefore, the final particles must carry away this small momentum. \n\nBut if the momentum is small, then the particles' velocities can be approximated as equal in magnitude but direction such that their momenta cancel except for a small net. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, so the final particles have zero net momentum, so symmetric. \n\nBut in that case, the initial frame must be the center of mass frame. \n\nWait, if the proton and antiproton are at rest relative to each other, then their center of mass is stationary, and total momentum is zero. \n\nSo if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is moving in the opposite direction at a similar speed, but since it's a proton and antiproton, maybe they are moving towards each other? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center of mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. \n\nIn that case, the initial energy is the sum of the rest masses (since they are at rest). So total energy 2*938 MeV. \n\nThen the final particles must also have zero net momentum. \n\nTherefore, the four particles must move in such a way that their vectors cancel. \n\nSo, each pair of particles moving in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel. \n\nThus, each pair would have the same speed and opposite direction. \n\nSo each particle has the same speed. \n\nThus, the calculation I did earlier holds. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is 0.77c. \n\nHmm, so why is there an option for 0.91c? Maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. \n\nWait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. \n\nGamma was 1.5633. \n\nThe velocity v is c multiplied by sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). \n\nLet me compute 1/gamma^2 again. \n\nGamma squared is 1.5633 squared. \n\nLet me do this more precisely. \n\n1.5633 * 1.5633: \n\nFirst, 1.5 *1.5 =2.25 \n\n1.5 *0.0633 =0.09495 \n\n0.0633 *1.5 =0.09495 \n\n0.0633 *0.0633 =0.004 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\n2.25 + 0.09495 +0.09495 +0.004 \n\n=2.25 +0.1899 +0.004 \n\n=2.25 +0.1939 =2.4439 \n\nSo 1/gamma squared is 1/2.4439 = approximately 0.4092. \n\nThus 1 -0.4092 =0.5908. \n\nSquare root of that is sqrt(0.5908). \n\nLet me calculate this with more precision. \n\nWe know that 0.77^2 =0.5929 \n\n0.76^2 =0.5776 \n\n0.77^2 is 0.5929 \n\n0.5908 is 0.5929 -0.0021. \n\nSo, let me see: \n\nLet x =0.77 - delta \n\nx^2 = (0.77 - delta)^2 =0.5929 - 2*0.77*delta + delta\u00b2 \n\nSet equal to 0.5908 \n\n0.5929 -1.54 delta + delta\u00b2 =0.5908 \n\nNeglect delta squared, since delta is small. \n\n-1.54 delta \u2248 -0.0021 \n\ndelta \u22480.0021 /1.54 \u22480.00136 \n\nSo x\u22480.77 -0.00136=0.7686 \n\nSo sqrt(0.5908)\u22480.7686 \n\nSo v/c\u22480.7686, so 0.77c. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the rest mass of the antiproton is same as proton, so total initial energy is 2*(938) =1876, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the antiproton and proton are moving towards each other with some speed, so their kinetic energies add. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass of A is 300 MeV, but in the question it's written as m_A c\u00b2=300 MeV, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, I think my calculation is correct. The answer should be A)0.77c. \n\nWait, but the options also have 0.91c. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of particles. Let me check the reaction equation again. \n\nThe reaction is p + p\u0304 \u21922A+ +2A\u2212. So total of 4 particles. \n\nYes, so 4 particles, each with mass 300 MeV. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass of the products, so the kinetic energy is (1876 - 1200)=676 MeV, and then using that to find the velocity. \n\nBut that's what I did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects to use the kinetic energy per particle. \n\nThe kinetic energy per A particle is (gamma -1)*m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTotal kinetic energy is 4*(gamma-1)*300 =676 \n\nSo (gamma-1)*300=169 \u2192 gamma-1=169/300\u22480.5633 \u2192 gamma\u22481.5633, same as before. \n\nThus, same result. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are different? Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions: \n\nA) 0.77c \n\nB) 0.96c \n\nC)0.91c \n\nD)0.86c \n\nYes, so A is an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of proton? Let me check. \n\nYes, proton mass is 938 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different unit? Like GeV? No, the given mass is 300 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have considered that the total energy is the sum of the proton and antiproton's rest masses plus their kinetic energies. But since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2, which is negligible compared to its rest mass. So adding that would not change much. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the proton is at rest and the antiproton has some kinetic energy. \n\nWait, let's suppose the antiproton is moving with speed v_antiproton. \n\nThen, the initial energy is (gamma_antiproton * m_p c\u00b2) + m_p c\u00b2. \n\nThe initial momentum is gamma_antiproton * m_p v_antiproton. \n\nThe final particles must have this momentum. \n\nBut since v_antiproton is small, the initial momentum is small. \n\nAssuming that the final particles have four particles with total momentum equal to that. \n\nBut this complicates the calculation because we have to consider the direction of momentum. \n\nAlternatively, if the antiproton is moving very slowly, then gamma_antiproton \u22481, so initial energy is approx (m_p c\u00b2 + m_p c\u00b2) = same as before. \n\nThe momentum is m_p v_antiproton. \n\nAssuming that the final particles' momenta must add to this. \n\nSuppose all four particles move in the same direction as the antiproton, but that would give large momentum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps two move in the direction of the antiproton's motion, and two opposite. \n\nAssuming that two have momentum p and two have momentum p', such that 2p - 2p' = m_p v_antiproton. \n\nBut since v_antiproton is very small, the difference between p and p' is small. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since the antiproton is slowly moving, the initial momentum is negligible, so the final momentum is also negligible. Hence, the particles must have momentum vectors cancelling each other. \n\nTherefore, the first approach holds. \n\nThus, the answer should be A) 0.77c. \n\nHmm, but the option C is 0.91c. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the gamma calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the equation. \n\nWait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) \n\nSo, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) \n\nWait, let me compute 1/gamma squared: \n\ngamma is 1.5633 \n\ngamma squared is 2.4439 \n\n1/gamma squared is 0.4092 \n\n1 - 0.4092 =0.5908 \n\nsqrt(0.5908)=0.7686. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. \n\nWait, if I thought that the kinetic energy of each particle is (gamma -1) m_A c\u00b2, and the total kinetic energy is 4*(gamma-1)*300 =676. \n\nSo gamma-1= 676/(4*300)=676/1200\u22480.5633 \n\nThus, gamma=1.5633, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering relativistic kinetic energy as (gamma -1)mc\u00b2, which is correct. \n\nHmm, I can't see where the error is. The calculation seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A) 0.77c. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the total energy? \n\nWait, the total energy after annihilation must be equal to the initial energy. \n\nInitial energy: proton (938 MeV) plus antiproton (938 MeV) \u2192 total 1876. \n\nFinal energy: 4*(gamma*m_A c\u00b2) \u2192 4*gamma*300. \n\nSet equal: 4*300 gamma =1876 \u2192 gamma=1876/(1200)=1.5633. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the speed using kinetic energy. \n\nWait, kinetic energy per particle is (gamma -1)*300 MeV. \n\nTotal kinetic energy is 4*(gamma-1)*300 = 4*(0.5633)*300 \u22484*169\u2248676, which matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute velocity using kinetic energy. \n\nWait, kinetic energy K = (gamma -1)m c\u00b2. \n\nSo, K = (gamma -1)*300. \n\nBut how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, if I compute the kinetic energy per particle as (gamma -1)*300 = 169 MeV (since 0.5633 *300\u2248169). \n\nThe total energy per particle is gamma*300 = 1.5633*300\u2248469 MeV. \n\nSo, the kinetic energy is 169 MeV. \n\nBut how does that relate to velocity? \n\nWell, velocity is still calculated via gamma. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption that all four particles have the same speed. \n\nSuppose that the two A+ and two A- move in pairs in opposite directions. For instance, each pair has the same speed but opposite direction. \n\nThus, each pair contributes momentum p and -p. \n\nThus, the total momentum is zero. \n\nIn that case, each particle has the same speed. \n\nThus, the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different formula. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic kinetic energy? \n\nIf so, then total kinetic energy is 4*(1/2 m v\u00b2) = 2 m v\u00b2 *4? Wait no. \n\nWait, non-relativistic KE is (1/2) m v\u00b2 per particle. \n\nTotal KE would be 4*(0.5 m_A v\u00b2) = 2 m_A v\u00b2. \n\nTotal energy would be 4 m_A c\u00b2 + 2 m_A v\u00b2. \n\nSet equal to 2 m_p c\u00b2. \n\nSo, 4*(300)*c\u00b2 + 2*(300/c\u00b2)v\u00b2*c\u00b2 = 2*938 c\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's messy. \n\nWait, let me write in MeV terms. \n\nTotal initial energy is 1876 MeV. \n\nTotal rest mass energy of products is 4*300=1200. \n\nThus, KE = 676 MeV. \n\nIn non-relativistic, KE is 4*(0.5 m_A v\u00b2). \n\nBut m_A here is in kg? Wait, but in energy terms, m_A c\u00b2 =300 MeV. \n\nSo, m_A = 300 MeV / c\u00b2. \n\nThus, KE = 4*(0.5 * (300 MeV/c\u00b2) v\u00b2 ) \n\n= 2*(300/c\u00b2) v\u00b2 \n\nSet equal to 676 MeV: \n\n2*(300/c\u00b2)v\u00b2 =676 MeV \n\nSolving for v\u00b2: \n\nv\u00b2 = (676 / (2*300)) *c\u00b2 \n\n= (676 /600)*c\u00b2 \u22481.1267 c\u00b2 \n\nWhich gives v = sqrt(1.1267) c \u22481.06c, which is impossible. \n\nThus, non-relativistic approach is invalid here, as expected. \n\nTherefore, must use relativistic equations. \n\nThus, my original calculation holds, giving ~0.77c. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but the options have C as 0.91c. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the proton and antiproton's annihilation produces energy equal to their rest mass, but the products must have momentum. \n\nWait, but I think my approach was correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the relation between kinetic energy and momentum. \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nTotal energy of each A is gamma m_A c\u00b2. \n\nTotal energy is 4 gamma m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2 \n\nThus gamma = (m_p)/(2 m_A) \n\nWait, m_p c\u00b2 =938, m_A c\u00b2=300. \n\nSo gamma = 938/(2*300)=938/600\u22481.5633. \n\nSame as before. \n\nThus, velocity v= c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2) \n\nWait, that's the same formula. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in a different reference frame? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the direction of the square root. \n\nWait, the formula is v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma\u00b2)). \n\nWait, let me compute it again: \n\ngamma =1.5633 \n\n1/gamma squared is 0.4092 \n\n1 -0.4092 =0.5908 \n\nsqrt(0.5908)=0.7686 \n\nSo v=0.7686c. \n\nSo 0.77c. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nI think that's the right approach. I can't see any mistake here. Maybe the options are wrong, but given the choices, A must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the proton. Let me confirm: \n\nProton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\nAntiproton has the same mass. \n\nThus, total rest mass is 2\u00d7938.272\u22481876.544 MeV. \n\nThe four particles have 4\u00d7300=1200. \n\nThe difference is 1876.544-1200=676.544 MeV. \n\nSo the calculation is accurate. \n\nThus, the answer is A. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by considering the annihilation process \\( p + \\overline{p} \\rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \\).
