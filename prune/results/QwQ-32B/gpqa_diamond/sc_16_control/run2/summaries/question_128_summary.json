      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about choosing the correct plasmid to produce the human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The options are four different DNA sequences (A, B, C, D), and I need to figure out which one is the correct one that encodes the given amino acid sequence of P53.\n\nFirst, I remember that to translate a DNA sequence into protein, we need to look at the codons. Each set of three nucleotides (triplet) codes for an amino acid. Since DNA is double-stranded, but the mRNA is transcribed from one strand, the DNA sequence should be the template strand. So, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand, and then the codons in mRNA are read in triplets. However, sometimes people get confused between the coding strand and the template strand. Wait, the coding strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. The template strand is complementary to the mRNA. So when looking at the DNA, the coding strand would be the one that matches the mRNA sequence except for T instead of U. \n\nThe key here is that the DNA must have the correct codons corresponding to each amino acid in the given sequence. Since the options are all DNA sequences, I need to compare each DNA sequence (assuming it's the coding strand, so each triplet corresponds directly to the amino acid's codon) with the amino acid sequence provided. Alternatively, perhaps the DNA is the template strand, so each triplet would be complementary. Wait, but the standard approach is that the coding strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA. Since the DNA is double-stranded, the mRNA is synthesized using the template strand, which is complementary. So, the mRNA sequence would be complementary to the template strand. Therefore, the coding strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). \n\nTherefore, to get the codons, we can take the DNA sequence's coding strand (which would be the same as the mRNA, with T's instead of U's) and split it into triplets. Each triplet should correspond to the amino acid in the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, if the DNA is the template strand, then each triplet would be complementary to the mRNA's codon. So, for example, if the DNA has a triplet TAC, the mRNA would be AUG (since TAC complementary to ATG). But in that case, the DNA's triplet would be complementary to the codon. \n\nHmm, this could complicate things. The problem here is that without knowing which strand the DNA is on (coding or template), but perhaps the plasmid sequences are given as the DNA that's supposed to be transcribed into mRNA. So, the DNA plasmid should have the coding strand's sequence so that when transcribed, the mRNA is the correct one. Therefore, the DNA's coding strand's sequence should match the mRNA's sequence (with T's instead of U's). \n\nSo, the correct plasmid's DNA sequence, when read as the coding strand (i.e., each triplet corresponds directly to the codon), should translate into the given amino acid sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the DNA is presented in the same direction as the mRNA. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the given amino acid sequence starts with 'M' which is methionine, coded by ATG. The first codon in the DNA must be ATG (since the coding strand would have ATG, and the mRNA would have AUG, which codes for Methionine). \n\nLooking at the options, all start with ATG, so that's good. Let's check the first few triplets to see if they match.\n\nThe amino acid sequence's first few amino acids are:\n\nM (Met) E (Glu) E (Glu) P (Pro) Q (Gln) S (Ser) D (Asp) P (Pro) S (Ser) V (Val) E

The question gives me the amino acid sequence of P53 and four different DNA sequences (options A to D). My task is to determine which DNA sequence correctly encodes that protein.\n\nFirst, I remember that DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into protein. Since the DNA is given as the coding strand, the mRNA would be complementary to the DNA's template strand. But for the purpose of translation, each codon in the mRNA corresponds to an amino acid. So, the DNA sequence should be such that when transcribed into mRNA (replacing T with U), each triplet codon matches the amino acid sequence.\n\nBut maybe an easier way is to compare the DNA sequences to the amino acid sequence by using the genetic code. Each triplet of DNA nucleotides (since it's the coding strand, the DNA sequence is the same as the mRNA except T instead of U) should correspond to an amino acid. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe amino acid sequence starts with \"MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAM...\" and so on. The first amino acid is Methionine (M), which is encoded by the codon ATG. So the DNA sequence should start with ATG as the first three nucleotides. Let me check each option's first few nucleotides:\n\nLooking at option A: The first triplet is ATG, which is correct for Methionine. So that's a good start. Let's check option B's first triplet. B also starts with ATG. Option C starts with ATG as well. Option D also starts with ATG. So all start with Methionine. Hmm, so that doesn't narrow it down.\n\nNow, moving on to the second amino acid. The second amino acid in the sequence is Glutamic acid (E). The possible codons for E (Glu) are GAA and GAG. So the second codon (positions 2-4 in DNA?) Wait, actually, the DNA is read in triplets. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the DNA is written as a string. Let me see. Let's take the first few nucleotides of each option and see if they match the first few amino acids.\n\nThe first amino acid is M (ATG), so first 3 nucleotides are correct. The second amino acid is E. So the next triplet (positions 4-6 in the DNA sequence) should code for E. Let's check each option's next triplet.\n\nLooking at the first few letters of each option:\n\nOption A's DNA starts with:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TC... \n\nWait, let's break it down. Let me write the first few codons:\n\nOption A first 12 nucleotides: ATG GAG GAG CCG\n\nWait, the first codon is ATG (M), the second is GAG (which codes for Glutamic acid, E). That matches the second amino acid (E). The third codon is GAG again (another E), which would correspond to the third amino acid, which is another E in the sequence (MEEP...). Let's see:\n\nThe amino acid sequence starts with M-E-E-P-... So the first three amino acids are M, E, E.\n\nLooking at option A's first three codons:\n\n1. ATG (M)\n2. GAG (E)\n3. GAG (E)\nSo that's M-E-E, which matches the first three amino acids. So that looks good.\n\nNow check option B. Let's look at its first few codons:\n\nOption B's DNA starts with:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCC... Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the first part of option B's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGTCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\n\nBreaking down the first few codons for B:\n\nFirst codon: ATG (M)\nSecond: GAG (E)\nThird: GAG (E)\nFourth: CCC (Proline, P). Wait, the third amino acid in the sequence is E, but the fourth is P. Let me see the amino acid sequence again: M-E-E-P-Q... So after the first three (M, E, E) the next is P (the fourth). The third codon in B's DNA is GAG (E), which would be the third amino acid (E) as needed. Then the fourth codon is CCC. Let's see: CCC codes for Proline (P). So the fourth amino acid is P, which matches the sequence. So up to here, B is matching.\n\nWait, but let me check option A again. Let me look at option A's fourth codon. The first 12 nucleotides of A are:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCG (so the fourth codon is CCG, which is Proline (CCC, CCG, CCU, CCA are all Proline). So CCG codes for Proline. So the fourth amino acid is P, which matches. So both A and B are matching so far.\n\nHmm, so need to go further. Let's see the next amino acid after that. The sequence is M-E-E-P-Q-... The fifth amino acid is Q (Glutamine). Let's see what codon that would be.\n\nGlutamine (Q) is coded by CAA or CAG. So the fifth codon (positions 13-15 in the DNA) should be either CAA or CAG.\n\nLooking at option A's DNA:\n\nThe first 15 nucleotides: ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TC...\n\nSo the fifth codon is CAG (positions 13-15: CAG). CAG is Q, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nOption B's fifth codon: Let's see. The first 15 nucleotides of B's DNA: same as A? Let me check again. Let me look at the start of option B:\n\nOption B's first part:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCC\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Wait, the first 12 nucleotides of option B are:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCC (positions 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12). Wait, the fourth codon here is CCC (positions 10-12). So the fourth codon is CCC (Proline). Then the fifth codon is G (the 13th nucleotide is G). Let me see the exact sequence. Let's parse it step by step:\n\nOption B's first part:\n\nThe DNA starts as:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCC GAG TC ... \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the splitting. Let me write it as a string:\n\nOption A's first 18 nucleotides:\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG\n\nWait, wait no, let me count properly.\n\nWait, the first 3 letters are ATG (codon 1).\n\nThen next three (positions 4-6): GAG (codon 2).\n\nThen next three (7-9): GAG (codon3).\n\nThen next three (10-12): CCG (codon4).\n\nThen next three (13-15): CAG (positions 13-15: CAG \u2192 that's the fifth codon.\n\nSo for option A, fifth codon is CAG (Q), which matches the sequence.\n\nOption B's first part:\n\nLooking at option B's DNA:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\n1: ATG (1-3)\n\n2: GAG (4-6)\n\n3: GAG (7-9)\n\n4: CCC (10-12) \u2192 because the 10th nucleotide is G, 11th C, 12th G \u2192 GCG? Wait, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the letters.\n\nWait the DNA sequence for option B starts as:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCC GAG TC...\n\nWait, perhaps the fourth codon is different. Let me write the first 18 nucleotides of option B as a string:\n\nThe first 18 letters of option B's DNA are:\n\nA T G G A G G A G C C G C A G T C A G A T C C T A G C G T C G A G C C G C C T C T G A G T C A G G A A A C A T T T T C A G A C C T A T G G A A A C T A C T T C C T G A A A A C A A C G T T C T G T C C C C G T T G C C G T C C C A A G C A A T G G A T G A T T T G A T G C T G T C C C C G G A C G A T A T T G A A C A A T G G T T C A C T G A A G A C C C A G G T C C A G A T G A A G C T C C C A G A A T G C C A G A G G C T G C T C C C C C C G T G G C C C T G C A C C A G C A G C T C C T A C A C C G C G G C C C C T G C A C C A G C C C C C T C C T G G C C C T G T C A T C T T C T G T C C C T T C C C A G A A A A C C T A C C A G G G C A G C T A C G G T T T C C G T C T G G G C T T C T T G C A T T C T G G G A C A G C C A A G T C T G T G A C T T G C A C G T A C T C C C C T G C C C T C A A C A A G A T G T T T T G C C A A C T G G C C A A G A C C T G C C C T G T G C A G C T G T G G G T T G A T T C C A C A C C C C C G C C C G G C A C C C G C G T C C G C G C C A T G G C C A T C T A C A A G C A G T C A C A G C A C A T G A C G G A G G T T G T G A G G C G C T G C C C C A C C A T G A G C G C T G C T C A G A T A G C G A T G G T C T G G C C C T C C T C A G C A T C T T A T C C G A G T G G A A G G A A A T T T G C G T G T G G A G T A T T T G G A T G A C A G A A A C A C T T T T C G A C A T A G T G T G G T G G T G C C C T A T G A G C C G C C T G A G G T T G G C T C T G A C T G T A C C A C C A T C C A C T A C A A C T A C A T G T G T A A C A G T T C C T G C A T G G G C G G C A T G A A A C C G A G G C C C A T C C T C A C C A T C A T C A C A C T G G A A G A C T C C A G T G G T A A T C T A C T G G G A C G G A A C A G C T T T G A G G T G C G T G T T T G T G C C T G T C C T G G G A G A G A C C G G C G C A C A G A G G A A G A G A A T C T C C G C A A G A A A G G G G A G C C T C A C C A C G A G C T G C C G C C A G G G A G C A C T A A G C G A G C A C T G C C C A A C A A C A C C A G C T C C T C T C C C C C A G C C A A A G A A G A A A C C C T G G A T G G A G A A T A T T T C A C C C T T C A G A T C C G T G G G C G T G A G C G C T T C G A G A T G T T C C G A G A G C T G A A T G A G G C C T T G G A A C T C A A G G A T G C C C A G G C T G G G A A G G A G C C A G G G G G A G C A G G G C T C A C T C C A G C C A C C T G A A G T C C A A A A A G G G T C A G T C T A C C T C C C G C C A T A A A A A A A C T A T G T T C A A G A C A G A A G G G C C T G A C T C A G A C T G A\n\nWait, this is getting too long. Let me just look at the first few codons again.\n\nFor option B, after the first three codons (ATG, GAG, GAG), the fourth is CCC (positions 10-12), then the next triplet (positions 13-15) would be GAG (since the 10-12 is CCC, then 13-15 is GAG). Wait, let me see the exact letters.\n\nLooking at the first 15 nucleotides of option B's DNA:\n\nLetters 1-15: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGT (wait, let me count properly):\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the actual string given for option B. The first line of option B's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGTCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\n\nBreaking down the first 15 nucleotides:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (M)\n\n4-6: GAG (E)\n\n7-9: GAG (E)\n\n10-12: CCG (P)\n\nWait, the 10th nucleotide is C, 11th G, 12th C \u2192 C G C \u2192 so CCG is the fourth codon (positions 10-12). Then positions 13-15 would be CAG (the 13th is A, 14th T, 15th C? Wait, no. Wait the letters here:\n\nLooking at the first part: the first 15 letters of option B's DNA are:\n\nATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA...\n\nWait, perhaps I should write them out as:\n\nLetters 1-15:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G \u2192 ATG (1-3)\n\n4: G\n\n5: A\n\n6: G \u2192 GAG (4-6)\n\n7: G\n\n8: A\n\n9: G \u2192 GAG (7-9)\n\n10: C\n\n11: C\n\n12: G \u2192 CCG (10-12)\n\n13: C\n\n14: A\n\n15: G \u2192 CAG (13-15)\n\nSo the fifth codon (13-15) is CAG (Q), which matches the fifth amino acid (Q). So both A and B are matching up to here.\n\nHmm, so need to look further. Let's see the next amino acid. The sequence after M-E-E-P-Q is S (the sixth amino acid: QSDPS... So the sixth is S (Serine).\n\nSerine can be AGT, AGC, TCC, TCT, TCA, TCG. So the sixth codon (positions 16-18) should be one of those.\n\nLooking at option A's sixth codon (positions 16-18):\n\nContinuing from option A's DNA:\n\nAfter the first 15 (CAG), the next three nucleotides (positions 16-18) would be:\n\nLooking at the first part of A's DNA:\n\nAfter the first 15 (ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG), the next triplet would be TCA (positions 16-18: T C A \u2192 TCA).\n\nTCA codes for Serine (S). So that matches the sixth amino acid (S).\n\nNow check option B's sixth codon:\n\nThe sixth codon in B's DNA (positions 16-18):\n\nAfter the first 15 (CAG), the next triplet would be TCA (positions 16-18: T C A \u2192 TCA) as well. So also S. So both A and B are still matching.\n\nMoving on. The next amino acid is D (Aspartic acid). The seventh amino acid in the sequence is D.\n\nAspartic acid (D) is coded by GAT or GAC. Let's see what the seventh codon is (positions 19-21).\n\nLooking at option A's DNA:\n\nAfter the first 18 (positions 16-18: TCA), the next three (19-21):\n\nLooking at option A's DNA, after the first 18 letters (which are ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA), the next letters would be G (position 19?), but I need to track precisely. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for a point where the options differ. Since the options are A, B, C, D, perhaps some have different sequences further along.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the options is truncated. For example, option C is much shorter. Let me check the lengths.\n\nThe question says the P53 protein's amino acid sequence is provided, which is a long string. The DNA options are all very long, but maybe one of them is incomplete.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the amino acid sequence of this protein is as follows\" followed by a long string. Let me check the length of the given amino acid sequence.\n\nThe given amino acid sequence starts with \"MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD\"\n\nCounting the letters: Let's see, each amino acid is one letter. Let me count them roughly. The first part: \"MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD\"\n\nThat's a long sequence.

Let me see. Each line has about 60 characters, but the actual count is important. However, perhaps the key is that the DNA must have a length that's a multiple of 3 and matches the entire amino acid sequence. Let me check the lengths of the DNA options.\n\nOption C and D are presented in a different format. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption C's DNA is written in multiple lines, but perhaps it's shorter.

Not sure. Wait, perhaps the entire DNA sequence is written in multiple lines, but maybe option C's DNA is shorter than the required length. Let's see the length of the DNA sequences.\n\nThe DNA sequences for each option should be 3 times the number of amino acids. Since the amino acid sequence is about 393 residues, the DNA should be about 1179 nucleotides (393*3). Let's check the length of each option.\n\nOption A's DNA is a single long line. Let me count the characters. Alternatively, maybe I can see if any of the options have a different length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in one of the DNA sequences that causes a frameshift or a wrong codon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the options has a stop codon early. Since the P53 is a full-length protein, the DNA should not have a stop codon (TAG, TAA, TGA) before the end. Let me check for stop codons.\n\nWait, the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary, so the stop codons would be TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA (since mRNA's stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA, which correspond to TAA, TAG, TGA in DNA). So if any of the options have a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence before the end, that would be a problem.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nLet me check option C first. Let me look for any TAA, TAG, TGA in its DNA sequence.\n\nLooking at the first few lines of option C:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA AACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCCTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC GGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCT CCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGT CATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGG GACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCT GCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAG CAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCT GGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTT TTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACT ACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACT CCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGC ACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCA CTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAG ATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCT GGG AAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCC ATA AAAA ACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\n\nLooking for TGA (stop codon). For example, in the last line: \"ACTGA\" has TGA at the end. Wait, \"ACTGA\" ends with TGA? Let me see:\n\nThe last part of option C's DNA is \"...ATA AAAA ACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\"\n\nBreaking down the last few nucleotides:\n\nThe last few letters: ...CTGA. Wait, \"ACTGA\" would be the last few letters. Let's see:\n\nThe very end is \"ACTGA\". So the last codon would be ACT followed by G and A. But the last three would be TGA (the last three letters of the DNA sequence are TGA?), but it's better to see exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last codon is TGA (which is a stop). Let me see the exact end of option C's DNA sequence. The problem states that the DNA is the entire coding sequence, so if it ends with a stop codon, that's okay. But the P53 protein's sequence does not have a stop codon at the end because it's given without a stop. Wait, actually, the DNA should have a stop codon at the end, but the protein sequence provided doesn't include it. The question gives the amino acid sequence, which presumably ends before the stop codon. Therefore, the correct DNA should not have a stop codon in the middle but should end with a stop codon after the last amino acid.\n\nLooking at the options, perhaps option C has a stop codon in the middle. Let me check somewhere in the middle.\n\nLooking at the line: \"GACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\"\n\nLooking for TAA, TGA, or TAG.

The last few letters are \"ACTGA\", so the last codons would be ACT, G, A? Not sure. The exact stop codon would be at the end. But perhaps in the middle, there's a stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because it's the only one that matches all the way.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a discrepancy between the options. Let's look at a later part of the DNA sequences.\n\nLooking at the end of option C's DNA sequence: \"GACTGA\". The last three letters would be TGA, which is a stop codon. So if the DNA sequence ends with TGA, that would be okay if that's the final codon. But the given amino acid sequence ends with an SD (Serine and Asp?) or whatever the last amino acid is. Let me check the last few amino acids of the protein's sequence.\n\nThe amino acid sequence ends with \"...KTEGPDSD\". Let's see the last few letters: the last few are \"KTEGPDSD\". The last amino acid is D (Aspartic acid). So the DNA should end with a codon for D followed by a stop codon. Let's see:\n\nThe DNA's last few nucleotides (if the correct one is D) should code for the last D (GAT or GAC) and then a stop.\n\nLooking at option D's last part:\n\nOption D's DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\" (the last few letters are \"ACTGA\"). The last three nucleotides would be TGA (if the last three are TGA). Let me see:\n\nThe last part of option D is \"...ACTCAGACTGA\". The last three nucleotides are ACTGA? Wait, let me parse:\n\nThe last part of D's DNA is:\n\n\"...ACTCAGACTGA\" \u2192 the last three would be TGA, which is a stop codon. That would be okay. The codon before would be ACT (Threonine) followed by TGA (stop). But the last amino acid is D (GAT or GAC). So perhaps there's an issue here.\n\nAlternatively, the correct DNA should end with the codon for the last amino acid, then a stop. Let me see the last amino acid is D (the sequence ends with ...DSD, so last D is the second to last? Or last is D? Let me check.\n\nThe last few letters of the amino acid sequence given are \"...TEGPDSD\". The very last is D. So the last codon should be D (GAT/GAC), then a stop codon. So the DNA sequence should have the codon for D (GAT or GAC) followed by a stop (TAG, TAA, TGA).\n\nLooking at option D's last part:\n\nThe DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\". The last three nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop. The previous three would be ACT (Threonine), but the last amino acid should be D. So that would not match. Therefore, option D might be incorrect here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the exact last few amino acids:\n\nThe amino acid sequence ends with \"...KTEGPDSD\". Let me count from the end:\n\nThe last few letters are:\n\n...KTEGPDSD \u2192 the last is D, preceded by S, D, P, G, E, T, K.\n\nSo the last amino acid is D (position X), then before that S (X-1), D (X-2), etc.\n\nSo the DNA should have a codon for D (GAT/GAC) at the end before the stop.\n\nIf option D ends with TGA (stop), then the previous codon must be D. Let me see:\n\nIn option D's DNA, the last few codons:\n\nThe last part is \"...ACTCAGACTGA\". Breaking into codons:\n\nThe last few codons before the stop would be:\n\n...ACT CAG ACT GA (but GA is only two letters). Wait, the exact last part:\n\nThe last part of the DNA sequence in option D is:\n\n\"ACTCAGACTGA\" \u2192 breaking into codons:\n\nACT CAG ACT GA \u2192 but GA is not a full codon. Wait, perhaps the last codons are ACT, CAG, ACT, and then the stop TGA? Wait, no. Let me parse it properly.\n\nThe letters before the final TGA are:\n\n...ACT CAG ACT GA. Wait, perhaps the last full codon before the stop is ACT (Threonine), then the stop is TGA. That would mean the last amino acid is Threonine, which doesn't match the D. So that's a problem. Therefore, option D has an incorrect stop codon placement, leading to the last amino acid being T instead of D. So D is incorrect.\n\nNow looking at option C's end:\n\nThe DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\". Same as D? Wait, maybe I need to check all options.\n\nOption A's last part:\n\nThe DNA sequence for A ends with \"...ACTGA\". The same issue? Let me see.\n\nOption A's DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\" as well? Let me check the last line of option A's DNA:\n\nOption A's last line is:\n\n\"ACTCAGACTGA\"\n\nSame as D. So the last codon before stop is ACT (Threonine), but the last amino acid should be D (Asp). So this suggests that options A and D have a problem here, while option B or C may not.\n\nWait, but let me check option B's DNA.\n\nOption B's DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\" as well? Let me look at option B's last part:\n\nLooking at option B's DNA's last line:\n\nThe DNA ends with \"...ACTGA\" as well. So all options except perhaps C have this issue?\n\nWait, looking at option C's DNA:\n\nThe last part of option C's DNA is \"...ACTGA\" as well? Let me check.\n\nWait, the last line of option C is: \"ATA AAAA ACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\"\n\nBreaking down the end: the last few codons would be ACT CAG ACT GA \u2192 same as others. So all options except maybe one have this error?\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is not present, but the question doesn't require the stop codon because the protein sequence is given without it. So maybe the DNA should not have a stop codon at the end, but that's unlikely because the DNA for a gene usually includes a stop codon. The protein sequence provided doesn't include the stop, so the DNA should have a stop after the last amino acid's codon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discrepancy is elsewhere. Let's think of another approach.\n\nAnother possible error is a frameshift. Let me check for any possible discrepancies in the middle.\n\nLet me look for a point where the options diverge. For example, perhaps in option B, at some point, there's a difference from the others.\n\nLooking at option B's DNA sequence compared to others.\n\nLooking back at the first few codons after the start:\n\nThe first few codons for all options up to the fifth (Q) are the same. The sixth is S (TCA), seventh D (GAT or GAC). Let me check the seventh codon in each option.\n\nThe seventh codon (positions 19-21):\n\nLooking at option A's DNA after the first 18 nucleotides (which were ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA (first six codons)), the next codon (positions 19-21) would be G (assuming the next letters are GAT? Let me parse more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a point where options differ. Let me check the codon corresponding to the amino acid D (the seventh amino acid).\n\nThe seventh amino acid is D (Aspartic acid), which is coded by GAT or GAC.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequences for each option:\n\nTake the seventh codon (positions 19-21):\n\nFor option A:\n\nThe first 21 nucleotides:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG (P)\n\n13-15: CAG (Q)\n\n16-18: TCA (S)\n\n19-21: GAT (assuming the next triplet is GAT). Let me see:\n\nLooking at option A's DNA:\n\nAfter the first 18 nucleotides (positions 1-18: ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA), the next three would be the next three letters. The DNA sequence for option A's first part continues as \"...GAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\" \n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the exact letters. Let me write the first 21 nucleotides of option A:\n\nOption A's first 21 nucleotides:\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG\n\n13-15: CAG\n\n16-18: TCA\n\n19-21: GAG (from the next letters?)\n\nWait, perhaps the next three after TCA (positions 16-18) are the next triplet. Let me see the actual letters:\n\nThe first part of option A's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\n\nBreaking down the first 21:\n\nAfter the first 18 (positions 1-18), the next three (19-21) would be the next triplet. The 19th nucleotide is G (from the next letters: after TCA comes G...). Let me see:\n\nThe sequence after the first 18 is \"GAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\" \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me look for a specific point where the options differ. For example, looking at option C and D, their DNA sequences are written with line breaks. Let me see if there are any obvious errors.\n\nOption C's DNA has a line break after \"GGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCT\" followed by

But wait, let's look at the first few letters of option C:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG (1)\n\n4-6: GAG (2)\n\n7-9: GAG (3)\n\n10-12: CCG (4)\n\n13-15: CAG (5)\n\n16-18: TCA (6)\n\nWait, perhaps there's a difference here.\n\nWait, the fourth codon (positions 10-12) is CCG (same as before), then positions 13-15: CAG (5th codon), positions 16-18: TCA (6th), same as before.\n\nContinuing:\n\nCodon7: positions 19-21: GAT (same as before?)\n\nWait, but in option C's DNA, the first line ends with \"...GCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\".\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in option C's DNA.\n\nLooking at the fourth codon in option C:\n\nAfter the first 12 nucleotides (positions 1-12):\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG\n\nThen positions 13-15: the next three nucleotides are CAG (same as A and B). So codon5 is CAG (Q).\n\nCodon6: positions 16-18: TCA (S).\n\nCodon7: positions 19-21: GAT (D).\n\nCodon8: positions 22-24: CAG (Q).\n\nCodon9: positions 25-27: AAT (N).\n\nCodon10: positions 28-30: TCC (S).\n\nCodon11: positions 31-33: TGA (stop codon). Oh! Here's a difference.\n\nIn option C's DNA, the 11th codon (positions 31-33) is TGA, which is a stop codon. But the 11th amino acid is S (from the amino acid sequence). The 11th amino acid is S (position 11 in the amino acids), so the 11th codon should encode S, not a stop. This would mean option C has a premature stop codon at position 11, making it incorrect.\n\nSo option C is incorrect due to a stop codon early.\n\nNow check option D.\n\nOption D's DNA sequence:\n\nThe first part of option D's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA AACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC GGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCT CCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGT CATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGG GACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCT GCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAG CAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCT GGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTT TTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACT ACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACT CCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGC ACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCA CTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAG ATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCT GGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGC CATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\n\nLet's look at the first 54 nucleotides (18 codons):\n\nThe first line of D's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nBreaking down into codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG (1-3)\n\nCodon2: GAG (4-6)\n\nCodon3: GAG (7-9)\n\nCodon4: CCG (10-12)\n\nCodon5: CAG (13-15)\n\nCodon6: TCA (16-18)\n\nCodon7: GAT (19-21)\n\nCodon8: CAG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: AAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: TCC (28-30)\n\nCodon11: TGA (31-33)\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as option C. But in the amino acid sequence, the 11th amino acid is S (position 11), so the 11th codon should be S, not a stop. So option D also has a stop codon at position 11, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but looking at option D's first line:\n\nThe DNA sequence after the first few lines:\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA AACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC GGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCT CCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGT CATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGG GACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCT GCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAG CAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCT GGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTT TTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACT ACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACT CCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGC ACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCA CTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAG ATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCT GGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGC CATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA\n\nThe first part up to codon 11:\n\nCodons 1-11 are the same as options A and B up to codon 10, but codon 11 is TGA (stop) in D. But this is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing option D's DNA.\n\nWait, let me re-examine option D's first few codons:\n\nOption D's DNA starts with:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...\n\nBreaking down the first 33 nucleotides (11 codons):\n\nCodon 1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCG\n\n5: CAG\n\n6: TCA\n\n7: GAT\n\n8: CAG\n\n9: AAT\n\n10: TCC\n\n11: TGA\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So the 11th codon is TGA, which is a stop, but the 11th amino acid is S, so this is wrong. Thus, option D also has an error.\n\nWait, this is confusing because all options have a stop codon at position 11?\n\nLooking back at the amino acid sequence, the 11th amino acid is S. Let me count again:\n\nThe amino acid sequence:\n\n1:M, 2:E, 3:E, 4:P, 5:Q, 6:S, 7:D, 8:L, 9:M, 10:L, 11:S.\n\nYes, the 11th is S. So the 11th codon must code for S. The codons for S are AGC, AGT, TCT, TCC, TCA, TCG.\n\nIn options A, B, D, the 11th codon is TGA (stop). Only option C has a different sequence? Wait no, option C also has TGA.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parsing of the DNA sequences. Let me look at option C's DNA again.\n\nOption C's DNA first line:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCG\n\n5: CAG\n\n6: TCC (positions 16-18)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's count the first 30 nucleotides of option C's DNA:\n\nPositions 1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG\n\n13-15: CAG\n\n16-18: TCC (positions 16-18: TCC)\n\nCodon6 is TCC (Serine).\n\nCodon7: positions19-21: C (wait, the next letters?)\n\nThe next letters after TCC would be the next triplet. Let me see:\n\nThe first line of option C's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nBreaking down:\n\nAfter the first 18 nucleotides (6 codons):\n\nThe next three (19-21) would be the 7th codon. Let's see:\n\nPositions 19-21: the next three letters after TCC (positions16-18) are:\n\nThe next letters are C (position19), T (20), A (21) \u2192 CTA (Leucine), which is L.\n\nBut the 7th amino acid is D (position7).\n\nHmm, this indicates that option C has an error here as well.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps the correct option is D, but I must have made a mistake in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct DNA is option D, but the error in the 11th codon is a typo in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me look at the 11th codon in option D's DNA again.\n\nThe first 33 nucleotides of option D's DNA:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG (1-3)\n\nCodon2: GAG (4-6)\n\nCodon3: GAG (7-9)\n\nCodon4: CCG (10-12)\n\nCodon5: CAG (13-15)\n\nCodon6: TCA (16-18)\n\nCodon7: GAT (19-21)\n\nCodon8: CAG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: AAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: TCC (28-30)\n\nCodon11: TGA (31-33)\n\nYes, that's correct. So option D also has a stop here. But this must be wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that all options have errors. But that can't be. Perhaps I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 11th codon is not a stop. Let me check the DNA sequence for option D again:\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence for option D's first part:\n\nThe 31-33 nucleotides are TGA, which is a stop codon. But the amino acid sequence requires an S here. So this is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe the DNA sequences are presented with line breaks that affect the count. For example, in option C and D, the DNA is written with line breaks after certain letters, which might split codons. Let me check.\n\nLooking at option C's DNA:\n\nThe first line is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nThe next line starts with \"AACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCCTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC\"\n\nWait, perhaps the line breaks don't split the codons. For example, the first line ends with \"GGA\", and the next line starts with \"AACT...\", so the 31st-33rd nucleotides would be the last three of the first line and the first of the next line?\n\nWait, no, the line break is after \"GGA\", so the next line starts with \"AACT...\", so the 31-33 would be the last three of the first line (positions 31-33 are the last three of the first line):\n\nThe first line has:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nTotal length: let's count letters:\n\nEach segment:\n\nATG (3), GAG (3), GAG (3), CCG (3), CAG (3), TCC (3), C (1?), wait no, let me count the entire first line:\n\n\"ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\"\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nThat's 60 characters (assuming each word is counted without spaces). Let me check:\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from A:\n\nA T G G A G G A G C C G C A G T C A G A T C C T A G C G T C G A G C C C C C T C T G A G T C A G G A A A C A T T T T C A G A C C T A T G G A \u2192 that's 60 letters.\n\nSo the first line is 60 nucleotides, which is 20 codons (60/3=20).\n\nThe 11th codon (positions 30-32) would be the 11th codon: positions 30-32:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nThe first 20 codons (60 nucleotides):\n\nCodon1: 1-3: ATG\n\nCodon2:4-6: GAG\n\nCodon3:7-9: GAG\n\nCodon4:10-12: CCG\n\nCodon5:13-15: CAG\n\nCodon6:16-18: TCC\n\nCodon7:19-21: C (wait, let's do it properly.\n\nWait, let me break the first 60 nucleotides into codons:\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: GAG\n\n7-9: GAG\n\n10-12: CCG\n\n13-15: CAG\n\n16-18: TCC\n\n19-21: C (wait, the next three letters after 18 are the 19th-21st:\n\nThe 19th nucleotide is C (position 19), then T (20), A (21). So codon7: CTA (Leucine).\n\nCodon8:22-24: G (position22) T (23), A (24) \u2192 GTA (Valine)\n\nCodon9:25-27: C (25), T (26), A (27) \u2192 CTA (Leucine)\n\nCodon10:28-30: G (28), C (29), G (30) \u2192 GCG (Alanine)\n\nCodon11:31-33: T (31), C (32), T (33) \u2192 TCT (Serine)\n\nAh! Here's the mistake I made earlier. I thought the 11th codon was TGA, but that's incorrect.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nFirst line of option C's DNA is 60 nucleotides:\n\nBreaking down codons 1-20:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCG\n\n5: CAG\n\n6: TCC\n\n7: CTA\n\n8: GTA\n\n9: CTA\n\n10: GCG\n\n11: TCT (positions31-33)\n\nSo the 11th codon is TCT (Serine), which matches the 11th amino acid (S). That's correct.\n\nEarlier mistake was because I miscounted the positions due to the line breaks. So option C's 11th codon is TCT (Serine), which is correct.\n\nNow, proceeding to codon 18 (the V):\n\nContinuing:\n\nCodon11: TCT (S)\n\nCodon12: positions 34-36: C (34), T (35), G (36) \u2192 CTG (Leucine)\n\nCodon13:37-39: A (37), G (38), T (39) \u2192 AGT (Serine)\n\nCodon14:40-42: C (40), A (41), G (42) \u2192 CAG (Gln)\n\nCodon15:43-45: A (43), A (44), T (45) \u2192 AAT (Asn)\n\nCodon16:46-48: T (46), T (47), T (48) \u2192 TTT (Phe)\n\nCodon17:49-51: T (49), C (50), A (51) \u2192 TCA (Ser)\n\nCodon18:52-54: G (52), A (53), A (54) \u2192 GAA (Glu)\n\nHmm, but the 18th amino acid is V (Valine), which should be GTC, GTT, GTA, or GTG.\n\nCodon18 in option C is GAA (Glu), which is incorrect. So option C also has an error here.\n\nNow, let's check option D again with the correct parsing.\n\nOption D's first line is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nThis is also 60 nucleotides (same as option C).\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCG\n\n5: CAG\n\n6: TCA (positions 16-18)\n\nWait, let me parse option D's first line:\n\nThe first line of option D's DNA is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nCodon1-20:\n\n1: ATG (1-3)\n\n2: GAG (4-6)\n\n3: GAG (7-9)\n\n4: CCG (10-12)\n\n5: CAG (13-15)\n\n6: TCA (16-18)\n\n7: GAT (19-21)\n\n8: CAG (22-24)\n\n9: AAT (25-27)\n\n10: TCC (28-30)\n\n11: TGA (31-33)\n\nWait, this brings us back to the previous issue. So option D's 11th codon is TGA (stop), which is wrong.\n\nBut option C's first line was different due to the \"CCCCC\" part.\n\nWait, perhaps option C's DNA is correct up to the 18th codon?\n\nLet me recheck option C's 18th codon:\n\nContinuing from codon 1-20 in option C's first line (60 nucleotides):\n\nCodon18: positions 52-54:\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\nCodons 1-20 for option C's first line:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: GAG\n\n3: GAG\n\n4: CCG\n\n5: CAG\n\n6: TCC (positions16-18)\n\n7: CTA (19-21)\n\n8: GTA (22-24)\n\n9: CTA (25-27)\n\n10: GCG (28-30)\n\n11: TCT (31-33)\n\n12: CTG (34-36)\n\n13: AGT (37-39)\n\n14: CAG (40-42)\n\n15: AAT (43-45)\n\n16: TTT (46-48)\n\n17: TCA (49-51)\n\n18: GAA (52-54)\n\nHmm, so codon18 is GAA (Glu), which is incorrect for V.\n\nNow, what about option D?\n\nOption D's first line's codons:\n\n1-20:\n\nCodon6 is TCA (positions16-18)\n\nCodon7: GAT (19-21)\n\nCodon8: CAG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: AAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: TCC (28-30)\n\nCodon11: TGA (31-33)\n\nCodon12: positions 34-36: the next three after TGA are the next letters.\n\nAfter the first line (60 nucleotides), the next line starts with \"AACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC\"\n\nSo codon11 in option D is TGA (stop), which is wrong.\n\nThis is perplexing. All options seem to have errors. But the question states that one of them is correct. Perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, the error is in the 18th codon (V) and the correct option is the one that has a GTG there.\n\nLooking back at the 18th amino acid is V (Valine), which is encoded by GTG, GTT, GTC, or GTA.\n\nLooking for option D's 18th codon:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse further for option C and D.\n\nLet me try option D again, but consider that the first line is 60 nucleotides (20 codons), so the 18th codon is codon18 in the first line.\n\nCodon18 of option D's first line:\n\nCodon1-20:\n\nCodon18 would be the 18th codon, which is at positions 52-54.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nCodon17: positions49-51: TCA (Ser)\n\nCodon18:52-54: G (52), G (53), A (54) \u2192 GGA (Gly)\n\nSame as A and B. So incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is option C, but with the 18th codon being different.\n\nOption C's first line is 60 nucleotides:\n\nCodon18 is positions52-54: GAA (Glu)\n\nStill not V.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the first few codons where I thought they were correct but actually there's a difference.\n\nLet me check the 7th codon (the D amino acid).\n\nThe 7th amino acid is D (Aspartic acid), which is GAT or GAC.\n\nLooking at option C's 7th codon (positions19-21):\n\nCodon7 is CTA (Leucine), which is incorrect.\n\nAh! Here's the issue. The seventh amino acid should be D, but option C has L there. So option C is wrong.\n\nOption D's 7th codon is GAT (positions19-21):\n\nCodon7 of option D is GAT (D), which is correct.\n\nWait, option D's first line codons:\n\nCodon7: positions19-21: GAT (D), which is correct.\n\nCodon11 of option D is TGA (stop), which is wrong.\n\nBut option C's codon7 is wrong (CTA instead of D).\n\nOption A and B have codon7 as GAT (correct).\n\nSo the correct options up to codon7 are A, B, D.\n\nBut codon11 is a problem for D.\n\nOption A's codon11 is TGA (stop) as well.\n\nWait, option A's first line is:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\n\nThe first line has 60 nucleotides (20 codons):\n\nCodon11 would be positions31-33:\n\nCodon1-20 for A:\n\nCodon11: TGA (stop).\n\nSo A has a stop at codon11, which is wrong.\n\nOption B's first line:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAA...\n\nCodon11 is TGA (stop), same as A and D.\n\nThus, the only option that has the correct seventh codon (GAT for D) and avoids the TGA stop at codon11 is none of them? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the line breaks.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is in option D's DNA after the first line.\n\nLet me look at option D's DNA after the first line.\n\nAfter the first line (60 nucleotides), the next line starts with:\n\nAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCC\n\nSo codon11 (positions31-33 in the first line) is TGA (stop). But the next line continues from position61:\n\nThe next codon (21st) would be the first three of the next line: A A C \u2192 AAC (N).\n\nSo codon11 is indeed TGA (stop), which is incorrect.\n\nOption C's first line's codon11 is TCT (S), which is correct.\n\nBut option C has codon7 as CTA (L) instead of D. So option C is wrong there.\n\nOption B's codon7 is GAT (D), codon11 is TGA (stop).\n\nHmm, this is a puzzle. Perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the stop codon at position11 is a typo, but the options are presented correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D and the stop codon at position11 is a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counting of the first line's nucleotides for option D.\n\nLet me re-express option D's first line's codons again:\n\nFirst line:\n\nATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nCodon1: ATG (1-3)\n\nCodon2: GAG (4-6)\n\nCodon3: GAG (7-9)\n\nCodon4: CCG (10-12)\n\nCodon5: CAG (13-15)\n\nCodon6: TCA (16-18)\n\nCodon7: GAT (19-21)\n\nCodon8: CAG (22-24)\n\nCodon9: AAT (25-27)\n\nCodon10: TCC (28-30)\n\nCodon11: TGA (31-33)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, option D has a stop at position11, which is wrong.\n\nThis suggests that none of the options are correct, but that's impossible. Perhaps I made a mistake in the amino acid sequence count.\n\nLet me recount the first few amino acids:\n\nThe sequence starts with M-E-E-P-Q-S-D-L-M-L-S-P-D-D-L-M-L-S-P-D-D-I-E-Q-W-F-T-E-D-P-G-P-D-E-A-P-R-M-P-E-A-A-P-P-V-A-P-A-P-A-P-T-A-P-A-P-A-P-S-W-P-L-S-S-S-V-P-S-Q-K-T-Y-Q-G-S-Y-G-F-R-L-G-F-L-H-S-G-T-A-K-S-V-T-C-T-Y-S-P-A-L-N-K-M-F-C-Q-L-A-K-T-C-P-V-Q-L-W-V-D-S-T-P-P-P-G-T-R-V-R-A-M-A-I-Y-K-Q-S-Q-H-M-T-E-V-V-R-R-C-P-H-H-E-R-C-S-D-S-D-G-L-A-P-P-Q-H-L-I-R-V-E-G-N-L-R-V-E-Y-L-D-D-R-N-T-F-R-H-S-V-V-V-P-Y-E-P-P-E-V-G-S-D-C-T-T-I-H-Y-N-Y-M-C-N-S-S-C-M-G-G-M-N-R-R-P-I-L-T-I-I-T-E-L-D-S-S-G-N-L-L-G-R-N-S-F-E-V-R-V-C-A-C-P-G-R-D-R-R-T-E-E-E-N-L-R-K-K-G-E-P-H-H-E-L-P-P-G-S-T-K-R-A-L-P-N-N-T-S-S-S-P-Q-P-K-K-K-P-L-D-G-E-Y-F-T-L-Q-I-R-G-R-E-R-F-E-M-F-R-E-L-N-E-A-L-E-K-D-A-Q-A-G-K-E-P-G-G-S-R-A-H-S-S-H-L-K-S-K-K-G-Q-S-T-S-R-H-K-K-L-M-F-K-T-E-G-P-D-S-D\n\nThe 11th amino acid is S (position 11). The 11th codon must be TCT (as in option C), but option C has a mistake at codon7.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct option is C, and the error at codon7 is a typo in the problem's options?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the codon for D.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is D, and the TGA is a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that option D's DNA is the longest, but that's not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in option A's fourth codon.\n\nLooking back at the first few codons:\n\nThe fourth codon is CCG (Proline). The fourth amino acid is P, which matches.\n\nThe fifth codon is CAG (Q), which matches.\n\nThe sixth codon is TCA (S), matches.\n\nThe seventh codon is GAT (D), which matches.\n\nThe eighth codon is CAG (Q), which is the eighth amino acid L?\n\nWait, the eighth amino acid is L.\n\nThe eighth amino acid is L, which is encoded by CTG, CTC, CTA, CTG, CTT, or CAA (No, L is CTX or ATT? No. L is CTX (CTG, CTC, CTT, CTA) or ATT? No, ATT is Isoleucine.\n\nWait, the eighth amino acid is L (Leucine). The codons for L are UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG.\n\nIn DNA, the coding strand would be TAA, TAG, or CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG.\n\nThe eighth codon in option A is CAG (Q), which is Glutamine, but the eighth amino acid is L (Leucine). Thus, option A is wrong here.\n\nAh! This is the key mistake.\n\nThe eighth amino acid is L (position8 in the sequence: M-E-E-P-Q-S-D-L-...).\n\nThe eighth codon must be Leucine (L), but option A's eighth codon is CAG (Q). So option A is incorrect.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nThe eighth amino acid is L. The eighth codon (positions22-24):\n\nFor option A:\n\nCodon8 is positions22-24: CAG (Q). This is wrong.\n\nOption B's eighth codon is also CAG (Q), which is incorrect.\n\nOption C's eighth codon is GTA (Valine), which is V, not L.\n\nOption D's eighth codon is CAG (Q), also wrong.\n\nWait, so none of the options have the correct codon for the eighth amino acid (L).\n\nHmm, this is a problem. But the options must have one correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counting of the amino acids.\n\nLet me recount the first few amino acids:\n\n1:M\n\n2:E\n\n3:E\n\n4:P\n\n5:Q\n\n6:S\n\n7:D\n\n8:L\n\n9:M\n\n10:L\n\n11:S\n\n12:P\n\n13:D\n\n14:D\n\n15:L\n\n16:M\n\n17:L\n\n18:S\n\n19:P\n\n20:D\n\n21:D\n\n22:I\n\n23:E\n\n24:Q\n\n25:W\n\n26:F\n\n27:T\n\n28:E\n\n29:D\n\n30:P\n\n31:G\n\n32:P\n\n33:D\n\n34:E\n\n35:A\n\n36:P\n\n37:R\n\n38:M\n\n39:P\n\n40:E\n\n41:A\n\n42:A\n\n43:P\n\n44:P\n\n45:V\n\n46:A\n\n47:P\n\n48:A\n\n49:P\n\n50:A\n\n51:P\n\n52:T\n\n53:A\n\n54:P\n\n55:A\n\n56:P\n\n57:A\n\n58:P\n\n59:S\n\n60:W\n\n61:P\n\n62:L\n\n63:S\n\n64:S\n\n65:S\n\n66:V\n\n67:P\n\n68:S\n\n69:Q\n\n70:K\n\n71:T\n\n72:Y\n\n73:Q\n\n74:G\n\n75:S\n\n76:Y\n\n77:G\n\n78:F\n\n79:R\n\n80:L\n\n81:G\n\n82:F\n\n83:L\n\n84:H\n\n85:S\n\n86:G\n\n87:T\n\n88:A\n\n89:K\n\n90:S\n\n91:V\n\n92:T\n\n93:C\n\n94:T\n\n95:Y\n\n96:S\n\n97:P\n\n98:A\n\n99:L\n\n100:N\n\n101:K\n\n102:M\n\n103:F\n\n104:C\n\n105:Q\n\n106:L\n\n107:A\n\n108:K\n\n109:T\n\n110:C\n\n111:P\n\n112:V\n\n113:Q\n\n114:L\n\n115:W\n\n116:V\n\n117:D\n\n118:S\n\n119:T\n\n120:P\n\n121:P\n\n122:P\n\n123:G\n\n124:T\n\n125:R\n\n126:V\n\n127:R\n\n128:A\n\n129:M\n\n130:A\n\n131:I\n\n132:Y\n\n133:K\n\n134:Q\n\n135:S\n\n136:Q\n\n137:H\n\n138:M\n\n139:T\n\n140:E\n\n141:V\n\n142:V\n\n143:R\n\n144:R\n\n145:C\n\n146:P\n\n147:H\n\n148:H\n\n149:E\n\n150:R\n\n151:C\n\n152:S\n\n153:D\n\n154:S\n\n155:D\n\n156:G\n\n157:L\n\n158:A\n\n159:P\n\n160:P\n\n161:Q\n\n162:H\n\n163:L\n\n164:I\n\n165:R\n\n166:V\n\n167:E\n\n168:G\n\n169:N\n\n170:L\n\n171:R\n\n172:V\n\n173:E\n\n174:Y\n\n175:L\n\n176:D\n\n177:D\n\n178:R\n\n179:N\n\n180:T\n\n181:F\n\n182:R\n\n183:H\n\n184:S\n\n185:V\n\n186:V\n\n187:V\n\n188:P\n\n189:Y\n\n190:E\n\n191:P\n\n192:P\n\n193:E\n\n194:V\n\n195:G\n\n196:S\n\n197:D\n\n198:C\n\n199:T\n\n200:T\n\n201:I\n\n202:H\n\n203:Y\n\n204:N\n\n205:Y\n\n206:M\n\n207:C\n\n208:N\n\n209:S\n\n210:S\n\n211:C\n\n212:M\n\n213:G\n\n214:G\n\n215:M\n\n216:N\n\n217:R\n\n218:R\n\n219:P\n\n220:I\n\n221:L\n\n222:T\n\n223:I\n\n224:I\n\n225:T\n\n226:E\n\n227:L\n\n228:D\n\n229:S\n\n230:S\n\n231:G\n\n232:N\n\n233:L\n\n234:L\n\n235:G\n\n236:R\n\n237:N\n\n238:S\n\n239:F\n\n240:E\n\n241:V\n\n242:R\n\n243:V\n\n244:C\n\n245:A\n\n246:C\n\n247:P\n\n248:G\n\n249:R\n\n250:D\n\n251:R\n\n252:R\n\n253:T\n\n254:E\n\n255:E\n\n256:E\n\n257:N\n\n258:L\n\n259:R\n\n260:K\n\n261:K\n\n262:G\n\n263:E\n\n264:P\n\n265:H\n\n266:H\n\n267:E\n\n268:L\n\n269:P\n\n270:P\n\n271:G\n\n272:S\n\n273:T\n\n274:K\n\n275:R\n\n276:A\n\n277:L\n\n278:P\n\n279:N\n\n280:N\n\n281:T\n\n282:S\n\n283:S\n\n284:S\n\n285:P\n\n286:Q\n\n287:P\n\n288:K\n\n289:K\n\n290:K\n\n291:P\n\n292:L\n\n293:D\n\n294:G\n\n295:E\n\n296:Y\n\n297",
