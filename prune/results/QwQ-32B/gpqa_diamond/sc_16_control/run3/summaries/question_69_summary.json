      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X\u2070 that decays into Y+ and Z\u2212. The proper lifetime of X\u2070 is given as \u03c4\u2080 = 8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions in meters. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the proper lifetime means. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (like the bubble chamber), the particle might be moving, so its lifetime would be dilated due to time dilation from special relativity. The lifetime observed in the lab frame would be \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. \n\nThe resolution needed probably relates to how far the particle travels before decaying. The detector resolution must be small enough to distinguish the decay point from the starting point. So the distance the particle travels during its lifetime in the lab frame must be less than the resolution? Wait, actually, maybe the resolution has to be smaller than that distance so you can see the decay. Wait, no, if the particle travels some distance, the detector's resolution must be able to resolve that distance so you can see the decay happened. So the minimum resolution needed would be the average distance traveled, perhaps? Hmm, but how does the 30% come into play here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the spatial resolution needed such that the detector can resolve the decay within the lifetime. But I need to think more precisely.\n\nLet me think step by step. The proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 is 8e-16 s. The lab frame's lifetime \u03c4 is longer because of time dilation. To compute \u03c4, I need to find \u03b3, which requires knowing the velocity of the particle in the lab frame. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. The energy of the particle is related to its total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, so E = \u03b3mc\u00b2. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2). Since the mass is given in GeV, which is actually the rest mass energy, right? Because in particle physics, mass is often expressed in energy units via E=mc\u00b2. So here, the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2, so the rest mass energy is 3.41 GeV. The total energy E is given as 27 GeV, so \u03b3 would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, so 27/3.41 is approximately 7.917. So \u03b3 is roughly 7.92. \n\nTherefore, the lab frame lifetime \u03c4 is \u03b3\u03c4\u2080 = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 * 8 = 63.36, so \u03c4 \u2248 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 seconds. \n\nNow, the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is v * \u03c4. But I need to find v. Since we have \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), and also E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Alternatively, since we know \u03b3, we can find v from \u03b3. Alternatively, maybe we can find v through the relation between kinetic energy and velocity. Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and we have E, m, so \u03b3 is known. The velocity v can be found using the relation between \u03b3 and v. Let me recall that v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 1/\u03b3\u00b2 would be 1/(7.92)^2 \u2248 1/62.7264 \u2248 0.01594. So 1 - 0.01594 = 0.98406. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(0.98406) \u2248 0.992. So v \u2248 c * 0.992. \n\nSo the velocity is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. Let me confirm that calculation again. Let me do it more accurately. \n\n\u03b3 = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.9179. Then 1/\u03b3\u00b2 = 1/(7.9179)^2 = 1/(62.693) \u2248 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. The square root of that is sqrt(0.98405) \u2248 0.992, yes. So v \u2248 0.992c.\n\nTherefore, the speed is roughly 0.992c. \n\nThe distance traveled in the lab frame is then v * \u03c4. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 * 8e-16 s \u2248 6.334e-15 s. \n\nv is 0.992c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo the distance d = v * \u03c4 = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, multiply 0.992 and 3e8: 0.992 * 3e8 \u2248 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply that by 6.334e-15 s: \n\n2.976e8 * 6.334e-15 = (2.976 * 6.334) * 1e-7. Let's compute 2.976 * 6.334. \n\n2.976 * 6 = 17.856, 2.976 * 0.334 \u2248 2.976 * 0.3 = 0.8928 and 2.976*0.034\u22480.1012, so total \u22480.994. So total 17.856 + 0.994 \u224818.85. \n\nSo approximately 18.85e-7 m? Wait, 1e-7? Wait, 1e8 * 1e-15 is 1e-7, right. So 18.85e-7 meters. Wait, but 2.976e8 *6.334e-15 = (2.976*6.334)*(1e8 *1e-15) = (18.85)*(1e-7) = 1.885e-6 meters? Wait, no, 18.85e-7 is 1.885e-6 meters. Wait, 18.85e-7 is 1.885 \u00d7 10^-6. \n\nHmm. So the distance is approximately 1.885e-6 meters? Wait, but the options have 2.08e-6, which is close. Hmm, maybe my approximations are off. Let me do a more precise calculation.\n\nLet me re-calculate the gamma value first. \n\nGiven that E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV. So \u03b3 = E/(m c\u00b2) but wait, actually, E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2. Since the mass here is already given in GeV/c\u00b2, so m c\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. Therefore, \u03b3 is E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.9179.\n\nSo \u03b3 is correct. \n\nThen, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2). Let's compute 1/\u03b3\u00b2 exactly. 7.9179 squared is (7.9179)^2. Let me compute 7.9^2 is 62.41, 0.0179^2 is negligible but let's do precise:\n\n7.9179 *7.9179:\n\nLet me compute 7.9 * 7.9 = 62.41. \n\nThen 0.0179*7.9179*2 + (0.0179)^2. Wait, perhaps better to do (7.9179)^2:\n\nLet me write it as (7.9 + 0.0179)^2 = 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.0179 + (0.0179)^2.\n\n7.9\u00b2 is 62.41, 2*7.9*0.0179 = 2*7.9*0.0179 \u2248 15.8 *0.0179 \u22480.283. \n\n0.0179 squared is ~0.00032. \n\nTotal: 62.41 + 0.283 + 0.00032 \u2248 62.6933. \n\nSo 1/(\u03b3\u00b2) is 1/62.6933 \u2248 0.01595. \n\nThus, 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. \n\nSquare root of 0.98405: sqrt(0.98405) \u2248 let's see, sqrt(0.98) is approx 0.9899, sqrt(0.98405) is slightly higher. Let me compute 0.992 squared is 0.984064. Oh! Exactly. Because 0.992 squared is (0.99 + 0.002)^2 = 0.9801 + 2*0.99*0.002 + 0.000004 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004 = 0.984064. So sqrt(0.98405) is very close to 0.992. So v = 0.992c exactly. \n\nSo that part is precise. \n\nThus, v = 0.992c. \n\nNow, \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 * 8e-16. Let me compute that exactly. \n\n7.9179 *8 = 63.3432, so \u03c4 =63.3432e-16 s =6.33432e-15 seconds. \n\nThen, the distance is v * \u03c4 = 0.992 * c * \u03c4. \n\nc is 3e8 m/s. \n\nSo 0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s. \n\nMultiply by \u03c4 (6.33432e-15 s):\n\n2.976e8 *6.33432e-15 = \n\nLet me compute 2.976 *6.33432 first. \n\n2.976 *6 = 17.856 \n\n2.976 *0.33432 \u2248 2.976 *0.3 = 0.8928, plus 2.976 *0.03432 \u22480.102. So total approx 0.8928 +0.102 =0.9948. \n\nTotal is 17.856 +0.9948 = 18.8508. \n\nSo 18.8508e-7 meters? Wait, because 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7. \n\nWait, 2.976e8 (m/s) * 6.33432e-15 s = 2.976 *6.33432 *1e-7 m. \n\nYes, so 18.8508 *1e-7 m = 1.88508e-6 meters. \n\nHmm, so that's approximately 1.885e-6 meters, which is 1.885 micrometers. \n\nBut the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers, which is close but not exactly the same. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me recheck the multiplication:\n\nWait, 2.976e8 m/s multiplied by 6.33432e-15 s:\n\nThe exponents: 1e8 *1e-15 = 1e-7. \n\nSo 2.976 * 6.33432 = ?\n\nLet me do this more accurately. 2.976 \u00d7 6.33432:\n\nFirst, 2 \u00d76.33432 = 12.66864\n\n0.9 \u00d76.33432 = 5.700888\n\n0.07 \u00d76.33432 = 0.4434024\n\n0.006 \u00d76.33432 =0.03800592\n\nAdding all together:\n\n12.66864 +5.700888 = 18.369528\n\n+0.4434024 = 18.8129304\n\n+0.03800592 = 18.85093632\n\nSo total is approximately 18.8509, so 18.8509e-7 m is indeed 1.885e-6 meters. \n\nHmm. The answer given in the options is 2.08e-6 m. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\". So maybe the calculation I did gives the average distance, but since the decay is a probabilistic process, the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay within the lifetime such that 30% of the decays are detected. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the decay length distribution and wants the resolution to capture 30%?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. Wait, maybe I need to use the relation between the proper lifetime and the lab lifetime, but also account for the fact that the decay occurs over a time that is spread out due to the distribution. \n\nWait, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The proper lifetime is the mean lifetime. The lab frame lifetime is \u03c4 = \u03b3\u03c4\u2080. The distance traveled would be v*\u03c4, which is the mean distance. But perhaps the question is about the spatial resolution needed so that the detector can resolve the decay within the distance traveled before the particle decays, but considering that 30% of the decays happen before that distance?\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays are observed. The probability that a particle decays within a distance d is equal to the probability that it decays within time t = d / v. The decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/\u03c4). We need this probability to be at least 30%, so 0.3 = 1 - exp(-d/(v\u03c4)). \n\nLet me see. Let me think of it this way: the probability that the particle decays within a certain distance d is the probability that the lifetime is less than d/v. Since the lifetime distribution is exponential with mean \u03c4, the probability P(t < d/v) = 1 - exp(- (d/v)/\u03c4 ). \n\nWe need this probability to be at least 30%, so:\n\n1 - exp( -d/(v \u03c4) ) \u2265 0.3 \n\n=> exp(-d/(v \u03c4)) \u2264 0.7 \n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\n- d/(v \u03c4) \u2264 ln(0.7) \n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\nd/(v \u03c4) \u2265 - ln(0.7) \n\nThus,\n\nd \u2265 v \u03c4 * (-ln(0.7)) \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so -ln(0.7) is positive. \n\nCalculating ln(0.7) \u2248 -0.35667. So -ln(0.7) \u2248 0.3567. \n\nTherefore, d must be at least v \u03c4 * 0.3567. \n\nWait, so the required distance d (so the resolution must be at least this distance?) Wait, no. Wait the resolution needs to be small enough to distinguish the decay point from the starting point. So the minimum resolution required is the distance that corresponds to the 30% probability. Wait, perhaps the question wants the average distance, but the options don't match that. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the average distance as the required resolution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the problem's parameters. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says: \"What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the resolution must be smaller than the average distance traveled, so that the detector can resolve the decay within that distance. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution required is the distance the particle travels during its lifetime, but adjusted for the 30% probability. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's go back to the previous approach. The probability that a decay occurs within distance d is P = 1 - exp(-d/(v \u03c4)). We need P \u2265 0.3. So solving for d:\n\n1 - exp(-d/(v \u03c4)) \u2265 0.3 \u2192 exp(-d/(v \u03c4)) \u2264 0.7 \u2192 -d/(v \u03c4) \u2264 ln(0.7) \u2192 d \u2265 - v \u03c4 ln(0.7).\n\nWait, so d must be at least that value. The minimum resolution would need to be less than that distance so that the detector can resolve the decay. Wait, perhaps the resolution is the distance that the particle travels before the detector can resolve the decay. So the minimum resolution required is the distance at which 30% of the decays have happened, so that you can see them. Hence, the required resolution is the d where P=0.3. So that would be d = - v \u03c4 ln(0.7). \n\nCalculating that: \n\nv \u03c4 = (v)*(\u03c4) = (0.992c)*(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) = 0.992c * (\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080). Wait but earlier, I had v \u03c4 = (v)*(\u03b3 \u03c4\u2080) since \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080. \n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, v \u03c4 is v multiplied by the lab lifetime \u03c4. \n\nWait, let me compute d using this formula. \n\nFirst, let's compute v \u03c4:\n\nv is 0.992c, \u03c4 is \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.9179 *8e-16 = 6.334e-15 s.\n\nv \u03c4 = 0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s \n\nWait, but that's exactly the same as before. Wait, that's the same as the mean distance traveled, which is v multiplied by \u03c4. \n\nWait, but in the formula above, d = - v \u03c4 ln(0.7). \n\nWait, let me compute that. \n\nFirst, v \u03c4 is the mean distance, which is 1.885e-6 m (as before). \n\nMultiply that by (-ln(0.7)) \u2248 0.3567. \n\nWait, so d = 1.885e-6 * 0.3567 \u2248 ?\n\nLet's compute 1.885 * 0.3567. \n\n1.885 * 0.35 = 0.65975 \n\n1.885 *0.0067 \u22480.01263 \n\nTotal \u22480.65975 +0.01263 = 0.67238 \n\nSo d \u22480.67238e-6 m? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, sorry, the units. Wait, v \u03c4 is 1.885e-6 m. \n\nSo d = 1.885e-6 m * 0.3567 \u2248 (1.885 *0.3567) e-6 m \u2248 0.672e-6 m. \n\nHmm, that gives 6.72e-7 m, which is 0.672 micrometers. But the options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted the equation. Let me check again:\n\nWe had:\n\nd = - v \u03c4 * ln(0.7). \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so the negative makes it positive. \n\nWait, the correct equation is d = v \u03c4 * ( - ln(0.7) ), which is exactly what I did. \n\nWait, so the required d is 0.3567 * v \u03c4. \n\nSo 0.3567 * 1.885e-6 m \u2248 0.672e-6 m. \n\nHmm, that's 6.72e-7 m, but the options are 2.08e-6, which is much bigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not about the distance but the spatial resolution needed to see the decay. The resolution must be small enough so that the track can be seen over the decay length. But perhaps the problem is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the relation between energy and momentum to find the velocity. Wait, let me try that. \n\nThe total energy E is given as 27 GeV. The rest mass is 3.41 GeV. The energy-momentum relation is E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. So, (27)^2 = (pc)^2 + (3.41)^2. \n\nLet me compute pc:\n\npc = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2) \n\nSo pc = sqrt( (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 ) GeV \n\nCalculating that:\n\n27^2 is 729. \n\n3.41^2 is 11.6281. \n\nSo sqrt(729 -11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) \u2248 26.78 GeV. \n\nTherefore, the momentum p is (26.78 GeV)/c. \n\nThe velocity v is (pc\u00b2)/E. \n\nWait, since E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, and p = \u03b3mv. \n\nSo v = pc\u00b2 / E. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nAlternatively, v/c = (pc)/(E). Because p = \u03b3mv, and E=\u03b3mc\u00b2, so p = (E/(c\u00b2)) v. \n\nWait, rearranged, v = (pc\u00b2)/E. \n\nSo v = ( (26.78 GeV/c) * c\u00b2 ) / (27 GeV) \n\nThe GeV units cancel out. \n\nSo v = (26.78 * c\u00b2 * GeV / c ) * (1/(27 GeV)) \n\nWait, units are getting a bit messy. Let me compute numerically. \n\nv = ( (26.78 GeV/c * c\u00b2) ) / (27 GeV) \n\nThe c\u00b2/c term gives c. \n\nWait, maybe better to write:\n\nv/c = (pc)/(E) \n\nSince p is in GeV/c, so pc is GeV. \n\nSo (pc)/E = (26.78 GeV) / (27 GeV) \u2248 0.992. \n\nAh! So v/c is approximately 0.992, which matches the earlier calculation. \n\nSo that's consistent. \n\nHmm, so that approach gives the same velocity. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial approach was correct, but the discrepancy is because the question is expecting a different approach? Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem states the proper lifetime \u03c4\u2080 = 8e-16 s. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. \n\nPerhaps the resolution refers to the spatial resolution of the detector, which needs to be smaller than the mean decay length so that the decay can be observed. If the detector's resolution is worse than the decay length, then you can't see the decay. Wait, but maybe the minimum resolution is the decay length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the relativistic Doppler shift? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Lorentz factor. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the energy given is the total energy of the particle. So E = gamma m c\u00b2. \n\nSo gamma is E/(m c\u00b2) = 27 / 3.41 \u22487.917. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for the mean decay length, which would be v * tau. \n\nThe mean decay length is v * tau = v * gamma * tau\u2080. \n\nWhich we calculated as ~1.885e-6 meters. \n\nBut the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is a bit higher. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is considering the root mean square (RMS) distance or something else? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the proper lifetime without considering time dilation? But that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, the question says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Hmm, perhaps that's the kinetic energy. Wait, but in physics, when they say the energy of a particle, it's usually the total energy. But maybe in this context, the energy is the kinetic energy. Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf the 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K + mc\u00b2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma would be E/(mc\u00b2) = 30.41 / 3.41 \u2248 8.91. \n\nLet me see how that would change things. \n\nIf gamma is 8.91, then v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(8.91)^2). \n\nCalculating 8.91 squared is approx 79.4. \n\n1/79.4 \u22480.0126. \n\nSo sqrt(1 -0.0126)=sqrt(0.9874)= approx 0.9937. \n\nThen v \u22480.9937c. \n\nThen the lab lifetime tau = gamma tau\u2080 =8.91 *8e-16 \u22487.128e-15 s. \n\nThen the distance would be v*tau =0.9937 *3e8 *7.128e-15. \n\n0.9937 *3 =2.981, so 2.981e8 *7.128e-15 = 2.981 *7.128 *1e-7 \n\n2.981 *7 =20.867, 2.981 *0.128=0.381, so total 20.867 +0.381=21.248. \n\nSo 21.248e-7 m = 2.1248e-6 m. Which is about 2.12e-6, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nHmm! So perhaps the question assumes that the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. That would explain the discrepancy. \n\nSo the problem says \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". Maybe that's the kinetic energy. \n\nWait, in particle accelerators, sometimes the energy referred to is the kinetic energy. But sometimes it's the total. Hmm. \n\nThe problem statement says: \"Knowing that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41GeV.\" \n\nHmm, the units here are important. The mass is given in GeV, which is actually the rest mass energy (since mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, but they just write GeV). So the energy in the bubble chamber (the total energy) is 27 GeV. Wait, but if that's the case, then my first calculation was correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using non-relativistic approximation? \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nIf the energy is the kinetic energy K, then total energy E = K + m c\u00b2 = 27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV. \n\nThen gamma = E/(mc\u00b2)=30.41/3.41\u22488.91. \n\nThen the calculation gives about 2.12e-6 m, which is close to option A (2.08e-6). \n\nBut the question didn't specify whether the energy is kinetic or total. This is ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the relation between the energy and momentum to compute the velocity, which would be the same as the first method. \n\nWait, but in the first approach, assuming that the given energy is the total energy, I got ~1.885e-6, but the option A is 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the first approach. Let me recalculate the distance again. \n\nFirst, gamma is 27/3.41\u22487.9179 \n\nv = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2)*c. \n\n1/gamma\u00b2 =1/(7.9179)^2 \u22481/(62.69)= ~0.01595. \n\nThus 1 -0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)=0.992, so v=0.992c. \n\nTau = gamma * tau0 =7.9179 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s. \n\nDistance: v * tau =0.992 *3e8 *6.334e-15. \n\nLet me compute 0.992 *6.334e-15 *3e8. \n\nWait, let's compute 3e8 *6.334e-15 = 3*6.334 *1e-7 = 19.002 *1e-7 m/s*s \u2192 meters? \n\nWait, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 6.334e-15 s gives 3e8 *6.334e-15 = (3*6.334) *1e-7 = 19.002e-7 m. \n\nThen multiply by 0.992: 19.002e-7 *0.992 \u2248 18.83e-7 m = 1.883e-6 m. \n\nSo that's ~1.88e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so that's about 1.88 micrometers. The closest option is A (2.08e-6). But that's 2.08 vs 1.88. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects using the velocity as (pc)/E, where pc is momentum? Wait, no, that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity, but the question wants the gamma factor in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, so I need to compute gamma using K = (gamma -1)mc\u00b2. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nIf the energy given is kinetic energy K=27 GeV, then:\n\nK = (gamma -1)mc\u00b2 \u2192 gamma = (K/(mc\u00b2)) +1. \n\nmc\u00b2 is 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo gamma = (27/3.41)+1 \u22487.917+1=8.917. \n\nThen gamma is ~8.917. \n\nThen v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma\u00b2) *c. \n\n1/gamma\u00b2 is 1/(8.917)^2 \u22481/79.5 \u2192 ~0.01257. \n\n1-0.01257=0.98743 \u2192 sqrt(0.98743)= ~0.9937. \n\nv=0.9937c. \n\nTau = gamma * tau0=8.917*8e-16 \u22487.134e-15 s. \n\nThen distance is v*tau: 0.9937*3e8 *7.134e-15. \n\nCompute 3e8 *7.134e-15 = 2.1402e-6 m. \n\nMultiply by 0.9937 gives 2.1402 *0.9937 \u22482.13e-6 m. \n\nAh! That's 2.13e-6, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6). The slight difference could be due to rounding during calculations. \n\nSo, if the energy given is the kinetic energy, then the answer is approximately 2.13e-6, which is closest to option A. \n\nBut the problem states \"the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV\". The wording is ambiguous. In particle physics, when they say \"energy\" without specifying, it can sometimes refer to total energy. But if the question is from an exam, perhaps the convention is that the given energy is the kinetic energy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses a different formula. Let me see the options. \n\nThe given options are A) 2.08e-6, B) 2.08e-9, etc. \n\nThe two possible results are ~1.88e-6 (if total energy) or ~2.13e-6 (if kinetic energy). The first is closer to 2.08e-6 (option A) if the calculation is precise. \n\nWait, let me recalculate using the kinetic energy approach with more precise numbers. \n\nLet me do that step by step:\n\nIf K =27 GeV is the kinetic energy,\n\nthen E = K + m c\u00b2 =27 +3.41 =30.41 GeV.\n\ngamma = E/(mc\u00b2)=30.41/3.41 = let's compute that exactly:\n\n30.41 divided by 3.41.\n\n3.41 \u00d7 8 =27.28, so 30.41-27.28=3.13. \n\n3.41 \u00d7 0.918 \u22483.13 (since 3.41\u00d70.9=3.069; 3.41\u00d70.018=0.06138; total 3.069+0.06138\u22483.130). \n\nSo gamma =8.918. \n\nThus, gamma squared is (8.918)^2. \n\n8.918 squared: 8^2=64, 0.918^2\u22480.843, cross term 2\u00d78\u00d70.918\u224814.688. \n\nTotal: 64 +14.688 +0.843 \u224880. (Wait, let me compute 8.918 \u00d78.918:\n\n8\u00d78 =64\n\n8\u00d70.918 =7.344\n\n0.918\u00d78 =7.344\n\n0.918\u00d70.918\u22480.843\n\nAdding all terms for (a+b)^2: (8 +0.918)^2 =8\u00b2 +2\u00d78\u00d70.918 +0.918\u00b2 =64 +14.688 +0.843 \u224864+14.688=78.688 +0.843=79.531. \n\nThus, 8.918 squared is ~79.531. \n\nSo 1/gamma squared is 1/79.531 \u22480.01257. \n\nThus, 1 - 1/gamma\u00b2 \u22480.98743, sqrt(0.98743)= let me calculate this more precisely. \n\nsqrt(0.98743). Let's see, sqrt(0.98)=0.98995, sqrt(0.99)=0.99499. \n\nLet me compute (0.9937)^2: 0.9937*0.9937. \n\n(0.99 +0.0037)^2 =0.9801 + 2\u00d70.99\u00d70.0037 +0.0037\u00b2 \n\n=0.9801 + 0.007294 +0.00001369 \u22480.987397. \n\nThat's very close to 0.98743. So sqrt(0.98743) is approximately 0.9937. \n\nThus v =0.9937c. \n\nTau = gamma * tau\u2080 =8.918 \u00d78e-16 =7.134e-15 s. \n\nNow compute the distance: v * tau =0.9937 \u00d73e8 \u00d77.134e-15. \n\nFirst multiply 3e8 \u00d77.134e-15 =3 \u00d77.134 \u00d71e-7 =21.402 \u00d71e-7 =2.1402e-6 m. \n\nMultiply by 0.9937: 2.1402e-6 \u00d70.9937 \u2248 2.1402 \u00d70.9937 = \n\nLet me compute 2 \u00d70.9937 =1.9874, 0.1402 \u00d70.9937 \u22480.1394. \n\nTotal is 1.9874 +0.1394 \u22482.1268e-6 m. \n\nAh, so that's 2.1268e-6 m, which rounds to approximately 2.13e-6 m. The option A is 2.08e-6, which is close but not exact. Perhaps the question uses approximate values for constants like c. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses c =3e8 m/s exactly, but in my calculation, I used that. Let me see:\n\nThe exact calculation:\n\nv =0.9937 *3e8 m/s \n\ntau =7.134e-15 s \n\nMultiply them:\n\n0.9937 *3e8 =2.9811e8 m/s \n\ntimes 7.134e-15 s = \n\n2.9811e8 *7.134e-15 = (2.9811 *7.134) *1e-7 \n\n2.9811 *7 =20.8677 \n\n2.9811 *0.134=0.400 \n\nTotal is 20.8677 +0.400 =21.2677 \n\nSo 21.2677e-7 m = 2.12677e-6 m. \n\nHmm, so 2.12677e-6 m is approximately 2.13e-6 m, which is very close to the given option A (2.08e-6 m). The difference might be due to rounding in gamma. Let me see:\n\nIf gamma was exactly 8.91, then:\n\ngamma =8.91 \n\nThen, 1/gamma\u00b2 =1/(8.91)^2=1/(79.3881)= ~0.0126. \n\nThen sqrt(1-0.0126)=sqrt(0.9874)=0.9937 as before. \n\nTau =8.91\u00d78e-16 =7.128e-15 s \n\nv=0.9937c \n\ndistance: 0.9937 *3e8 *7.128e-15 \n\n3e8 *7.128e-15 = 2.1384e-6 \n\nMultiply by 0.9937 gives 2.1384 *0.9937\u22482.126e-6. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm, the given answer option A is 2.08e-6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for c. \n\nWait, perhaps in some contexts, c is taken as exactly 3e8 m/s, but perhaps in the problem's calculation, they used a different value. Wait, but even so, that would not make a big difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question's options. But the options are given as A) 2.08e-6 m, B)2.08e-9, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the proper decay length, but that would be v0*tau0. But v0 is the velocity in the rest frame, which is zero. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. \n\nWait, the problem says \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\". \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the question requires considering that only 30% of the decays occur within the resolution, so we need to find the distance where the decay probability is 30%, not the mean distance. \n\nEarlier I considered that. \n\nSo, the probability of decay within distance d is P=1 - exp(-d/(v tau)). \n\nSet P=0.3. \n\nThus, \n\nd = -v tau ln(1 - P) = -v tau ln(0.7). \n\nWait, ln(0.7) is negative, so the negative cancels, so d = v tau * (-ln(0.7)). \n\nIf using the first approach (total energy=27 GeV):\n\nv tau =1.885e-6 m. \n\nMultiply by (-ln(0.7))=0.3567 gives 1.885e-6 *0.3567\u22480.672e-6 m. \n\nThat's ~0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 m, not in the options. \n\nIf using the kinetic energy approach (total energy=30.41 GeV), then v tau=2.126e-6 m. \n\nMultiply by 0.3567 gives 2.126e-6 *0.3567\u22480.757e-6 m. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question requires the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed, so solving for d where P=0.3. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the mean lifetime and find the distance where 30% have decayed. \n\nWait, the mean distance is v tau. The probability to decay before the mean distance is 1 - exp(-1)\u22480.632, so 63% decay before that distance. \n\nTo have only 30%, we need a shorter distance. \n\nSo d = (ln(1/(1-0.3)))^{-1} * v tau? \n\nWait, solving 1 - exp(-d/(v tau)) =0.3 \u2192 exp(-d/(v tau)) =0.7 \u2192 d/(v tau)=ln(1/0.7)=ln(10/7)\u22480.3567. \n\nThus, d= v tau *0.3567. \n\nSo the required distance is 0.3567 times the mean distance. \n\nIf using total energy=27 GeV, the mean distance is 1.885e-6, so d=0.672e-6, which is not in the options. \n\nIf using total energy=30.41 GeV (kinetic energy assumption), then d=2.126e-6 *0.3567\u22480.757e-6 m. Still not matching. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance traveled during the proper lifetime, not the lab lifetime. \n\nProper lifetime is \u03c4\u2080 =8e-16 s. \n\ndistance =v * tau\u2080. \n\nBut v is the velocity in the lab frame. \n\nv =0.992c (if total energy=27 GeV). \n\nThen distance would be 0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 = \n\n0.992 *3*8 =23.808 \n\ntimes 1e-8 (since 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8). \n\nWait, 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =2.4e-7 m. Multiply by 0.992 gives ~2.38e-7 m, which is 2.38e-7 m or 0.238e-6 m. Not matching options. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation between energy and momentum to find the velocity, but miscalculating the gamma. \n\nWait, let's try another approach. \n\nThe energy is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV/c\u00b2. \n\nSo the momentum p is sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2 ) / c. \n\nWait, p = sqrt(E\u00b2 - (mc\u00b2)^2)/c. \n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nE is in GeV, so (mc\u00b2) is 3.41 GeV. \n\nSo p (in GeV/c) is sqrt(27\u00b2 -3.41\u00b2) \n\nSo sqrt(729 -11.6281)= sqrt(717.3719)= approx 26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThus, the momentum p =26.78 GeV/c. \n\nThe velocity v is given by v = pc\u00b2 / E. \n\nWait, since p = gamma m v \n\nand E = gamma m c\u00b2 \n\nso v = (p c\u00b2)/E. \n\nSo plugging in: \n\nv = (26.78 GeV/c *c\u00b2 ) / 27 GeV \n\nThe GeV units cancel, and c terms give (c\u00b2 /c ) =c. \n\nSo v= (26.78 /27 )c \u22480.992c. \n\nSame as before. \n\nThus, the velocity is 0.992c. \n\nThen the lab lifetime is gamma tau0 = (27/3.41)*8e-16 \u22487.917*8e-16 =6.33e-15 s. \n\nThe distance is v*tau =0.992 *3e8 *6.33e-15 \u22481.88e-6 m. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options have A)2.08e-6. \n\nPerhaps the question assumes that the energy is the kinetic energy, leading to gamma= (27+3.41)/3.41=30.41/3.41\u22488.91, leading to distance ~2.1e-6, which rounds to 2.08e-6. \n\nGiven that the question's options have 2.08e-6, which is close to 2.1e-6, I think the problem is expecting us to treat the given energy as the kinetic energy. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 2.08e-6 m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question uses a different formula. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the proper length, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the relation for relativistic Doppler effect for the decay time, but that might not apply here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the resolution to be the gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime times velocity. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what I computed. \n\nHmm. Given that the closest answer is option A, I think that's the intended answer. \n\nTherefore, I will go with option A. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n\n\nTo determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of \\( X^0 \\), we start by calculating the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) using the given energy and mass of \\( X^0 \\). The total energy \\( E \\) is 27 GeV, and the rest mass energy \\( mc^2 \\) is 3.41 GeV. \n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.9179\n\\]\n\nThe velocity \\( v \\) of \\( X^0 \\) is calculated using the relation:\n\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(7.9179)^2}} \\approx 0.992c\n\\]\n\nThe lab frame lifetime \\( \\tau \\) is given by time dilation:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.9179 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nThe distance traveled by \\( X^0 \\) in the lab frame before decaying is:\n\n\\[\nd = v \\tau = 0.992 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nHowever, considering the possibility that the given energy might be the kinetic energy instead of the total energy, we recalculate with \\( E = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 \\, \\text{GeV} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{30.41}{3.41} \\approx 8.917\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(8.917)^2}} \\approx 0.9937c\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 8.917 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 7.134 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = v \\tau = 0.9937 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 7.134 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 2.126 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis value is closest to option A (2.08e-6 m), considering rounding and possible conventions in the problem.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
