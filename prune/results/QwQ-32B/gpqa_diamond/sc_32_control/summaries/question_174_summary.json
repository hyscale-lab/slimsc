      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have to figure out the difference between the actual kinetic energy and the classical approximation of the more massive fragment after fission. Hmm, first, I need to recall the principles of conservation here. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission should be zero. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. \n\nThe problem states that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the original mass M. So, the rest mass energy of the original nucleus was 300 GeV. But when it splits, some of that mass is converted into kinetic energy, right? The total energy before and after should be conserved. \n\nLet me denote the rest masses of the fragments as m1 and m2. Given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let's say m1 = 2m2. Since their sum is 0.99*M, then m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Substituting m1 = 2m2 gives 3m2 = 0.99M \u2192 m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M, and m1 = 0.66M. \n\nWait, but actually, the question is about kinetic energy. Let me think about how to compute that. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the center of mass frame is the lab frame here. The two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p1 = -p2. \n\nThe total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy of the original nucleus, which is M * c\u00b2 (since rest mass energy is m c\u00b2, but here the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. Wait, actually, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV, so M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV. So total energy before is 300 GeV. \n\nAfter fission, the total energy will be the sum of the rest masses plus their kinetic energies. So, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). The problem states that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Therefore, the total energy is 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2). \n\nBut conservation of energy requires that this equals the original energy, so 300 GeV (since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV) equals 0.99 * 300 GeV + (T1 + T2). Therefore, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 0.99*300 GeV = 300*(1 - 0.99) = 300 *0.01 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. \n\nNow, since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. Therefore, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's denote the magnitudes as p. \n\nSo, p1 = p and p2 = p (but opposite direction). \n\nNow, the kinetic energy in relativistic terms is T = (\u03b3 - 1) m c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. However, in the classical approximation, we would use T \u2248 p\u00b2/(2m). \n\nWe need to compute T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) both relativistically and classically, then find the difference between the two. \n\nFirst, let's find the relativistic calculation. \n\nLet me denote the masses as m1 = 0.66M and m2 = 0.33M. \n\nSince p1 = p2 in magnitude. Let me note that momentum p for each fragment is the same magnitude, so:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 = \u03b32 m2 v2, but since they are equal and opposite, so their magnitudes must be equal. Wait, actually, the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite, so |p1| = |p2|. \n\nLet me denote p1 = p (direction), so p2 = -p. So the magnitudes are equal. \n\nTherefore, the momentum of fragment 1 is p = \u03b31 m1 v1, and fragment 2 is p = \u03b32 m2 v2. \n\nBut since they are opposite, their momenta are equal in magnitude. Therefore, \u03b31 m1 v1 = \u03b32 m2 v2. \n\nBut since they must move in opposite directions with speeds such that their momenta cancel. \n\nAlternatively, since the magnitudes are equal, so p1 = p2 = p. \n\nBut since their masses are different, their velocities must be different. \n\nWe can write equations for energy and momentum. \n\nTotal energy is (\u03b31 m1 c\u00b2) + (\u03b32 m2 c\u00b2) = total energy after, which is M c\u00b2 (rest mass) + T1 + T2. Wait, but actually, the total energy after is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + T1 + T2. \n\nEarlier, we found that T1 + T2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. \n\nBut to find individual T1 and T2, we need another equation. \n\nThe momentum equation tells us that the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. So p1 = p2. \n\nExpressed as:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 = \u03b32 m2 v2 \n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are in opposite directions. But the magnitudes must satisfy that equation. \n\nAlternatively, since the magnitudes of momentum are equal, so:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 = \u03b32 m2 v2 \n\nLet me denote v1 and v2 as their speeds. \n\nAdditionally, since they are moving in opposite directions, the velocities are negatives (if we consider direction), but the magnitudes are v1 and v2. \n\nHmm, this might be getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the total momentum is zero, the momenta vectors are equal and opposite, so their magnitudes are equal. Let\u2019s denote the magnitude as p. Then for fragment 1 (mass m1), its momentum is p, and fragment 2 has momentum -p (so magnitude p). \n\nThe energy of each fragment is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). \n\nTotal energy is then sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) = total energy after fission. \n\nThe total energy after fission is 0.99 M c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + 3 GeV. But since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV, that's 0.99*300 + 3 = 297 + 3 = 300 GeV. Wait, that's the original energy, so that checks out. So the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) = M c\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's because the total energy after fission is equal to the original rest mass energy (since initially it was at rest, so total energy is just the rest mass). Wait, no. Wait, the rest mass energy of the original nucleus was 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest mass is 0.99 M, so their rest masses summed to 0.99 M. The total energy is (sum rest masses)*c\u00b2 plus the kinetic energy. But according to conservation of energy, the total energy after must equal the original rest mass. \n\nWait, the initial energy is just M c\u00b2. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c\u00b2 + T1) + (m2 c\u00b2 + T2) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) = (0.99 M)c\u00b2 + T_total. \n\nSo indeed, since M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, then 0.99*300 + T_total = 300, so T_total is 3 GeV. \n\nBut to find T1 and T2, perhaps we can use the momentum condition. \n\nLet me denote the momentum as p. For the two fragments, their momenta are p and -p. \n\nThus, for fragment 1:\n\nTotal energy: sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) = m1 c\u00b2 + T1 \n\nSimilarly for fragment 2:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) = m2 c\u00b2 + T2 \n\nAdding those two equations gives:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) + sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) = (m1 + m2)c\u00b2 + (T1 + T2) \n\nBut as we know, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, so the left side must equal (0.99 M)c\u00b2 + 3 GeV, which is exactly equal to M c\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the equation is indeed:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) + sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) = M c\u00b2 \n\nHmm, so we need to solve for p here, but this seems a bit complex. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the kinetic energies are related through their masses and the momentum. \n\nLet me express the kinetic energy for each fragment as T = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) - m c\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, T1 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\nSimilarly, T2 = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c\u00b2)^2 ) - m2 c\u00b2 \n\nThe sum T1 + T2 is 3 GeV. \n\nSo, maybe we can set variables in terms of GeV. Let me note that M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV. \n\nGiven that m1 = 0.66 M, so m1 c\u00b2 = 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV \n\nSimilarly, m2 = 0.33 M \u2192 m2 c\u00b2 = 99 GeV \n\nLet me let pc = x (in GeV). Because c is here, but since units are in GeV, maybe it's okay? Wait, actually, the units might need to be consistent. Let me think. \n\nThe term (pc)^2 has units of (GeV)^2 (since p is in GeV/c, c is in m/s, so pc is in GeV). So the terms inside the square roots are (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2, which are both in (GeV)^2. Therefore, sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ) is in GeV. So yes, if we set pc as a variable in GeV, then the equations can be handled numerically. \n\nSo let me let x = pc. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( x^2 + (198)^2 ) + sqrt( x^2 + (99)^2 ) = 300 \n\nWe need to solve for x. \n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky to solve algebraically, but maybe we can approximate or find a way. \n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the problem asks for the difference between the actual T1 and the classical T1. \n\nLet me first compute the classical case. \n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy would be T = (p^2)/(2m). \n\nSince p1 and p2 have same magnitude, so p1 = p2 = p (in magnitude). \n\nBut in classical, the total kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m1) + (p^2)/(2m2) ) = (p\u00b2/2)(1/m1 + 1/m2) \n\nBut also, since the system's momentum is zero, the momenta are equal and opposite. So the magnitudes are equal. \n\nAdditionally, in classical, the velocities would satisfy m1 v1 = - m2 v2. Because p1 = m1 v1 and p2 = m2 v2, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2. \n\nWait, but the total momentum is zero, so m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 = - (m1/m2) v1. \n\nSo if we consider velocities, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 v2\u00b2 = (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2 ( (m1/m2 v1)^2 ) \n\nWhich simplifies to (1/2)m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2*(m1\u00b2/m2\u00b2 v1\u00b2 ) = (1/2) v1\u00b2 [ m1 + (m1^3)/(m2\u00b2) ] \n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since p1 = m1 v1 and p2 = m2 v2 = - m1 v1. So p2 = - (m1/m2) p1. Wait, but that might not be necessary. \n\nAlternatively, in the classical case, the total kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m1) + (p^2)/(2m2) = p\u00b2 ( (1/(2m1) + 1/(2m2) ) )\n\nBut the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so:\n\np\u00b2 ( (1/(2m1) + 1/(2m2) )) = 3 GeV \n\nBut in classical terms, the mass is in kg, but here the units are in terms of energies. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust units here. \n\nAlternatively, since m1 is given as a fraction of M, maybe I can express everything in terms of M. \n\nLet me think again. Let me first try to compute the classical T1. \n\nIn classical mechanics:\n\nTotal kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. \n\nAlso, since the momenta are equal in magnitude (p1 = p2 = p), so p = sqrt( 2 m1 T1 ) and p = sqrt( 2 m2 T2 ). \n\nTherefore, sqrt(2 m1 T1) = sqrt(2 m2 T2) \u2192 sqrt( m1 T1 ) = sqrt( m2 T2 ) \u2192 m1 T1 = m2 T2 \n\nTherefore, T2 = (m1/m2) T1 \n\nSince m1 = 2 m2 (since m1 is twice as massive as m2, right? Wait, the problem says \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses)\", so m1 = 2 m2. \n\nAh! Wait, earlier, I set m1 = 2 m2, so m2 = M/3, m1 = 2M/3. But the sum m1 + m2 = M(2/3 + 1/3) = M. But the problem states that the sum is 0.99 M. Wait, that's a conflict. Wait, no. Wait the problem says \"the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". \n\nAh, right! So my earlier mistake. \n\nWait, let me correct that. \n\nThe problem says \"the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\".\n\nSo m1 + m2 = 0.99 M \n\nAlso, m1 = 2 m2 (since one is twice as massive as the other). \n\nTherefore, substituting into the first equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M \u2192 m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M, so m1 = 0.66 M. \n\nSo earlier, that part was correct. \n\nTherefore, in the classical case, m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M. \n\nSo, back to the classical equations. \n\nWe have T2 = (m1/m2) T1 \u2192 T2 = (0.66/0.33) T1 = 2 T1. \n\nTherefore, T1 + T2 = T1 + 2 T1 = 3 T1 = 3 GeV \u2192 T1 (classical) = 1 GeV. \n\nWait, but the problem says to compare the actual T1 and the classical T1. \n\nSo in the classical approximation, T1 would be 1 GeV. \n\nBut the actual T1 is different. \n\nNow, to compute the actual T1, we need to do the relativistic calculation. \n\nLet me go back to the equations. \n\nWe have the equation:\n\nsqrt( x^2 + (198)^2 ) + sqrt( x^2 + (99)^2 ) = 300 \n\nWhere x is pc in GeV. \n\nWe need to solve for x. Let me denote x as the variable, and let's compute numerically. \n\nLet me call the first sqrt term as A = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 198\u00b2), and the second as B = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2). \n\nThe equation is A + B = 300. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. \n\n(A + B)^2 = 300\u00b2 \n\nA\u00b2 + 2AB + B\u00b2 = 90000 \n\nBut A\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (198)^2 \n\nB\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (99)^2 \n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 198\u00b2) + (x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2) + 2AB = 90000 \n\nCombine terms:\n\n2x\u00b2 + 198\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 + 2AB = 90000 \n\nLet me compute 198^2: 198*198 = (200-2)^2 = 40000 - 800 +4= 39204 \n\n99^2 = 9801 \n\nSo 198\u00b2 +99\u00b2 = 39204 +9801 = 49005 \n\nThus, the equation becomes: \n\n2x\u00b2 +49005 + 2AB = 90000 \n\nSo 2AB = 90000 -2x\u00b2 -49005 = (90000 -49005) -2x\u00b2 \n\n90000 -49005 = 40995 \n\nThus: 2AB = 40995 -2x\u00b2 \n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me let A + B = 300 \n\nSo, A = 300 - B \n\nThen substitute into A\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 198\u00b2 \n\n(300 - B)^2 = x\u00b2 + 198\u00b2 \n\nBut B\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 \u2192 x\u00b2 = B\u00b2 -99\u00b2 \n\nSubstituting into the previous equation:\n\n(300 - B)^2 = (B\u00b2 -99\u00b2) + 198\u00b2 \n\nExpand left side:\n\n300\u00b2 - 600B + B\u00b2 = B\u00b2 - 99\u00b2 + 198\u00b2 \n\nCancel B\u00b2 terms:\n\n90000 -600B = -99\u00b2 + 198\u00b2 \n\nCompute -99\u00b2 +198\u00b2. Note that 198 is 2*99, so 198\u00b2 = (2*99)^2 =4*99\u00b2 \n\nThus, -99\u00b2 +4*99\u00b2 = 3*99\u00b2 \n\nSo, 3*99\u00b2 = 3*(9801) = 29403 \n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n90000 -600B = 29403 \u2192 \n\n-600B = 29403 -90000 = -60597 \u2192 \n\nB = 60597 /600 \n\nCalculate that: 60597 divided by 600. Let's see, 600*100=60,000 \u2192 60597 -60,000 = 597 \u2192 so 100 + 597/600 \u2248 100.995. So B \u2248 100.995. \n\nHmm, so B \u2248 100.995 GeV. \n\nBut B is sqrt(x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2). \n\nThus, sqrt(x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2) \u2248 100.995 \n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 99\u00b2 \u2248 (100.995)^2 \n\nCalculate (100.995)^2 \u2248 (101 -0.005)^2 \u2248 101\u00b2 - 2*101*0.005 + (0.005)^2 \u2248 10201 -1.01 +0.000025 \u2248 ~10200. \n\nWait, but 100.995 squared is more accurately calculated as:\n\nLet me compute 100.995^2:\n\n= (100 + 0.995)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*0.995 + 0.995\u00b2 \n\n= 10000 + 199 + 0.990025 = 10000 + 199 = 10199 + ~0.99 = 10199.99 \n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (99)^2 \u2248 10199.99 \n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 10199.99 - 99\u00b2 \n\n99\u00b2 is 9801, so 10199.99 -9801 = 398.99 \n\nSo x\u00b2 \u2248 398.99 \u2192 x \u2248 sqrt(398.99) \u2248 19.975 \u2248 20 GeV. \n\nTherefore, x \u224820 GeV. \n\nSo the momentum p c \u224820 GeV. \n\nTherefore, the momentum p is 20 GeV / c. \n\nNow, to compute T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m1 = 0.66 M). \n\nThe kinetic energy T1 is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\nWe have pc =20 GeV, m1 c^2 =0.66 *300 GeV =198 GeV. \n\nSo the total energy of fragment 1 is sqrt( (20)^2 + 198^2 ) GeV \n\nCompute sqrt(400 + 39204 ) \n\nWait, 20 squared is 400, and 198 squared is 39204. \n\nSum is 400 + 39204 = 39604 \n\nsqrt(39604) = 199 GeV? Wait 199 squared is 39601, so sqrt(39604) is sqrt(39601 +3) \u2248199.0075 \n\nWait exactly, 199^2 = (200 -1)^2 =40000-400 +1= 39601. \n\nSo sqrt(39604) = sqrt(39601 +3) \u2248 199 + 3/(2*199) \u2248 ~199.0075 \n\nSo the total energy is approximately 199.0075 GeV \n\nThus, T1 = (199.0075 -198) GeV \u2248 1.0075 GeV \n\nWait, so about 1.0075 GeV. \n\nBut wait, the classical calculation gave T1 as 1 GeV. \n\nWait so the difference between the actual T1 (\u22481.0075 GeV) and the classical T1 (1 GeV) is about 0.0075 GeV. \n\nWait 0.0075 GeV is 7.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but the options are 2,5,10,20. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(20^2 + 198^2) exactly. \n\n20^2 = 400 \n\n198^2 = (200-2)^2 = 40000 - 800 +4 = 39204 \n\nTotal inside sqrt: 400 + 39204 = 39604 \n\nThe square root of 39604 is exactly 199, because 199^2 is 39601? Wait no, 199*199 is 39601. So sqrt(39604) is sqrt(39601+3) = 199.0015? Wait wait, 199^2 is 39601, so 199^2 +3= 39604. So sqrt(39604) is sqrt( (199)^2 +3 ). So it's 199.0015 approximately. \n\nWait, but that's a very small difference. \n\nWait, so the total energy is 199.0015 GeV \n\nThus, T1 = 199.0015 - 198 = 1.0015 GeV. \n\nSo the difference between actual T1 (\u22481.0015 GeV) and classical T1 (1 GeV) is 0.0015 GeV. Which is 1.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but the options are 2,5,10,20. So that's 1.5 MeV, which is near option A (2 MeV). But maybe my approximation is wrong here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again. \n\nWait, when I calculated B as sqrt(x\u00b2 +99\u00b2). \n\nEarlier step: \n\nWe had B = sqrt(x\u00b2 +99\u00b2) \u2248100.995 GeV. \n\nThen, x^2 + 99^2 \u2248 (100.995)^2. \n\nWait, 100.995 squared is (100 +0.995)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*0.995 +0.995\u00b2 = 10000 + 199 + ~0.990025 \n\nTotal is 10000 +199=10199 + 0.990025 \u224810199.99 \n\nThen, x\u00b2 = 10199.99 -99\u00b2 = 10199.99 -9801 = 398.99 \n\nSo x is sqrt(398.99) \u224819.975 GeV. \n\nWait, so x is about 19.975, not 20. So x is approximately 19.975 GeV. \n\nSo when calculating the total energy of fragment 1: sqrt( (19.975)^2 + (198)^2 ). \n\nLet me compute (19.975)^2: \n\n19.975 squared is (20 -0.025)^2 = 400 - 2*20*0.025 +0.025\u00b2 = 400 -1 + 0.000625 = 399.000625 \n\nAdding to 198^2 (39204):\n\nTotal inside sqrt is 399.000625 +39204 = 39603.000625 \n\nSo sqrt(39603.000625) \n\nHmm, since 199^2 is 39601, so sqrt(39603.000625) is sqrt(39601 + 2.000625) = 199 + (2.000625)/(2*199) using binomial approx. \n\nThat's 199 + ~2/(400) = 199.005. \n\nThus, the total energy of fragment 1 is ~199.005 GeV \n\nThus, T1 =199.005 -198 =1.005 GeV \n\nSo difference between actual (1.005 GeV) and classical (1 GeV) is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. \n\nAh! So that's 5 MeV, which is option B. \n\nHmm, so I must have made an error in my initial calculation's approximation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate that more accurately. \n\nWait, 19.975 squared is (20 -0.025)^2 = 400 - 2*20*0.025 + (0.025)^2 = 400 -1 + 0.000625 =399.000625 \n\nAdding to 198\u00b2 (which is 39204) gives 39204 +399.000625 = 39603.000625 \n\nTaking the square root of that: \n\nWe know 199^2 is 39601 \n\n39603.000625 - 39601 = 2.000625 \n\nSo sqrt(39601 +2.000625) = 199 + (2.000625)/(2*199) \n\nThe second term is 2.000625/(398) \u2248 0.005026 \n\nThus, total is 199.005026 \n\nSo total energy is approx 199.005 GeV \n\nThus, T1 = 199.005 -198 =1.005 GeV \n\nTherefore, the actual T1 is 1.005 GeV, and the classical is 1 GeV. \n\nDifference is 0.005 GeV \u2192 5 MeV, so answer is B. \n\nHmm, so that's why I must have miscalculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better way to compute this without going through all that algebra. \n\nAlternatively, let's see: \n\nThe relativistic T1 is T1 = (sqrt(x\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074)/c\u00b2) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\nWait, but maybe in units where c=1, it's easier. Let me try that. \n\nLet me set c=1. Then, all masses are in GeV/c\u00b2, energies in GeV. \n\nOriginal mass M: M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV \u2192 M = 300 GeV/c\u00b2 \n\nm1 = 0.66 M = 0.66*(300 GeV/c\u00b2) = 198 GeV/c\u00b2 \n\nm2 = 0.33*M =99 GeV/c\u00b2 \n\nThe momenta are p and -p. \n\nThe energy of fragment 1 is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) \n\nEnergy of fragment 2 is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m2\u00b2) \n\nTotal energy: sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) + sqrt(p\u00b2 + m2\u00b2) = M =300 GeV/c\u00b2 *c\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, in c=1 units, M is 300 GeV/c\u00b2, so M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV. So the total energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) + sqrt(p\u00b2 + m2\u00b2) =300 GeV. \n\nWe need to find p. \n\nBut proceeding as before. \n\nAlternatively, since the difference between the relativistic and classical is small, perhaps we can use an expansion. \n\nIn the classical case, T1 is p\u00b2/(2m1) \n\nIn the relativistic case, T1 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) - m1 \n\nThe difference would be sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) - m1 - [p\u00b2/(2m1) ]\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nLet me denote y = p/(m1 c). \n\nWait, in c=1 units, m1 is 198 GeV/c\u00b2, so m1 c = 198 GeV. \n\np is in GeV/c units, so p/(m1 c) would be (p c)/(m1 c\u00b2) ) \u2192 (p c)/ (m1 c\u00b2) = p/(m1 c). \n\nSo let me define y = p/(m1 c) \u2192 y = (p c)/(m1 c\u00b2) \n\nThus, p = y * m1 c \n\nThen, T1 (relativistic) is sqrt( (p)^2 + (m1 c\u00b2)^2 ) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\n= sqrt( (y\u00b2 m1\u00b2 c\u00b2) + m1\u00b2 c^4 ) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\n= m1 c\u00b2 sqrt( y\u00b2 +1 ) - m1 c\u00b2 \n\n= m1 c\u00b2 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2 ) -1 ] \n\nThe classical is T1 (classical) = (p^2)/(2m1) = (y\u00b2 m1\u00b2 c\u00b2 )/(2 m1) ) = (y\u00b2 m1 c\u00b2)/2 \n\nSo the difference between relativistic and classical is: \n\nm1 c\u00b2 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2 ) -1 ] - (y\u00b2 m1 c\u00b2)/2 \n\n= m1 c\u00b2 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2 ) -1 - y\u00b2/2 ] \n\nHmm, perhaps expanding sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) in a Taylor series for small y? Wait but is y small? \n\nWait, p is the momentum we found earlier. Let me see. \n\nEarlier, when I found that p c \u224820 GeV. \n\nSince m1 c\u00b2 =198 GeV, so y = (p c)/(m1 c\u00b2) = 20 /198 \u22480.101. \n\nSo y \u22480.1. So this is a small value, so maybe we can use an expansion. \n\nThe expansion of sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) around y=0 is: \n\nsqrt(1 + \u03b5) \u22481 + (1/2)\u03b5 - (1/8)\u03b5\u00b2 + ... \n\nHere, \u03b5 = y\u00b2. \n\nSo sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) \u22481 + (1/2)y\u00b2 - (1/8)y^4 + ... \n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(1 + y\u00b2) -1 - y\u00b2/2 \u2248 [1 + (1/2)y\u00b2 - (1/8)y^4 - ... ] -1 - (y\u00b2/2) \n\n= - (1/8)y^4 + ... \n\nSo the difference between relativistic and classical is m1 c\u00b2 [ - (1/8)y^4 + ... ] \n\nWait, but this would be negative, which contradicts our previous result where relativistic T1 is higher than classical? \n\nWait, in our numerical calculation, relativistic was 1.005 GeV and classical 1 GeV, so the difference is +0.005 GeV. \n\nHmm, maybe the expansion is for small y, but here y is 0.1, so maybe the next term is needed? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. \n\nWait let's see. \n\nWait the expansion: \n\nsqrt(1 + y\u00b2) = 1 + (1/2)y\u00b2 - (1/8)y^4 + (1/16)y^6 - ... \n\nSo sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) -1 - (y\u00b2)/2 \u2192 \n\n[1 + (y\u00b2)/2 - (y^4)/8 + ...] -1 - (y\u00b2)/2 \u2192 \n\n- (y^4)/8 + higher terms. \n\nThus the difference is negative, so the relativistic T is less than the classical? But in our case it was higher. That can\u2019t be. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, T1 (relativistic) = m1 c\u00b2 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) -1 ]\n\nT1 (classical) = (y\u00b2 m1 c\u00b2)/2 \n\nSo difference is T1_rel - T1_cl = m1 c\u00b2 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) -1 - y\u00b2/2 ]\n\nThe expansion gives this as m1 c\u00b2 [ ( (1 + y\u00b2/2 - y^4/8) ) -1 - y\u00b2/2 ] = m1 c\u00b2 [ - y^4 /8 + ... ]\n\nWhich is negative. But according to our numerical calculation, the difference was positive (relativistic was higher). \n\nHmm, so something is wrong here. \n\nWait, perhaps my substitution was incorrect. Let me redo it. \n\nWait, let me clarify variables again. \n\nIn terms of units with c=1, \n\np is in GeV/c (since mass is in GeV/c\u00b2, so pc is in GeV)\n\nWait, m1 is 198 GeV/c\u00b2, so m1 c is 198 GeV. \n\np is momentum, so p/c has units of GeV/c\u00b2 * s/m? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, in natural units where c=1, the momentum p is in GeV. \n\nWait, perhaps better to re-define variables with c=1. \n\nLet me try again with c=1. \n\nThen, all masses are in GeV (since m c\u00b2 is the rest energy, so m = (rest energy)/c\u00b2 \u2192 with c=1, mass is rest energy). \n\nSo M = 300 GeV (since M c\u00b2 is 300 GeV). \n\nm1 =0.66*M= 198 GeV \n\nm2=0.33*M=99 GeV \n\nThen, the momenta are p and -p (vectors). \n\nTotal energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) + sqrt(p\u00b2 + m2\u00b2) = M =300 GeV \n\nWe need to solve for p. \n\nLet me call p the magnitude. \n\nEarlier, we found p \u224820 GeV (since with c=1, pc was 20 GeV? Wait, no. Wait in the previous calculation, with c=1, then pc would just be p (since c=1). Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from units. \n\nWait let me set c=1. So in natural units, \n\nThen, the equation is sqrt(p\u00b2 + 198\u00b2) + sqrt(p\u00b2 +99\u00b2) =300 \n\nWe can proceed as before. \n\nLet me try to compute the difference using the approximation. \n\nWe found that p\u224820 GeV. \n\nWait, so y = p / m1 = 20 /198 \u22480.101. \n\nSo y is about 0.1. \n\nThen, the difference term is T1_rel - T1_cl = m1 [ sqrt(1 + y\u00b2) -1 - y\u00b2/2 ] \n\nWait, since m1 is 198 GeV, so:\n\n=198 GeV [ sqrt(1 + (0.101)^2 ) -1 - (0.101)^2 /2 ]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(1 + 0.0102 ) = sqrt(1.0102) \u22481.00508 \n\nThen subtract 1 \u2192 0.00508 \n\nSubtract (0.0102)/2 \u2192 0.0051 \n\nSo total inside the brackets: 0.00508 -0.0051 \u2248 -0.00002 \n\nHmm, that gives a negligible difference. \n\nBut this contradicts our previous result where the difference was +0.005 GeV. \n\nWait, so there's inconsistency here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is not sufficient for y=0.1. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute the exact difference using the value of p=20 GeV (approx). \n\nWait with p=20 GeV, then T1_rel is sqrt(20\u00b2 +198\u00b2) -198 \n\nWhich is sqrt(400 + 39204)=sqrt(39604)=199 \u2192 199 -198 =1 GeV \n\nWait a second! Wait sqrt(39604) is exactly 199, because 199 squared is 39601? Wait no, wait 199^2 is (200-1)^2 = 40000-400+1=39601. \n\nWait 199^2 = 39601, so sqrt(39604) is sqrt(39601 +3)= approx 199.0015. \n\nWait but if p was exactly 20 GeV, then 20\u00b2 +198\u00b2 is 400 + 39204 =39604, sqrt is 199.0015. \n\nWait but earlier I thought p was \u224820 GeV, but the exact value of p gives that sqrt term to be 199. \n\nWait let me see when p=20 GeV: \n\nsqrt(20^2 +198^2)=sqrt(400+39204)=sqrt(39604)=199 exactly? \n\nWait 199 squared is 39601. \n\nSo sqrt(39604) is sqrt(199\u00b2+3) which is about 199.0015, not exactly 199. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the process. \n\nWait let me recalculate the equation. \n\nWe have:\n\nsqrt(x^2 + 198^2) + sqrt(x^2 +99^2) =300. \n\nSuppose x=20, then left side is sqrt(400 +39204) + sqrt(400 +9801). \n\nFirst sqrt is sqrt(39604) which is 199.0015 \n\nSecond sqrt is sqrt(10201) =101 \n\nSo total is 199.0015 +101 = 300.0015, which is very close to 300. \n\nAh! So x=20 gives 300.0015, which is almost 300. \n\nTherefore, the solution is x\u224820 GeV. \n\nThus, the total energy of fragment 1 is sqrt(20^2 +198^2)=199.0015 GeV \n\nThus, T1 =199.0015 -198 =1.0015 GeV \n\nThe classical T1 is 1 GeV. \n\nThus, the difference is 0.0015 GeV =1.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought the difference was 5 MeV. \n\nWait, but where did the 5 MeV come from? \n\nAh, I think I made an error in the algebra step when I thought that B was approximately 100.995. Let me retrace:\n\nWait when I set A + B =300, where A= sqrt(x\u00b2 +198\u00b2), B= sqrt(x\u00b2 +99\u00b2). \n\nThen I substituted A=300 - B, squared both sides, leading to an equation where I ended up with B\u2248100.995. \n\nWait, but if x=20, then B= sqrt(20\u00b2 +99\u00b2)=sqrt(400+9801)=sqrt(10201)=101 exactly. \n\nAh! So if x=20, then B is exactly 101, which is a whole number. \n\nSo let me redo that step: \n\nIf x=20, then B=101. \n\nThen, A= sqrt(20\u00b2 +198\u00b2)=sqrt(39604)=199.0015 (approx). \n\nBut then A + B =199.0015 +101 =300.0015 which is very close to 300, so x=20 is a good approximation. \n\nThus, the exact value of x is approximately 20 GeV, which gives T1\u22481.0015 GeV \n\nSo the difference between actual (1.0015) and classical (1 GeV) is ~0.0015 GeV=1.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but that's about 1.5 MeV, which is not among the options. The options are 2,5,10,20. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the classical calculation? \n\nWait, let me check again. \n\nIn the classical case, T1 + T2=3 GeV \n\nAlso, since the momenta are equal in magnitude, p = sqrt(2 m1 T1) = sqrt(2 m2 T2) \n\nTherefore, sqrt(2 m1 T1) = sqrt(2 m2 T2) \u2192 m1 T1 = m2 T2 \n\nSince m1 =2 m2, \n\n2 m2 * T1 = m2 T2 \u2192 T2=2 T1 \n\nThus T1 +2 T1=3 T1 =3 GeV \u2192 T1=1 GeV \n\nThus that part is correct. \n\nSo the difference is 0.0015 GeV=1.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, maybe my assumption of p=20 GeV is an approximation. \n\nWait let's use the exact equation. \n\nWe have the equation sqrt(x\u00b2 +198\u00b2) + sqrt(x\u00b2 +99\u00b2)=300 \n\nLet me denote that B= sqrt(x\u00b2+99\u00b2)=101 when x=20. \n\nThen A = sqrt(x\u00b2 +198\u00b2)= sqrt( x\u00b2+ (2*99)^2 ) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + 4*99\u00b2) \n\nWait, perhaps there's a relation here. \n\nWait 198 is 2*99, so m1 is twice m2. \n\nHmm, but perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the relativistic T1 is double the classical, but I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the relativistic T1. \n\nWait if x=20, then T1 = sqrt(20\u00b2 +198\u00b2) -198 \n\n= sqrt(39604) -198 \n\nIf 199\u00b2 is 39601, then sqrt(39604)=sqrt(199\u00b2+3)=199+ (3)/(2*199) , using the binomial approximation. \n\nThus sqrt(39604)=199 + 3/(2*199) =199 + ~0.007537 \n\nThus total T1 is (199.007537 -198)=1.0075 GeV \n\nWait that's different from before. \n\nWait if sqrt(39604) is 199.0075, then the difference is 1.0075-1=0.0075 GeV =7.5 MeV \n\nHmm, but why the discrepancy? \n\nWait let's compute sqrt(39604) precisely. \n\nLet me compute 199.0075 squared: \n\n(199 + 0.0075)^2 =199\u00b2 +2*199*0.0075 + (0.0075)^2 \n\n=39601 + 3*0.0075*200 (no, wait 2*199*0.0075 = 2*199=398 *0.0075= 3. \n\nWait 199*0.015 =2.985. So 2*199*0.0075 =199*0.015=2.985 \n\nThus, total: \n\n199\u00b2 +2.985 + (0.0075)^2 \n\n=39601 +2.985 +0.000056 \u224839603.985 \n\nWhich is close to 39604, but not exact. \n\nSo the exact value of sqrt(39604) is slightly higher. \n\nLet me use more precise calculation. \n\nLet me set S =199. \n\nWe have S^2 =39601 \n\nWe need to find d such that (S +d)^2 =39604 \n\n(S +d)^2 = S\u00b2 + 2 S d +d\u00b2 =39601 + 398 d +d\u00b2 =39604 \n\nThus, 398d +d\u00b2 =3 \n\nAssuming d is small, d\u00b2 is negligible. \n\nSo 398 d \u22483 \u2192 d\u22483/398\u22480.0075376 \n\nSo sqrt(39604)\u2248199 +0.0075376 \n\nThus T1= (199.0075376 -198)=1.0075376 GeV \n\nThus, difference is 0.0075376 GeV \u22487.5 MeV \n\nAh! So that's where I messed up before. \n\nEarlier I thought sqrt(39604) was 199.0015, but actually it's approximately 199.0075. \n\nWait because 199.0075 squared is 39601 +2*199*0.0075 + (0.0075)^2 \n\nWait 2*199*0.0075 is 2*199=398 *0.0075= 2.985 \n\nAdding to 39601 gives 39601+2.985=39603.985, and adding the 0.000056 gives 39603.985056. \n\nBut the target is 39604, so the remaining is 0.014944. \n\nWait, so perhaps need a better approximation. \n\nLet me do a second iteration. \n\nLet me let d =0.0075376 \n\nWe have (199 +d)^2=39604 \n\nBut previous calculation gives (199 +d)^2 \u224839601 +398d +d\u00b2 \n\nSet equal to 39604 \u2192398d +d\u00b2 =3 \n\nWith d=0.0075376, \n\n398d =398*(0.0075376)=3 \n\nThus, precisely, d=3/398, so sqrt(39604)=199 +3/398 \n\nThus, T1 = [199 +3/398] -198 =1 +3/398 \n\n3/398 is approximately 0.0075376 \n\nThus, T1 =1.0075376 GeV \n\nTherefore, difference is 0.0075376 GeV \u21927.5376 MeV. \n\nAh, so approximately 7.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but the options are 2,5,10,20. \n\nHmm, but this is close to 10 MeV. But why the discrepancy? \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in the momentum. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". \n\nWait, the rest mass of fragments is m1 +m2 =0.99 M. \n\nBut when we split the original mass M into two fragments, their rest mass is less than M, so the difference is the binding energy or the energy converted to kinetic? \n\nWait that's correct. \n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the rest mass is 0.99M, so the mass defect is 0.01M, which is converted into kinetic energy. \n\nWait which we did: total kinetic energy is 0.01*M c\u00b2 =3 GeV. \n\nHmm, but in the calculation above, the difference between relativistic and classical is about7.5 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of m1 and m2. \n\nWait m1 is twice m2, so m1=2 m2. \n\nTotal m1 + m2 =3m2 =0.99M \u2192 m2=0.33M \n\nThus m1=0.66 M. \n\nSo, m1 c squared is 0.66*300=198 GeV. \n\nm2 c squared is 99 GeV. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1. \n\nWait relativistic T1 is T1_rel = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) -m1 \n\nThe classical T1 is T1_cl = p\u00b2/(2m1) \n\nThe difference is T1_rel - T1_cl \n\nWe found that this difference is about 0.0075 GeV =7.5 MeV. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait the options are A)2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20. \n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in units? \n\nWait the problem states that the rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c\u00b2=300 GeV. \n\nThe kinetic energy difference is in units of MeV. \n\nWait 7.5 MeV is closer to 10, but perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach and get 5? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the relativistic T1. Let me re-express the problem with variables. \n\nLet me try to compute the relativistic T1 using the exact equation. \n\nWe have the momentum p. \n\nThe total energy of fragment 1 is E1 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m1\u00b2) \n\nThe total energy of fragment 2 is E2 = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m2\u00b2) \n\nWe know E1 + E2 =300 GeV \n\nAlso, the total kinetic energy is E1 + E2 - (m1 +m2)c\u00b2 =300 -0.99*300 =3 GeV \n\nWe are to find T1 = E1 -m1 c\u00b2 \n\nWe can write E1 = T1 +m1 \n\nE2 = T2 +m2 \n\nSo T1 + T2 =3 GeV \n\nWe also have E1/E2 = (T1 +m1)/(T2 +m2) \n\nBut I'm not sure that helps. \n\nAlternatively, let me use the relation that the momenta are equal in magnitude. \n\nThe momentum of fragment 1 is p = (E1^2 -m1^2)^0.5 \n\nSimilarly, p = (E2^2 -m2^2)^0.5 \n\nThus, \n\nE1^2 -m1\u00b2 = E2\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 \n\nE1\u00b2 -E2\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 \n\nFactor left side: (E1 -E2)(E1 +E2) = m1\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 \n\nWe know that E1 +E2 =300 \n\nThus, \n\n(E1 -E2)*300 = m1\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 \n\nBut m1 =0.66 M, m2=0.33 M \n\nThus m1\u00b2 =0.4356 M\u00b2 \n\nm2\u00b2 =0.1089 M\u00b2 \n\nThus, m1\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 =0.3267 M\u00b2 \n\nSo, \n\n(E1 -E2)*300 =0.3267 M\u00b2 \n\nBut M is the original mass, so M c\u00b2 =300 GeV \u2192 M =300 GeV /c\u00b2 \n\nWait in units where c=1, M is 300 GeV. \n\nThus, M\u00b2 is (300 GeV)^2 \n\nTherefore, \n\n(E1 -E2)*300 =0.3267*(300)^2 \n\nDivide both sides by 300: \n\nE1 -E2 =0.3267 *300 =98.01 GeV \n\nSo E1 -E2 =98.01 GeV \n\nAlso, E1 +E2 =300 \n\nAdding the two equations: \n\n2E1 = 300 +98.01 \u2192 E1= (398.01)/2=199.005 GeV \n\nThus, E1=199.005 GeV \n\nThus, T1= E1 -m1 =199.005 -198=1.005 GeV \n\nAh! So that's the exact value. \n\nThus, T1=1.005 GeV \n\nClassical T1 is 1 GeV. \n\nThus, the difference is 0.005 GeV=5 MeV. \n\nAh! So that's where the error was. \n\nI must have made an error in the square root calculation earlier. \n\nThis method is much better. \n\nSo using the equations of conservation of energy and the momentum equality, by setting up E1 -E2 and adding equations, we get E1=199.005 GeV \n\nTherefore T1=1.005 GeV \n\nThus, the difference between the actual and classical is 0.005 GeV=5 MeV. \n\nSo the correct answer is B)5 MeV. \n\nThis approach is better because it avoids approximating the square roots and uses algebraic manipulation. \n\nSo the key steps: \n\n1. Conservation of energy and momentum gives equations for E1 and E2. \n\n2. Using the relation p1 = p2 in magnitude, leading to E1\u00b2 -m1\u00b2 = E2\u00b2 -m2\u00b2 \n\n3. Solving for E1 - E2 and then combining with energy conservation. \n\n4. Finding E1 =199.005 GeV \n\n5. Thus T1 is 1.005 GeV vs classical 1 GeV \u2192 difference of 5 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the nucleus at rest splits into two fragments with rest masses \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\), where \\( m_1 = 2m_2 \\). The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the original mass \\( M \\), so \\( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \\). This gives \\( m_1 = 0.66M \\) and \\( m_2 = 0.33M \\).\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:**\n   - Total kinetic energy \\( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) (since 1% of the initial rest energy \\( 300 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) is converted to kinetic energy).\n   - Momentum conservation requires \\( p_1 = -p_2 \\), so their magnitudes are equal: \\( p_1 = p_2 = p \\).\n\n2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy Calculation:**\n   - For each fragment, the total energy is \\( \\sqrt{p^2 c^4 + (m c^2)^2} \\).\n   - Using conservation of energy:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2} = Mc^2\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( x = pc \\). Substituting \\( m_1 c^2 = 198 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( m_2 c^2 = 99 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), we solve:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} + \\sqrt{x^2 + 99^2} = 300 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n   - Through algebraic manipulation and solving, we find \\( x \\approx 20 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).\n\n3. **Compute \\( T_1 \\):**\n   - For the more massive fragment:\n     \\[\n     T_1 = \\sqrt{(20)^2 + 198^2} - 198 \\approx 199.005 \\, \\text{GeV} - 198 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1.005 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Classical Approximation:**\n   - Using \\( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\, \\text{GeV} \\) and \\( T_2 = 2T_1 \\) (derived from momentum equality), we find \\( T_1 = 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - The difference between the relativistic \\( T_1 \\) and classical \\( T_1 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     1.005 \\, \\text{GeV} - 1 \\, \\text{GeV} = 0.005 \\, \\text{GeV} = 5 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n     \\]\n\n**Answer:** B) 5 MeV.\n\n\\boxed{B}",
