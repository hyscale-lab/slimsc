      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. It's about snakes on a circle divided into 45 arcs, each of length 1. Initially, there are 15 snakes, each occupying one arc, and they're placed every third arc. So, the circle is divided into 45 arcs, and the snakes are spaced every three arcs apart. That means the distance between the heads of each snake is 3 arcs? Hmm, maybe I should visualize it first.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The circumference is split into 45 arcs, each of length 1. So the total circumference is 45 units. There are 15 snakes, each of length 1. That means each snake is occupying exactly one arc? Wait, the problem says \"occupying every third arc.\" So, starting at some point, every third arc is occupied by a snake. Since there are 15 snakes and 45 arcs, that makes sense because 45 divided by 3 is 15. So each snake is on an arc that's three apart from the next one. So the initial configuration is like snake at positions 0, 3, 6, ..., 42? Assuming the circle is labeled from 0 to 44, maybe? Or modulo 45? Yeah, since it's a circle, positions are modulo 45.\n\nNow, every second, each snake moves either left or right by one arc, each with probability 1/2. But when two snakes touch, they merge into one snake. The merged snake then occupies all the arcs that the two previous snakes did. And this continues until there's only one snake left. We need to compute the expected time until that happens.\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem that could involve some sort of Markov chain or expected value calculation. Since each snake is moving randomly, and when they meet, they merge. The challenge is to compute the expectation.\n\nFirst, let me think about the initial configuration. Since the snakes are every third arc, the distance between any two adjacent snakes is 3 arcs. Since the circle is 45 arcs, the spacing between them is uniform. Each snake is separated by three arcs. So they are equally spaced around the circle.\n\nNow, when each snake moves either left or right, their positions will change. The key is that whenever two snakes are adjacent (distance 1 apart), they merge. So merging can only happen when two snakes are next to each other. Since initially they are three apart, they need to move closer until they meet.\n\nBut since they can move either direction, the movement is random. So perhaps this is similar to a coalescing random walk problem, where particles move and merge when they meet. Maybe there's a known formula for the expected time for all particles to merge into one in a circular arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as 15 particles on a circle with 45 positions, starting at positions 0,3,6,...,42. Each second, each particle moves left or right with equal probability. When two particles are adjacent, they merge into a single particle occupying both positions. The process continues until only one particle remains. We need the expectation of the time until all have merged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering the gaps between the snakes. Since initially, each snake is separated by three arcs, so the distance between any two consecutive snakes is 3. Let me consider the gaps between the snakes. Since the circle is divided into 45 arcs, with 15 snakes each taking one arc, there are 15 gaps between them, each of length 2. Wait, actually, each snake is one arc, so between two snakes there are two empty arcs. Because from snake at position 0, the next is at 3, so between them are arcs 1 and 2. So each gap is two arcs. Wait, but the distance between the snakes is three arcs in terms of steps, but the gap between them is two arcs because the snake itself occupies one. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the circle is labeled from 0 to 44. The snakes are at positions 0, 3, 6, ..., 42. The next snake after 42 would be at 45 mod 45 = 0, which is the first one. So between each pair of consecutive snakes, there are two arcs between them. For example, between 0 and 3, the arcs 1 and 2 are empty. So the gap between two adjacent snakes is 2 arcs. Each gap is the number of empty arcs between two snakes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to starting with 15 gaps, each of length 2, and each second, the gaps change depending on the movement of the snakes. When a gap between two snakes becomes 0, meaning the two snakes have touched, then they merge, reducing the total number of snakes by 1 and the number of gaps by 1 as well.\n\nTherefore, maybe we can model the system in terms of the gaps between the snakes. Each gap is a number that can increase or decrease over time. The key idea is that when two gaps are adjacent, their sizes can influence each other? Hmm, perhaps not directly. Alternatively, maybe each gap's evolution depends on the movement of the two snakes that form its endpoints.\n\nAlternatively, the gaps can be considered as independent processes? But since the snakes move independently, the gaps might not be independent. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a linear arrangement instead of a circle. Since the circle complicates things, but maybe the symmetry allows us to analyze it as if it were on a line with periodic boundary conditions. But I might need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since all gaps start at 2, and we need them all to merge until only one snake remains, which would mean all gaps have been closed. The process stops when all gaps are zero except one? Wait, actually, when two snakes merge, the number of snakes decreases by 1, so starting from 15 snakes, we need to have 14 merges. The process ends when there's one snake left, so the total number of merges needed is 14. Each merge reduces the number of snakes by 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the gaps between the snakes. Initially, there are 15 gaps each of size 2. Each gap can decrease or increase depending on the movement of the two adjacent snakes.\n\nLet me consider a single gap between two snakes. Let's label the two ends of the gap as snake A and snake B. Each second, snake A can move left or right, and snake B can move left or right, each with probability 1/2. The gap between them is determined by their movements.\n\nWait, but since they are on a circle, moving left or right for each snake is relative. Let me fix a direction. Let's say the gap between snake A at position x and snake B at position y (with y > x) is (y - x - 1) arcs. If snake A moves to the right, it would go to x+1, and snake B moves to the left, it would go to y-1, then the gap between them would decrease by 2. If both move towards each other, the gap decreases by 2, if both move away, the gap increases by 2, and if one moves towards and the other away, the gap stays the same.\n\nWait, actually, let's think carefully. Let me denote the two endpoints of a gap. Let me suppose the gap is between snake A at position a and snake B at position b, such that the distance from a to b clockwise is (b - a) arcs. Wait, but since it's a circle, the actual distance is the minimal. But since initially, all gaps are 3 arcs apart (since the snakes are every third arc), so the distance between two adjacent snakes is 3 arcs. Wait, but earlier I thought the gap was 2? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me clarify again. If the snakes are at positions 0, 3, 6,...,42, then between 0 and 3, the arcs are 1 and 2. So the distance between snake at 0 and the next at 3 is 3 arcs (since moving clockwise from 0, you pass 1,2,3). So the distance between them is 3. But the number of empty arcs between them is 2. So maybe the distance is 3, but the gap (empty space) is 2. Hmm, so perhaps the gap size is the number of arcs between the two snakes, so between 0 and 3, it's 2 empty arcs, so gap size 2. Therefore, the distance between the snakes is gap size + 1 (since the snake itself is at the end). So the distance is gap +1.\n\nTherefore, if the gap is size g, the distance between the two snakes is g+1. So, when the gap becomes 0, the distance is 1, so the two snakes are adjacent and merge. Therefore, the merging occurs when the gap reaches 0.\n\nTherefore, each gap starts at size 2, and we need all gaps to reach 0. However, once two snakes merge, the adjacent gaps become combined. Wait, actually, when two snakes merge, the two gaps adjacent to them also merge? Let me think. Suppose we have three snakes: A, B, C, with gaps between A and B of size g1 and between B and C of size g2. When B and C merge, then the new snake spans from A's position to C's position, so the gap between A and the merged snake would be g1 + g2 +1? Wait, actually, no. Let's think step by step.\n\nSuppose the original configuration is A at position 0, B at position 3, and C at position 6. The gap between A and B is 2 (arcs 1 and 2), and between B and C is also 2 (arcs 4 and 5). If B and C merge, the merged snake would occupy positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, no. Wait, each snake is of length 1, so originally, each occupies one arc. When they merge, they form a snake that occupies all the arcs of the previous snakes. Since B was at 3 and C at 6, merging them would require that they are adjacent. Wait, but initially, they are separated by two arcs. So they can only merge when they come into contact. So, when they move towards each other until their positions are adjacent, then they merge into a snake that spans from B's original position to C's? Wait, actually, when they are adjacent, say B is at position 5 and C is at 6, then merging would create a snake from 5 to 6, which is length 2? Hmm, maybe the merged snake's length is the sum of the previous lengths.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the merged snake moves as one snake.\" So perhaps the merged snake's length is the sum of the two previous snakes. Since each was length 1, the merged snake is length 2. So, when two snakes merge, their combined length is 2, and they occupy the arcs of both. So their positions are now from the leftmost to the rightmost of the original two.\n\nTherefore, in terms of gaps, when two adjacent snakes merge, the two gaps adjacent to them are combined into a single gap. For instance, if snakes A and B merge, then the gap between A and B is eliminated, and the gaps on either side (if any) would now be between the merged snake and the next snake. But actually, since the merged snake is now occupying more arcs, the gaps around it would adjust accordingly.\n\nThis complicates the analysis because the gaps are not independent; merging affects neighboring gaps.\n\nHmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way to model this. Since all the snakes start equally spaced, perhaps the problem has symmetry, so we can consider the system in terms of the gaps between the snakes, and model each gap's behavior as a random walk?\n\nWait, if all the gaps start at the same size (size 2), and due to symmetry, maybe each gap behaves independently? Although their movements are not independent because the movement of one snake affects two gaps. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe because of the circular symmetry, the expected time for all gaps to reach zero can be considered similarly to a system of independent gaps, but adjusted for the circular nature.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is on a circle, it's a closed system, so when considering gaps, the total number of arcs not occupied by snakes is constant? Wait, initially, each snake is 1 unit, so total occupied is 15. Total circumference is 45, so gaps total to 30. But when snakes merge, their combined snake takes up more arcs, so the total occupied increases. Wait, actually, when two snakes merge, their total length becomes 2, so the number of occupied arcs increases by 1 (since they were each 1 before). Wait no, actually, each snake is made up of arcs. Initially, each snake is length 1 (occupying 1 arc). When they merge, they occupy all the arcs between their original positions. Wait, actually, the problem says \"occupying every third arc\" initially, so each snake is 1 arc. When they merge, the merged snake would occupy all arcs from the leftmost to the rightmost of the two original snakes. So if two adjacent snakes were separated by some distance, merging them would create a snake of length equal to the distance between them plus one? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose two snakes are at positions x and y, with x < y, and the distance between them (along the circle) is d. When they merge, the new snake occupies all arcs from x to y, so its length is d. Since each original snake was 1, so the total length would be d = (y - x). Wait, but the original total length was 1 + 1 = 2, so the new length is d. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me see with an example.\n\nSuppose two snakes are at positions 0 and 3. The distance between them is 3 (arcs 0,1,2,3?), so maybe the distance is 3 arcs. If they move towards each other until they are adjacent. Let's say they end up at positions 2 and 3. Then merging would create a snake from 2 to 3, which is length 2. Wait, but they started at 0 and 3, so how did they end up at 2 and 3? Maybe they moved towards each other. Each second, they move left or right. The exact path would depend on their movements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model each pair of adjacent snakes as a system where their relative distance is a random variable, and the time until they meet is the time until their relative distance reaches 1 (so they are adjacent). But since they are on a circle, their relative motion is a combination of their individual movements.\n\nAlternatively, consider the movement of two adjacent snakes as a single random walk. Let me think of two particles moving on a circle, each moving left or right with probability 1/2 every second. The distance between them changes based on their movements.\n\nSuppose we have two snakes, A and B. Let\u2019s track the distance between them. Let\u2019s denote the distance as D. Since they are on a circle, the distance can be measured in either direction, but we can fix a direction. Let\u2019s say the clockwise distance from A to B is D. Each second, both A and B move either left or right. The change in distance depends on their movements.\n\nIf A moves clockwise (right) and B moves counter-clockwise (left), then the distance between them decreases by 2. If both move clockwise, the distance remains the same (since both move in the same direction). Similarly, if both move counter-clockwise, the distance remains the same. If A moves counter-clockwise and B moves clockwise, the distance increases by 2.\n\nWait, actually, let me think carefully. Let me model their positions numerically. Let me set the circle to have circumference N = 45, with positions labeled 0 to 44. Let\u2019s suppose snake A is at position x and snake B is at position y, with y > x (distance clockwise is y - x). Each second, A moves either to x+1 or x-1 mod 45, and similarly B moves to y+1 or y-1 mod 45. The new positions will affect the new distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the relative motion. Let\u2019s consider the movement of A relative to B. The distance between them can be thought of as a random walk on the integers modulo 45, but since we want them to meet, we can consider it as a one-dimensional random walk on a line (ignoring the circular boundary for a moment, but since they are on a circle, the distance can wrap around).\n\nWait, maybe instead, model the distance between A and B as a random variable. Let\u2019s denote D_t as the distance between A and B at time t. We want to find the expected time until D_t = 1 (so they are adjacent, then they merge). But actually, when the distance becomes 1, they can merge. Wait, but the distance can also be measured the other way. Since it's a circle, the minimal distance between them is min(D, 45 - D). Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, let's fix the direction and consider the clockwise distance between them. Suppose initially the clockwise distance is 3 arcs (since they are every third arc). Each second, the distance can change based on their movements.\n\nLet me consider the change in distance. Let me define the distance D. Each snake moves left or right. Let me define the movement of A and B as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose snake A moves to the right (clockwise) with probability 1/2, or left (counter-clockwise) with probability 1/2. Similarly for snake B. But their directions are independent.\n\nThe change in distance depends on their relative movements. Let me think of the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Both snakes move in the same direction (both right or both left). Then, the distance between them remains the same. Because if both go right, their distance stays the same. Similarly, both left.\n\nCase 2: Snake A moves right and B moves left. Then, the distance between them decreases by 2, because A is moving towards B and B is moving towards A.\n\nCase 3: Snake A moves left and B moves right. Then, the distance increases by 2.\n\nWait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose initially the distance is D. If A moves right and B moves left, then A's new position is x+1, B's new position is y-1. The new distance clockwise would be (y - 1) - (x + 1) = (y - x) - 2 = D - 2.\n\nSimilarly, if A moves left (to x-1) and B moves right (to y+1), then the new distance is (y +1) - (x -1) = (y - x) + 2 = D + 2.\n\nIf they move in the same direction, then their distance remains D.\n\nTherefore, the change in distance \u0394D is:\n\n-2 with probability 1/4 (A right, B left),\n\n+2 with probability 1/4 (A left, B right),\n\n0 with probability 1/2 (both same direction).\n\nTherefore, the distance D undergoes a random walk with step sizes -2, +2, or 0, with probabilities 1/4, 1/4, and 1/2 respectively.\n\nBut since we are on a circle, the distance can wrap around. However, since we are interested in the distance decreasing to 1 (so they can merge), perhaps we can model this as a one-dimensional walk on the integers from 1 to some maximum, with absorbing state at 1. Wait, but the initial distance is 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, in this problem, the merging happens when the distance between two snakes becomes 1 (so adjacent), so the absorbing state is 1. But the distance can also go above 45, but since it's a circle, the maximum distance between two points is 22 (since beyond that, it's shorter the other way). Wait, but perhaps since we are tracking the clockwise distance, the distance can go up to 44. But in our case, since the snakes start at a distance of 3, maybe the walk is on the interval 1 to (45 -1), but with periodic boundary conditions? Hmm, this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe since the initial distance between any two adjacent snakes is 3, and we can model the time until they meet (distance 1) as a first passage time problem for this random walk starting at 3, with absorbing barrier at 1.\n\nBut before proceeding, let me check: when two snakes are at distance D, the probability transitions are as above. The walk can only change by \u00b12 or stay. So actually, the distance must always have the same parity as the starting distance. Since 3 is odd, all distances will remain odd. Because each step changes the distance by an even number (-2, +2, or 0). Therefore, the distance can never be even. Since we start at 3 (odd), it can go to 1, 5, etc. Wait, but 1 is odd, so if we reach 1, that's the absorbing state. So actually, the distance can only reach 1 if it started at an odd distance. Since 3 is odd, that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional random walk starting at 3, with absorbing barrier at 1 (merging), and reflecting barriers at other points? Or is there a maximum distance?\n\nWait, actually, on the circle, the maximum distance is 44 (since if you go the other way around, it's shorter). So the walk is confined between 1 and 44, but since distances are tracked in one direction, perhaps we can model it as a walk on the integers from 1 to 44, where the walk can go to D \u00b1 2 with some probability, or stay.\n\nHowever, the walk is not symmetric because the maximum distance could be 44, but that's equivalent to a distance of 1 the other way. So actually, we can model the walk on the circle as a one-dimensional walk on distances from 1 to 22 (since beyond 22, it's shorter the other way). But perhaps the exact model is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat the distance as a number between 1 and 44, but with the walk being symmetric except that at the ends, the distance wraps around. However, since we are only interested in the first time the distance reaches 1, perhaps we can consider it as a one-dimensional walk on integers from 1 upwards, with the only absorbing state at 1, and otherwise the walk can go up or down in steps of 2, but with certain probabilities.\n\nWait, but actually, since they are on a circle, if the distance becomes too large (greater than 22), it's equivalent to a shorter distance in the opposite direction. However, since we are only considering the clockwise distance, the distance can go up to 44. But if the distance exceeds 22, then the other direction distance would be 45 - D, which is smaller. But in terms of the process, the snakes can still move in either direction, so the distance can increase beyond 22, but then the other snake could be approaching from the other side. Hmm, this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by symmetry. Since all the gaps start at the same distance, and the circle is symmetric, maybe the expected time for all gaps to merge can be calculated by considering the expected time for a single gap to reach 0 (i.e., the two snakes meet), and then scaling appropriately.\n\nWait, but in the problem, there are 15 gaps, each of size 2. Each gap has its own merging process, but when a gap merges, it affects the adjacent gaps. So the gaps are not independent. Hmm, perhaps the key is that the merging of two snakes reduces the number of gaps by 1, so starting with 15 gaps, we need to have 14 merges. But each merge reduces the number of gaps, so perhaps the expectation can be expressed as the sum over each gap's expected time until merging, but adjusted for dependencies?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a coupon collector problem? Not exactly, but in some way, since each merge reduces the number of snakes, but the dependencies complicate it.\n\nAlternatively, since all gaps are symmetric and start the same, perhaps the expected time until all have merged is 15 times the expected time for a single gap to merge? But that might not be correct since they are not independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the \"coalescing Brownian motions\" on a circle, but discrete-time. I might need to recall some known results.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the concept of expected meeting time for two random walkers on a circle.\n\nSuppose two particles start at distance d apart on a circle of circumference N. Each step, each particle moves left or right with probability 1/2. The expected time until they meet can be calculated. If I can find that expectation, then perhaps for each pair of adjacent snakes, the expected time until they merge is T(d), and since all gaps start at distance 3 (or gap size 2?), maybe I can compute T(3) or T(2).\n\nWait, let me get back to the distance terminology. Let's clarify once and for all:\n\nSuppose two adjacent snakes are separated by a gap of size g, meaning there are g arcs between them. The distance between them along the circle (in the direction of the gap) is g + 1 (since they each occupy one arc). So, if the gap is size 2, the distance is 3.\n\nTherefore, the initial distance between any two adjacent snakes is 3. So, to model the merging time between two adjacent snakes, we can model the meeting time of two particles starting at distance 3 on a circle of circumference 45, moving as described.\n\nWait, but actually, the two snakes are moving independently, each moving left or right each second. So effectively, their relative motion is a combination of their individual movements. Let me model the distance between them as a random walk.\n\nLet me consider two particles, A and B, on a circle of circumference N=45. Let\u2019s fix the circle as positions 0 to 44. Let the initial distance between A and B be D_0 = 3 (clockwise).\n\nEach second, each particle moves left or right with probability 1/2. The change in distance \u0394D is as before:\n\n- If both move in the same direction, distance stays the same.\n\n- If A moves towards B and B moves away, distance increases by 2? Wait, let me recast:\n\nWait, let me think in terms of displacement. Let me denote the movement of A as +1 (right) or -1 (left), and similarly for B. The displacement of the distance is (movement of B - movement of A). Because if A moves to the right (direction of B), then the distance decreases by 1 if B stays, etc. Wait, perhaps better to compute \u0394D = (B's movement - A's movement). Wait, no, because:\n\nSuppose the distance D is the clockwise distance from A to B. If A moves clockwise (right) and B moves counterclockwise (left), then the new distance is D - (A's step) - (B's step). Wait, maybe this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the relative speed. The relative motion between the two particles can be considered as the difference in their steps. Each second, the relative displacement between A and B is (step_B - step_A). Since each step is +1 or -1 with probability 1/2, then the relative displacement is:\n\nEach second, the relative displacement can be:\n\nIf both move right: step_B - step_A = 0.\n\nIf A moves right and B moves left: step_B - step_A = (-1) - (+1) = -2.\n\nIf A moves left and B moves right: step_B - step_A = (+1) - (-1) = +2.\n\nIf both move left: step_B - step_A = 0.\n\nTherefore, the relative displacement each second is either -2, 0, or +2, with probabilities:\n\n-2 occurs when A moves right and B left: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\n+2 occurs when A moves left and B right: 1/4.\n\n0 occurs with probability 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B changes by \u0394D = relative displacement. Wait, actually, the distance D is a quantity on the circle. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the initial distance is D. After a step, the new distance is D + \u0394D', where \u0394D' is the relative displacement. However, since it's on a circle, the distance is modulo N, but since we can consider it as a signed distance, but the actual distance is the minimal, but perhaps for the purposes of the random walk, we can consider it as an integer that can go negative or exceed N, but we have to adjust it modulo N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance is on a linear scale from 1 to N-1, with transitions as per the relative displacement. However, this is getting complicated. Let me try to compute the expected time for two particles to meet starting at distance D.\n\nLet me denote E(D) as the expected time until the two particles meet, starting at distance D. We need to find E(3).\n\nThe meeting occurs when the distance becomes 0 or N (since on a circle, distance N is equivalent to 0). However, in our case, the distance between two adjacent snakes is initially 3, and we want them to reach distance 1 (so that they are adjacent and merge). Wait, actually, when their distance becomes 1, they are adjacent and can merge. Wait, hold on, confusion again between distance and gap.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the terminology. Let me redefine:\n\nLet\u2019s define the \"gap\" between two adjacent snakes as the number of empty arcs between them. So if the gap is g, the distance between the two snakes is g + 1 (since each snake occupies 1 arc). So to merge, the gap must reach 0 (distance 1). Therefore, starting from a gap of 2 (distance 3), we need the gap to reach 0. The gap itself can be modeled as a random walk on the non-negative integers, starting at 2, with absorbing state at 0. The transitions of the gap g are as follows:\n\nEach second, the gap can:\n\n- Increase by 2 with probability 1/4 (if the two snakes move away from each other),\n\n- Decrease by 2 with probability 1/4 (if they move towards each other),\n\n- Stay the same with probability 1/2 (if they move in the same direction).\n\nTherefore, the gap performs a random walk with step size -2, 0, +2 with probabilities 1/4, 1/2, 1/4, except when at the boundary (gap=0, which is absorbing). Wait, but actually, when the gap is 0, they have merged, so we can't have a negative gap. Hmm, but actually, if the gap is 1, it can go to -1? No, since the gap can't be negative. Wait, actually, the gap must stay non-negative. Therefore, the walk is on the non-negative integers, with step size -2, 0, +2, but when at gap=1, a step of -2 would take it to -1, which is invalid, so perhaps at the lower boundary, the walk is censored?\n\nThis complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the walk is only allowed to reach 0, and when at gap=1, the step of -2 is instead reflected or adjusted. Hmm, this is getting too involved. Let me try to model it as an absorbing Markov chain where the states are gaps from 0 to infinity, but in reality, on a circle, the maximum possible gap between two adjacent snakes is N - 2 (since the other snakes are present). Wait, but with multiple snakes, the gaps can't be too large because the other snakes are in between. Hmm, actually, maybe in the problem, since all gaps are initially 2, and snakes can only merge with their immediate neighbors, the maximum gap size can't grow indefinitely because other snakes might block it. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since all snakes are moving independently, the gaps between them can grow or shrink, but because it's a circle, the total number of arcs not occupied by snakes is fixed? Wait, no. When snakes merge, their combined snake occupies more arcs. Initially, total occupied is 15 arcs. After a merge, it becomes 16, then 17, etc., until one snake occupies all 45 arcs. Wait a second, actually the total number of arcs is fixed at 45. Each snake's length is the number of arcs it occupies, so when two snakes merge, the new snake's length is the sum of their lengths plus the distance between them? Wait, no, actually, the problem states \"occupying every third arc initially,\" but when they merge, they occupy all the arcs between their original positions. Wait, perhaps the length of a snake is the number of arcs it occupies. Initially, each is 1. When two snakes merge, the new snake's length is the distance between the two original snakes (since they now occupy all arcs in between). Wait, but the distance between two snakes is the number of arcs between them plus 1 (since they each occupy one). So if two snakes are separated by a gap of g (so distance g + 1), then merging them would create a snake of length (g + 1). Therefore, the total length of all snakes increases by g each merge. Hmm, but this complicates the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that regardless of the merging process, the expected time until all snakes merge into one is the same as the expected time for all the gaps between the initial snakes to be \"closed,\" and due to symmetry, we can model this as similar to a system of independent coalescing random walks, where each pair of adjacent snakes must meet.\n\nAlternatively, since all gaps are symmetric and start at the same distance, perhaps the expected time can be computed by considering one gap and multiplying by the number of gaps? But that might not be accurate because the merging events are not independent.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the concept of \"coupon collector problem,\" but with dependencies. Suppose each merge reduces the number of snakes by 1, so from 15 to 14, etc., down to 1. The expected time could be the sum over each step of the expected time to merge one more snake given the current number.\n\nLet me define E(n) as the expected time to reach one snake from n snakes. Then, E(1) = 0, and we need E(15). To find E(n), perhaps when there are n snakes, each pair of adjacent snakes has some probability of merging in the next step, so the expected time until a merge occurs is 1/(rate), and then we can write a recursive formula.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the merging events are not independent; the movement of one snake affects multiple gaps. Therefore, the rate at which merges occur depends on the current configuration, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the initial symmetric setup, the expected time can be calculated by considering that each of the 15 gaps is a symmetric random walk starting at distance 3 (gap 2), and the first time any of them reaches 0 (gap 0) will cause a merge, but then the system changes. However, since all gaps are symmetric and independent initially, maybe the expected time until the first merge occurs is the minimum of 15 independent expected first passage times?\n\nWait, but the gaps are not independent because the movement of a snake affects two adjacent gaps. So their evolutions are dependent.\n\nHmm, this is quite challenging. Let me see if I can find any similar problems or standard results.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of each pair of adjacent snakes as performing a random walk towards or away from each other, and the expected time until they meet is known.\n\nSuppose two particles on a line, starting distance D apart, each moving left or right with probability 1/2 each step. The expected meeting time is known to be D^2. But on a circle, it's different.\n\nAlternatively, for two particles on a circle of circumference N, starting distance D apart, the expected time until they meet can be calculated.\n\nIn general, for two symmetric random walks on a circle, the meeting time can be analyzed as follows:\n\nThe relative motion between the two particles is a random walk with step size -2, 0, +2 as we saw earlier. Since the walk is symmetric, the expected time to hit 0 starting from D is proportional to D^2? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the expected time for two particles starting at distance D to meet on a circle.\n\nLet me model the relative distance as a Markov chain. Let the distance be an integer between 1 and N-1 (since on a circle, beyond that it wraps around). However, because of the symmetry, the meeting time can be considered on a line from 0 to N/2, with D and N-D being equivalent.\n\nBut let's consider that on a circle of circumference N, the two particles will meet when their relative displacement reaches 0 mod N.\n\nAlternatively, since the walk is symmetric, the expected time to meet starting from distance D is the same as starting from distance N - D. Let me denote the expected time as T(D). Then, we can set up the recurrence relations.\n\nFor the relative distance D, the expected time T(D) satisfies:\n\nT(D) = 1 + (1/4) T(D - 2) + (1/2) T(D) + (1/4) T(D + 2)\n\nThis comes from the fact that in one step, with probability 1/4, the distance decreases by 2, with 1/2 it stays the same, and with 1/4 it increases by 2. However, this is only valid for 2 \u2264 D \u2264 N - 2. For D = 1, T(1) = 1 + ... but once D reaches 1, the next step could lead to 0 or 3.\n\nWait, actually, when D=1, the next step:\n\nWith probability 1/4, distance becomes 1 - 2 = -1, which mod N would be N-1, but since we're considering distance as the minimal, it would be 1 (since distance can't be negative). Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps on the circle, the distance can be considered modulo N, but since we want the first time they meet (distance 0), we can model it as a one-dimensional walk on 0 to N with 0 being the absorbing state.\n\nWait, let's try to set up the equations properly.\n\nDefine T(D) as the expected time to reach 0 starting from distance D (1 \u2264 D \u2264 N-1). Note that T(0) = 0.\n\nFor D = 1:\n\nT(1) = 1 + (1/4) T( (1 - 2) mod N ) + (1/2) T(1) + (1/4) T(3)\n\nBut since we are on a circle, the distance can't be negative. However, if D=1 and it decreases by 2, the new distance would be N -1. Wait, this complicates things because the walk becomes periodic.\n\nAlternatively, if we ignore the circular nature and consider the distance on a line from 0 to infinity, but with the understanding that when the distance would go negative, it's reflected or something. Hmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think on the line where the two particles can move freely, and compute the expected meeting time, then adjust for the circular boundary conditions.\n\nWait, in the problem, the circle is finite, so the two particles can't drift off to infinity, so their relative motion is confined. Maybe the expected meeting time on a circle of circumference N is similar to that on a line, but with adjusted boundary conditions.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by electrical networks. The expected time can be related to resistances, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that on a circle, the expected time for two particles to meet starting at distance D is proportional to D*(N - D). For a circle of circumference N, the expected meeting time T(D) = D*(N - D). Wait, I think I remember that for two symmetric random walks on a circle, the expected meeting time is indeed D*(N - D). Let me check if this formula makes sense.\n\nSuppose N = 45, and D = 3 (distance between two adjacent snakes initially). Then T(3) would be 3*(45 - 3) = 3*42 = 126. But this might be the case if they were moving on a line, but on a circle?\n\nWait, actually, I think for two continuous-time random walks on a circle, the expected meeting time might be different, but in discrete time, perhaps similar.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem on a line first. Suppose two particles start at distance D apart on the integer line. Each step, each moves left or right with probability 1/2. The expected time until they meet is D^2. This is a classic result.\n\nIn our case, on a circle of circumference N, the distance can be considered as D or N - D. So the minimal distance is min(D, N - D). However, the movement is such that the relative displacement is a random walk with step size -2, 0, +2 with probabilities 1/4, 1/2, 1/4.\n\nWait, in the line case, the expected meeting time is D^2. For the circle case, perhaps the expected time is D*(N - D). Let me test with N=4, D=1. Then T(1) = 1*(3)=3. Let's see if that holds.\n\nSuppose N=4, starting distance D=1. The particles are at positions 0 and 1. Each step:\n\nEach has 1/2 chance to move left or right. Let's track their positions:\n\nAt time 0: positions 0 and 1.\n\nTime 1:\n\nParticle A (at 0) can go to 1 or 3 (mod 4). Particle B (at 1) can go to 0 or 2.\n\nSo possible new distances:\n\nIf both move towards each other: A to 1, B to 0: distance becomes 3 (since 0 and 1 meet, but on circle, distance 1? Wait, actually, if they swap positions, the distance is still 1. Wait, confusion.\n\nWait, let's compute the distance after each step.\n\nCase 1: A moves to 1, B moves to 0. Then they have swapped places, distance remains 1 (since distance is minimal, which is still 1).\n\nCase 2: A moves to 1, B moves to 2. New positions 1 and 2, distance 1.\n\nCase 3: A moves to 3, B moves to 0. Distance from 3 to 0 is 1 (since on circle, 3 to 0 is 1 mod 4).\n\nCase 4: A moves to 3, B moves to 2. New positions 3 and 2, distance 1.\n\nWait, actually, in all cases, the distance remains 1? That can't be. Wait, that suggests that if they start at distance 1 on a circle of 4, they never meet?\n\nWait, no. Wait, when they are at positions 0 and 1, if they move towards each other, like A moves to 1 and B moves to 0, then they have swapped positions but are still at distance 1. To actually meet, they need to be at the same position?\n\nWait a second, perhaps in the problem, merging occurs not just when they are adjacent, but when they are in the same position? Wait, going back to the problem statement: \"If two snakes ever touch, they merge\". The term \"touch\" might mean occupying adjacent arcs? Or the same arc?\n\nThe problem states: \"occupying every third arc\" initially, so each snake is on one arc. When they move, they can move to adjacent arcs. \"If two snakes ever touch, they merge\". The exact definition of \"touch\" is key here. The problem says \"touch\" when their arcs are adjacent? Or when they are on the same arc?\n\nThe problem says \"occupying every third arc\" initially. Each snake is length 1, so they occupy a single arc. When they move, they move to an adjacent arc. \"If two snakes ever touch, they merge\". So \"touching\" probably means occupying the same arc. Because if they are on adjacent arcs, they are not touching. Wait, but the problem says \"touch\", which might mean adjacent? Hmm, this is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"If two snakes ever touch, they merge to form a single snake occupying the arcs of both of the previous snakes\".\n\nSo when two snakes are on adjacent arcs, their arcs are adjacent, so they \"touch\", so they merge. So merging occurs when two snakes are on adjacent arcs. Therefore, the distance between them (in terms of arcs) must be 1 for them to merge. Wait, but distance between them as 1 would mean they are on adjacent arcs, so that's when they merge. Therefore, in that case, the distance D between them must reach 1 (arc separation), so the gap between them (number of empty arcs between them) is 0.\n\nWait, this is critical. So the gap is the number of empty arcs between them. To merge, the gap must be 0 (distance 1). So starting from a gap of 2 (distance 3), they need to reduce the gap to 0.\n\nTherefore, the distance D between them is gap +1. So starting gap of 2 corresponds to D=3.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the expected time for a gap starting at 2 (so distance 3) to reach 0 (distance 1), with the gap's random walk as described earlier.\n\nSo the key is to compute E(2), the expected time for a gap starting at size 2 to reach 0, where the gap can increase by 2, decrease by 2, or stay the same each step with probabilities 1/4, 1/4, 1/2.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote E(g) as the expected time to reach 0 starting from gap g. We need to find E(2).\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nFor g \u2265 1,\n\nE(g) = 1 + (1/4) E(g - 2) + (1/2) E(g) + (1/4) E(g + 2)\n\nWith the boundary condition E(0) = 0.\n\nWait, but when g=1,\n\nE(1) = 1 + (1/4) E(-1) + (1/2) E(1) + (1/4) E(3)\n\nBut E(-1) is invalid, since the gap can't be negative. So actually, when the gap is 1, a step of -2 would lead to gap -1, which is impossible, so perhaps in that case, the gap can only decrease to -1, but since it can't, maybe it stays? Or does the walk reflect?\n\nAlternatively, when at gap=1, moving towards each other (which would decrease the gap by 2) would result in a negative gap, which is impossible, so perhaps in such a case, the gap cannot decrease further, so that transition is invalid, and instead, the probability redistributes?\n\nHmm, this complicates the recurrence. Maybe I need to adjust the recurrence relations for the boundary conditions.\n\nLet me think again. The gap can't be negative. So when the gap is 1, the possible transitions are:\n\n- With probability 1/4 (both snakes move towards each other): the gap would become -1, which is invalid. Therefore, perhaps this transition is impossible, so instead, the gap can\u2019t decrease below 0. So actually, when the gap is 1, moving to -1 is not allowed, so that probability is instead added to staying or increasing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities must be adjusted so that when a move would take the gap below 0, it instead results in the gap reaching 0 (merging) immediately?\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the snakes are at gap 1, and they both move towards each other (which would decrease the gap by 2), then they would actually merge (since the gap would go to -1, but that means they've overlapped). Therefore, when the gap is 1, a step that would decrease it by 2 (probability 1/4) actually results in merging (gap 0), so that transition leads to absorption.\n\nTherefore, correcting the recurrence:\n\nFor g \u2265 1,\n\nE(g) = 1 + (prob decrease)*E(g-2) + (prob stay)*E(g) + (prob increase)*E(g+2)\n\nBut with the caveat that when g=1:\n\nThe probability to decrease is 1/4, but decreasing from 1 would lead to -1, which is invalid, so instead, that 1/4 chance leads to absorption (E=0).\n\nSimilarly, for g=1,\n\nE(1) = 1 + (1/4)*0 + (1/2)*E(1) + (1/4)*E(3)\n\nBecause the 1/4 chance to decrease leads to immediate absorption (gap 0).\n\nSimilarly, for g=2,\n\nE(2) = 1 + (1/4)*E(0) + (1/2)*E(2) + (1/4)*E(4)\n\nHere, decreasing from 2 to 0 is possible (since 2-2=0, which is valid).\n\nFor g \u2265 3,\n\nE(g) = 1 + (1/4)*E(g-2) + (1/2)*E(g) + (1/4)*E(g+2)\n\nAnd for g=0, E(0)=0.\n\nSimilarly, for g=1, as above.\n\nContinuing this way, we can set up the equations.\n\nLet me write the equations step by step.\n\nFirst, E(0) = 0.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nE(1) = 1 + (1/4)(0) + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3)\n\n=> E(1) = 1 + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4E(1) = 4 + 2E(1) + E(3)\n\n=> 2E(1) - E(3) = 4 --> Equation (1)\n\nFor g=2:\n\nE(2) = 1 + (1/4)E(0) + (1/2)E(2) + (1/4)E(4)\n\n=> E(2) = 1 + 0 + (1/2)E(2) + (1/4)E(4)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(2) = 4 + 2E(2) + E(4)\n\n=> 2E(2) - E(4) = 4 --> Equation (2)\n\nFor g=3:\n\nE(3) = 1 + (1/4)E(1) + (1/2)E(3) + (1/4)E(5)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(3) = 4 + E(1) + 2E(3) + E(5)\n\n=> 2E(3) - E(5) = 4 + E(1) --> Equation (3)\n\nSimilarly, for g=4:\n\nE(4) = 1 + (1/4)E(2) + (1/2)E(4) + (1/4)E(6)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(4) = 4 + E(2) + 2E(4) + E(6)\n\n=> 2E(4) - E(6) = 4 + E(2) --> Equation (4)\n\nContinuing this pattern, for general g \u2265 1:\n\n2E(g) - E(g+2) = 4 + [E(g-2) if g > 1 else 0]\n\nWait, actually, looking at Equation (1): For g=1, the equation becomes 2E(1) - E(3) = 4.\n\nEquation (2) for g=2: 2E(2) - E(4) =4 + E(0) ? Wait no, in Equation (2):\n\nWait, Equation (2) is 2E(2) - E(4) =4, which is similar to Equation (1). Hmm, perhaps the general form for g \u22651 is:\n\n2E(g) - E(g+2) = 4 + (E(g-2) if g \u22652 else 0?)\n\nWait, no, looking at Equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) is 2E(3) - E(5) =4 + E(1)\n\nSimilarly, Equation (4): 2E(4) - E(6) =4 + E(2)\n\nAh, so in general for g \u22651:\n\n2E(g) - E(g+2) =4 + E(g-2) for g \u22652,\n\nand for g=1:\n\n2E(1) - E(3) =4.\n\nThus, for g \u22652:\n\n2E(g) - E(g+2) = 4 + E(g-2)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nLet me rearrange the recurrence for g \u22652:\n\nE(g+2) = 2E(g) - E(g-2) -4.\n\nHmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nTo solve this, we can look for a particular solution and homogeneous solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is:\n\nE(g+2) - 2E(g) + E(g-2) =0.\n\nThe characteristic equation would be ?\n\nLet me assume a solution of the form E(g) = r^g.\n\nSubstituting into homogeneous equation:\n\nr^{g+2} - 2r^g + r^{g-2}=0\n\nDivide by r^{g-2}:\n\nr^4 - 2r^2 +1 =0\n\nLet y = r^2:\n\ny^2 -2y +1 =0 \u21d2 (y -1)^2 =0 \u21d2 y=1 (double root).\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is E_h(g) = (A + Bg)(1)^g = A + Bg.\n\nNow, look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is -4, we can try a constant particular solution, but since the homogeneous solution already includes a constant, we need to try a quadratic function. Let\u2019s suppose a particular solution of the form E_p(g) = Cg^2.\n\nPlugging into the nonhomogeneous equation:\n\nE_p(g+2) -2E_p(g) + E_p(g-2) = -4\n\nCompute each term:\n\nE_p(g+2) = C(g+2)^2,\n\n-2E_p(g) = -2Cg^2,\n\nE_p(g-2) = C(g-2)^2.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nC[(g+2)^2 -2g^2 + (g-2)^2] = -4\n\nExpand the squares:\n\n(g+2)^2 = g^2 +4g +4,\n\n(g-2)^2 =g^2 -4g +4,\n\nThus,\n\nC[(g^2 +4g +4) -2g^2 + (g^2 -4g +4)] =\n\nC[ (g^2 +4g +4 -2g^2 +g^2 -4g +4) ] =\n\nC[ ( (g^2 -2g^2 +g^2) + (4g -4g) + (4+4) ) ] =\n\nC[0 +0 +8] =8C\n\nSet equal to -4:\n\n8C = -4 \u21d2 C = -0.5\n\nThus, the particular solution is E_p(g) = -0.5 g\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nE(g) = A + Bg -0.5 g\u00b2.\n\nNow apply the recurrence relation for g \u22652:\n\nBut we also need to use the boundary conditions to find constants A and B.\n\nHowever, we also have the recurrence relations from earlier equations (Equations 1,2,3 etc.), so we need to determine A and B such that the boundary conditions and the recurrence are satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the recurrence for the general solution.\n\nBut let me also consider the equations we have:\n\nFirst, for g=1:\n\n2E(1) - E(3) =4.\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nE(1) = A + B(1) -0.5(1)^2 = A + B -0.5\n\nE(3) = A + B(3) -0.5(9) = A +3B -4.5\n\nPlugging into equation for g=1:\n\n2*(A + B -0.5) - (A +3B -4.5) =4\n\nExpand:\n\n2A +2B -1 -A -3B +4.5 =4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2A -A) + (2B -3B) + (-1 +4.5) =4\n\nA - B + 3.5 =4\n\nThus,\n\nA - B = 0.5 --> Equation (A)\n\nFor g=2:\n\n2E(2) - E(4) =4\n\nCompute E(2) and E(4):\n\nE(2) =A +2B -0.5*(4) =A+2B -2\n\nE(4)= A +4B -0.5*(16)=A+4B -8\n\nPlug into equation:\n\n2*(A +2B -2) - (A +4B -8) =4\n\nExpand:\n\n2A +4B -4 -A -4B +8 =4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2A -A) + (4B -4B) + (-4 +8)=4\n\nA +4 =4 \u21d2 A=0\n\nFrom Equation (A):\n\n0 - B =0.5 \u21d2 B= -0.5\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nE(g) = 0 + (-0.5)g -0.5 g\u00b2 = -0.5g -0.5g\u00b2 = -0.5g(g +1)\n\nWait, but this gives E(g) = -0.5g(g+1). However, this can\u2019t be correct because E(g) should be positive, but this formula gives negative values. Clearly, a mistake was made.\n\nWait, let me check the particular solution again. The particular solution was E_p(g) = -0.5g\u00b2, but when we combined with homogeneous solution A + Bg, the total solution was E(g) = A + Bg -0.5g\u00b2.\n\nHowever, when we solved for A and B using the equations from g=1 and g=2, we obtained A =0 and B = -0.5, leading to E(g) = -0.5g -0.5g\u00b2, which is negative for all g>0. This can\u2019t be correct, since expected time should be positive.\n\nHmm, clearly an error in the process. Let me backtrack.\n\nThe particular solution was found by assuming E_p(g) = Cg\u00b2, and then we found C = -0.5. But the homogeneous solution includes terms A + Bg. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let's check the nonhomogeneous equation again:\n\nThe recurrence for the nonhomogeneous part was:\n\nE(g+2) -2E(g) + E(g-2) = -4\n\nWait, but in the previous steps, when we derived the recurrence from the equation for general g \u22652,\n\nWe had:\n\n2E(g) - E(g+2) =4 + E(g-2)\n\nRearranged:\n\nE(g+2) = 2E(g) - E(g-2) -4\n\nThen, moving everything to left-hand side:\n\nE(g+2) -2E(g) + E(g-2) = -4\n\nAh, so the nonhomogeneous term is -4, so the equation is:\n\nE(g+2) -2E(g) + E(g-2) = -4\n\nTherefore, when we plugged in E_p(g)=Cg\u00b2,\n\nWe had:\n\nC[(g+2)^2 -2g^2 + (g-2)^2] = -4\n\nWhich simplified to 8C = -4 \u21d2 C = -0.5. That is correct.\n\nThus, the particular solution is E_p(g) = -0.5g\u00b2.\n\nThen the general solution is E(g) = A + Bg -0.5g\u00b2.\n\nNow, when we applied the boundary conditions, we got A=0 and B= -0.5, leading to E(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 -0.5g, which is negative. This suggests inconsistency.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that the recurrence relation derived from the equations is different.\n\nLet me re-examine the equations for g=1 and g=2.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nEquation (1):\n\n2E(1) - E(3) =4\n\nFor g=2:\n\nEquation (2):\n\n2E(2) - E(4) =4\n\nBut according to the general solution, with A=0 and B=-0.5,\n\nE(1)= -0.5(1) -0.5(1)^2 = -0.5 -0.5 = -1\n\nE(3)= -0.5(3) -0.5(9)= -1.5 -4.5 = -6\n\nThen plugging into Equation (1):\n\n2*(-1) - (-6) = -2 +6 =4, which satisfies the equation.\n\nSimilarly for g=2,\n\nE(2)= -0.5*2 -0.5*4= -1 -2= -3\n\nE(4)= -0.5*4 -0.5*16= -2 -8= -10\n\nThen 2*(-3) - (-10)= -6 +10=4, which also holds.\n\nThus, the equations are satisfied, but the solution is negative. Which is impossible because expected time can\u2019t be negative.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the general solution includes terms that need to be adjusted.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the homogeneous solution was incorrectly assumed. The homogeneous equation was:\n\nE(g+2) -2E(g) + E(g-2)=0\n\nWe assumed a solution E_h(g) = r^g, leading to the characteristic equation r^4 -2r\u00b2 +1=0, which had a double root at r=1, so the homogeneous solution is E_h(g)= (A + Bg)1^g = A + Bg.\n\nBut perhaps there's another homogeneous solution?\n\nWait, the characteristic equation has a double root at r=1, so the homogeneous solution is indeed A + Bg. So that's correct.\n\nThe problem arises because the particular solution and homogeneous solution combine to give a negative function, which must mean that our initial assumption for the particular solution is missing something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, so perhaps need a constant particular solution?\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Maybe the particular solution should be linear?\n\nSuppose we try E_p(g) = Cg + D.\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\nE_p(g+2) -2E_p(g) + E_p(g-2) = -4\n\nCompute:\n\nC(g+2)+D -2(Cg +D) + C(g-2) + D = ?\n\nWait, expanding:\n\nC(g+2) + D - 2Cg -2D + C(g-2) + D\n\n= Cg + 2C + D -2Cg -2D + Cg -2C + D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(Cg -2Cg + Cg) + (2C -2C) + (D -2D + D)\n\nAll terms cancel out, resulting in 0 = -4, which is impossible. So linear particular solution won't work.\n\nHence, quadratic particular solution is needed, but it leads to negative expected value. This suggests that perhaps the general solution should have another term?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution is not just A + Bg, but also includes another term because of the double root?\n\nWait, the characteristic equation had a double root at r=1, so the homogeneous solution is indeed A + Bg. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, this is perplexing. The solution to the recurrence meets the equations but gives negative expected time, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nLet me re-examine the setup of the recurrence equations.\n\nThe key step was the recurrence for E(g):\n\nE(g) = 1 + (1/4)E(g-2) + (1/2)E(g) + (1/4)E(g+2)\n\nRearranged:\n\nE(g) - (1/2)E(g) =1 + (1/4)E(g-2) + (1/4)E(g+2)\n\n(1/2)E(g) =1 + (1/4)[E(g-2) + E(g+2)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n2E(g) =4 + E(g-2) + E(g+2)\n\nThen,\n\nE(g+2) =2E(g) - E(g-2) -4\n\nThis is correct.\n\nThen, for g=1:\n\nE(3) =2E(1) - E(-1) -4\n\nWait a second! Wait, in the equation for g=1,\n\nThe equation is:\n\nE(g+2) =2E(g) - E(g-2) -4\n\nSo for g=1,\n\nE(3) = 2E(1) - E(-1) -4\n\nBut E(-1) is undefined, since the gap can't be negative. Earlier, I assumed that when at gap=1, the transition to g=-1 is instead an absorption, which would imply that the term E(-1) is replaced by 0. However, in the recurrence, we need to adjust for that boundary condition.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The recurrence I set up for E(g) assumes that for any g \u22651, the next steps are as per the possibilities. However, when g=1, the term E(g-2) corresponds to g-2 = -1, which is invalid. Therefore, the recurrence for g=1 must be treated separately.\n\nTherefore, my earlier approach to set up the equations for g=1 and g=2 was correct, but when trying to generalize the recurrence for all g\u22652, the homogeneous solution ended up being problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the general solution for the recurrence. Let me try to compute E(g) manually for small g and see a pattern.\n\nLet me compute E(0)=0.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nE(1) =1 + (1/4)(0) + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3)\n\nSo,\n\nE(1) =1 + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(1) =4 + 2E(1) + E(3)\n\n=> 2E(1) - E(3) =4 --> Equation (1)\n\nFor g=2:\n\nE(2)=1 + (1/4)E(0) + (1/2)E(2) + (1/4)E(4)\n\n=> E(2)=1 +0 + (1/2)E(2) + (1/4)E(4)\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(2)=4 + 2E(2) + E(4)\n\n=>2E(2) - E(4)=4 --> Equation (2)\n\nFor g=3:\n\nE(3)=1 + (1/4)E(1) + (1/2)E(3) + (1/4)E(5)\n\nMultiply by4:\n\n4E(3)=4 + E(1)+2E(3) +E(5)\n\n=> 2E(3) - E(5)=4 +E(1) --> Equation (3)\n\nFor g=4:\n\nE(4)=1 + (1/4)E(2)+ (1/2)E(4)+ (1/4)E(6)\n\nMultiply by4:\n\n4E(4)=4 +E(2)+2E(4)+E(6)\n\n=>2E(4)-E(6)=4 +E(2) --> Equation (4)\n\nContinuing this, we can see that each equation relates E(g) to E(g+2). This forms an infinite system of equations. To solve this, we can express each E(g+2) in terms of E(g) and E(g-2).\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\nE(3) = 2E(1) -4\n\nFrom Equation (2):\n\nE(4) = 2E(2) -4\n\nFrom Equation (3):\n\nE(5) = 2E(3) -4 -E(1)\n\nSubstitute E(3) from Equation (1):\n\nE(5)=2*(2E(1)-4) -4 -E(1)=4E(1)-8 -4 -E(1)=3E(1)-12\n\nSimilarly, Equation (4):\n\nE(6)=2E(4)-4 -E(2)=2*(2E(2)-4) -4 -E(2)=4E(2)-8 -4 -E(2)=3E(2)-12\n\nThis pattern suggests that for each even g, E(g) depends on E(g-2), and similarly for odd.\n\nHowever, this seems to lead to an infinite chain unless a boundary condition is found at infinity.\n\nAssuming that as g approaches infinity, the expected time E(g) also approaches infinity, but we need a solution that fits for all g. The general solution we found earlier gives a quadratic function, but it's negative. However, if we consider the general solution E(g) = A + Bg -0.5g\u00b2, perhaps we can find constants A and B such that the boundary conditions at g=1 and g=2 are satisfied, even if the solution is negative, but this doesn't make sense physically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct solution is the absolute value of that, but that\u2019s not rigorous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution should be modified. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we consider the homogeneous equation E(g+2) -2E(g) + E(g-2)=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r^4 -2r\u00b2 +1=0 \u21d2 (r\u00b2 -1)^2=0 \u21d2 r\u00b2=1 \u21d2 r=\u00b11.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is E_h(g)=A(1)^g + B(-1)^g + C g (1)^g + D g (-1)^g ?\n\nWait, no, since it's a double root at r=1 and r=-1?\n\nWait, the equation is (r\u00b2 -1)^2 =0, so roots r=1 (multiplicity 2) and r=-1 (multiplicity 2). Thus, the homogeneous solution would be:\n\nE_h(g) = (A + Bg)(1)^g + (C + Dg)(-1)^g.\n\nAh! I missed the double roots for r=-1. That\u2019s where the mistake was. The characteristic equation has roots at r=1 and r=-1, each with multiplicity 2. Therefore, the homogeneous solution includes terms like (A + Bg)(1)^g and (C + Dg)(-1)^g.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\nE_h(g) = (A + Bg) + (C + Dg)(-1)^g.\n\nAdding the particular solution E_p(g) = -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nE(g) = (A + Bg) + (C + Dg)(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2.\n\nNow we can use this general solution and apply boundary conditions to find constants A,B,C,D.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, apply boundary condition E(0)=0:\n\nE(0)= (A +0) + (C +0)(-1)^0 -0 = A + C =0 \u21d2 A = -C.\n\nEquation (A): A + C =0.\n\nNow, apply the equation for g=1:\n\nFrom the earlier recurrence for g=1,\n\nE(3) = 2E(1) -4.\n\nBut let's also express E(1) and E(3) using the general solution.\n\nFirst, compute E(1):\n\nE(1)= (A + B*1) + (C +D*1)(-1)^1 -0.5*(1)^2\n\n= (A+B) + (-C -D) -0.5\n\nSimilarly, E(3):\n\nE(3)= (A +3B) + (C +3D)(-1)^3 -0.5*(3)^2\n\n= (A+3B) + (-C -3D) -4.5\n\nFrom the recurrence, E(3)=2E(1) -4.\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\n\n(A+3B) -C -3D -4.5 = 2[ (A+B) -C -D -0.5 ] -4\n\nExpand the RHS:\n\n2(A+B -C -D -0.5) -4 = 2A +2B -2C -2D -1 -4 = 2A+2B-2C-2D -5\n\nLHS: (A+3B -C -3D) -4.5\n\nThus,\n\nA +3B -C -3D -4.5 =2A +2B -2C -2D -5\n\nBring all terms to LHS:\n\nA +3B -C -3D -4.5 -2A -2B +2C +2D +5=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-A) + B + C - D +0.5=0\n\nEquation (B): -A + B + C - D +0.5=0\n\nNow, use the boundary condition A = -C,\n\nReplace A with -C:\n\n-(-C) + B + C - D +0.5 =0 \u21d2 2C +B -D +0.5=0 --> Equation (B1)\n\nSimilarly, let's use g=2.\n\nFrom the recurrence for g=2,\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4.\n\nCompute E(2):\n\nE(2)= (A +2B) + (C +2D)(-1)^2 -0.5*(2)^2\n\n= (A+2B) + (C+2D) - 2\n\nSimilarly, E(4):\n\nE(4)= (A+4B) + (C+4D)(-1)^4 -0.5*(4)^2\n\n= (A+4B) + (C+4D) -8\n\nAccording to recurrence:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4,\n\nThus:\n\n(A+4B +C+4D -8) =2*(A+2B +C+2D -2) -4\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n2A +4B +2C +4D -4 -4 =2A+4B+2C+4D -8\n\nSet equal to LHS:\n\nA+4B +C+4D -8 =2A+4B+2C+4D -8\n\nSubtract LHS from both sides:\n\n0 = A + C\n\nWhich gives A + C =0. Which is consistent with our first boundary condition.\n\nSo no new information.\n\nLet\u2019s consider another equation. Let\u2019s compute E(1) and E(2) expressions.\n\nWe might need another equation. Let's use the expression for E(1) and E(3):\n\nAlternatively, let's try to compute E(1) and see if we can find more conditions.\n\nBut perhaps we can assume symmetry or other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that the solution must be symmetric in some way, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s pick a specific value for one of the constants. For instance, let\u2019s assume D=0 for simplicity, and see if the equations can be satisfied.\n\nAssume D=0,\n\nThen from Equation (B1):\n\n2C + B -0 +0.5=0 \u21d22C + B =-0.5.\n\nAlso, A = -C.\n\nNow, let's compute E(1):\n\nE(1) = (A+B) + (-C -D) -0.5 = (A+B) - (C +0) -0.5\n\nBut A =-C,\n\nThus,\n\n(-C + B) - C -0.5 = -2C + B -0.5\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (B1):\n\n2C + B = -0.5 \u21d2 B = -0.5 -2C\n\nSubstitute into E(1):\n\n-2C + (-0.5 -2C) -0.5 = -4C -1\n\nSimilarly, let's compute E(2):\n\nE(2)= (A+2B) + (C+2D) -2 = (-C +2B) + (C +0) -2 =2B -2\n\nWith B =-0.5 -2C,\n\nE(2)=2*(-0.5 -2C) -2 = -1 -4C -2 = -3 -4C\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation.\n\nConsider the recurrence for g=3:\n\nE(5) = 2E(3) -4 - E(1)\n\nWait, according to Equation (3):\n\n2E(3) - E(5) =4 + E(1)\n\n=> E(5) =2E(3) -4 -E(1)\n\nBut let's also compute E(5) using the general solution.\n\nE(5)= (A+5B) + (C+5D)(-1)^5 -0.5*(5)^2\n\nWith D=0,\n\n= (A+5B) + (-C -0) -12.5\n\n= (A+5B -C) -12.5\n\nSince A =-C,\n\n= (-C +5B -C) -12.5 = (5B -2C) -12.5\n\nSubstituting B =-0.5 -2C,\n\n=5*(-0.5 -2C) -2C -12.5\n\n= -2.5 -10C -2C -12.5 = -15 -12C\n\nNow, from the recurrence:\n\nE(5)=2E(3) -4 -E(1)\n\nCompute E(3):\n\nE(3)= (A+3B) + (-C -3D) -4.5 = (-C +3B) -C -4.5 = (3B -2C) -4.5\n\nWith B =-0.5 -2C,\n\n=3*(-0.5 -2C) -2C -4.5\n\n= -1.5 -6C -2C -4.5 = -6 -8C\n\nThus,\n\nE(5)=2*(-6 -8C) -4 - (-4C -1)\n\n= -12 -16C -4 +4C +1 = -15 -12C\n\nWhich matches the direct computation. So the equation holds.\n\nNow, we need another condition. Perhaps we can look at another equation involving E(2) and E(4).\n\nFrom the recurrence for g=2,\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4,\n\nCompute E(4):\n\nE(4)= (A+4B) + (C+4D)(-1)^4 -0.5*(4)^2\n\nWith D=0,\n\n= (A+4B) + (C +0) -8\n\n= (A +4B +C) -8\n\nSince A =-C,\n\n= (-C +4B +C) -8 =4B -8\n\nWith B =-0.5 -2C,\n\n=4*(-0.5 -2C) -8 = -2 -8C -8 = -10 -8C\n\nFrom recurrence:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4 =2*(-3 -4C) -4 =-6 -8C -4 =-10 -8C, which matches.\n\nThus, all equations are consistent with D=0.\n\nWe still need another condition to solve for C.\n\nPerhaps we can assume that as g approaches infinity, the expected time E(g) behaves in a particular way. For a symmetric random walk on the gaps, the expected time to reach 0 starting from g should grow quadratically, so our particular solution has a -0.5g\u00b2 term, which is correct in sign if we include the homogeneous terms to offset it.\n\nHowever, since we have the homogeneous terms, we can choose constants such that the total E(g) is positive.\n\nLet me choose a value for C and compute the constants.\n\nWe have:\n\nB =-0.5 -2C,\n\nA =-C,\n\nAnd the general solution:\n\nE(g) = (A +Bg) + (C +Dg)(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nWith D=0,\n\nE(g)= (-C + Bg) + C(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nSubstitute B =-0.5 -2C,\n\nE(g)= (-C + (-0.5 -2C)g ) + C(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nSimplify:\n\nE(g) = -C + (-0.5g -2Cg) + C(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\n= -C -0.5g -2Cg + C(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\n= C[ -1 -2g + (-1)^g ] -0.5g -0.5g\u00b2\n\nTo ensure that E(g) is positive for all g \u22651, we need to choose C such that the terms involving C dominate appropriately.\n\nSuppose we choose C=0. This would simplify things:\n\nIf C=0,\n\nThen B =-0.5 -0 =-0.5,\n\nA =0,\n\nE(g)= (-0.5 g) +0*(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2 = -0.5g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nWhich is negative, which is bad.\n\nThus, need C \u22600.\n\nLet me choose C such that the term C[ -1 -2g + (-1)^g ] compensates the negative terms.\n\nLet me suppose that for g=1,\n\nE(1)= -C -0.5(1) -2C(1) + C(-1)^1 -0.5(1)^2,\n\nWait, let me recompute E(g) when C is not zero.\n\nWait, the expression was:\n\nE(g) = -C -0.5g -2Cg + C(-1)^g -0.5g\u00b2,\n\nSo for g=1:\n\nE(1)= -C -0.5(1) -2C(1) + C(-1)^1 -0.5(1)^2,\n\n= -C -0.5 -2C -C -0.5,\n\n= (-C -2C -C) + (-0.5 -0.5),\n\n= (-4C) -1.\n\nBut from the recurrence, we have:\n\nE(1)= -4C -1.\n\nBut we also have from the recurrence Equation (1):\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4,\n\nAnd we can compute E(3) in terms of C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need another condition. Since the equation system has infinitely many solutions, but we need to pick the one where E(g) is finite and positive for all g.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that as g becomes large, the solution E(g) behaves appropriately. The particular solution is -0.5g\u00b2, which is negative, but the homogeneous solution has terms like C*(-1)^g and terms with g.\n\nTo counteract the -0.5g\u00b2, perhaps the homogeneous solution must include a positive quadratic term. However, the homogeneous solution we have is:\n\n(A + Bg) + (C + Dg)(-1)^g,\n\nWhich doesn't have a quadratic term. Thus, perhaps the particular solution needs to be adjusted?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption of the particular solution was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the homogeneous solution includes terms like g\u00b2, but due to the double roots?\n\nWait, the homogeneous solution is built from the roots of the characteristic equation. Since we have a double root at r=1 and r=-1, the homogeneous solution can include terms like g^2*(something), but I might have made a mistake in the characteristic equation analysis.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to assume that the solution has the form E(g)=ag\u00b2 + bg +c + d*(-1)^g.\n\nThen plug into the recurrence equation.\n\nE(g+2) -2E(g) +E(g-2)= -4\n\nCompute each term:\n\nE(g+2)=a(g+2)^2 +b(g+2)+c +d*(-1)^{g+2}\n\n= a(g\u00b2+4g+4) +b(g+2) +c +d*(-1)^g*(-1)^2\n\n= a g\u00b2 +4a g +4a +b g +2b +c +d*(-1)^g\n\nE(g) =a g\u00b2 +b g +c +d*(-1)^g\n\nE(g-2)=a(g-2)^2 +b(g-2)+c +d*(-1)^{g-2}\n\n= a(g\u00b2-4g+4)+b(g-2)+c +d*(-1)^g*(-1)^{-2}\n\n= a g\u00b2 -4a g +4a +b g -2b +c +d*(-1)^g\n\nNow plug into the LHS:\n\n[E(g+2) -2E(g) +E(g-2)] =\n\n[ ag\u00b2+4ag+4a +bg+2b +c +d(-1)^g ]\n\n-2[ag\u00b2 +bg +c +d(-1)^g ]\n\n+ [ag\u00b2 -4ag +4a +bg -2b +c +d(-1)^g ]\n\nExpand term by term:\n\nFirst term:\n\nag\u00b2 +4ag +4a +bg +2b +c +d(-1)^g\n\nSecond term (after multiplying by -2):\n\n-2ag\u00b2 -2bg -2c -2d(-1)^g\n\nThird term:\n\nag\u00b2 -4ag +4a +bg -2b +c +d(-1)^g\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\nag\u00b2 +4ag +4a +bg +2b +c +d(-1)^g\n\n-2ag\u00b2 -2bg -2c -2d(-1)^g\n\n+ag\u00b2 -4ag +4a +bg -2b +c +d(-1)^g\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor g\u00b2 terms:\n\nag\u00b2 -2ag\u00b2 +ag\u00b2 =0\n\nFor g terms:\n\n4ag + bg -2bg + (-4ag) + bg\n\n= (4ag -4ag) + (bg -2bg + bg) =0 +0=0\n\nFor constants:\n\n4a +2b +c -2c +4a -2b +c\n\n= (4a+4a) + (2b-2b) + (c-2c+c)\n\n=8a +0 +0=8a\n\nFor terms with (-1)^g:\n\nd(-1)^g -2d(-1)^g +d(-1)^g = (1 -2 +1)d(-1)^g=0\n\nThus, the entire expression simplifies to 8a = -4 \u21d2 a= -0.5.\n\nSo the particular solution is E_p(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + rest terms. Wait, so the general solution is:\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + bg +c +d*(-1)^g,\n\nwhere b, c, d are constants determined by boundary conditions.\n\nNow apply boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, E(0)=0:\n\nE(0)= -0 +0 +c +d*(-1)^0= c +d=0 \u21d2 c =-d.\n\nSecond, we need more equations. Let's use the recurrence for g=1 and g=2.\n\nFor g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5(1)^2 +b*1 +c +d*(-1)^1 = -0.5 +b +c -d.\n\nBut c =-d, so substitute:\n\n-0.5 +b -d -d = -0.5 +b -2d.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nE(3) =2E(1) -4.\n\nCompute E(3):\n\nE(3)= -0.5*(9) +b*3 +c +d*(-1)^3\n\n= -4.5 +3b +c -d.\n\nAgain, c =-d,\n\n-4.5 +3b -d -d = -4.5 +3b -2d.\n\nFrom recurrence:\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4 =2*(-0.5 +b -2d) -4 = -1 +2b -4d -4 =2b -4d -5.\n\nThus,\n\n-4.5 +3b -2d = 2b -4d -5\n\nRearrange:\n\n-4.5 +3b -2d -2b +4d +5=0 \u21d2 (b) + (2d) +0.5=0 \u21d2 b +2d =-0.5 --> Equation (B)\n\nFor g=2:\n\nE(2)= -0.5*(4)+b*2 +c +d*(-1)^2\n\n= -2 +2b +c +d.\n\nWith c =-d,\n\n-2 +2b -d +d = -2 +2b.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4.\n\nCompute E(4):\n\nE(4)= -0.5*(16) +b*4 +c +d*(-1)^4\n\n= -8 +4b +c +d.\n\nWith c=-d,\n\n-8 +4b -d +d = -8 +4b.\n\nFrom recurrence:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4 =2*(-2 +2b) -4 =-4 +4b -4 =4b -8.\n\nThus, the equation holds.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. c = -d,\n\n2. b +2d =-0.5.\n\nWe need another equation. Let's use g=1's expression.\n\nLet me choose another equation from g=1's expression.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the general expression for E(g) and assume that the solution should be bounded or have certain asymptotic behavior.\n\nAs g becomes large, the term -0.5g\u00b2 dominates, but we need E(g) to be positive for all g. Hence, the other terms must counteract this.\n\nHowever, if we set b and d such that the linear terms can balance the quadratic term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution must have b and d chosen such that the homogeneous terms (bg + c + d*(-1)^g) counterbalance the -0.5g\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to set the coefficients so that the solution is positive for all g.\n\nLet me suppose d is chosen such that the term involving (-1)^g is zero, but that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick d arbitrarily and see.\n\nLet me choose d =k,\n\nThen c =-k,\n\nFrom Equation (B):\n\nb = -0.5 -2k.\n\nThus, the solution becomes:\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + (-0.5 -2k)g -k +k*(-1)^g.\n\nWe can choose k to make the solution positive for all g.\n\nFor instance, let's choose k such that for g=1:\n\nE(1) =-0.5(1)^2 + (-0.5 -2k)(1) -k +k*(-1)^1\n\n= -0.5 -0.5 -2k -k -k*(-1)\n\nWait,\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nE(1)= -0.5*1 + (-0.5 -2k)*1 + (-k) +k*(-1)^1\n\n= -0.5 + (-0.5 -2k) -k + (-k)\n\n= -0.5 -0.5 -2k -k -k\n\n= -1 -4k\n\nSimilarly, for g=1 to be positive,\n\n-1 -4k >0 \u21d2 -4k >1 \u21d2 k < -0.25.\n\nChoose k = -0.5,\n\nThen,\n\nk =-0.5,\n\nThus,\n\nc = -k =0.5,\n\nb= -0.5 -2*(-0.5)= -0.5 +1=0.5,\n\nSo,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +0.5g +0.5 + (-0.5)(-1)^g.\n\nCheck for g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5 +0.5 +0.5 + (-0.5)(-1)= (-0.5+0.5+0.5) +0.5= 0.5 +0.5=1.0>0.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nE(2)= -0.5*(4)+0.5*2 +0.5 + (-0.5)(1)= -2 +1 +0.5 -0.5= -1.\n\nNegative, which is bad.\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nTry k =-0.25,\n\nThen,\n\nk=-0.25,\n\nc=0.25,\n\nb= -0.5-2*(-0.25)= -0.5+0.5=0,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +0*g +0.25 + (-0.25)(-1)^g,\n\nCheck g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5 +0 +0.25 + (-0.25)(-1)= -0.5+0.25+0.25=0.\n\nHmm, zero at g=1, but we need positive.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nE(2)= -0.5*4 +0 +0.25 + (-0.25)(1)= -2 +0.25 -0.25= -2 <0.\n\nStill bad.\n\nTry k =0,\n\nThen,\n\nk=0,\n\nc=0,\n\nb= -0.5,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 -0.5g +0 +0*(-1)^g,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 -0.5g,\n\nWhich is negative.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry k = 0.5,\n\nThen,\n\nk=0.5,\n\nc=-0.5,\n\nb= -0.5-2*(0.5)= -0.5-1= -1.5,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 -1.5g -0.5 +0.5*(-1)^g,\n\nTest g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5 -1.5 -0.5 +0.5*(-1)= (-2.5) + (-0.5)= -3 <0.\n\nNo good.\n\nThis approach may not be working.\n\nPerhaps the only way to satisfy the boundary conditions is to allow the solution to have negative values for small g but positive for larger g? But this contradicts the physical meaning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct solution is the quadratic function obtained earlier, and the negative values are an artifact of the mathematical model, and we should take the absolute value or interpret differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original assumption that the gap can decrease to 0 from any g is incorrect.\n\nWait, the problem says the snakes start on a circle of 45 arcs with 15 snakes each occupying one arc, every third arc. So the initial configuration is 15 snakes with gaps of 2 between them. When two snakes merge, they form a snake of length 2, occupying two arcs, and the adjacent gaps are merged into a single gap. Therefore, the process is not just about a single gap, but the system evolves as merges occur, which complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the mistake was in modeling a single gap independently, but in reality, once a merge occurs, the number of gaps decreases, and the remaining gaps are affected.\n\nTherefore, maybe the initial approach of modeling a single gap is too simplistic, and the problem requires a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSince all snakes are initially equally spaced, the system is symmetric. Therefore, the expected time until all merge should be the same as the expected time for any one pair to merge, multiplied by the number of snakes minus one? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that every time a pair merges, it reduces the number of snakes by one, and the expected time between each merge is the same due to symmetry, then the total expected time would be the sum over each merge step of the expected time between merges.\n\nSuppose that when there are n snakes, the expected time until the next merge is T(n). Then the total expected time is the sum from n=15 down to n=2 of T(n).\n\nTo compute T(n), when there are n snakes, each pair of adjacent snakes has a certain probability of merging in the next step.\n\nBut with n snakes, there are n gaps between them (since it's a circle). Each gap has a certain expected time until merging.\n\nHowever, these gaps are not independent, so it's complex.\n\nAlternatively, in the symmetric case, all gaps are the same size. Initially, all gaps are size 2. After a merge, the merged gap would be larger, but due to symmetry, perhaps all gaps remain the same?\n\nWait, if two adjacent gaps are of size g1 and g2, and the two adjacent snakes merge, then the resulting gap between the merged snake and the next snake would be g1 + g2 +1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the entire system as a collection of snakes with gaps between them. Initially, 15 gaps of size 2. Each gap can perform a random walk towards merging (gap=0) or growing.\n\nThe first merge occurs when any of the gaps reaches 0. Once a gap reaches 0, it merges, reducing the number of gaps by 1 and merging the two adjacent snakes into one. The new gap between the resulting snake and its neighbor would be the sum of the adjacent gaps plus something?\n\nActually, when two snakes at positions a and b (distance g+1 apart) merge, their new position spans from a to b. The next gap is between this new snake and the next snake, which was originally at distance from b of g2 +1 (distance between b and next snake). So the new gap size would be g2.\n\nWait, perhaps the merged snake occupies all the arcs between a and b, so the gap between the merged snake and the next snake is the original gap after b.\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe the key idea is that with symmetric initial conditions, the expected time can be computed as the expected time for a single gap to reach zero, multiplied by the number of gaps, but adjusted for overlap.\n\nAlternatively, since all gaps are identical and symmetric, the expected time until any gap reaches zero is the same as the expected time for one gap to reach zero divided by the number of gaps (due to linearity of expectation for competing risks).\n\nIn other words, if there are m independent processes each with expected time T until an event happens, then the expected time until any one of them happens is T/m.\n\nIn our case, initially there are 15 gaps, each with expected time E to reach zero. Then the expected time until the first merge is E/15.\n\nAfter the first merge, there are 14 gaps left. So the next expected time would be E/14, etc. Thus, the total expected time would be the sum from k=15 down to 2 of E/k.\n\nHowever, this is only valid if the gaps are independent, which they are not. Because the movement of one snake affects two adjacent gaps. Thus, their evolutions are dependent.\n\nHowever, in symmetric conditions, maybe the dependencies average out, and the total expectation is approximately the sum of E/k from k=15 down to 2.\n\nIf that were the case, then we just need to compute E, the expected time for a single gap to reach 0, starting from 2.\n\nAssuming that the expected time E(2) is 12, then the total would be 12*(H_{15} -1), where H_{15} is the 15th harmonic number.\n\nBut I need to compute E(2).\n\nWait, returning to the earlier recurrence with the homogeneous solution involving (-1)^g terms.\n\nSuppose we proceed with the solution E(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg + C + D(-1)^g.\n\nWith boundary conditions:\n\nE(0)=0 \u21d2 C + D=0 \u21d2 C = -D.\n\nLet\u2019s set D=1, then C=-1.\n\nNow, we need to determine B such that the solution behaves appropriately.\n\nFrom the recurrence for g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5(1) + B(1) -1 +1(-1)^1 = -0.5 + B -1 -1 = B -2.5\n\nFrom the equation for g=1:\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4.\n\nCompute E(3):\n\nE(3)= -0.5(9) + B(3) -1 +1(-1)^3 = -4.5 +3B -1 -1 =3B -6.5\n\nAccording to recurrence:\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4 =2(B-2.5) -4 =2B -5 -4=2B -9.\n\nThus,\n\n3B -6.5 =2B -9 \u21d2 B= -2.5.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 -2.5g -1 +1*(-1)^g.\n\nCheck for g=1:\n\nE(1)= -0.5 -2.5 -1 +(-1)= (-4) + (-1)= -5?

Thus, the particular solution is indeed quadratic as before, and the homogeneous solution is needed.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg +C + D(-1)^g.\n\nWith boundary conditions:\n\nE(0)=0 \u21d2 C + D=0 \u21d2 C =-D.\n\nThus,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg -D + D(-1)^g,\n\n= -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg + D(-1)^g -D,\n\nNow, to find B and D, we need more conditions.\n\nUsing the equation from g=1:\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4.\n\nFirst, compute E(1):\n\nE(1)= -0.5(1)^2 + B(1) + D(-1)^1 -D,\n\n= -0.5 + B -D -D,\n\n= -0.5 + B -2D.\n\nE(3)= -0.5(3)^2 + B(3) + D(-1)^3 -D,\n\n= -4.5 +3B -D -D,\n\n= -4.5 +3B -2D.\n\nThe equation:\n\nE(3)=2E(1) -4,\n\nThus,\n\n-4.5 +3B -2D =2*(-0.5 + B -2D) -4,\n\nExpand right side:\n\n-1 +2B -4D -4,\n\n=2B -4D -5,\n\nThus,\n\n-4.5 +3B -2D =2B -4D -5,\n\nRearranged:\n\n-4.5 - (-5) +3B -2D -2B +4D =0,\n\n0.5 +B +2D=0 \u21d2 B +2D= -0.5,\n\nEquation (1).\n\nWe need another equation. Let's use g=2:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4.\n\nCompute E(2):\n\nE(2)= -0.5*(4)+B*2 +D*(-1)^2 -D,\n\n= -2 +2B +D -D,\n\n= -2 +2B.\n\nE(4)= -0.5*(16)+B*4 +D*(-1)^4 -D,\n\n= -8 +4B +D -D,\n\n= -8 +4B.\n\nAccording to recurrence:\n\nE(4)=2E(2) -4=2*(-2+2B) -4= -4+4B -4=4B -8,\n\nWhich matches, so no new info.\n\nThus, we have one equation B+2D =-0.5.\n\nWe can choose D freely, but to ensure E(g) is positive for all g.\n\nLet me choose D such that when g approaches infinity, the solution E(g) becomes positive.\n\nThe dominant term as g\u2192\u221e is -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg + D(-1)^g.\n\nTo counteract the -0.5g\u00b2 term, we need Bg + ... to dominate positively, but since it's linear, it won't. Thus, this suggests that without additional terms, the solution can't be positive for large g.\n\nThis indicates that the model might be incorrect, or perhaps the initial assumption that the gaps can be treated independently is wrong.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is similar to the coupon collector problem where each pair has a chance to merge, but the expected time until all have merged.\n\nAlternatively, since the snakes are on a circle and start evenly spaced, perhaps the expected time until all merge is equal to the expected time for the snakes to all meet at a single point.\n\nIn other words, each snake performs a random walk on the circle, and we want the expected time until all meet.\n\nThis is known as the meeting time of multiple random walkers on a circle.\n\nFor n particles on a circle of N sites, each moving left or right with equal probability, the expected time until all meet is known?\n\nI recall that for two particles on a line, it's D\u00b2, but on a circle of size N, the expected meeting time between two particles starting distance D apart is D*(N - D).\n\nWait, if that's the case, then for two snakes initially separated by D=3 arcs (distance 3), the expected time until they meet is 3*(45 -3)=3*42=126.\n\nHowever, this might be the case for continuous-time or different movement rules.\n\nAssuming that formula holds, then the expected time for two snakes to meet is D*(N-D).\n\nIf so, then for our case, D=3 (distance between adjacent snakes), N=45,\n\nT(3)=3*(45-3)= 3*42=126.\n\nHowever, since there are 15 gaps, each with this expected time, but they are competing, so the time until first merge is 126/15=8.4.\n\nThen, after the first merge, there are 14 gaps, each now with expected time T(D') where D' would be different.\n\nWait, but after a merge, the distance between the new snake and its neighbor would be different.\n\nThis complicates things, as the distances change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total expected time is the sum over all pairs of their meeting times divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a Markov chain where the state is the number of snakes, and we compute the expected time to go from 15 to 1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote E(n) as the expected time to reach 1 snake from n snakes.\n\nWe have E(1)=0.\n\nFor n snakes, there are n gaps between them (on a circle). Each gap has an expected time until merging, but once any gap merges, the number reduces by 1.\n\nAssuming independence (which they are not), the expected time until the first merge is the minimum of n independent exponential variables (if it were continuous time), but in discrete time, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, in discrete time, the probability that a particular gap merges in one step is p = probability that the two endpoints move towards each other.\n\nFor a gap of size g, the probability that it decreases by 2 (i.e., the two snakes move towards each other):\n\nProbability = probability both move towards each other.\n\nEach snake has 1/2 chance to move towards the gap or away.\n\nWait, for a gap of size g between two snakes, each snake has a 1/2 chance to move towards the gap or away.\n\nThe probability that they move towards each other is 1/2 *1/2 =1/4.\n\nThe probability they move away is 1/4.\n\nThe probability they move in the same direction (no change) is 1/2.\n\nThus, the probability that the gap decreases by 2 is 1/4,\n\nSimilarly, increases by 2 is 1/4,\n\nStays same with 1/2.\n\nThus, for a gap of size g, the probability it merges (reduces to g-2) is 1/4 until g=1, where it can merge with probability 1/4 (when it tries to go to -1, which is absorbed).\n\nThus, the expected time for a single gap to merge is similar to the earlier problem.\n\nHowever, with multiple gaps, the first merge happens when any of the gaps merge. The expected time until the first merge is the reciprocal of the total probability per step that any gap merges.\n\nIf all gaps are size 2 initially, then each of the 15 gaps has a 1/4 chance per step to decrease by 2 (to 0), thus merging.\n\nThus, the probability that any gap merges in a step is 15*(1/4) - corrections for overlaps (since multiple merges can't happen in the same step).\n\nIgnoring overlaps (approximate), the expected time until first merge is 1/(15/4)=4/15 per step? No, expected time is reciprocal.\n\nWait, in discrete time, the expected number of trials until the first success in a Bernoulli process with probability p per trial is 1/p.\n\nSo if the probability that at least one merge happens is p=15*(1/4)*(1 - ...), but since the gaps are not independent, correlations make it complex.\n\nAssuming independence (which they are not), p=15*(1/4)*(1 - 1/2)^{others} ?\n\nThis is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's answer is 45*14=630, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recalling that in the first step, there are 15 gaps, each with probability 1/4 to merge, so the expected time until first merge is 1/(15/4)=4/15 per step, but in expectation, it would take 4/15 steps to have a merge. But since each step is a second, the expected time until first merge is 4/ (15*(1/4)) )? Hmm, confused.\n\nAlternatively, the expected time for a single gap to merge is computed as follows:\n\nFor a gap of size g, let E(g) be the expected time.\n\nWe had earlier equations that led to E(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 + Bg + C + D(-1)^g,\n\nBut with the constants chosen to satisfy boundary conditions, we might need to accept that the solution is E(g)= g*(N - g).\n\nWait, if we posit that for a circle of N=45, the expected time T(D)= D*(N - D),\n\nThen for D=3,\n\nT(3)=3*42=126,\n\nThen for a single gap of size 2 (distance 3), the expected time to merge would be 3*42=126.\n\nAssuming that the first merge occurs after 126/15 steps on average? No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total expected time for all snakes to merge is the sum over each step where each merge reduces the number of gaps by 1, and each time the expected time between merges is the same.\n\nIf each gap independently has expected time T until merging, then with n gaps, the expected time until the first merge is T/n.\n\nThus, the total expected time would be T*(1 +1/2 +1/3 +...+1/14).\n\nIf T=126,\n\nTotal E=126*(H_{14}),\n\nWhere H_{14}=1+1/2+...+1/14\u22483.927,\n\nThus, E\u2248126*3.927\u2248495.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, if T= 3*42=126 is the time for one gap to merge, then with 15 gaps, the first merge happens in 126/15 steps?\n\nBut expectation is linear, so the expected time is the sum over each gap's contribution.\n\nAlternatively, if the expected time until any of the n gaps merge is T/n,\n\nThen total time is \u03a3_{k=15}^2 T/k,\n\nBut T is 3*42=126 for the first step,\n\nBut after a merge, the remaining gaps have different sizes.\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 45 choose 2 or something, but I need a better approach.\n\nWait, another idea: since initially the snakes are equally spaced every 3 arcs, the configuration is symmetric. When they move, due to symmetry, the expected time until all merge is the same as the expected time for two particular snakes to meet, multiplied by the number of snakes minus one.\n\nFor example, pick one snake, the expected time until it merges with all others.\n\nBut merging is transitive, so once two merge, they form a larger snake.\n\nAlternatively, imagine the problem as 15 particles on a 45-node circular graph, each moving clockwise or counterclockwise each step with equal probability. The expected time until all coalesce.\n\nThis is a classic coalescing random walk problem on a cycle.\n\nAccording to some references, the expected coalescence time for n particles on a cycle of N nodes is roughly proportional to N log n.\n\nBut I might need to recall exact results.\n\nIn particular, for the coalescing time (when all particles meet) on a cycle of N nodes with n particles, the expected time is N log n.\n\nWait, for N=45 and n=15, this would be 45 log 15\u224845*2.708\u2248121.86, but this is an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, for continuous-time coalescing random walks, the expected time is N log n, but in discrete time?\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nThe expected time for two particles to meet on a circle of N nodes is N/2.\n\nWait, no, previously thought it might be D*(N-D), but for N=45 and D=3, that gives 126.\n\nAlternatively, the meeting time of two random walkers on a circle is known to be on the order of N\u00b2.\n\nWait, in a line of N sites, two random walkers take O(N\u00b2) time to meet.\n\nOn a circle, it might be similar.\n\nIf the expected time for two snakes to meet is O(N\u00b2), then with 15 snakes, the total time would be O(N\u00b2 log N).\n\nBut I need an exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the first recurrence for a single gap.\n\nThe expected time E(g) for a gap of size g to reach 0 is given by the recurrence:\n\nE(g) =1 + (1/4)E(g-2) + (1/2)E(g) + (1/4)E(g+2)\n\nWith E(0)=0,\n\nAnd for g=1,\n\nE(1)=1 + (1/4)(0) + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nE(1)=1 + (1/2)E(1) + (1/4)E(3).\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n4E(1)=4 + 2E(1) + E(3).\n\nThus,\n\n2E(1) - E(3)=4.\n\nSimilarly for g=2,\n\nE(2)=1 + (1/4)E(0) + (1/2)E(2) + (1/4)E(4),\n\nWhich gives,\n\n2E(2) - E(4)=4.\n\nAssuming the pattern continues,\n\nFor even g=2k,\n\nE(2k)=1 + (1/4)E(2k-2) + (1/2)E(2k) + (1/4)E(2k+2).\n\nRearranged,\n\n2E(2k) - E(2k+2)=4 + E(2k-2).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form E(g)=a*g\u00b2 + b*g,\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\n2*(a*(2k)^2 +b*(2k)) - [a*(2k+2)^2 +b*(2k+2)] =4 +a*(2k-2)^2 +b*(2k-2).\n\nExpand:\n\n2*(4a k\u00b2 +2b k) - [a*(4k\u00b2+8k+4) +b*(2k+2)] =4 +a*(4k\u00b2-8k+4)+b*(2k-2)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n8a k\u00b2 +4b k -4a k\u00b2 -8a k -4a -2b k -2b,\n\n= (8a-4a)k\u00b2 + (4b k -8a k -2b k) + (-4a -2b),\n\n=4a k\u00b2 + (2b -8a)k -4a -2b.\n\nRight side:\n\n4 +4a k\u00b2 -8a k +4a +2b k -2b,\n\n=4a k\u00b2 -8a k +2b k + (4 +4a -2b).\n\nSet coefficients equal:\n\nFor k\u00b2: 4a =4a \u21d2 OK.\n\nFor k:\n\n2b -8a = -8a +2b \u21d2 OK.\n\nConstants:\n\n-4a -2b =4 +4a -2b \u21d2\n\n-4a -2b =4 +4a -2b \u21d2\n\n-8a =4 \u21d2a= -0.5.\n\nThus, the solution is E(g)= -0.5 g\u00b2 +b g.\n\nNow, apply boundary condition E(0)=0 \u21d20=0 +0 \u21d2 OK.\n\nNow, use the equation for g=1 (assuming odd g can be expressed similarly):\n\nBut this solution is for even g. For odd g, need to consider another solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence for even and odd terms can be considered separately.\n\nAssuming that for even g=2k,\n\nE(2k)= -0.5*(2k)^2 +b*(2k)= -2k\u00b2 +2b k.\n\nSimilarly for odd g=2k+1,\n\nAssuming E(g)= -0.5 g\u00b2 +c g +d,\n\nPlug into recurrence,\n\nBut this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, since the general solution for even g is E(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +b g,\n\nUse the equation from g=2:\n\nE(2)= -2*(2)^2 +b*2= -8 +2b,\n\nFrom equation for g=2:\n\n2E(2) - E(4)=4,\n\nE(4)= -0.5*(4)^2 +b*4= -8+4b,\n\nThus,\n\n2*(-8 +2b) - (-8+4b) =4,\n\n-16 +4b +8 -4b =4 \u21d2-8=4 \u21d2 Not possible.\n\nThus, this assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, include a constant term:\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +b g +c.\n\nFor even g:\n\nE(2k)= -0.5*(4k\u00b2) +b*2k +c= -2k\u00b2 +2b k +c.\n\nRecurrence for even g=2k,\n\n2E(2k) - E(2k+2)=4 +E(2k-2),\n\nPlug in,\n\n2*(-2k\u00b2 +2b k +c) - [ -2(k+1)^2 +2b(k+1)+c ] =4 + [ -2(k-1)^2 +2b(k-1)+c ]\n\nExpand:\n\n-4k\u00b2 +4b k +2c - [ -2(k\u00b2+2k+1) +2b k +2b +c ] =\n\n-4k\u00b2 +4b k +2c +2k\u00b2 +4k +2 -2b k -2b -c =\n\n(-2k\u00b2) + (2b k +4k) + (c +2 -2b)\n\nThis equals RHS:\n\n4 + [ -2(k\u00b2-2k+1) +2b k -2b +c ]\n\n=4 -2k\u00b2 +4k -2 +2b k -2b +c\n\n= -2k\u00b2 +4k + (2b k) + (c -2b +2)\n\nSet LHS = RHS,\n\n-2k\u00b2 + (2b+4)k + (c +2 -2b) = -2k\u00b2 + (2b+4)k + (c -2b +2)\n\nWhich holds for all k. Thus, the equation is satisfied for any b and c.\n\nThus, the general solution for even g is E(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +b g +c,\n\nWith constants b and c determined by boundary conditions.\n\nSimilarly for odd g, we can derive a similar solution.\n\nAssume for odd g=2k+1,\n\nE(g)= -0.5g\u00b2 +d g +e.\n\nPlug into recurrence relation for odd g,\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is E(g)= g*(N -g)/something.\n\nWait, if we assume that for a circle of N nodes, the expected meeting time between two particles initially D apart is D*(N-D), then for N=45 and D=3,\n\nE(g)=3*42=126.\n\nThis is plausible and may be the correct answer for a single gap.\n\nIf so, then with 15 gaps, the expected time until the first merge is 126/15=8.4.\n\nThen after merging, there are 14 gaps, each with expected time 126/14=9,\n\nContinuing, the total expected time would be the sum over 15 to 2 of 126/k,\n\nWait, no, each time the number of gaps decreases by 1, but the distance for each new gap may vary.\n\nBut if the gaps remain uniform due to symmetry, then after a merge, the new gap size would be double the original?\n\nNo, when two gaps of size 2 merge, the new gap between the merged snake and its neighbor would be 2+2+1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the system remains symmetric after each merge, then the gap size remains the same for all gaps. But this is only possible if the merge happens in a symmetric way.\n\nGiven the symmetry, perhaps every time a merge occurs, it happens between two adjacent snakes that were equally likely any pair, so the remaining gaps remain the same size.\n\nIf this is the case, then after each merge, the number of gaps reduces by 1, and each gap size remains the same.\n\nThus, the expected time between merges when there are n gaps is T(n)= (initial gap size)*(N - initial gap size*(N/gaps?)),\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if after each merge, the gap size remains the same, then the expected time between each merge is the same as the initial T(gap).\n\nThus, if initially T=126 for 15 gaps, then with 14 gaps, it would also be T=126, so total time 15*T.\n\nBut this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expected time between each merge is 126, and since we need 14 merges, total time is 14*126.\n\nBut 14*126= 1764.\n\nAlternatively, the first merge takes 126/15, the second 126/14, etc., leading to total time 126*(1/15 +1/14+\u2026+1/1).\n\nThis would be 126*(H_{15}),\n\nWhere H_{15}=1+1/2+\u2026+1/15\u22483.318,\n\nThus\u2248126*3.318\u2248418.\n\nBut I need an exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, the problem states that the initial gap is 2 arcs (distance 3), so E(g)=3*(45-3)=126.\n\nTherefore, the expected time for a single gap is 126.\n\nSince there are 15 gaps initially, the first merge occurs after 126/15 steps.\n\nThen, after merging, there are 14 gaps, each of the same distance (due to symmetry), so each has expected time 126/(14) etc.\n\nThus total expected time is 126*(1/15 +1/14 + ... +1/1).\n\nWhich is 126*H_{15}.\n\nH_{15}=1+1/2+1/3+...+1/15.\n\nH_{15}\u22483.318.\n\n126*3.318\u2248418.7.\n\nBut the problem states the answer should be in a box.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 45*14=630.\n\nAlternatively, given the time I've spent and the thought process, I might recall that for coalescing random walks on a circle with n particles, the expected time until all meet is n*(n-1)*D, where D is the distance between them initially.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a discrete analog of the meeting time for multiple particles.\n\nAlternatively, the initial configuration has each pair of adjacent snakes separated by distance 3.\n\nThe expected time for two adjacent snakes to meet is 3*(45-3)=126.\n\nThere are 15 such pairs.\n\nThe first merge occurs after an expected time of 126/15 =8.4.\n\nThen after merging, the new distance between the merged snake and its neighbor is still 3, so the expected time for the next merge is 126/14\u22489.\n\nContinuing, the total expected time is \u03a3_{k=15}^2 126/k =126*(H_{15}-1).\n\nSince H_{15}= approximately 3.318, so 126*(3.318 -1)=126*2.318\u2248292.

Thus, for g=2 (distance 3), the expected time is 3*(45-3)=126.\n\nSince all gaps are independent in expectation, the total expected time is the sum over all gaps until they all reach 0. But since they are not independent, but in the symmetric case, the expected time until all gaps are closed is 126 multiplied by the number of gaps? No.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is equivalent to having 15 independent gaps, each with expected time 126 to hit 0, then the total expectation is 126*(number of gaps).\n\nBut no, because once a gap hits 0, it's removed.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is similar to the coupon collector problem where each coupon type has an expected time, but here it's the sum of harmonic series multiplied by the expected time per gap.\n\nThus, the expected time would be 126*(H_{15}).\n\nSince the problem states \"compute the expected number of seconds until there is only one snake left,\" and H_{15} is a fractional number, but the answer must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, the expected time for a single gap of size 2 (distance 3) is 3*(45 -3)=126.\n\nSince there are 15 gaps, and each must reduce to 0, the total expected time is 126*15=1890.\n\nBut I think this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 45*14=630.\n\nAlternatively, realizing that each snake must move to the meeting point, and the expected time is N(N-1)/2.\n\nFor N=45, 45\u00d744/2=990.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 126*(15-1)= 126\u00d714= 1764.\n\nGiven the confusion and time spent, I think the most plausible answer based on the meeting time formula for two particles on a circle is 126*(15)=1890 or 126*14=1764.\n\nBut since merging reduces the number of gaps by 1 each time, the total time is the sum over each merge step of the expected time between merges, which would be 126*(1/15 +1/14+\u2026+1/1).\n\nThus, the exact answer is 126 times the 15th harmonic number.\n\nH_{15}=1195757/360360,\n\nThus, the answer is 126\u00d71195757/360360= (126/360360)*1195757= (1/2860)*1195757=1195757/2860.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(1195757,2860).\n\nCompute GCD(2860,1195757):\n\n2860 divides into 1195757 how many times?\n\n1195757 \u00f7 2860 \u2248418 times.\n\n418\u00d72860=1,195,480.\n\nSubtract:1195757-1,195,480=277.\n\nNow GCD(2860,277).\n\n2860 \u00f7277=10 with remainder 90.\n\nGCD(277,90).\n\n277 \u00f790=3\u00d790=270, remainder7.\n\nGCD(90,7).\n\n90 \u00f77=12\u00d77=84, remainder6.\n\nGCD(7,6).\n\nGCD(6,1)=1.\n\nThus, GCD is1.\n\nThus, the fraction is 1195757/2860, which is approximately 418.1.\n\nSince the problem requires an exact answer, and the problem might have an elegant solution, I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, going back to the single gap analysis:\n\nIf the expected time for a gap of size g to reach 0 is E(g)=g*(N -g),\n\nThen for N=45, gap size g=3 (distance 3),\n\nE(3)=3*(45-3)=126,\n\nThus the expected time until a single gap of size 3 closes is 126 seconds.\n\nSince there are 15 gaps initially,\n\nThe total expected time is the sum over each gap being closed, but since they can close independently, it's similar to the coupon collector problem where each coupon has an expected time of 126, but with dependencies.\n\nHowever, in the coupon collector problem, the total time is sum_{k=1}^n (n choose k) probabilities, but here it's different.\n\nAlternatively, since the first gap closes in 126/15 steps,\n\nThe second in 126/14,\n\nThus total time is 126*(1/15 +1/14 +...+1/1)=126*H_{15}.\n\nSince the problem states the answer should be in a box,\n\nAnd 126*H_{15}=126*3.318\u2248418.7,\n\nThe closest integer is 420 or 418,\n\nBut exact fraction is 1195757/2860,\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects an exact answer of 126*H_{15} expressed as a fraction,\n\nBut given the problem's context, it might be 45\u00d744/2= 990,\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 126\u00d714=1764,\n\nBut I think the correct answer is 126 multiplied by the harmonic number H_{15}, so I will box that:\n\nThe expected number is 126 multiplied by the 15th harmonic number.\n\nBut since the problem might have an elegant answer,\n\nWait, another idea: the expected time is 45 choose 2 divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as 15 particles on a 45-node circle. The expected time until all meet is N(N-1)/4, which is 45\u00d744/4=495.\n\nAlternatively, since each snake moves left or right, the meeting time between two is N/2.\n\nFor N=45, it's 22.5,\n\nBut with 15 snakes, it's 15\u00d722.5=337.5,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the expected time for two snakes to meet is N=45,\n\nThus total time is 15\u00d744\u00d745/2= 14850,\n\nToo big.\n\nGiven that I can't find an exact answer and the problem might have a trick,\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that all gaps are symmetric and start at 2. Each second, each gap has a 1/4 chance to decrease, 1/4 to increase, 1/2 to stay.\n\nThe expected change in gap size is ( -2*(1/4) +0*(1/2)+2*(1/4))= (-0.5 +0.5)=0,\n\nThus, the gap performs a martingale.\n\nThe expected time until the gap reaches 0 is the same as the initial expected value squared divided by the variance per step,\n\nBut gap is at size 2,\n\nThe variance per step is E[ (\u0394g)^2 ] - (E[\u0394g])^2= ( ( (-2)^2*(1/4)+0*(1/2)+2^2*(1/4) )) -0= (4/4 +4/4)=2.\n\nThus, variance 2 per step.\n\nThus, expected time is (2)^2 / 2=2.\n\nWait, but this is for a symmetric martingale with variance 2 per step.\n\nBut the gap can also increase indefinitely,\n\nThus, this might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, the expected time is infinite, but since the snakes are on a circle, it's finite.\n\nAlternatively, for a symmetric random walk on the integers with absorbing barrier at 0,\n\nThe expected time to reach 0 starting from g is g\u00b2 * (something).\n\nFor symmetric walk with step \u00b12 with probability 1/4 each and 0 with 1/",
