      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible value of the product xyz, given these three equations with logarithms and exponents. Hmm, let's see. The equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers. I need to compute the minimal value of xyz. Alright, let's start by understanding what these equations mean and how to manipulate them.\n\nFirst, logarithms and exponents often can be tricky, but maybe taking logarithms of both sides might help. Since all variables are positive, logarithms are defined. Let me think about taking the logarithm base 2 of each equation. That might simplify things?\n\nLet me try that. Let's take the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nTaking log base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074).\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which is log_b(a^c) = c log_b(a), the left side becomes log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082(x). The right side can be split using log(ab) = log a + log b:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082(x) = log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074).\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\nlog\u2082(2\u2078) is 8, and log\u2082(3\u2074) is 4 log\u2082(3). So altogether:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082(x) = 8 + 4 log\u2082(3).\n\nHmm, that's the first equation. Let me write that down as equation (1):\n\n(log\u2082 y + log\u2082 z) * log\u2082 x = 8 + 4 log\u2082 3.\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for the second equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076.\n\nTaking log\u2082 of both sides:\n\nlog\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) = log\u2082(2\u2079\u00b73\u2076).\n\nAgain, left side becomes log\u2082(zx) * log\u2082(y). The right side is log\u2082(2\u2079) + log\u2082(3\u2076) = 9 + 6 log\u2082 3.\n\nSo equation (2):\n\n(log\u2082 z + log\u2082 x) * log\u2082 y = 9 + 6 log\u2082 3.\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nTaking log\u2082:\n\nlog\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)}) = log\u2082(2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070).\n\nLeft side is log\u2082(xy) * log\u2082 z. Right side is 5 + 10 log\u2082 3.\n\nThus, equation (3):\n\n(log\u2082 x + log\u2082 y) * log\u2082 z = 5 + 10 log\u2082 3.\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations involving log\u2082 x, log\u2082 y, log\u2082 z. Maybe it would help to let variables be the logs? Let me set variables to simplify:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\na = log\u2082 x,\n\nb = log\u2082 y,\n\nc = log\u2082 z.\n\nThen, since log\u2082 x = a, that means x = 2^a, and similarly y = 2^b, z = 2^c.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082 y + log\u2082 z = b + c,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(zx) = c + a,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = a + b.\n\nSo substituting into the equations:\n\nEquation (1): (b + c) * a = 8 + 4 log\u2082 3,\n\nEquation (2): (c + a) * b = 9 + 6 log\u2082 3,\n\nEquation (3): (a + b) * c = 5 + 10 log\u2082 3.\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations with variables a, b, c. The problem is that log\u2082 3 is a constant. Let me denote k = log\u2082 3 for simplicity. Since log\u2082 3 is a constant (approximately 1.58496, but exact value is irrational), but in the equations, it's multiplied by coefficients, so perhaps we can treat k as a variable? Wait, no, it's a constant. Hmm, but maybe we can write all equations in terms of k and then see if they can be solved?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the equations have terms with constants and terms with k. Let me look at the right-hand sides:\n\nFirst equation RHS: 8 + 4k,\n\nSecond equation RHS: 9 + 6k,\n\nThird equation RHS: 5 + 10k.\n\nSo each equation has a constant term and a multiple of k. Let me write each equation as:\n\n1) a(b + c) = 8 + 4k,\n\n2) b(c + a) = 9 + 6k,\n\n3) c(a + b) = 5 + 10k.\n\nHmm, so these are three equations with three variables a, b, c, but involving the constant k. Wait, but actually, k is a known constant (log\u20823). But perhaps we can separate the equations into parts with and without k? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we consider that the equations can be split into terms with k and without? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I consider variables a, b, c, and treat k as a coefficient, maybe there is some symmetry here. Alternatively, maybe if we can find a combination of the equations to eliminate k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let the equations be in terms of variables a, b, c and k, and try to solve for a, b, c in terms of k, then compute xyz = 2^{a + b + c}? Because since x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c, so xyz = 2^{a + b + c}. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a + b + c, then taking 2 to that power. So our target is to find a + b + c.\n\nTherefore, if we can find a + b + c, then we can compute xyz as 2^{a + b + c}. Therefore, the minimal value of xyz would be 2^{a + b + c}, so we need to find a + b + c.\n\nTherefore, maybe we can find a + b + c from the equations?\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nand also P = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand Q = abc,\n\nbut not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write the three equations in terms of S and other terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me write each equation as:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) = 8 +4k,\n\nbut since S = a + b + c, then (b + c) = S - a,\n\nSo equation1: a(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly, equation2: b(S - b) = 9 +6k,\n\nequation3: c(S - c) =5 +10k.\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations:\n\na(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nb(S - b) = 9 +6k,\n\nc(S - c) =5 +10k.\n\nHmm, so these are quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively. Let me think if there's a way to combine them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding all three equations together?\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na(S -a) + b(S - b) + c(S - c) = (aS -a\u00b2) + (bS - b\u00b2) + (cS - c\u00b2) = S(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nBut S = a + b + c, so this becomes S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nThe right side is (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) = (8+9+5) + (4k +6k +10k) = 22 + 20k.\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =22 + 20k.\n\nHmm, but I don't know a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 yet. Maybe another relation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps also consider that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote ab + bc + ca as P. Then,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P.\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nS\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 2P) =22 + 20k,\n\nSimplifies to 2P =22 +20k \u21d2 P=11 +10k.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have that ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k.\n\nHmm, that's a useful relation. So P =11+10k.\n\nNow, let's see if we can get another equation involving S and P.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the products of variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express each of the original equations in terms of S and P.\n\nWait, perhaps we can consider the equations again:\n\nEach equation is of the form variable*(S - variable) = RHS.\n\nSo for equation1:\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet me rearrange each equation:\n\nEquation1: aS - a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: bS - b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS - c\u00b2=5 +10k.\n\nSo if I add all three equations, I get S(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =22 +20k,\n\nwhich is what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract equations to find relationships between variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the variables a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation?\n\nLet me think. Let me suppose that a, b, c are roots of the equation t\u00b3 - St\u00b2 + Pt - Q =0, where Q = abc.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting too complicated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each variable squared in terms of S and the RHS?\n\nLet me see. Let's rearrange equation1:\n\na\u00b2 = aS - (8 +4k).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = bS - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = cS - (5 +10k).\n\nThen, the sum a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S(a + b + c) - (8 +4k +9 +6k +5 +10k) = S\u00b2 - (22 +20k).\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the differences between equations?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the variables a, b, c as variables and try to set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let\u2019s think of variables a, b, c and try to express them in terms of S and k.\n\nAlternatively, since I have three equations:\n\na(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S - b) =9 +6k,\n\nc(S - c)=5 +10k.\n\nThese equations are each quadratic in a, b, c. Let me write each as quadratic equations.\n\nFor example, equation1: a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nEquation2: b\u00b2 - Sb + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nEquation3: c\u00b2 - Sc + (5 +10k)=0.\n\nHmm, so each variable satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients depending on S and k. Since a, b, c are real numbers (since x, y, z are positive reals), the discriminant of each quadratic must be non-negative.\n\nSo for equation1 discriminant D1 = S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly, D2 = S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k) \u22650,\n\nD3 = S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650.\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2 must be \u22654*(max{8+4k, 9+6k, 5+10k}).\n\nHmm, but since k is log\u20823, which is approximately 1.58496, so let's compute:\n\nCompute each term inside the max:\n\n8 +4k \u22488 +4*1.58496\u22488+6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\n9 +6k\u22489+6*1.58496\u22489+9.50976\u224818.50976,\n\n5 +10k\u22485 +10*1.58496\u22485 +15.8496\u224820.8496.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of those is 20.8496, so S\u00b2 must be at least 4*20.8496\u224883.3984. So S must be at least sqrt(83.3984)\u22489.132. But this might not help us directly yet.\n\nAlternatively, since each a, b, c is a solution to their respective quadratics, perhaps the variables a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S and k, and then substituted into the sum S = a + b + c?\n\nLet me try that. Let me suppose that:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4*(8 +4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. But since variables a, b, c are positive real numbers, the roots must be positive, so we have to take the appropriate sign in the quadratic formula.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but perhaps if we consider that all three quadratics have to have their roots sum up to S. Let me see.\n\nWait, each quadratic equation for a, b, c has roots [variable and another root], but the variable here is one root. Wait, actually, for each quadratic equation:\n\nFor example, equation1: a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nthe sum of roots is S, and the product is (8 +4k). Therefore, the other root would be S - a. But since the variables a, b, c are part of the same system, perhaps there's some relation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we consider that variables a, b, c are the three roots of some cubic equation? Let me think.\n\nWait, since each quadratic equation has two roots, but a, b, c are each one root from each quadratic, maybe they are related in such a way that they must satisfy the cubic equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of S as a variable we need to find. Since S = a + b + c, and we also have ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k from earlier.\n\nIf I can find S, then I can compute xyz = 2^S. So maybe I can find S through some other equation?\n\nLet me see. Let me try to consider that:\n\nLet me denote the three equations again:\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k.\n\nIf I add all three equations, as before, we have S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) =22 +20k,\n\nand from earlier, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - 2*(11 +10k).\n\nThus, substituting into the first equation:\n\nS\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 2*(11 +10k)) =22 +20k,\n\nWhich simplifies to 22 +20k =22 +20k, so that's an identity. So that doesn't give us new information. Hmm.\n\nHmm, so maybe we need another equation. Let me think of multiplying the three original equations together?\n\nOriginal equations:\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k.\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\na b c (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = (8 +4k)(9 +6k)(5 +10k).\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated, but perhaps manageable. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, notice that (S - a) = b + c,\n\n(S - b) = a + c,\n\n(S - c) = a + b,\n\nTherefore, (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = (b + c)(a + c)(a + b).\n\nHmm, but expanding that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps express (S - a)(S - b)(S - c) in terms of S, P, and Q?\n\nLet me recall some algebraic identities. Let me note that:\n\n(S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S^3 - S\u00b2(a + b + c) + S(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\n\nBut since a + b + c = S,\n\n= S\u00b3 - S\u00b3 + S(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\n\nTherefore, simplifies to S(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\n\nSo, (S -a)(S -b)(S -c) = S P - Q,\n\nwhere P is ab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nand Q is abc.\n\nSo, going back to the product of equations:\n\na b c (S P - Q) = (8 +4k)(9 +6k)(5 +10k).\n\nHmm, but Q = abc, so this becomes:\n\nQ (S P - Q) = (8 +4k)(9 +6k)(5 +10k).\n\nBut this is an equation involving Q and S. Since we know P =11 +10k,\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nQ (S*(11 +10k) - Q) = (8 +4k)(9 +6k)(5 +10k).\n\nHmm, but this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make substitutions for variables. Let me consider that since the equations are symmetric in a, b, c but with different constants, maybe we can set variables in terms of S and then find S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that:\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\na(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb(S - b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S - c)=5 +10k.\n\nLet me denote the right-hand sides as constants:\n\nLet me define:\n\nC1 =8 +4k,\n\nC2 =9 +6k,\n\nC3=5 +10k.\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\na(S -a) = C1,\n\nb(S -b)=C2,\n\nc(S -c)=C3.\n\nThen, since S =a + b +c,\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of S and their own equation.\n\nFor example, from equation for a:\n\na\u00b2 -Sa +C1 =0,\n\nso a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nSimilarly, b = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2)]/2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)]/2.\n\nHmm, but then since a, b, c have to be positive and sum to S, perhaps each variable takes the smaller root? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since a, b, c are positive real numbers, and S is their sum, each of them must be less than S, so the other root (the one that's S - a) would be positive as well. So each quadratic has two positive roots? Let me check.\n\nThe quadratic equation for a is x\u00b2 - Sx + C1 =0,\n\nso the roots are [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nsince both roots have to be positive, the smaller root is [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nand the larger is [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2.\n\nTherefore, since a is one of the roots, but depending on which one it is, the same for b and c.\n\nHmm, but since a, b, c are variables, perhaps each variable corresponds to a different root? Wait, but how do they relate to each other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables a, b, c must be the smaller roots? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a system where each variable a, b, c is the smaller root of their respective quadratic equations, such that their sum is S. Hmm, but this might get too involved.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that:\n\nLet me denote:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2)]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)]/2,\n\nThen, since a + b + c = S,\n\nthen,\n\n[S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2 + [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2)]/2 + [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)]/2 = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n3S - [sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)] = 2S,\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3).\n\nHmm, that's an equation in terms of S only. But solving this equation for S would be really complicated, as it involves square roots of expressions with S\u00b2. Not sure if this is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think numerically? But since the problem asks for an exact answer, perhaps there's a smarter substitution.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider that the equations have terms with constants and terms with k. Since k = log\u20823 is a constant, maybe we can split the variables into parts that depend on log\u20823 and parts that don't?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that a, b, c can be written as linear combinations of 1 and log\u20823? Let me think. Let me suppose that a = p + q log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. Since the equations have terms with constants and terms with log\u20823, maybe this would separate the equations into two parts.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me set:\n\na = m\u2081 + n\u2081 log\u20823,\n\nb = m\u2082 + n\u2082 log\u20823,\n\nc = m\u2083 + n\u2083 log\u20823,\n\nwhere m\u2081, m\u2082, m\u2083 and n\u2081, n\u2082, n\u2083 are real numbers.\n\nThen, substituting into the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\na(S -a) = (m\u2081 +n\u2081k)( (m\u2081 + n\u2081k + m\u2082 +n\u2082k + m\u2083 +n\u2083k) - (m\u2081 +n\u2081k) )\n\nWait, this might get really messy, but perhaps expanding terms with and without k.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that in each equation, the right-hand side has a constant term and a term involving k. Let me see:\n\nFirst equation: a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for others. If I can split a(S -a) into terms without k and terms with k, then equate coefficients for constants and coefficients of k.\n\nWait, let's think of equations as:\n\nLeft side: (m\u2081 +n\u2081k)( (S -a) ) where S is also expressed in terms of m's and n's. Hmm, maybe this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me suppose that the variables a, b, c can be separated into components that account for the constants and the terms with log\u20823. Let me think of the equations as:\n\nEach equation has an expression that must equal a constant plus a multiple of log\u20823. Therefore, perhaps the left-hand sides also have terms with and without log\u20823. Therefore, maybe the variables a, b, c can be written as a combination so that when multiplied, they produce the separation of terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split each variable into two parts: a = A + B log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. Let me try this.\n\nLet:\n\na = A + B log\u20823,\n\nb = C + D log\u20823,\n\nc = E + F log\u20823,\n\nWhere A, B, C, D, E, F are constants to be determined.\n\nThen, substituting into the first equation:\n\na(S -a) = (A + Bk)( (S - (A + Bk) ) ) = (A + Bk)( (S - A - Bk) ) = (A + Bk)(S - A - Bk),\n\nSimilarly, this would be equal to 8 +4k.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(A)(S - A) + A(-Bk) + Bk(S - A) + Bk*(-Bk)\n\n= A(S - A) - ABk + BkS - ABk - B\u00b2k\u00b2,\n\n= A(S - A) + Bk(S - 2A) - B\u00b2k\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, this must equal 8 +4k.\n\nTherefore, equate the terms without k and the terms with k (and terms with k\u00b2? But the right side has no k\u00b2 term. Hmm, so perhaps the coefficient of k\u00b2 must be zero, and the coefficients of k and constants must match.\n\nSimilarly, this would give:\n\nCoefficient of k\u00b2: -B\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 B\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 B=0,\n\nCoefficient of k: B(S - 2A) =4,\n\nConstant term: A(S - A) =8,\n\nBut if B=0, then the coefficient of k becomes 0*(S - 2A)=0, but the right side has 4k, so that would require 0=4, which is impossible. Hmm, so this approach might not work.\n\nHmm, maybe the assumption that a can be written as A + Bk is too simplistic? Maybe a more complex form is needed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables a, b, c each have components proportional to 1 and log\u20823, so that when multiplied, they can produce terms with log\u20823 squared. But since the RHS has only up to first power of log\u20823, so the squared terms must vanish. Therefore, perhaps the coefficients of the squared terms must be zero?\n\nWait, let me try again with variables expressed as linear combinations of 1 and log\u20823. Let me denote k = log\u20823.\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\na = p + q k,\n\nb = r + s k,\n\nc = t + u k,\n\nwhere p, q, r, s, t, u are constants.\n\nThen, substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\na(S -a) = (p + q k)( (S - (p + q k)) ) = (p + qk)( (S - p - qk) )\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n= p(S - p - qk) + qk(S - p - qk)\n\n= p(S - p) - p q k + qk(S - p) - q\u00b2 k\u00b2\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= [p(S - p) + qk(S - p)] + [ -p q k - q\u00b2 k\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, actually, let me do term by term:\n\nFirst term: p*(S - p) = pS - p\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: p*(-qk) = -p q k,\n\nThird term: qk*(S - p) = qk(S - p),\n\nFourth term: qk*(-qk) = - q\u00b2k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\npS - p\u00b2 - p q k + qk(S - p) - q\u00b2k\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe terms without k: pS - p\u00b2,\n\nThe terms with k: ( -p q + q(S - p) )k = q(S - 2p) k,\n\nThe term with k\u00b2: - q\u00b2 k\u00b2.\n\nThus, the entire expression is:\n\npS - p\u00b2 + q(S - 2p)k - q\u00b2 k\u00b2.\n\nThis must equal 8 +4k.\n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\n- The term with k\u00b2: -q\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 q=0,\n\n- The term with k: q(S - 2p) =4,\n\n- The constant term: pS - p\u00b2 =8.\n\nBut if q=0, then the term with k becomes 0 =4, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach also leads to inconsistency. Hmm, so maybe this decomposition is not possible?\n\nHmm, maybe the variables cannot be expressed as linear combinations of 1 and log\u20823. Maybe this suggests that the problem requires another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of working with logarithms, let me try to use substitution with exponents.\n\nWait, going back to the original equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet me recall that a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}. Is that an identity? Wait, let me verify:\n\nTake log base b of both sides:\n\nlog_b(a^{log_b c}) = log_b c * log_b a,\n\nand log_b(c^{log_b a}) = log_b a * log_b c.\n\nYes, so they are equal. Therefore, a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can rewrite each equation using this identity.\n\nSo for the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = (yz)^{log\u2082 x} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSecond equation: y^{log\u2082(zx)} = (zx)^{log\u2082 y} =2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nThird equation: z^{log\u2082(xy)} = (xy)^{log\u2082 z} =2^5\u00b73^{10}.\n\nHmm, so each equation now is (product of two variables) raised to log\u2082 of the third variable equals the given power.\n\nTherefore, the first equation becomes:\n\n(y z)^{log\u2082 x} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(z x)^{log\u2082 y}=2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nThird equation:\n\n(x y)^{log\u2082 z}=2^5\u00b73^{10}.\n\nHmm, perhaps taking the product of all three equations?\n\nMultiplying left sides: (y z)^{log\u2082x} * (z x)^{log\u2082y} * (x y)^{log\u2082 z}.\n\nLet me compute this product.\n\nFirst, note that exponents can be combined by adding exponents for the same base.\n\nLet me write each term in prime factors:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLeft side:\n\n(y z)^{log\u2082x} * (z x)^{log\u2082y} * (x y)^{log\u2082 z}\n\n= y^{log\u2082x} z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y} x^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082 z} y^{log\u2082 z}\n\nNow, group the terms with y, z, x:\n\nFor y terms:\n\ny^{log\u2082x + log\u2082 z} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082y + log\u2082 z}\n\nWait, perhaps better to write exponents:\n\nLet me collect the exponents for each variable:\n\nFor variable x:\n\nIn the first term: z^{log\u2082x}\n\nIn the second term: x^{log\u2082y}\n\nIn the third term: x^{log\u2082 z}\n\nTherefore, the exponent of x is (log\u2082y + log\u2082 z).\n\nSimilarly for variable y:\n\nFirst term: y^{log\u2082x}\n\nThird term: y^{log\u2082 z}\n\nSecond term: (z x)^{log\u2082y} has y^{log\u2082y} ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nWait, let me re-express each term:\n\nFirst term: (y z)^{log\u2082x} = y^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x}\n\nSecond term: (z x)^{log\u2082y} = z^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082y}\n\nThird term: (x y)^{log\u2082z} = x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z}\n\nTherefore, multiplying all together:\n\ny^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z}\n\nNow, collect exponents for each variable:\n\nFor y:\n\nlog\u2082x (from first term) + log\u2082z (from third term)\n\nTotal exponent: log\u2082x + log\u2082z\n\nFor z:\n\nlog\u2082x (from first term) + log\u2082y (from second term)\n\nTotal exponent: log\u2082x + log\u2082y\n\nFor x:\n\nlog\u2082y (from second term) + log\u2082z (from third term)\n\nTotal exponent: log\u2082y + log\u2082z\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nx^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x + log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y}\n\nHmm, notice that log\u2082y + log\u2082z = log\u2082(yz),\n\nSimilarly for the others. So this can be written as:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(xz)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nWait, but that's the same as each original equation multiplied together. Hmm, but the right-hand side when we multiply the three equations is:\n\n(2^8\u00b73^4) * (2^9\u00b73^6) * (2^5\u00b73^{10}) =2^{8+9+5} *3^{4+6+10}=2^{22}\u00b73^{20}.\n\nTherefore,\n\nLeft side product = x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(xz)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2^{22}\u00b73^{20}\n\nHmm, but is there a way to express the left side in terms of (xyz)^{something}?\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nLet me note that log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(xz) = log\u2082x + log\u2082z,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = log\u2082x + log\u2082y,\n\nTherefore, exponents:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z,\n\nlog\u2082(xz) = log\u2082x + log\u2082z,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = log\u2082x + log\u2082y,\n\nTherefore, the left side is:\n\nx^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x + log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y}\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y}\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms:\n\n= (x^{log\u2082x})^{something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that each term like x^{log\u2082y} can be paired with y^{log\u2082x}:\n\nIndeed, x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = (x^{log\u2082y})(y^{log\u2082x}) = e^{(ln x)(log\u2082y)} * e^{(ln y)(log\u2082x)} ?\n\nWait, maybe better to use the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a} again.\n\nWait, for example, x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, as per the identity.\n\nTherefore, x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x},\n\nSimilarly, x^{log\u2082z} = z^{log\u2082x},\n\ny^{log\u2082z} = z^{log\u2082y},\n\nTherefore, substituting into the left side:\n\n(x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x}) * (x^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x}) * (y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082y})\n\n= (y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x}) ? Wait, no. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, actually, each pair like x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} is equal to y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, let me take it step by step.\n\nOriginal left side after expanding:\n\nx^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y}\n\nGroup terms as:\n\n(x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x}) * (x^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x}) * (y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082y})\n\nEach of these grouped pairs is equal to (x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x}) = y^{log\u2082x} * x^{log\u2082y} = ?\n\nWait, using the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}, so x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so the first pair is x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{2 log\u2082x} ?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{log\u2082x} * x^{log\u2082y} = same thing. But according to the identity, each term is equal. So x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x} so the product is y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{2 log\u2082x} ?\n\nWait, no, no, that would be (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2, but actually, x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} is equal to y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x}? Wait, no, no. Wait, let me substitute variables:\n\nLet me let A = log\u2082x,\n\nB = log\u2082y,\n\nC = log\u2082z.\n\nThen, log\u2082y = B,\n\nlog\u2082x = A,\n\nso x^{log\u2082y} = (2^A)^{B} = 2^{AB},\n\nSimilarly, y^{log\u2082x} = (2^B)^A = 2^{AB},\n\nTherefore, their product is 2^{AB} * 2^{AB} = 2^{2AB}.\n\nHmm, so each pair like x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = 2^{AB + BA} = 2^{2AB}?\n\nWait, actually, it's 2^{AB} * 2^{AB} = 2^{2AB}, yes.\n\nSimilarly, the second group:\n\nx^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x} = (2^A)^C * (2^C)^A = 2^{AC} * 2^{AC} = 2^{2AC},\n\nThird group:\n\ny^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082y} = (2^B)^C * (2^C)^B = 2^{BC} * 2^{BC} = 2^{2BC},\n\nTherefore, the entire left side product is:\n\n2^{2AB} * 2^{2AC} * 2^{2BC} =2^{2(AB + AC + BC)}.\n\nThus, equating to the right side:\n\n2^{2(AB + AC + BC)} =2^{22}\u00b73^{20}\n\nHmm, but the left side is a power of 2, while the right side has a factor of 3^{20}. This suggests that my approach is missing something, unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, I must have messed up the substitution.\n\nHold on, when I used the identity, I converted variables to exponents of 2, but the original variables x, y, z could have factors of 3 as well. Wait a second, in the original equations, the right-hand sides have factors of both 2 and 3. But when I set variables like x =2^a, that would make x only a power of 2, but in reality x might have factors of 3 as well. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in my initial substitution, I set a = log\u2082x, which would mean x = 2^a, but if x has factors of 3, then log\u2082x is not an integer, but still real. But in the equations, the right-hand side has 3's, so the left-hand sides must also have factors of 3. But when I expressed everything in terms of log\u2082 variables, maybe I lost track of the 3's?\n\nAh, here's the problem! Earlier, when I set a = log\u2082x, then x =2^a, but this would make x only a power of 2, but in the original equations, the RHS has 3's. Therefore, this suggests that my substitution is flawed because x, y, z must also have factors of 3 to get those terms.\n\nTherefore, my mistake was in assuming that x =2^a, but actually, since the RHS has factors of 3, x must be a product of powers of 2 and 3. Therefore, I need to express x, y, z as 2^{a} *3^{b} or something like that.\n\nAh, right! I oversimplified by only considering log base 2, but since there are factors of 3, I need a different substitution.\n\nHmm, so let me start over with a better substitution.\n\nLet me assume that x, y, z can be written as:\n\nx =2^{a} *3^{d},\n\ny =2^{b} *3^{e},\n\nz =2^{c} *3^{f},\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, f are real numbers. This way, they can have both factors of 2 and 3.\n\nThen, let's rewrite the original equations in terms of a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^{8}\u00b73^{4}\n\nCompute log\u2082(yz). Since yz =2^{b +c}*3^{e + f},\n\nso log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{b +c} *3^{e +f}) = (b +c) + log\u2082(3^{e +f}) = (b +c) + (e +f) log\u20823.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(yz) = (b +c) + k(e +f), where k = log\u20823.\n\nThen, x^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^{a}3^{d}]^{(b +c) +k(e +f)} =2^{a[(b +c)+k(e +f)]} *3^{d[(b +c)+k(e +f)]}.\n\nThis must equal 2^8 3^4.\n\nTherefore, equate the exponents of 2 and 3:\n\nFor 2: a[(b +c) +k(e +f)] =8,\n\nFor 3: d[(b +c)+k(e +f)] =4.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^9\u00b73^6.\n\nCompute log\u2082(zx):\n\nzx =2^{c +a}*3^{f +d},\n\nso log\u2082(zx) = (c +a) +k(f +d).\n\nThen, y^{log\u2082(zx)} = [2^{b}3^{e}]^{(a +c) +k(d +f)} =2^{b[(a +c)+k(d +f)]} *3^{e[(a +c)+k(d +f)]}.\n\nSet equal to 2^9\u00b73^6:\n\nExponents:\n\nFor 2: b[(a +c) +k(d +f)] =9,\n\nFor 3: e[(a +c)+k(d +f)] =6.\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} =2^5\u00b73^{10}.\n\nCompute log\u2082(xy):\n\nxy =2^{a +b}*3^{d +e},\n\nso log\u2082(xy) = (a +b) +k(d +e).\n\nThen, z^{log\u2082(xy)} = [2^{c}3^{f}]^{(a +b)+k(d +e)} =2^{c[(a +b)+k(d +e)]} *3^{f[(a +b)+k(d +e)]}.\n\nSet equal to 2^5 3^{10}:\n\nExponents:\n\nFor 2: c[(a +b)+k(d +e)] =5,\n\nFor 3: f[(a +b)+k(d +e)] =10.\n\nTherefore, now we have six equations:\n\nEquation1a: a[(b +c) +k(e +f)] =8,\n\nEquation1b: d[(b +c)+k(e +f)] =4,\n\nEquation2a: b[(a +c) +k(d +f)] =9,\n\nEquation2b: e[(a +c)+k(d +f)] =6,\n\nEquation3a: c[(a +b)+k(d +e)] =5,\n\nEquation3b: f[(a +b)+k(d +e)] =10.\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have six equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, and k = log\u20823 is a constant.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there is a pattern here. Let me see.\n\nLooking at equations 1a and 1b, they have the same factor [(b +c) +k(e +f)]. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nFor equation1:\n\nLet\u2019s set M1 = (b + c) + k(e + f),\n\nThen Equation1a: a*M1 =8,\n\nEquation1b: d*M1 =4,\n\nSimilarly, for equation2:\n\nLet\u2019s denote M2 = (a +c) +k(d + f),\n\nEquation2a: b*M2 =9,\n\nEquation2b: e*M2 =6,\n\nEquation3:\n\nLet\u2019s denote M3 = (a + b) +k(d + e),\n\nEquation3a: c*M3 =5,\n\nEquation3b: f*M3 =10.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nM1 =8/a =4/d,\n\nM2 =9/b =6/e,\n\nM3 =5/c =10/f.\n\nFrom here, each M is expressed in terms of variables.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom M1:\n\n8/a =4/d \u21d2 8d =4a \u21d2 2d =a \u21d2 a=2d.\n\nSimilarly, M2:9/b=6/e \u21d2 9e =6b \u21d2 3e=2b \u21d2 e=(2b)/3.\n\nM3:5/c =10/f \u21d25f =10c \u21d2 f=2c.\n\nSo, from these, we can express a, e, f in terms of d, b, c.\n\nSo,\n\na =2d,\n\ne = (2/3)b,\n\nf = 2c.\n\nNow, substitute these into the expressions for M1, M2, M3.\n\nFirst, let's compute M1:\n\nM1 = (b + c) +k(e + f).\n\nSubstituting e and f:\n\n= (b + c) +k( (2/3)b +2c )\n\n= b + c + (2k/3)b + 2k c.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nM2 = (a +c) +k(d +f).\n\nSubstituting a=2d and f=2c:\n\n= (2d +c) +k(d +2c).\n\nM3 = (a +b) +k(d +e).\n\nSubstituting a=2d and e=(2/3)b:\n\n= (2d +b) +k(d + (2/3)b).\n\nNow, let's also note that M1, M2, M3 are also equal to 8/a, 9/b, 5/c respectively.\n\nBut since a=2d,\n\nM1 =8/a =8/(2d)=4/d,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nM2 =9/b,\n\nM3=5/c.\n\nSo now, let me write the equations for M1, M2, M3 in terms of variables.\n\nStarting with M1:\n\nM1 = b + c + (2k/3)b + 2k c =4/d,\n\nBut since a=2d, so d =a/2,\n\nWait, but maybe better to keep variables as they are.\n\nWait, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, M1 equation:\n\nb + c + (2k/3)b + 2k c =4/d,\n\nSimilarly, M2 equation:\n\n(2d +c) +k(d +2c)=9/b,\n\nM3 equation:\n\n(2d +b) +k(d + (2/3)b)=5/c.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit involved, but perhaps we can substitute variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can express d, b, c in terms of other variables?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assign variables in terms of d, b, c and form equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have:\n\nLet me treat variables d, b, c as independent variables, and express everything in terms of them.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nFrom a =2d, e= (2/3)b, f=2c,\n\nThus, variables a, e, f are dependent on d, b, c.\n\nNow, let's write all equations in terms of d, b, c.\n\nStarting with M1 equation:\n\nM1 = (b + c) +k*( (2/3)b +2c ) = (b +c) + (2k/3)b +2k c,\n\nand this equals 4/d,\n\nSo,\n\n(b + c) + (2k/3)b + 2k c =4/d. (Equation A)\n\nSimilarly, M2:\n\nM2 = (2d +c) +k(d +2c) =2d +c +k d +2k c = (2d + k d) + (c +2k c) =d(2 +k) + c(1 +2k),\n\nand this equals 9/b,\n\nThus,\n\nd(2 +k) + c(1 +2k) =9/b. (Equation B)\n\nM3 equation:\n\nM3 = (2d +b) +k*(d + (2/3)b ) =2d +b +k d + (2k/3)b,\n\n= d(2 +k) + b(1 + (2k)/3),\n\nand this equals5/c,\n\nThus,\n\nd(2 +k) +b( (3 +2k)/3 ) =5/c. (Equation C)\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations (A, B, C) with variables d, b, c.\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three variables. Let me see.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation A:\n\n(b + c) + (2k/3)b + 2k c =4/d,\n\nEquation B:\n\nd(2 +k) + c(1 +2k) =9/b,\n\nEquation C:\n\nd(2 +k) + (b)( (3 +2k)/3 ) =5/c.\n\nHmm, this is still quite complex, but perhaps we can find some substitution.\n\nLet me see if I can express d from Equation B and plug into Equation C and A.\n\nFrom Equation B:\n\nd(2 +k) =9/b - c(1 +2k),\n\nThus,\n\nd= [9/b -c(1 +2k) ] / (2 +k).\n\nSimilarly, from Equation C:\n\nd(2 +k) =5/c - b( (3 +2k)/3 ),\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = [5/c - b( (3 +2k)/3 ) ] / (2 +k).\n\nThus, equate the two expressions for d:\n\n[9/b -c(1 +2k) ] / (2 +k) = [5/c - b( (3 +2k)/3 ) ] / (2 +k).\n\nMultiply both sides by (2 +k):\n\n9/b -c(1 +2k) =5/c - (b(3 +2k))/3.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n9/b -c(1 +2k) -5/c + (b(3 +2k))/3 =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that variables d, b, c are proportional to something, or maybe set variables to certain ratios?\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting too algebraically intensive, maybe numerical substitution with k = log\u20823 \u22481.58496 could help, but since the problem requires an exact answer, perhaps the system has integer solutions or something.\n\nWait, let me check if the equations can be satisfied with some integer values.\n\nLet me see, let me suppose that the variables d, b, c are integers. Maybe that could lead us somewhere.\n\nSuppose d is an integer. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that variables are integers. Let me try some trial.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in the equations involving M1, M2, M3, and their relations.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the variables M1, M2, M3.\n\nFrom the earlier definitions:\n\nM1 =8/a =4/d,\n\nM2=9/b,\n\nM3=5/c,\n\nand also:\n\nM1 = (b + c) + k(e + f),\n\nbut since e= (2/3)b and f=2c,\n\nM1 =b +c +k*( (2/3)b +2c )\n\nSimilarly, M2 = (2d +c) +k*(d +2c),\n\nM3= (2d +b) +k*(d + (2/3)b )\n\nHmm, maybe express M1, M2, M3 in terms of M1=4/d, M2=9/b, M3=5/c,\n\nand also express variables in terms of M1, M2, M3.\n\nAlternatively, since a=2d,\n\nthen from M1 =4/d,\n\nd=4/M1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb=9/M2,\n\nc=5/M3,\n\nSo, let me write d, b, c in terms of M1, M2, M3:\n\nd=4/M1,\n\nb=9/M2,\n\nc=5/M3.\n\nThen, variables e and f can be written as:\n\ne= (2/3)b = (2/3)(9/M2)=6/M2,\n\nf=2c=10/M3.\n\nNow, substitute these into M1, M2, M3:\n\nStarting with M1:\n\nM1 = (b + c) +k*(e + f)\n\nSubstituting expressions:\n\n= (9/M2 +5/M3) +k*(6/M2 +10/M3)\n\nSimilarly, M2:\n\nM2 = (2d +c) +k*(d +2c)\n\nSubstituting d=4/M1, c=5/M3:\n\n= (2*(4/M1) +5/M3) +k*(4/M1 +2*(5/M3))\n\n= (8/M1 +5/M3) +k*(4/M1 +10/M3)\n\nSimilarly, M3:\n\nM3 = (2d +b) +k*(d + (2/3)b )\n\nSubstituting d=4/M1, b=9/M2:\n\n= (2*(4/M1) +9/M2) +k*(4/M1 + (2/3)*(9/M2))\n\n= (8/M1 +9/M2) +k*(4/M1 +6/M2)\n\nTherefore, we now have expressions for M1, M2, M3 in terms of themselves:\n\nEquation for M1:\n\nM1 = (9/M2 +5/M3) +k*(6/M2 +10/M3)\n\nEquation for M2:\n\nM2 = (8/M1 +5/M3) +k*(4/M1 +10/M3)\n\nEquation for M3:\n\nM3 = (8/M1 +9/M2) +k*(4/M1 +6/M2)\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three variables M1, M2, M3, and constants involving k.\n\nThis still seems very complex. Maybe there's symmetry here?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that M1, M2, M3 are proportional to some common factor. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that M1 = M2 = M3 = M,\n\nthen check if that leads to a solution.\n\nAssume M1 = M2 = M3 = M.\n\nThen,\n\nFrom M1 = M,\n\nEquation for M1:\n\nM = (9/M +5/M) +k*(6/M +10/M)\n\n= (14/M) +k*(16/M)\n\n= (14 +16k)/M,\n\nThus,\n\nM = (14 +16k)/M \u21d2 M\u00b2 =14 +16k,\n\nSimilarly, for M2:\n\nM = (8/M +5/M) +k*(4/M +10/M)\n\n=13/M +14k/M,\n\nThus,\n\nM\u00b2=13 +14k,\n\nSimilarly for M3:\n\nM= (8/M +9/M) +k*(4/M +6/M)\n\n=17/M +10k/M,\n\nThus,\n\nM\u00b2=17 +10k,\n\nTherefore, this would require that all three expressions for M\u00b2 are equal:\n\n14 +16k =13 +14k \u21d2 1 +2k=0 \u21d2k=-0.5,\n\nand also 14 +16k=17 +10k \u21d24k=3 \u21d2k=0.75,\n\nwhich contradicts since k=log\u20823\u22481.58496. So this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm, so symmetry assumption is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations for M1, M2, M3 are cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider making substitutions to reduce variables.\n\nLet me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet me define variables u =1/M1,\n\nv=1/M2,\n\nw=1/M3.\n\nThen,\n\nM1=1/u,\n\nM2=1/v,\n\nM3=1/w.\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\nEquation M1:\n\n1/u = (9v +5w) +k*(6v +10w),\n\nEquation M2:\n\n1/v = (8u +5w) +k*(4u +10w),\n\nEquation M3:\n\n1/w = (8u +9v) +k*(4u +6v).\n\nHmm, still complex, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me rewrite these equations:\n\nEquation1:\n\n1/u = (9v +5w)(1 +k*(2/3)),\n\nWait, no, actually:\n\nWait, expanding the terms:\n\nEquation1:\n\n1/u =9v +5w +k*(6v +10w) =9v +5w +6kv +10kw.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2:\n\n1/v =8u +5w +4k u +10k w,\n\nEquation3:\n\n1/w =8u +9v +4k u +6k v.\n\nHmm, perhaps arrange terms:\n\nEquation1:\n\n1/u = v*(9 +6k) + w*(5 +10k). (1)\n\nEquation2:\n\n1/v = u*(8 +4k) + w*(5 +10k). (2)\n\nEquation3:\n\n1/w =u*(8 +4k) +v*(9 +6k). (3)\n\nAh! Now this is interesting. Let me denote:\n\nLet me set,\n\nLet me denote coefficients:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nA =8 +4k,\n\nB =9 +6k,\n\nC=5 +10k.\n\nThen, notice that:\n\nEquation1: 1/u = B*v + C*w,\n\nEquation2:1/v =A*u + C*w,\n\nEquation3:1/w =A*u + B*v.\n\nSo now, the equations are:\n\n1/u = Bv + Cw, (1)\n\n1/v =Au + Cw, (2)\n\n1/w =Au + Bv. (3)\n\nNow, this system is symmetric and might be solvable.\n\nLet me write equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nWe can write them as:\n\nBv + Cw =1/u, (1)\n\nAu + Cw =1/v, (2)\n\nAu + Bv =1/w. (3)\n\nLet me see if I can solve this system for u, v, w.\n\nLet me consider equations (2) and (3). Let's subtract them:\n\n(2)-(3):\n\nAu + Cw - (Au + Bv) =1/v -1/w,\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nCw - Bv = (w - v)/(vw),\n\nWait, right side is 1/v -1/w = (w - v)/(vw).\n\nThus,\n\nCw - Bv = (w - v)/(vw).\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express variables in terms.\n\nLet me treat u, v, w as variables and try to solve the system.\n\nLet me consider equations (1), (2), (3).\n\nLet me consider equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom equation (1): Bv + Cw =1/u,\n\nFrom equation (2): Au + Cw =1/v.\n\nLet me subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(Bv + Cw) - (Au + Cw) =1/u -1/v,\n\n=> Bv - Au = (v -u)/(uv),\n\nHmm, still not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express u from equation (2):\n\nFrom (2): Au =1/v - Cw \u21d2 u = (1/(A v)) - (C/A)w.\n\nSimilarly from equation (1): Bv =1/u - Cw \u21d2 v = (1/(B u)) - (C/B)w.\n\nThis substitution could get too recursive.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider multiplying each equation by the variable in the denominator.\n\nMultiply equation (1) by u:\n\n1 = B v u + C w u,\n\nMultiply equation (2) by v:\n\n1 =A u v + C w v,\n\nMultiply equation (3) by w:\n\n1 =A u w + B v w.\n\nThus, the equations become:\n\nBuv + C wu =1, (1a)\n\nAuv + C wv =1, (2a)\n\nAu w + B v w =1. (3a)\n\nHmm, now these three equations have terms involving products of variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nX = uv,\n\nY = vw,\n\nZ = wu.\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1a: B X + C Z =1,\n\nEquation2a: A X + C Y =1,\n\nEquation3a: A Z + B Y =1.\n\nNow we have three equations with variables X,Y,Z.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n1) B X + C Z =1,\n\n2) A X + C Y =1,\n\n3) A Z + B Y =1.\n\nHmm, this is a linear system in variables X, Y, Z. Let me write this in matrix form:\n\n[ B   0   C ] [X]   [1]\n\n[ A   C   0 ] [Y] = [1]\n\n[ 0   B   A ] [Z]   [1]\n\nHmm, perhaps solve this system.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nFrom equation1: B X + C Z =1 \u21d2 X = (1 - C Z)/B,\n\nFrom equation2: A X + C Y =1 \u21d2 plug X from above:\n\nA*(1 - C Z)/B + C Y =1 \u21d2 (A/B - (A C /B) Z) + C Y =1 \u21d2\n\nC Y = 1 - A/B + (A C /B) Z,\n\nY = [ (1 - A/B ) + (A C / B ) Z ] / C,\n\nSimilarly from equation3:\n\nA Z + B Y =1,\n\nSubstitute Y from above:\n\nA Z + B*[ (1 - A/B ) + (A C / B ) Z ] / C =1,\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: A Z,\n\nSecond term: B/C*(1 - A/B) + B/C*(A C / B) Z,\n\n= B/C*(1 - A/B) + (A Z),\n\nThus entire equation:\n\nA Z + [ B/C*(1 - A/B) + A Z ] =1,\n\nCombine terms:\n\nA Z + A Z + [ B/C*(1 -

A/C ) + A Z ] =1,\n\nSo,\n\nA Z + B/C - A/C +A Z =1,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2A Z + (B - A)/C =1,\n\nNow, solving for Z:\n\n2A Z =1 - (B - A)/C,\n\nZ= [1 - (B - A)/C ]/(2A).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's substitute the values of A, B, C.\n\nRecall that:\n\nA=8 +4k,\n\nB=9 +6k,\n\nC=5 +10k,\n\nwhere k=log\u20823.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, compute numerator:1 - (B - A)/C,\n\nCompute B - A = (9+6k) - (8+4k)=1 +2k,\n\nThus,\n\n1 - (1 +2k)/(5 +10k) = [ (5+10k) - (1 +2k) ] / (5+10k)\n\n= (4 +8k)/ (5 +10k) = 4(1 +2k)/ [5(1 +2k)] ) = 4/5,\n\nWait, that's nice!\n\nWait,\n\n(5+10k -1 -2k) =4 +8k =4(1 +2k),\n\nDenominator is (5 +10k)=5(1 +2k),\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes 4(1 +2k)/5(1 +2k)=4/5,\n\nThus,\n\nZ= (4/5) / (2A) = (4)/(5 *2A) = 2/(5A).\n\nTherefore,\n\nZ =2/(5A).\n\nSo Z =2/(5*(8 +4k)),\n\nSimilarly, let's compute A =8 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\nZ = 2/(5*(8 +4k)) =2/[5*4*(2 +k)] ) = 1/[10*(2 +k)].\n\nWait, 8 +4k =4*(2 +k),\n\nYes, so 2/(5*4*(2 +k)) = 2/(20*(2 +k)) =1/(10*(2 +k)).\n\nTherefore, Z =1/[10*(2 +k)].\n\nOkay, so now we have Z.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation1:\n\nB X + C Z =1,\n\nWe know Z,\n\nso,\n\nX = (1 -C Z)/B,\n\nSubstituting Z =1/[10*(2 +k)],\n\nSo,\n\nC Z = C/[10(2 +k)],\n\nThus,\n\nX = [1 - C/(10(2 +k)) ] / B,\n\nLet me compute C/(10*(2 +k)),\n\nC =5 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\nC/(10*(2 +k)) = (5 +10k)/(10*(2 +k)),\n\nFactor numerator:5(1 +2k),\n\nDenominator:10*(2 +k),\n\nThus,\n\n5(1 +2k)/[10(2 +k)] = (1 +2k)/[2(2 +k)].\n\nTherefore,\n\nX = [1 - (1 +2k)/(2(2 +k)) ] / B,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1 - (1 +2k)/(2(2 +k)) = [2(2 +k) - (1 +2k)]/[2(2 +k)]\n\n= [4 +2k -1 -2k]/[2(2 +k)]\n\n=3/[2(2 +k)]\n\nThus,\n\nX = [3/(2(2 +k)) ] / B = 3/[2(2 +k) B].\n\nSince B=9 +6k,\n\nTherefore,\n\nX=3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k) ].\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSimilarly, from equation2a: A X + C Y =1,\n\nWe can solve for Y:\n\nC Y =1 -A X,\n\nY= [1 -A X]/C,\n\nSubstitute X=3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k)],\n\nA=8 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\nA X= (8 +4k)*3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k)].\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFactor numerator: (8+4k)=4*(2 +k),\n\nSo,\n\nA X=4*(2 +k)*3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k)] =12*(2 +k)/[2*(2 +k)*(9 +6k)] =6/[9 +6k].\n\nThus,\n\n1 - A X=1 -6/(9 +6k)= (9 +6k -6)/ (9 +6k)= (3 +6k)/ (9 +6k)=3(1 +2k)/ [3(3 +2k)]= (1 +2k)/(3 +2k).\n\nTherefore,\n\nY= [ (1 +2k)/(3 +2k) ] / C,\n\nWhere C=5 +10k=5(1 +2k),\n\nThus,\n\nY= (1 +2k)/(3 +2k) / [5(1 +2k)] ) =1/[5(3 +2k)].\n\nSo Y=1/[5(3 +2k)].\n\nNow, so now we have X,Y,Z in terms of k.\n\nRecall that:\n\nX = uv,\n\nY = vw,\n\nZ = wu.\n\nWe can now express variables u, v, w in terms of these.\n\nLet me write:\n\nWe have:\n\nX = uv =3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k) ],\n\nY = vw =1/[5(3 +2k) ],\n\nZ = wu =1/[10(2 +k) ].\n\nLet me see if we can solve for u, v, w.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nLet me consider variables:\n\nLet me write the three equations:\n\n1) uv = X,\n\n2) vw = Y,\n\n3) wu = Z.\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying all three equations:\n\n(uv)(vw)(wu)=X Y Z,\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 v\u00b2 w\u00b2 = X Y Z,\n\nTherefore,\n\nu v w = sqrt(X Y Z).\n\nBut perhaps better to solve step by step.\n\nLet me solve for variables:\n\nFrom equation3: wu = Z \u21d2 w = Z/u,\n\nFrom equation1: uv =X \u21d2 v = X/(u),\n\nSubstitute v =X/u into equation2:\n\n(X/u) * w = Y \u21d2 w = (Y u)/X,\n\nBut also from equation3, w= Z/u,\n\nThus,\n\n(Y u)/X = Z/u \u21d2 Y u\u00b2 =X Z \u21d2 u\u00b2 = (X Z)/Y,\n\nTherefore,\n\nu = sqrt( (X Z)/Y ).\n\nCompute (X Z)/Y:\n\nX=3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k) ],\n\nZ=1/[10(2 +k) ],\n\nY=1/[5(3 +2k) ]\n\nThus,\n\n(X Z)/Y = [3/(2(2 +k)(9 +6k))] * [1/(10(2 +k)) ] / [1/(5(3 +2k)) ]\n\n= [3/(2(2 +k)(9 +6k) *10(2 +k)) ] *5(3 +2k)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [3/(20(2 +k)^2 (9 +6k))] *5(3 +2k)\n\n= (3 *5)(3 +2k) / [20 (2 +k)^2 (9 +6k) ]\n\n=15(3 +2k)/[20*(2 +k)^2*(9 +6k) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:15(3+2k),\n\nDenominator:20*(2 +k)^2*(9 +6k).\n\nNote that 9 +6k =3(3 +2k),\n\nTherefore,\n\nDenominator becomes 20*(2 +k)^2*3*(3 +2k) =60*(2 +k)^2*(3 +2k).\n\nThus,\n\n(X Z)/Y =15(3 +2k)/[60*(2 +k)^2*(3 +2k) ] =15/[60*(2 +k)^2] =1/[4*(2 +k)^2].\n\nThus,\n\nu= sqrt(1/[4*(2 +k)^2])=1/[2*(2 +k)].\n\nTherefore,\n\nu=1/[2*(2 +k)].\n\nThen, from equation1: v= X/u,\n\nX=3/[2(2 +k)(9 +6k) ],\n\nThus,\n\nv= [3/(2(2 +k)(9 +6k)) ] / [1/(2*(2 +k)) ] = 3/(2(2 +k)(9 +6k)) * 2*(2 +k)/1 =3/(9 +6k).\n\nSimplify denominator:9 +6k=3*(3 +2k),\n\nThus,\n\nv=3/[3*(3 +2k)] =1/(3 +2k).\n\nSimilarly, from equation3: w= Z/u,\n\nZ=1/[10*(2 +k) ],\n\nSo,\n\nw= [1/(10*(2 +k))]/[1/(2*(2 +k))] = [1/(10*(2 +k))] * [2*(2 +k)/1] =2/(10)=1/5.\n\nTherefore,\n\nw=1/5.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nu=1/[2*(2 +k)],\n\nv=1/(3 +2k),\n\nw=1/5.\n\nThus, variables u, v, w are found.\n\nRecall that:\n\nu =1/M1,\n\nv=1/M2,\n\nw=1/M3,\n\nTherefore,\n\nM1=1/u=2*(2 +k),\n\nM2=1/v=3 +2k,\n\nM3=1/w=5.\n\nAh! This is a breakthrough.\n\nThus,\n\nM1=2*(2 +k),\n\nM2=3 +2k,\n\nM3=5.\n\nNow, recall that:\n\nFrom earlier substitutions:\n\na=2d,\n\nd=4/M1,\n\nThus,\n\nd=4/[2*(2 +k)] =2/(2 +k),\n\nThen,\n\na=2d=4/(2 +k).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb=9/M2=9/(3 +2k),\n\nc=5/M3=5/5=1,\n\nAnd,\n\ne= (2/3)b= (2/3)*(9/(3 +2k))=6/(3 +2k),\n\nf=2c=2*1=2.\n\nSo, we now have all variables expressed in terms of k=log\u20823.\n\nNow, recall that we need to find S =a +b +c,\n\nsince xyz=2^{a +b +c}*3^{d +e +f},\n\nWait, wait! Wait a second. Remember that we set:\n\nx=2^a *3^d,\n\ny=2^b *3^e,\n\nz=2^c *3^f,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{a +b +c}*3^{d +e +f},\n\nSo the exponent for 2 is S =a +b +c,\n\nand the exponent for 3 is T =d +e +f,\n\nTherefore, xyz=2^S *3^T,\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal value of xyz. Since 2 and 3 are both greater than 1, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize S and T.\n\nHowever, since the equations are fixed, S and T are fixed values determined by the variables, so there is only one possible value. Let me compute them.\n\nFirst, compute S =a +b +c:\n\na=4/(2 +k),\n\nb=9/(3 +2k),\n\nc=1,\n\nThus,\n\nS=4/(2 +k) +9/(3 +2k) +1.\n\nSimilarly, compute T =d +e +f:\n\nd=2/(2 +k),\n\ne=6/(3 +2k),\n\nf=2,\n\nThus,\n\nT=2/(2 +k) +6/(3 +2k) +2.\n\nSo, we need to compute S and T.\n\nBut k=log\u20823.

Not sure,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product of the three original equations:\n\nFirst equation: x^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nSecond: y^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nThird: z^{log\u2082(xy)}=2^5\u00b73^{10},\n\nThe product:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)} =2^{8+9+5}\u00b73^{4+6+10}=2^{22}\u00b73^{20},\n\nBut from earlier, this left side product equals 2^{2P}*3^{2Q} where P and Q are the sums for the exponents in the variables, but perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since we have xyz=2^S *3^T,\n\nThen, (xyz)^{log\u2082(xy) + log\u2082(yz) + log\u2082(zx)} equals the product of the three equations?\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for S and T, and they are exact in terms of k=log\u20823, perhaps the minimal value is simply 2^{S}*3^{T} where S and T are as computed.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a trick where S and T can be simplified to integers by recognizing that certain terms cancel out.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me compute S + T:\n\nS + T = [ (2k\u00b2 +24k +36) + (4k\u00b2 +24k +30) ] / (2k\u00b2 +7k +6),\n\nWait, no, S and T are separate terms.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2^S *3^T can be rewritten using the values of a,b,c,d,e,f:\n\nxyz=2^{a +b +c}*3^{d +e +f},\n\nWhere,\n\na=4/(2 +k),\n\nb=9/(3 +2k),\n\nc=1,\n\nd=2/(2 +k),\n\ne=6/(3 +2k),\n\nf=2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{4/(2 +k) +9/(3 +2k)+1} *3^{2/(2 +k)+6/(3 +2k)+2},\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be expressed as:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me compute the exponent of 2:\n\nLet me write 4/(2 +k) +9/(3 +2k) +1,\n\n= [4/(2 +k) + 2/(2 +k)] + [9/(3 +2k)+6/(3 +2k)] + (1 +0),\n\nWait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of variables:\n\nNote that:\n\nThe exponents S and T have terms like 1/(2 +k) and 1/(3 +2k),\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set m=2 +k,\n\nn=3 +2k,\n\nThen,\n\nk = log\u20823,\n\nm=2 + log\u20823,\n\nn=3 +2 log\u20823,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS=4/m +9/n +1,\n\nT=2/m +6/n +2,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{S}*3^{T}=2^{4/m +9/n +1} *3^{2/m +6/n +2},\n\nHmm, but without knowing m and n, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relation between m and n?\n\nWait, n=3+2k,\n\nSince m=2 +k,\n\nthen,\n\nn=3+2(k)=3+2(m-2)=3+2m-4=2m-1,\n\nTherefore,\n\nn=2m-1,\n\nThus, we can write everything in terms of m.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nn=2m-1,\n\nThus,\n\nS=4/m +9/(2m-1)+1,\n\nT=2/m +6/(2m-1)+2,\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nLet me compute S:\n\nS=4/m +9/(2m-1)+1,\n\nLet me compute common denominator for the first two terms:\n\nThe common denominator is m(2m-1),\n\nThus,\n\n4/m =4*(2m-1)/[m(2m-1)],\n\n9/(2m-1) =9m/[m(2m-1)],\n\nThus,\n\n4/m +9/(2m-1)= [8m-4 +9m]/[m(2m-1)] = (17m -4)/[m(2m-1)],\n\nThus,\n\nS= (17m -4)/[m(2m-1)] +1,\n\n= (17m -4 + m(2m-1))/[m(2m-1)],\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n17m-4 +2m\u00b2 -m=2m\u00b2 +16m -4,\n\nThus,\n\nS=(2m\u00b2 +16m -4)/[m(2m -1)].\n\nSimilarly for T:\n\nT=2/m +6/(2m -1)+2,\n\nCommon denominator m(2m -1),\n\n2/m =2*(2m -1)/[m(2m-1)],\n\n6/(2m-1)=6m/[m(2m-1)],\n\nThus,\n\n2/m +6/(2m-1)= [4m -2 +6m]/[m(2m-1)]= (10m -2)/[m(2m-1)],\n\nThus,\n\nT=(10m -2)/[m(2m-1)] +2,\n\n= (10m -2 +2m(2m -1))/[m(2m -1)],\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n10m -2 +4m\u00b2 -2m=4m\u00b2 +8m -2,\n\nThus,\n\nT=(4m\u00b2 +8m -2)/[m(2m -1)].\n\nHmm, still not helpful.\n\nWait, but m=2 +k,\n\nand k=log\u20823,\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to set m such that this simplifies?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the variables setup. Let me re-verify:\n\nWait, when I set variables x=2^a *3^d,\n\nthen log\u2082(xyz) = log\u2082(2^{a +b +c}3^{d +e +f}) =a +b +c + log\u20823*(d +e +f),\n\nBut wait, actually, log\u2082(xyz)= log\u2082 part plus log\u20823 part?\n\nNo, actually, log\u2082(xyz)= log\u2082(2^{a +b +c} *3^{d +e +f})= (a +b +c) + log\u20823*(d +e +f).\n\nBut in our case, S is the exponent of 2, so S=a +b +c,\n\nand T is the exponent of 3, so T=d +e +f.\n\nTherefore, xyz=2^{S}3^{T}.\n\nHmm, so unless there's a way to combine S and T into a single exponent, but it's separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem setup?\n\nWait, the problem says \"compute the smallest possible value of xyz\". Since the equations are given, and variables are positive reals, there is likely a unique solution, so the minimal value is the only possible value. Hence, we must compute it as we found.\n\nTherefore, the exact form is 2^{S}*3^{T}, where S and T are as computed.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a simplified form with integer exponents, perhaps there's an error in the process?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the substitution steps.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again:\n\nWe set variables:\n\nx=2^a*3^d,\n\ny=2^b*3^e,\n\nz=2^c*3^f,\n\nThen, computed the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2^8*3^4,\n\nComputed log\u2082(yz)= log\u2082y + log\u2082z,\n\nlog\u2082y= log\u2082(2^b*3^e)=b +e log\u20823,\n\nWait, wait a second!\n\nHold on, this is a critical mistake I made earlier!\n\nWait, log\u2082(y) is not just b, but since y=2^b *3^e,\n\nlog\u2082(y)= log\u2082(2^b *3^e)=b + log\u2082(3^e)=b + e log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(z)=c +f log\u20823,\n\nThus, log\u2082(yz)= log\u2082y + log\u2082z = [b +e log\u20823] + [c +f log\u20823]= (b +c) + (e +f) log\u20823,\n\nWait, so earlier calculation of log\u2082(yz) is correct: (b +c) +k(e +f),\n\nwhere k=log\u20823.\n\nBut when I computed the exponent for 3 in the first equation:\n\nThe first equation's left side is x^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^a 3^d]^{ (b +c) +k(e +f) }.\n\nThis equals 2^{a*(b +c +k(e +f))} * 3^{d*(b +c +k(e +f))}.\n\nSo the exponent for 3 is d*(b +c +k(e +f)), not d multiplied by something else.\n\nAh! Wait, this is a mistake I made earlier.\n\nWait, in my previous calculation I had:\n\nThe exponent of 3 was d multiplied by the entire exponent of the term, which is (b +c +k(e +f)),\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut in my earlier steps, I considered that exponent for 3 was d multiplied by the same exponent as the exponent for 2.\n\nBut that is correct.\n\nHowever, when I set up the equations, I had:\n\nEquation1a: a*M1 =8,\n\nEquation1b: d*M1=4,\n\nwhere M1= (b +c) +k(e +f).\n\nThus, M1 is the same for both equations.\n\nTherefore, the previous steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the mistake was not here.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the only way is to compute S and T in terms of log\u20823 and present the answer as 2^S *3^T with the computed S and T.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the minimal value and it's likely an integer, perhaps the exponents simplify when substituting k=log\u20823.\n\nLet me see:\n\nRecall that k=log\u20823,\n\nThus, 2^k=3,\n\nSo,\n\nLet me see if S and T can be expressed in terms of 2 and 3.\n\nLet me compute S:\n\nS=4/(2 +k)+9/(3 +2k)+1,\n\nLet me substitute 3=2^k,\n\nThus,\n\n3 +2k=2^k +2k,\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me write denominators in terms of 2 and k:\n\nDenominator1:2 +k,\n\nDenominator2:3 +2k,\n\nBut with k=log\u20823,\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me see if 3 +2k=3 +2 log\u20823,\n\nHmm, not obvious,\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms can be expressed as fractions of each other?\n\nWait, perhaps if we let\u2019s consider that:\n\nLet me compute S + T:\n\nS + T = [ (2k\u00b2 +24k +36) + (4k\u00b2 +24k +30) ] / D,\n\nWait no,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nS + T = (A) + (B),\n\nWhere A was S numerator over denominator, plus B similarly.\n\nWait, perhaps this is too time-consuming and the problem expects just the expression in terms of exponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is 2^{22}*3^{20} divided by something?\n\nWait, the product of the three equations is 2^{22}*3^{20}\uff0c which is the same as (xyz)^{something}?\n\nEarlier when multiplying the three equations, we get left side as 2^{2P}*3^{2Q} =2^{22}*3^{20},\n\nThus,\n\n2P=22 \u21d2 P=11,\n\n2Q=20 \u21d2 Q=10,\n\nWhere P=ab + bc + ca,\n\nand Q=de + ef + fd? Not sure,\n\nWait, perhaps P is the exponent sum for 2's and Q for 3's?\n\nAlternatively, in the initial substitution where I set variables as a=log\u2082x etc., we had:\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nWhich would be P=11 +10k,\n\nThen, 2P=22 +20k,\n\nBut equate to 22, so that would require k=0,\n\nBut k=log\u20823\u22600,\n\nThus, this approach was incorrect because we didn't account for the 3's.\n\nHmm, so no.\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nIf S and T are the exponents, perhaps their sum S + T is an integer?\n\nEarlier approximate values were S\u22483.574, T\u22483.531,\n\nSum\u22487.105,\n\nNot integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that when you compute xyz, the exponents S and T can be written as integers when expressed in terms of log\u20823.\n\nWait, let me compute S:\n\nS= a +b +c=4/(2 +k) +9/(3 +2k)+1,\n\nIf we let\u2019s substitute k=log\u20823,\n\nthen,\n\nLet me compute terms:\n\nLet me note that:\n\nk = log\u20823,\n\nso 2^{k}=3,\n\nThus,\n\n3 +2k =3 +2 log\u20823,\n\nHmm, but I don't see a way to express this as a power of 2 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 2^{S}*3^{T} with S and T as above,\n\nBut in the problem's context, maybe there's a trick where variables a,b,c,d,e,f are chosen such that the exponents become integers.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom earlier variables:\n\na=4/(2 +k),\n\nb=9/(3 +2k),\n\nc=1,\n\nd=2/(2 +k),\n\ne=6/(3 +2k),\n\nf=2,\n\nLet me see if these can be fractions that simplify to integers when multiplied by something?\n\nFor example,\n\nSuppose that (2 +k)=2 + log\u20823,\n\nBut this is not an integer,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the exponents S and T can be expressed as integers when considering that the minimal value is achieved when variables are set to certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a step I missed where S and T can be simplified.\n\nWait, let me compute S:\n\nS=4/(2 +k) +9/(3 +2k)+1,\n\nLet me multiply numerator and denominator by some factors.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that k=log\u20823,\n\nthen 2 +k=2 +log\u20823=log\u20824 + log\u20823=log\u2082(4*3)=log\u208212,\n\nWait, no: log\u20824 + log\u20823=log\u208212,\n\nBut 2 +k is just a number, not a logarithm.\n\nAlternatively, 3 +2k=3+2 log\u20823=log\u20828 +2 log\u20823=log\u20828 + log\u20829=log\u2082(8*9)=log\u208272,\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires expressing the answer as 2^{S}*3^{T} where S and T are expressed in terms of log\u20823,\n\nThus, the minimal value is 2^{S}*3^{T},\n\nBut since S and T are expressed in terms of log\u20823,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting k into S and T,\n\nLet me try:\n\nS =4/(2 +log\u20823) +9/(3 +2 log\u20823)+1,\n\nLet me compute this expression,\n\nBut it's unlikely to simplify to an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is 2^5 *3^5 = (2*3)^5=6^5=7776,\n\nBut I computed the approximate value of xyz as 2^3.574 *3^3.531\u2248 (2^3.5)*(3^3.5)= (sqrt(2^7))*(sqrt(3^7))\u2248sqrt(128*2187)=sqrt(280, 624)\u2248530, but that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach:\n\nWait, the equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} =2^5\u00b73^{10},\n\nLet me take log base 2 of each equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2^8\u00b73^4),\n\nWhich gives:\n\nlog\u2082(yz)*log\u2082x =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nlog\u2082(zx)*log\u2082y=9 +6 log\u20823,\n\nlog\u2082(xy)*log\u2082z=5 +10 log\u20823,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set a=log\u2082x,\n\nb=log\u2082y,\n\nc=log\u2082z,\n\nand k=log\u20823,\n\nthen,\n\nThe equations become:\n\n(b +c)*a =8 +4k,\n\n(c +a)*b=9 +6k,\n\n(a +b)*c=5 +10k,\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nWe need to find S=a +b +c.\n\nLet me consider adding all three equations:\n\na(b +c)+b(c +a)+c(a +b)= (8+9+5)+(4+6+10)k,\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2(ab + bc + ca)=22 +20k,\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca=11 +10k.\n\nSo P=11 +10k,\n\nWe also know that:\n\n(a +b +c)^2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2P,\n\nBut we also have from each equation:\n\na\u00b2 =aS -

the expression we found.\n\nBut the problem says \"compute the smallest possible value of xyz\".\n\nSince xyz is uniquely determined by the equations, the minimal value is the only possible value, so

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of S and T's numerators and denominators:\n\nThe numerator for S is 2*(k\u00b2+12k+18),\n\nDenominator is (2k+3)(k+2),\n\nSimilarly, for T numerator is 2*(2k\u00b2+12k+15),\n\nThus,\n\nS=2*(k\u00b2+12k+18)/[(2k+3)(k+2)],\n\nT=2*(2k\u00b2+12k+15)/[(2k+3)(k+2)],\n\nLet me see:\n\nk\u00b2+12k+18 = (k+6)^2 - 18,\n\nNot helpful,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nk\u00b2+12k+18 = (k+3)(k+6) -0,\n\nNot factorable.\n\nBut notice that,\n\nThe denominator is (2k+3)(k+2),\n\nIf we let me set variables as m=2k+3 and n=k+2,\n\nThen,\n\nDenominator=mn,\n\nk=(m-3)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nk+2= n,\n\nk=(m-3)/2,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2+12k+18= [(m-3)/2]^2 +12*(m-3)/2 +18,\n\n= (m\u00b2-6m+9)/4 +6(m-3)+18,\n\n= (m\u00b2-6m+9)/4 +6m-18+18,\n\n= (m\u00b2-6m+9)/4 +6m,\n\n= (m\u00b2-6m+9 +24m)/4,\n\n= (m\u00b2+18m +9)/4,\n\nHmm,\n\nThus,\n\nS=2*(m\u00b2+18m+9)/4 divided by mn,\n\nWait,\n\nS=2*(k\u00b2+12k+18)/(mn)=2*( (m\u00b2+18m+9)/4 )/(mn)= (m\u00b2+18m+9)/(2mn),\n\nBut this may not help.\n\nOverall, after extensive calculations, it seems the only exact form is the expression in terms of log\u20823, which is too complicated. Perhaps there's an error in the problem-solving approach.\n\nWait",

Let me see how to approach this. The equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, all variables are positive real numbers. The equations look similar, each variable raised to the logarithm of the product of the other two variables. Maybe there's a way to take logarithms of all equations to simplify them? Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote log base 2 for simplicity. Let me recall that a^{log_b(c)} can be rewritten using logarithm properties. Wait, there's a formula: a^{log_b(c)} = c^{log_b(a)}. Is that right? Let me check. Let me take log base b of both sides: log_b(a^{log_b(c)}) = log_b(c) * log_b(a). On the other side, log_b(c^{log_b(a)}) = log_b(a) * log_b(c). Yeah, so they are equal. So that's a useful identity here. Maybe that can help.\n\nAlternatively, taking logarithms of both sides might be a straightforward approach. Let me try taking log base 2 of each equation. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nTake log\u2082 of both sides:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074).\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082(x).\n\nRight side: log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) = log\u2082(2\u2079\u00b73\u2076).\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(zx) * log\u2082(y).\n\nRight side: 9 + 6 log\u20823.\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)}) = log\u2082(2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070).\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(xy) * log\u2082(z).\n\nRight side: 5 + 10 log\u20823.\n\nHmm, so if I let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z = b + c,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(zx) = c + a,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = a + b.\n\nAlso, log\u2082x is a, so log\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) becomes (b + c)*a.\n\nTherefore, the first equation's left side is a*(b + c), and the right side is log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u20823.\n\nWait, but log\u2082(3) is a constant here. Let me denote k = log\u20823, so that we can write the equations in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Let k = log\u20823. Then, the equations become:\n\nFirst equation: a*(b + c) = 8 + 4k,\n\nSecond equation: b*(c + a) = 9 + 6k,\n\nThird equation: c*(a + b) = 5 + 10k.\n\nSo now we have three equations in variables a, b, c, with k being a constant (since log\u20823 is a constant, approximately 1.58496... but we might not need its numerical value). Since we need to find xyz, which in terms of a, b, c would be 2^{a + b + c}, because log\u2082(xyz) = a + b + c, so xyz = 2^{a + b + c}. Therefore, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize a + b + c. Wait, but since all variables are positive, and exponents are positive, so a, b, c must be real numbers, but not necessarily positive? Wait, no, since x, y, z are positive real numbers, their logarithms can be any real numbers, but the exponents in the original equations must work out. Anyway, our goal is to find a + b + c, so let's see.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1) a(b + c) = 8 + 4k,\n\n2) b(c + a) = 9 + 6k,\n\n3) c(a + b) = 5 + 10k.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c. Then, note that each equation can be written as:\n\n1) a(S - a) = 8 + 4k,\n\n2) b(S - b) = 9 + 6k,\n\n3) c(S - c) = 5 + 10k.\n\nHmm, so each variable multiplied by (S minus itself) equals these constants. Let me see if I can write these equations as quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively. For example, equation 1 becomes:\n\naS - a\u00b2 = 8 + 4k,\n\nwhich can be rearranged as:\n\na\u00b2 - aS + (8 + 4k) = 0.\n\nSimilarly for the others:\n\nb\u00b2 - bS + (9 + 6k) = 0,\n\nc\u00b2 - cS + (5 + 10k) = 0.\n\nHmm, so each variable is a root of a quadratic equation with the same leading coefficient and linear term coefficient, but different constants. Interesting.\n\nSince a, b, c are roots of these quadratics, perhaps they are the roots of the same quadratic equation? Wait, but each has a different constant term, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe we can consider that a, b, c are three different roots? But each quadratic only has two roots. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that all three variables a, b, c satisfy some common equation? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the three equations:\n\na(S - a) = 8 + 4k,\n\nb(S - b) = 9 + 6k,\n\nc(S - c) = 5 + 10k.\n\nLet me denote the right-hand sides as constants:\n\nLet\u2019s denote C\u2081 = 8 + 4k,\n\nC\u2082 = 9 + 6k,\n\nC\u2083 = 5 + 10k.\n\nSo, each variable satisfies:\n\na(S - a) = C\u2081,\n\nb(S - b) = C\u2082,\n\nc(S - c) = C\u2083.\n\nLet me think of these as equations for each variable. Let me see if I can express a, b, c in terms of S and the constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding all three equations:\n\na(S - a) + b(S - b) + c(S - c) = C\u2081 + C\u2082 + C\u2083.\n\nLeft side:\n\naS - a\u00b2 + bS - b\u00b2 + cS - c\u00b2 = S(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nBut since S = a + b + c, this becomes:\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = C\u2081 + C\u2082 + C\u2083.\n\nHmm, so that's one equation. Let me note that.\n\nBut not sure yet. Let me compute the right-hand side:\n\nC\u2081 + C\u2082 + C\u2083 = (8 + 4k) + (9 + 6k) + (5 + 10k) = (8 +9 +5) + (4k +6k +10k) = 22 + 20k.\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 + 20k.\n\nHmm. But we need another relation between S and a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of S.\n\nWe know that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the previous equation:\n\nS\u00b2 - [S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] = 22 + 20k,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = 22 + 20k,\n\nTherefore,\n\nab + bc + ca = 11 + 10k.\n\nHmm, okay. So that's another equation: the sum of the products of the variables two at a time is 11 + 10k.\n\nNow, we have some equations here. Let me see what else I can do.\n\nLooking back at the original three equations:\n\na(S - a) = C\u2081,\n\nb(S - b) = C\u2082,\n\nc(S - c) = C\u2083.\n\nLet me rearrange each equation to express the product terms:\n\naS - a\u00b2 = C\u2081,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbS - b\u00b2 = C\u2082,\n\ncS - c\u00b2 = C\u2083.\n\nLet me denote each of these as:\n\nEquation 1: aS - a\u00b2 = C\u2081,\n\nEquation 2: bS - b\u00b2 = C\u2082,\n\nEquation 3: cS - c\u00b2 = C\u2083.\n\nIf I add Equations 1, 2, and 3 together:\n\n(aS - a\u00b2) + (bS - b\u00b2) + (cS - c\u00b2) = C\u2081 + C\u2082 + C\u2083,\n\nWhich we already did, leading to the equation above. But perhaps looking at individual equations:\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations for each variable:\n\nFrom equation 1: a\u00b2 - aS + C\u2081 = 0,\n\nSimilarly for the others. Each variable is a root of their respective quadratic equations. Let me consider that for variable a, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 - Sx + C\u2081 = 0,\n\nSimilarly for b: x\u00b2 - Sx + C\u2082 = 0,\n\nAnd for c: x\u00b2 - Sx + C\u2083 = 0.\n\nHmm, so each variable satisfies a quadratic equation with the same leading coefficient and linear term, but different constants. So, unless the constants are the same, each variable must be a root of a different quadratic. Since C\u2081, C\u2082, C\u2083 are different (unless k is a specific value, but k is log\u20823 which is fixed), so they are different. Therefore, each quadratic equation has two roots, and a, b, c are each one of those roots from their respective quadratics.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the variables a, b, c are roots of these three quadratics. Since each quadratic has two roots, the variables could be any of those roots. However, since S = a + b + c, perhaps there's a relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of S as a common variable and set up equations to solve for S. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me consider that each variable a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S. For example, from equation 1:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + C\u2081 = 0,\n\nso a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4C\u2081)] / 2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4C\u2082)] / 2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4C\u2083)] / 2.\n\nBut since S is the sum of a, b, c, this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the three quadratics must have their roots such that when you add three such roots (one from each quadratic), their sum is S. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the variables a, b, c are all related through these quadratics, so perhaps we can set up ratios or differences between them?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the three quadratics and see if there's a way to relate them. Let me write down the three quadratics again:\n\n1) x\u00b2 - Sx + (8 + 4k) = 0,\n\n2) x\u00b2 - Sx + (9 + 6k) = 0,\n\n3) x\u00b2 - Sx + (5 + 10k) = 0.\n\nLet me denote the three quadratics as Q\u2081(x), Q\u2082(x), Q\u2083(x). The roots of Q\u2081 are a and S - a (since sum of roots is S). Similarly, roots of Q\u2082 are b and S - b, and roots of Q\u2083 are c and S - c. Wait, but actually the roots of Q\u2081 are the solutions to x\u00b2 - Sx + C\u2081 =0, which would be [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081)]/2. Hmm, but since a is one of the roots, the other root would be S - a, because the sum of roots is S. Similarly for the others. Therefore, if a is a root of Q\u2081, then the other root is S - a. Similarly for b and Q\u2082, c and Q\u2083.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the variables a, b, c must be such that each is paired with another term (like S - a, etc.), but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the three quadratics and see if their roots are interconnected. For example, perhaps S - a is equal to one of the roots of another quadratic?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are relationships between the constants. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that S is a common variable, so if I can find S such that all three quadratics have real roots (since a, b, c are real numbers), then that S is a candidate. The discriminant of each quadratic must be non-negative.\n\nTherefore, discriminant for Q\u2081: S\u00b2 - 4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly for Q\u2082: S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k) \u22650,\n\nQ\u2083: S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650,\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2 must be at least the maximum of 4*(8+4k), 4*(9+6k), and 4*(5 +10k).\n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can subtract equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me see, for instance, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\nb(S - b) - a(S - a) = (9 +6k) - (8 +4k),\n\nWhich is:\n\nbS - b\u00b2 - aS + a\u00b2 = 1 + 2k,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nS(b - a) + (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 1 + 2k,\n\nNote that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b),\n\nTherefore,\n\nS(b - a) + (a - b)(a + b) = 1 + 2k,\n\nFactor out (b -a):\n\n(b - a)(S - (a + b)) = 1 + 2k,\n\nHmm, S - (a + b) = c, since S = a + b + c,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(b - a)(c) = 1 + 2k,\n\nSimilarly, maybe?\n\nWait, let me check that step again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nS(b - a) + (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = 1 + 2k,\n\nThen,\n\nS(b - a) + (a - b)(a + b) = 1 + 2k,\n\nFactor (b - a):\n\n(b - a)(-S + (a + b)),\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (a - b)(a + b),\n\nSo:\n\nS(b -a) + (a - b)(a + b) = (b - a)(-S) + (a - b)(a + b) ?\n\nWait, let me re-express the entire expression:\n\nS(b - a) + (a - b)(a + b) = (b - a)[ -S + (a + b) ]\n\nWait, (a - b) is -(b - a). So:\n\n= S(b -a) - (b - a)(a + b) = (b - a)[ S - (a + b) ]\n\nYes, that's correct. So then,\n\n(b - a)(S - (a + b)) = 1 + 2k,\n\nBut S - (a + b) = c,\n\nSo,\n\n(b - a)c = 1 + 2k.\n\nSimilarly, maybe if we subtract other equations, we can get similar relations.\n\nLet me try subtracting the third equation from the first equation:\n\na(S - a) - c(S - c) = (8 +4k) - (5 +10k),\n\nLeft side:\n\naS - a\u00b2 - cS + c\u00b2 = (a - c)S + (c\u00b2 - a\u00b2),\n\n= (a - c)(S - (a + c)),\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nAlternatively:\n\n= (a - c)S + (c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) = (a - c)S - (a\u00b2 - c\u00b2) = (a - c)(S - (a + c)),\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo,\n\n(a - c)(S - (a + c)) = (8 +4k) - (5 +10k) = 3 -6k,\n\nBut S - (a + c) = b,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a - c)*b = 3 -6k.\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second equation from the third:\n\nc(S - c) - b(S - b) = (5 +10k) - (9 +6k),\n\nLeft side:\n\ncS - c\u00b2 - bS + b\u00b2 = (c - b)S + (b\u00b2 - c\u00b2),\n\n= (c - b)(S - (b + c)),\n\nWait, same as (c - b)[ S - (b + c) ],\n\nBut S - (b + c) = a,\n\nSo,\n\n(c - b)*a = (5 +10k) - (9 +6k) = -4 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\n(c - b)*a = -4 +4k.\n\nSo now, I have three equations from the differences:\n\n1) (b - a)c = 1 + 2k,\n\n2) (a - c)b = 3 -6k,\n\n3) (c - b)a = -4 +4k.\n\nHmm, these equations might be helpful. Let me see if I can write them in terms of variables. Let me note that variables are a, b, c, and k. Since k is log\u20823, which is a constant, but perhaps we can find a relation that allows us to eliminate k? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can combine these three equations to eliminate variables. Let me think of them as:\n\nEquation (1): (b - a)c = 1 + 2k,\n\nEquation (2): (a - c)b = 3 -6k,\n\nEquation (3): (c - b)a = -4 +4k.\n\nLet me note that the left-hand sides are cyclic permutations of a, b, c. Let me see if adding all three equations would help.\n\nAdding equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n(b - a)c + (a - c)b + (c - b)a = (1 + 2k) + (3 -6k) + (-4 +4k).\n\nLeft side:\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (b - a)c = bc - ac,\n\nSecond term: (a - c)b = ab - bc,\n\nThird term: (c - b)a = ac - ab,\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n(bc - ac) + (ab - bc) + (ac - ab) = 0.\n\nAll terms cancel out. So the left side is 0.\n\nRight side:\n\n1 + 2k + 3 -6k -4 +4k = (1 +3 -4) + (2k -6k +4k) = 0 + 0 =0.\n\nSo that checks out, which is a good consistency check.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't give us new information, but confirms that the equations are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider ratios of these equations to eliminate k. Let me see.\n\nLet me write equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): (b - a)c = 1 + 2k,\n\nFrom (2): (a - c)b = 3 -6k,\n\nLet me solve for k from each and set them equal.\n\nFrom (1): 2k = (b - a)c -1,\n\nThus, k = [ (b - a)c -1 ] /2,\n\nFrom (2): -6k = (a - c)b -3,\n\nSo, k = [ 3 - (a - c)b ] /6,\n\nSet equal:\n\n[ (b - a)c -1 ] /2 = [ 3 - (a - c)b ] /6,\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n3[ (b - a)c -1 ] = [3 - (a - c)b ],\n\nExpand left side:\n\n3(b - a)c -3 = 3 - (a - c)b,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3(b - a)c -3 -3 + (a - c)b =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n3(b - a)c + (a - c)b -6 =0,\n\nLet me expand terms:\n\n3bc - 3ac + ab - cb -6 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3bc - cb) + (-3ac) + ab -6 = 0,\n\n2bc - 3ac + ab -6 =0,\n\nHmm, factor terms:\n\nLet me see:\n\nab + 2bc -3ac -6 =0,\n\nMaybe factor terms with a and terms with c?\n\nab -3ac +2bc -6=0,\n\na(b -3c) + 2bc -6=0,\n\nHmm, not obvious. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe proceed similarly with another pair of equations.\n\nTake equations (1) and (3):\n\nFrom (1): (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nFrom (3): (c -b)a = -4 +4k,\n\nExpress k from both:\n\nFrom (1): 2k = (b -a)c -1,\n\nFrom (3): 4k = (c -b)a +4,\n\nThus,\n\nk = [(b -a)c -1]/2,\n\nand,\n\nk = [ (c -b)a +4 ] /4,\n\nSetting equal,\n\n[(b -a)c -1]/2 = [ (c -b)a +4 ] /4,\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n2[(b -a)c -1] = (c -b)a +4,\n\nExpand left side:\n\n2(b -a)c -2 = (c -b)a +4,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2(b -a)c -2 - (c -b)a -4 =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(b -a)c - (c -b)a -6 =0,\n\nLet me expand terms:\n\n2bc - 2ac - ac + ab -6 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2bc -3ac + ab -6 =0,\n\nWait, this is the same equation as before. So that's consistent. Hmm, so this suggests that equations (1) and (2) and (1) and (3) lead to the same equation. Interesting.\n\nSo perhaps we need another equation. Let me try equations (2) and (3):\n\nFrom (2): (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nFrom (3): (c -b)a = -4 +4k,\n\nExpress k from both:\n\nFrom (2): -6k = (a -c)b -3,\n\nSo,\n\nk = [3 - (a -c)b]/6,\n\nFrom (3): 4k = (c -b)a +4,\n\nThus,\n\nk = [ (c -b)a +4 ] /4,\n\nSet equal:\n\n[3 - (a -c)b]/6 = [ (c -b)a +4 ] /4,\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\n2[3 - (a -c)b] = 3[ (c -b)a +4 ],\n\nExpand:\n\n6 - 2(a -c)b = 3(c -b)a +12,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6 -2(a -c)b -3(c -b)a -12 =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2(a -c)b -3(c -b)a -6 =0,\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n-2ab + 2bc -3ac +3ab -6=0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2ab +3ab) + (2bc -3ac) -6=0,\n\nab +2bc -3ac -6 =0,\n\nSame equation again. So all combinations lead to the same equation. So, that equation is necessary but not sufficient. Hmm.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can use that equation ab +2bc -3ac =6 (wait, the equation was ab +2bc -3ac -6=0, so ab +2bc -3ac =6).\n\nLet me note that equation: ab + 2bc - 3ac =6.\n\nHmm, but we also have from earlier that ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k. Let me write that down.\n\nab + bc + ca = 11 +10k,\n\nSo, if we can find another equation involving ab, bc, ca, perhaps we can solve for variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can use the equation ab + 2bc -3ac =6 and ab + bc + ca =11 +10k.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(ab + bc + ca) - (ab +2bc -3ac) = (11 +10k) -6,\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nab -ab + bc -2bc + ca +3ac = (0) + (-bc) +4ac,\n\nSo,\n\n- bc +4ac =5 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\n4ac - bc =5 +10k,\n\nFactor:\n\nc(4a - b) =5 +10k,\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, maybe we can find another equation by manipulating the existing ones. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the three original equations:\n\nEquation (1): (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nEquation (3): (c -b)a =-4 +4k.\n\nLet me see if I can express each variable in terms of others. Let me try solving for variables step by step.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n(b - a)c =1 +2k,\n\n=> b c -a c =1 +2k,\n\nSimilarly, equation (2):\n\na b - c b =3 -6k,\n\nEquation (3):\n\nc a - b a =-4 +4k,\n\nHmm, perhaps if we write all three equations as:\n\n1) bc -ac =1 +2k,\n\n2) ab - bc =3 -6k,\n\n3) ac -ab =-4 +4k,\n\nNow, adding equations 1,2,3 gives 0=0, as before.\n\nAlternatively, adding equations 1 and 2:\n\n(bc -ac) + (ab - bc) = (1 +2k) + (3 -6k),\n\nWhich gives:\n\nab -ac =4 -4k,\n\nFactor:\n\na(b -c) =4 -4k,\n\nSimilarly, equation (3): ac -ab =-4 +4k,\n\nWhich can be written as -a(b -c) = -4 +4k => a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nSo this is consistent with the previous result. So, that's okay.\n\nHmm, so equation (3) was redundant here.\n\nSo from equation (1) + (2) gives a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nAlso, equation (3) gives the same.\n\nSo, perhaps let me write:\n\nLet me denote equation (1):\n\nbc -ac =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2):\n\nab - bc =3 -6k,\n\nEquation (3):\n\nac -ab =-4 +4k,\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of a. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables as a, b, c and the equations:\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nAnd the equation from above, ab +2bc -3ac =6,\n\nLet me try to solve for variables.\n\nLet me call the first equation (A): ab + bc + ca = S1 =11 +10k,\n\nSecond equation (B): ab +2bc -3ac =6,\n\nThen subtract (B) - (A):\n\n(ab +2bc -3ac) - (ab + bc + ca) =6 - S1,\n\nWhich gives:\n\n(0ab) + (2bc - bc) + (-3ac - ca) =6 - S1,\n\nSimplify:\n\nbc -4ac =6 - S1,\n\nBut S1 is 11 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\nbc -4ac =6 -11 -10k,\n\n=> bc -4ac = -5 -10k,\n\nFactor c:\n\nc(b -4a) = -5 -10k,\n\nHmm, that's another equation. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of a and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables a, b, c and the equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nEquation (3): (c -b)a =-4 +4k,\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation (3): (c -b)a =-4 +4k,\n\n=> c -b = (-4 +4k)/a,\n\n=> c = b + (-4 +4k)/a,\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1):\n\n(b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nSubstitute c from above:\n\n(b -a)[ b + (-4 +4k)/a ] =1 +2k,\n\nExpand this:\n\n(b -a)b + (b -a)(-4 +4k)/a =1 +2k,\n\nFirst term: b\u00b2 -a b,\n\nSecond term: [ -4(b -a) +4k(b -a) ] /a,\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 -ab + [ -4(b -a) +4k(b -a) ] /a =1 +2k,\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb\u00b2 -ab + [ (b -a)(-4 +4k) ] /a =1 +2k,\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out (b -a):\n\nWait, the second term is [ (b -a)(-4 +4k) ] /a,\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 -ab + (b -a)(-4 +4k)/a =1 +2k,\n\nLet me factor terms with (b -a):\n\nHmm, perhaps not straightforward. Alternatively, let me multiply through by a to eliminate denominators:\n\nMultiply entire equation by a:\n\na(b\u00b2 -ab) + (b -a)(-4 +4k) = a(1 +2k),\n\nExpand terms:\n\nab\u00b2 -a\u00b2b + (-4 +4k)(b -a) = a + 2k a,\n\nExpand the second term:\n\n-4b +4a +4k b -4k a,\n\nThus,\n\nab\u00b2 -a\u00b2b -4b +4a +4k b -4k a =a +2k a,\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nab\u00b2 -a\u00b2b -4b +4a +4k b -4k a -a -2k a =0,\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nab\u00b2 -a\u00b2b -4b + (4a -a) + (4k b) + (-4k a -2k a) =0,\n\nWhich is:\n\nab\u00b2 -a\u00b2b -4b +3a +4k b -6k a =0,\n\nHmm, this is getting really messy, maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to solve for variables a, b, c directly, let's think of the original problem again. Since we need to find xyz =2^{a + b + c}, so we need to find S =a + b +c.\n\nIf we can find S, then we can compute xyz.\n\nWe had earlier that ab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nAnd also, we had the equation ab +2bc -3ac =6,\n\nPerhaps we can combine these equations to find expressions in terms of S and ab + bc + ca.\n\nLet me see.\n\nLet me denote ab + bc + ca = M =11 +10k,\n\nAnd the equation ab +2bc -3ac =6. Let me call this equation (C).\n\nLet me write equation (C):\n\nab + 2bc -3ac =6,\n\nWe can write this as (ab + bc + ca) + bc -4ac =6,\n\nWhich is M + (bc -4ac) =6,\n\nBut bc -4ac = c(b -4a),\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, since M = ab + bc + ca,\n\nThen,\n\nequation (C): ab +2bc -3ac = (ab + bc + ca) + bc -4ac = M + (bc -4ac) =6,\n\nThus,\n\nbc -4ac =6 - M,\n\nBut M =11 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\nbc -4ac =6 -11 -10k = -5 -10k,\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of S.\n\nLet me recall that S = a + b + c,\n\nAlso, we can consider variables a, b, c as variables with sum S and product terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose that we set variables in terms of S, like:\n\nLet me think of the three quadratics for each variable:\n\nFor a: a\u00b2 -Sa + C\u2081 =0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThe product of the roots for each quadratic is C\u2081, C\u2082, C\u2083 respectively.\n\nSince a and S -a are roots of the first quadratic,\n\nSimilarly, the product a*(S - a)= C\u2081,\n\nWhich is the first original equation.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the variables a, b, c are such that:\n\na*(S -a)=C\u2081,\n\nb*(S -b)=C\u2082,\n\nc*(S -c)=C\u2083,\n\nAnd we need to find S such that these equations are consistent.\n\nThis seems like a system that can be solved for S by considering that:\n\nLet me think of each variable as satisfying x*(S -x)=C,\n\nSo for each variable, x\u00b2 -Sx + C=0,\n\nThus, the three variables a, b, c are three different roots of these three quadratics. Since quadratics have two roots each, but three variables, perhaps each variable is paired with another variable to form roots for different quadratics. This is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of S as a variable and set up equations to solve for S.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFrom the three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\na(S -a)=C\u2081,\n\nb(S -b)=C\u2082,\n\nc(S -c)=C\u2083,\n\nAdding all three gives:\n\nS(a +b +c) - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)= C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nWhich we already used to get that ab + bc + ca = (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)/2 + (S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2))/2,\n\nWait, no, earlier we had that:\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)= C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nand since a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSo substituting gives:\n\nS\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca))= C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nwhich simplifies to 2(ab + bc + ca) = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nTherefore,\n\nab + bc + ca = (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that ab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nBut indeed, C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083 =22 +20k,\n\nso 22+20k divided by 2 is 11+10k, so that's correct.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nSo now, if I can find S in terms of k, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each variable:\n\nFrom a(S -a)=C\u2081,\n\nSo,\n\nSa = a\u00b2 + C\u2081,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSb = b\u00b2 + C\u2082,\n\nSc = c\u00b2 + C\u2083,\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\nS(a +b +c) = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nBut left side is S\u00b2,\n\nRight side is (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nBut from before,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (ab + bc + ca),\n\nHence,\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 - (ab + bc + ca)] + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nWhich simplifies to,\n\n0 = - (ab + bc + ca) + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083.\n\nWait, but earlier we had ab + bc + ca = (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)/2,\n\nHmm, that contradicts unless my earlier steps were wrong. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, let me redo this.\n\nAdding the three equations:\n\nSa + Sb + Sc = a\u00b2 + C\u2081 + b\u00b2 + C\u2082 +c\u00b2 + C\u2083,\n\nLeft side: S(a +b +c)=S\u00b2,\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nBut previously, we had:\n\nFrom S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nWhich would imply that,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nWhich is exactly what this equation says. Therefore, no contradiction here. The earlier equation was correct.\n\nBut when we also had:\n\nab + bc + ca = (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)/2,\n\nWait, where did I get that?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nFrom the three equations,\n\na(S -a)=C\u2081,\n\nb(S -b)=C\u2082,\n\nc(S -c)=C\u2083,\n\nAdding all three gives,\n\nSa -a\u00b2 + Sb -b\u00b2 + Sc -c\u00b2 = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nWhich is,\n\nS(a + b +c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nBut since a +b +c = S,\n\nThis becomes,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083),\n\nYes.\n\nBut then, also, the identity,\n\n(a +b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)] + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083) + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSubtract S\u00b2,\n\n0 = - (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083) + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThus,\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083,\n\nTherefore,\n\nab + bc + ca = (C\u2081 +C\u2082 +C\u2083)/2,\n\nWhich is,\n\nab + bc + ca = (22 +20k)/2 =11 +10k,\n\nYes, that's correct. So that is consistent.\n\nTherefore, all steps are okay.\n\nHmm. So I need another equation to relate S and k.\n\nAlternatively, since k is a constant, log\u20823, perhaps I can consider the equations in terms of S and then combine with the expressions involving k.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe have:\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nAlso, from the previous equation:\n\nab +2bc -3ac =6,\n\nWhich can be written as,\n\n(ab + bc + ca) + bc -4ac =6,\n\nWhich is,\n\n(11 +10k) + (bc -4ac)=6,\n\nThus,\n\nbc -4ac =6 -11 -10k = -5 -10k,\n\nHmm, so bc -4ac = -5 -10k,\n\nFactor c from the left side:\n\nc(b -4a) = -5 -10k,\n\nSimilarly, perhaps other similar equations can be found.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find an expression for S in terms of k.\n\nLet me consider the product of all three original equations.\n\nWait, original equations were:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)}=2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)}=2^5\u00b73^10,\n\nIf I take the product of all three equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)} = (2^8\u00b73^4)(2^9\u00b73^6)(2^5\u00b73^10),\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n2^{8+9+5} *3^{4+6+10}=2^{22}\u00b73^{20}.\n\nLeft side: Let me see if I can combine the exponents.\n\nNote that x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nLet me express each term using logarithm/exponential properties.\n\nAlternatively, let me take log base 2 of both sides of the product equation:\n\nlog\u2082 [x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}] = log\u2082(2^{22}\u00b73^{20}),\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) + log\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) + log\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)}),\n\nWhich is,\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x + log\u2082(zx)*log\u2082y + log\u2082(xy)*log\u2082z,\n\nWhich, using variables a,b,c,\n\n= (b +c)a + (c +a)b + (a +b)c,\n\n= ab +ac + bc +ab + ac + bc,\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x = (log\u2082y + log\u2082z)(log\u2082x)= (b +c)a,\n\nSecond term: log\u2082(zx)*log\u2082y= (c +a)b,\n\nThird term: log\u2082(xy)*log\u2082z= (a +b)c,\n\nAdding all together:\n\na(b +c) + b(c +a) + c(a +b),\n\n= ab +ac + bc +ab + ac + bc,\n\nWait, that's:\n\nEach pair:\n\nab + ac + bc + ab + ac + bc = 2(ab + bc + ac),\n\nTherefore, the left side is 2(ab + bc + ac),\n\nThe right side is log\u2082(2^{22}\u00b73^{20}) =22 +20 log\u20823 =22 +20k.\n\nTherefore, 2(ab + bc + ac)=22 +20k,\n\nWhich is consistent with our previous result that ab + bc + ac =11 +10k.\n\nSo this doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Since variables a, b, c are related through the quadratics, perhaps we can consider that each pair of equations can be used to eliminate variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the three original equations:\n\na(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me write each variable squared term.\n\nFor example,\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me treat each quadratic equation as follows:\n\nLet me denote for variable a:\n\nEquation1: a\u00b2 - Sa + C\u2081 =0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: b\u00b2 - Sb + C\u2082 =0,\n\nEquation3: c\u00b2 - Sc + C\u2083 =0.\n\nNow, if I consider that these are three separate quadratic equations with the same S, then perhaps the variables a, b, c are such that they are roots of these equations, and their sum is S.\n\nAlternatively, think of S as a parameter and see for which S these equations have roots that sum to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the system of equations for a, b, c in terms of S and k.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the variables a, b, c as solutions to their respective quadratics, so each variable is either:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nTherefore, the three variables a, b, c are each roots of their respective quadratics. Since the sum a + b + c = S, perhaps we can set up equations where each variable is a root from its quadratic, and their sum is S.\n\nThis approach might be complicated, but let's see.\n\nSuppose that for each variable, we choose the root such that when added together, they total S.\n\nLet me consider the following: Let me denote for each variable, the two roots of their quadratic.\n\nFor variable a: roots are [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nSuppose that a is one root from its quadratic, b from its quadratic, c from its quadratic, such that a + b + c = S.\n\nThis is a system that might allow solving for S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that each variable takes the '+' root, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081)]/2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082)]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083)]/2,\n\nThen their sum would be:\n\na +b +c = [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083))]/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\n[3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083))]/2 = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083)) =2S,\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083),\n\nHmm, this equation in S may be solvable numerically, but it's quite complex. Since we need an exact answer, perhaps there is an integer value of S that works?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the discriminants are perfect squares? Let me see:\n\nLet me suppose that S is such that S\u00b2 -4C\u2081, S\u00b2 -4C\u2082, S\u00b2 -4C\u2083 are all squares.\n\nSince C\u2081=8+4k, C\u2082=9+6k, C\u2083=5+10k,\n\nLet me denote k=log\u20823, so let me compute numerical values for C\u2081, C\u2082, C\u2083:\n\nLet me compute k = log\u20823 \u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\nC\u2081=8 +4*(1.58496)\u22488+6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\nC\u2082=9 +6*(1.58496)\u22489+9.5098\u224818.5098,\n\nC\u2083=5 +10*(1.58496)\u22485+15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 -4C\u2081 \u2248S\u00b2 -57.359,\n\nS\u00b2 -4C\u2082\u2248S\u00b2 -74.039,\n\nS\u00b2 -4C\u2083\u2248S\u00b2 -83.398,\n\nSo, to have sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081), etc., be real numbers, we need S\u00b2 must be greater than 4C\u2083\u224883.398,\n\nSo S must be greater than sqrt(83.398)\u22489.13.\n\nHmm, but maybe S is an integer? Let me see.\n\nSuppose S is an integer greater than 9. Let me try S=10.\n\nCheck if sqrt(100 -4C\u2081), etc., can be rational or form an equation?\n\nLet me compute with S=10,\n\nCompute sqrt(100 -4C\u2081)=sqrt(100 -4*(8 +4k)),\n\nWait, but with k=log\u20823, which is irrational, so this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations can be solved for S by considering that the equations must hold with the variables a, b, c being real numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a substitution that can be made.\n\nLet me consider the variables a, b, c as variables and S as the sum. Let me think of the three quadratic equations:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + C\u2081 =0,\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb + C\u2082 =0,\n\nc\u00b2 - Sc + C\u2083 =0,\n\nLet me consider that these are three equations with variables a, b, c and parameter S. The sum a +b +c =S.\n\nLet me consider the product of (a)(b)(c). Maybe that can help? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the relationships between the variables.\n\nWait, from the earlier equations like (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nIf I can find expressions for (b -a), (a -c), etc., in terms of S and k, perhaps I can combine them.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables u =a -b, v =b -c, w =c -a,\n\nBut this might complicate more.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider solving for one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me try to express b from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1): (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\n=> b = (1 +2k)/c +a,\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2): (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nSubstitute b from above:\n\n(a -c)[ (1 +2k)/c +a ]=3 -6k,\n\nExpand:\n\n(a -c)*(1 +2k)/c + (a -c)a =3 -6k,\n\nLet me denote this as equation (4).\n\nThis seems very involved. Perhaps there's a smarter substitution.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the minimal xyz =2^{S}, so minimal S.\n\nThus, perhaps find S such that all equations are satisfied and S is as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations are symmetric in some way, and maybe set variables in terms of ratios.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of logarithms and exponents.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nLet me take natural logarithm on both sides,\n\nln(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = ln(2^8\u00b73^4),\n\nWhich is,\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * lnx =8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = (ln yz)/ln2,\n\nThus,\n\n(ln yz / ln2) * lnx =8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nMultiply both sides by ln2,\n\nln yz * lnx =8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln3 ln2,\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rewrite equations using exponents.\n\nLet me recall that x^{log\u2082(yz)} = (2^{log\u2082x})^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^{log\u2082x * log\u2082(yz)}.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, x^{log\u2082(yz)} = e^{ln x * log\u2082(yz)}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of base 2 logarithms.\n\nLet me denote log\u2082x =a, log\u2082y =b, log\u2082z =c as before.\n\nThus, x=2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c.\n\nThen, the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = (2^a)^{log\u2082(2^{b +c})} =2^{a*(b +c)} =2^{8}\u00b73^{4},\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSecond equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^{b*(c +a)}=2^{9}\u00b73^{6},\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} =2^{c*(a +b)}=2^{5}\u00b73^{10},\n\nAh! Wait a second! Here's a key insight. Earlier, when I converted the equations, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the original equation is x^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nBut x is a positive real number, so log\u2082(yz) is log\u2082(y) + log\u2082(z)=b +c,\n\nThus, x^{log\u2082(yz)} =x^{b +c}= (2^a)^{b +c}=2^{a(b +c)}.\n\nThus, the left side is 2^{a(b +c)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nWait, but the right side is a product of powers of 2 and 3, but the left side is only a power of 2. This suggests that my previous assumption is wrong, because the left side must equal the right side, which has factors of 3 as well. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my initial step.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake! I must have messed up the problem conversion.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nSimilarly for y and z. So, the left-hand sides are x raised to some log, but right-hand sides have both 2 and 3 as bases. Therefore, the left-hand sides must also be expressed in terms of both 2 and 3.\n\nWait, but x, y, z are positive real numbers, so their logarithms are real numbers. However, when we write x^{log\u2082(yz)}, that's an exponential function with base x, raised to a real exponent. To equate that to 2^8\u00b73^4, which is a product of powers of 2 and 3, we need to express x, y, z in terms that can combine into such products.\n\nPerhaps the variables x, y, z are of the form 2^{a}*3^{b}, so that when raised to some exponent, they can produce the required factors.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me assume that x, y, z can be written as:\n\nx =2^{p}3^{q},\n\ny =2^{r}3^{s},\n\nz =2^{t}3^{u},\n\nWhere p, q, r, s, t, u are real numbers. Then, we can express all equations in terms of exponents of 2 and 3.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFirst, compute log\u2082(yz):\n\nlog\u2082(yz)=log\u2082(y) + log\u2082(z).\n\nSince y =2^{r}3^{s}, log\u2082(y)=r + log\u2082(3^{s})=r +s log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(z)=t +u log\u20823.\n\nThus, log\u2082(yz)= [r + s log\u20823] + [t +u log\u20823] = (r +t) + (s +u) log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, x^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^{p}3^{q}]^{ (r +t) + (s +u) log\u20823 }.\n\nLet me denote log\u20823 as k for simplicity (k is a constant, k\u22481.58496).\n\nThen,\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^{p}3^{q}]^{ (r +t) + (s +u)k }.\n\nLet me separate the exponents:\n\n= 2^{p[(r + t) + (s +u)k]} * 3^{q[(r + t) + (s +u)k]}.\n\nThis must equal the right-hand side of the first equation, which is 2^8\u00b73^4.\n\nTherefore, equating the exponents for 2 and 3:\n\nFor the base 2 exponent:\n\np[(r + t) + (s +u)k] =8,\n\nFor base 3 exponent:\n\nq[(r + t) + (s +u)k] =4.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = [2^{r}3^{s}]^{ log\u2082(zx) }.\n\nCompute log\u2082(zx)= log\u2082(z) + log\u2082(x)= [t +u k] + [p + q k].\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(zx)= (t + p) + (u + q)k.\n\nThen,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^{r[(t + p) + (u + q)k]}\u00b73^{s[(t + p) + (u + q)k]} =2^9\u00b73^6.\n\nThus,\n\nr[(t + p)+(u + q)k] =9,\n\ns[(t + p)+(u + q)k]=6.\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = [2^{t}3^{u}]^{ log\u2082(xy) }.\n\nlog\u2082(xy)= log\u2082(x) + log\u2082(y)= [p + q k] + [r + s k].\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(xy)= (p +r) + (q +s)k.\n\nTherefore,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)}=2^{t[(p +r)+(q +s)k]}\u00b73^{u[(p +r)+(q +s)k]}=2^5\u00b73^{10}.\n\nThus,\n\nt[(p +r)+(q +s)k]=5,\n\nu[(p +r)+(q +s)k]=10.\n\nNow, we have six equations:\n\n1) p[(r + t) + (s +u)k] =8,\n\n2) q[(r + t) + (s +u)k] =4,\n\n3) r[(t + p)+(u + q)k] =9,\n\n4) s[(t + p)+(u + q)k]=6,\n\n5) t[(p +r)+(q +s)k]=5,\n\n6) u[(p +r)+(q +s)k]=10.\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable because we can consider variables in pairs.\n\nNotice that equations 1 and 2 involve the same term (r +t) + (s +u)k,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet me set A = (r + t),\n\nB = (s +u),\n\nC = (t + p),\n\nD = (u + q),\n\nE = (p +r),\n\nF = (q +s).\n\nThen, equations can be rewritten as:\n\n1) p(A + Bk)=8,\n\n2) q(A + Bk)=4,\n\n3) r(C + Dk)=9,\n\n4) s(C + Dk)=6,\n\n5) t(E + Fk)=5,\n\n6) u(E + Fk)=10.\n\nAdditionally, the variables A, B, C, D, E, F are:\n\nA = r + t,\n\nB = s +u,\n\nC = t + p,\n\nD = u + q,\n\nE = p + r,\n\nF = q + s.\n\nHmm, let me see if these can be expressed in terms of the variables.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider equations 1 and 2. Let me divide equation1 by equation2:\n\n(p(A + Bk)) / (q(A + Bk)) )=8/4=2,\n\nThus,\n\np/q =2,\n\nTherefore, p=2q.\n\nSimilarly, equations3 and4:\n\nDivide equation3 by equation4:\n\n(r(C + Dk))/(s(C + Dk)) )=9/6=3/2,\n\nThus,\n\nr/s=3/2,\n\nSo, r=(3/2)s.\n\nEquations5 and6:\n\nDivide equation5 by equation6:\n\n(t(E + Fk))/(u(E + Fk)) )=5/10=1/2,\n\nThus,\n\nt/u=1/2,\n\nHence, t=(1/2)u.\n\nSo now, we have relationships between variables:\n\np =2q,\n\nr=(3/2)s,\n\nt=(1/2)u.\n\nNow, let's express variables in terms of q, s, u.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet me let q be a variable,\n\nthen p=2q,\n\nSimilarly, let s be another variable,\n\nthen r=(3/2)s,\n\nand let u be another variable,\n\nthen t=(1/2)u.\n\nThus, we can write all variables in terms of q, s, u.\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the other equations.\n\nFirst, equations1 and2 can be written using p=2q:\n\nEquation1: 2q*(A + Bk)=8,\n\nEquation2: q*(A + Bk)=4,\n\nWhich is consistent, since 2q*(...) =2*(q*(...))=2*4=8,\n\nSo equation1 is redundant given equation2 and p=2q.\n\nSimilarly, equations3 and4:\n\nEquation3: r*(C + Dk)= (3/2)s*(C + Dk)=9,\n\nEquation4: s*(C + Dk)=6,\n\nTherefore, equation3 is (3/2)*equation4,\n\nWhich holds because (3/2)*6=9,\n\nSo equation3 is redundant given equation4 and r=(3/2)s.\n\nSimilarly, equations5 and6:\n\nEquation5: t*(E + Fk)= (1/2)u*(E + Fk)=5,\n\nEquation6: u*(E + Fk)=10,\n\nThus, equation5 is (1/2)*equation6,\n\nWhich holds since (1/2)*10=5,\n\nThus, equation5 is redundant given equation6 and t=(1/2)u.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are equations2,4,6:\n\nEquation2: q*(A + Bk)=4,\n\nEquation4: s*(C + Dk)=6,\n\nEquation6: u*(E + Fk)=10,\n\nWhere A,B,C,D,E,F are expressions in terms of variables p, r, t, s, u, q.\n\nBut since we have expressed variables in terms of q, s, u, let's substitute those expressions into A,B,C,D,E,F.\n\nRecall that:\n\nA = r + t,\n\nBut r=(3/2)s, and t=(1/2)u,\n\nThus, A = (3/2)s + (1/2)u,\n\nB = s + u,\n\nC = t + p,\n\nt=(1/2)u, p=2q,\n\nThus, C=(1/2)u +2q,\n\nD = u + q,\n\nE = p + r,\n\np=2q, r=(3/2)s,\n\nThus, E=2q + (3/2)s,\n\nF = q + s.\n\nNow, substituting into equations2,4,6:\n\nEquation2:\n\nq*(A + Bk)=4,\n\nSubstitute A and B:\n\nq*[ (3/2 s +1/2 u) + (s +u)k ] =4,\n\nEquation4:\n\ns*(C + Dk)=6,\n\nSubstitute C and D:\n\ns*[ (1/2 u +2q) + (u + q)k ] =6,\n\nEquation6:\n\nu*(E + Fk)=10,\n\nSubstitute E and F:\n\nu*[ (2q + (3/2)s) + (q + s)k ] =10.\n\nNow, we have three equations with three variables q, s, u.\n\nLet me denote variables as x=q, y=s, z=u for simplicity.\n\nLet me rewrite equations:\n\nEquation2:\n\nx * [ (3/2 y + 1/2 z) + (y + z)k ] =4,\n\nEquation4:\n\ny * [ (1/2 z + 2x) + (z +x)k ] =6,\n\nEquation6:\n\nz * [ (2x + 3/2 y) + (x + y)k ] =10,\n\nWhere k=log\u20823.\n\nThis system of equations might be solvable numerically, but perhaps there is an elegant solution.\n\nLet me see if we can make substitutions to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me first expand each equation:\n\nEquation2:\n\nx*( (3/2)y + (1/2)z + yk + zk ) =4,\n\nEquation4:\n\ny*( (1/2)z +2x + zk +xk )=6,\n\nEquation6:\n\nz*(2x + (3/2)y +xk + yk )=10,\n\nLet me rewrite them:\n\nEquation2:\n\nx*( (3/2 +k)y + (1/2 +k)z ) =4,\n\nEquation4:\n\ny*( (2 +k)x + (1/2 +k)z ) =6,\n\nEquation6:\n\nz*( (2 +k)x + (3/2 +k)y ) =10,\n\nThis is a linear system in variables x, y, z multiplied by coefficients involving k.\n\nLet me denote variables as x, y, z and coefficients involving k.\n\nLet me rewrite the equations in terms of coefficients:\n\nLet me define coefficients:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor Equation2:\n\nCoefficient of y: (3/2 +k) *x,\n\nCoefficient of z: (1/2 +k)*x,\n\nEquation2: [ (3/2 +k)x ] y + [ (1/2 +k)x ] z =4,\n\nSimilarly, Equation4:\n\nCoefficient of x: (2 +k)y,\n\nCoefficient of z: (1/2 +k)y,\n\nEquation4: [ (2 +k)y ]x + [ (1/2 +k)y ] z =6,\n\nEquation6:\n\nCoefficient of x: (2 +k)z,\n\nCoefficient of y: (3/2 +k)z,\n\nEquation6: [ (2 +k)z ]x + [ (3/2 +k)z ] y =10,\n\nSo the system is:\n\n1) ( (3/2 +k)x )y + ( (1/2 +k)x ) z =4,\n\n2) ( (2 +k)y )x + ( (1/2 +k)y ) z =6,\n\n3) ( (2 +k)z )x + ( (3/2 +k)z ) y =10.\n\nThis is a system of three equations with variables x, y, z. Let me see if we can find a solution by assuming some proportionalities or ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that x, y, z are proportional to certain constants.\n\nSuppose that there exists a constant \u03bb such that:\n\nx = \u03bb * a,\n\ny = \u03bb * b,\n\nz = \u03bb * c,\n\nfor some constants a, b, c. Then substituting into Equations:\n\nEquation1:\n\n( (3/2 +k)(\u03bb a) ) (\u03bb b) + ( (1/2 +k)(\u03bb a) )(\u03bb c ) =4,\n\n=> \u03bb\u00b2 [ (3/2 +k)ab + (1/2 +k)ac ] =4,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut this might not lead us anywhere unless we know the ratios a,b,c.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the variables x, y, z are proportional such that:\n\nLet me consider the ratios between equations. Perhaps divide equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me divide Equation2 by Equation4:\n\n[ ( (3/2 +k)x y + (1/2 +k)x z ) ] / [ ( (2 +k)y x + (1/2 +k)y z ) ] =4/6=2/3,\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: x y (3/2 +k) +x z (1/2 +k),\n\nDenominator: y x (2 +k) + y z (1/2 +k),\n\nFactor x y from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: x y [ (3/2 +k) + (z/y)(1/2 +k) ],\n\nDenominator: y x [ (2 +k) + (z/y)(1/2 +k) ],\n\nThus, the ratio becomes:\n\n[ (3/2 +k) + (z/y)(1/2 +k) ] / [ (2 +k) + (z/y)(1/2 +k) ] =2/3,\n\nLet me set m = z/y,\n\nThen,\n\n[ (3/2 +k) + m(1/2 +k) ] / [ (2 +k) + m(1/2 +k) ] =2/3,\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n3[(3/2 +k) + m(1/2 +k)] =2[ (2 +k) + m(1/2 +k) ],\n\nExpand:\n\n3*(3/2 +k) +3m*(1/2 +k) = 2*(2 +k) +2m*(1/2 +k),\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side:\n\n3*(3/2) +3k + (3m)*(1/2) +3m k = 9/2 +3k + (3m/2) +3mk,\n\nRight side:\n\n2*(2) +2k + (2m)*(1/2) +2m k =4 +2k +m +2mk,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n9/2 +3k + (3m/2) +3mk -4 -2k -m -2mk=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n(9/2 -4) + (3k -2k) + (3m/2 -m) + (3mk -2mk)=0,\n\nCompute each:\n\n9/2 -4= (9/2 -8/2)=1/2,\n\n3k -2k =k,\n\n3m/2 -m = (3m/2 -2m/2)=m/2,\n\n3mk -2mk=mk,\n\nSo overall:\n\n1/2 +k + (m/2) +mk =0,\n\nThus,\n\nk + mk + m/2 +1/2=0,\n\nFactor terms with m:\n\nm(k +1/2) +k +1/2=0,\n\nFactor (k +1/2):\n\n(m +1)(k +1/2)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nEither (k +1/2)=0 or (m +1)=0,\n\nBut k=log\u20823 \u22481.58496, so k +1/2\u22482.08496\u22600,\n\nThus, m +1=0,\n\nm= -1,\n\nTherefore,\n\nm=z/y =-1 => z =-y,\n\nBut variables x, y, z correspond to exponents in logarithms, which can be negative, but the original variables x,y,z are positive real numbers, so their exponents can be any real numbers, but getting z = -y may be problematic.\n\nWait, z = -y would imply that in our substitution variables, z = -y, but z and y are real numbers, so that's possible. However, we need to check whether this leads to a valid solution.\n\nLet me proceed with m = -1, so z = -y.\n\nNow, substitute z = -y into other equations.\n\nLet me first note that.\n\nLet me set z = -y.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation4:\n\nEquation4: y*( (2 +k)x + (1/2 +k)z )=6,\n\nSubstitute z =-y:\n\ny*[ (2 +k)x + (1/2 +k)(-y) ] =6,\n\n=> y*( (2 +k)x - (1/2 +k)y ) =6,\n\nEquation2: Let's also rewrite Equation2 with z =-y,\n\nEquation2: ( (3/2 +k)x )y + ( (1/2 +k)x )*(-y) =4,\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ (3/2 +k) - (1/2 +k) ]x y =4,\n\nCompute coefficient:\n\n3/2 +k -1/2 -k = (3/2 -1/2)=1,\n\nThus,\n\n1*x y =4,\n\nThus, x y =4.\n\nThat's a helpful simplification.\n\nThus, Equation2 gives x y =4.\n\nNow, back to Equation4:\n\ny*( (2 +k)x - (1/2 +k)y )=6,\n\nWe can express x from Equation2: x =4/(y).\n\nSubstitute x=4/y into Equation4:\n\ny*[ (2 +k)(4/y) - (1/2 +k)y ] =6,\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n(2 +k)*4/y - (1/2 +k)y,\n\nSo,\n\ny*[ (4(2 +k))/y - (1/2 +k)y ] =6,\n\nMultiply through:\n\n4(2 +k) - (1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =6,\n\nThus,\n\n(1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =4(2 +k) -6,\n\nCompute 4(2 +k) -6 =8 +4k -6 =2 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\n(1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =2 +4k,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny\u00b2 = (2 +4k)/(1/2 +k),\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fraction:\n\ny\u00b2 = (4 +8k)/(1 +2k),\n\nThus,\n\ny = sqrt( (4 +8k)/(1 +2k) ),\n\nSince y is a real number, the expression under the sqrt must be positive, which it is.\n\nNow, let's compute Equation6 with z = -y and x =4/y.\n\nEquation6:\n\nz*( (2 +k)x + (3/2 +k)y )=10,\n\nSubstitute z =-y, x=4/y:\n\n-y*[ (2 +k)(4/y) + (3/2 +k)y ] =10,\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n(2 +k)*4/y + (3/2 +k)y,\n\nThus,\n\n-y[ 4(2 +k)/y + (3/2 +k)y ] =10,\n\nMultiply through:\n\n- [4(2 +k) + (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 ] =10,\n\nThus,\n\n-4(2 +k) - (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =10,\n\nMove terms:\n\n- (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =10 +4(2 +k),\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n10 +8 +4k =18 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\n(3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =-18 -4k,\n\nBut the left side (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 is a product of (3/2 + log\u20823) and y squared. Since log\u20823 is positive, 3/2 +k is positive, and y squared is positive. Thus, the left side is positive, but the right side is negative (-18 -4k). This is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that our assumption m = -1 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the steps.\n\nWait, let's check the steps again.\n\nWe had:\n\nAfter cross-multiplying:\n\n3[(3/2 +k) + m(1/2 +k)] =2[ (2 +k) + m(1/2 +k) ],\n\nThen expanding:\n\nLeft side:\n\n3*(3/2 +k) +3m*(1/2 +k),\n\nRight side:\n\n2*(2 +k) +2m*(1/2 +k),\n\nThen moving all terms to left:\n\n3*(3/2 +k) +3m*(1/2 +k) -2*(2 +k) -2m*(1/2 +k)=0,\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n3*(3/2) =9/2,\n\n3*k =3k,\n\n3m*(1/2)= (3/2)m,\n\n3m*k =3mk,\n\n-2*(2)= -4,\n\n-2*k =-2k,\n\n-2m*(1/2)= -m,\n\n-2m*k= -2mk,\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n9/2 +3k + (3/2)m +3mk -4 -2k -m -2mk,\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nConstants:9/2 -4=1/2,\n\nk terms:3k-2k=k,\n\nm terms: (3/2 m -m)= (1/2)m,\n\nmk terms:3mk-2mk=mk,\n\nThus total:\n\n1/2 +k + (1/2)m +mk =0,\n\nWhich gives:\n\nk + mk + (1/2)m +1/2 =0,\n\nFactor terms with m:\n\nm(k +1/2) +k +1/2=0,\n\nThus,\n\n(m +1)(k +1/2)=0,\n\nWhich is the same result. Since k +1/2 isn't zero, we have m =-1.\n\nHmm, but that led to a contradiction. Perhaps there's an error in the problem setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting variables?\n\nWait, perhaps in Equation6 substitution:\n\nLet me re-derive Equation6 with z =-y and x=4/y.\n\nEquation6:\n\nz*( (2 +k)x + (3/2 +k)y )=10,\n\nSubstituting:\n\nz =-y,\n\nx =4/y,\n\nThus,\n\n-y*( (2 +k)*(4/y) + (3/2 +k)y ) =10,\n\nSo,\n\n-y*( [4(2 +k)/y] + (3/2 +k)y ) =10,\n\nMultiply inside terms:\n\n= -y*(4(2 +k)/y + (3/2 +k)y) \n\n= -y*(4(2 +k)/y) - y*( (3/2 +k)y )\n\n= -4(2 +k) - (3/2 +k)y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n-4(2 +k) - (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =10,\n\nThen moving terms:\n\n-(3/2 +k)y\u00b2 = 10 +4(2 +k),\n\nWhich is,\n\n(3/2 +k)y\u00b2= -10 -8 -4k = -18 -4k,\n\nAs before.\n\nSince the left side is positive and the right side is negative, this is impossible. So this suggests that with m =-1, there is no solution. Hence, our assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, but the equations led us to m =-1, which contradicts the system. This implies that there might be no solution unless we've made an error in the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an error in the assumption that variables can be expressed as multiples of 2 and 3. Alternatively, maybe the initial substitution is incorrect.\n\nWait a second, when I assumed variables can be written as x=2^a 3^b, that's valid because any positive real number can be expressed in terms of prime factors. So that part is okay.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when we set z = -y, we get a contradiction, but perhaps there is another solution?\n\nLooking back at the step where we had (m +1)(k +1/2)=0,\n\nSince k +1/2 \u22600, so m must be -1. So that is the only solution.\n\nBut that leads to a contradiction, which suggests that the system of equations has no solution unless we made a mistake.\n\nHmm, but the problem states that x,y,z are positive real numbers satisfying those equations, so there must be a solution.\n\nPerhaps I made an error in the substitution steps.\n\nLet me check the expansion of Equation2 again:\n\nOriginal Equation2 after substitution:\n\nEquation2: [ (3/2 +k)x y + (1/2 +k)x z ] =4,\n\nWith z =-y,\n\nEquation2 becomes:\n\n(3/2 +k)x y + (1/2 +k)x*(-y) =4,\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ (3/2 +k) - (1/2 +k) ]x y =4,\n\nThe coefficient:\n\n3/2 +k -1/2 -k = (3/2 -1/2)=1,\n\nTherefore, x y =4,\n\nThat's correct.\n\nEquation4:\n\ny*( (2 +k)x + (1/2 +k) z ) =6,\n\nWith z =-y and x=4/y,\n\n= y*( (2 +k)(4/y) + (1/2 +k)(-y) ) =6,\n\n= y*(4(2 +k)/y - (1/2 +k)y )\n\n=4(2 +k) - (1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =6,\n\nThus,\n\n- (1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =6 -4(2 +k),\n\n=6 -8 -4k = -2 -4k,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(1/2 +k)y\u00b2 =2 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2= (2 +4k)/(1/2 +k),\n\nSame as before.\n\nProceeding to Equation6:\n\nz= -y,\n\nx=4/y,\n\nEquation6:\n\nz*( (2 +k)x + (3/2 +k)y )=10,\n\nSubstituting,\n\n- y*( (2 +k)(4/y) + (3/2 +k)y ) =10,\n\n= -y*( 4(2 +k)/y + (3/2 +k)y )\n\n= - [4(2 +k) + (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 ] =10,\n\nThus,\n\n-4(2 +k) - (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =10,\n\nRearranged,\n\n- (3/2 +k)y\u00b2 =10 +4(2 +k),\n\n=10 +8 +4k,\n\n=18 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\n(3/2 +k)y\u00b2 = -18 -4k,\n\nThis is impossible because LHS is positive and RHS is negative.\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake?\n\nPerhaps in the initial assumption of variables?\n\nWait, when we set variables as x=2^p 3^q etc., perhaps the way we expressed the logarithms was incorrect?\n\nWait, let me recheck the first equation:\n\nOriginal first equation: x^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nWe wrote log\u2082(yz)=log\u2082y + log\u2082z =b +c,\n\nThen, x^{b +c}=2^{8}3^{4},\n\nBut x=2^p3^q,\n\nThus, (2^p3^q)^{b+c}=2^{p(b+c)}3^{q(b+c)}=2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nTherefore, equate exponents:\n\np(b+c)=8,\n\nq(b+c)=4,\n\nWhich gives p/q=2, so p=2q,\n\nSame as before.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nlog\u2082(zx)=log\u2082z + log\u2082x= c +p +qk ?\n\nWait, wait a second, this is where I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, log\u2082(zx) is log\u2082z + log\u2082x,\n\nBut earlier, I think I considered log\u2082x = p + q*log\u20823?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, if x=2^p3^q,\n\nthen log\u2082x = log\u2082(2^p3^q)= p + log\u2082(3^q)= p + q*log\u20823,\n\nYes, so log\u2082x = p + qk,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082y =r + s k,\n\nlog\u2082z =t +u k,\n\nThus, log\u2082(yz)= log\u2082y + log\u2082z= (r + s k)+(t +u k)= (r+t) + (s +u)k,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(zx)= log\u2082z + log\u2082x= (t +u k)+(p + qk)= (t +p) + (u +q)k,\n\nlog\u2082(xy)= log\u2082x + log\u2082y= (p + qk)+(r + sk)= (p +r)+(q +s)k,\n\nThus, the previous expressions were correct.\n\nTherefore, the earlier steps are correct.\n\nHmm, the problem is that when we set m =-1, we get inconsistency in Equation6, but the problem states that solutions exist. Therefore, perhaps there is another solution path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the variables can be expressed as x=2^p3^q etc. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an algebraic mistake in the equations.\n\nLet me try to consider another approach.\n\nWe have from the first pair of equations that p=2q,\n\nSecond pair gives r= (3/2)s,\n\nThird pair gives t=(1/2)u.\n\nWe also have from Equation2: x y =4,\n\nwhere x=p and y=q? No, wait variables were renamed.\n\nWait, in the substitution step earlier, I set variables as x=q, y=s, z=u,\n\nSo the variables are:\n\nx=q,\n\ny=s,\n\nz=u,\n\nSo the equations are in terms of q, s, u.\n\nWe had m=z/y = u/s =-1,\n\nThus, u =-s,\n\nTherefore, z=u =-s,\n\nThus, with that,\n\nNow, let's try to see if this can be possible.\n\nLet me set u=-s,\n\nThen, we can express all variables in terms of q and s:\n\np=2q,\n\nr=(3/2)s,\n\nt=(1/2)u= (1/2)(-s)= -s/2.\n\nNow, let me substitute into the other equations.\n\nWe have from Equation2:\n\nq*y*(...)=4, but y was s,\n\nWait, Equation2:\n\nEquation2 in the substituted form was q*( (3/2 +k)x + (1/2 +k)z ) =4,\n\nWait, with variables renamed as x=q, y=s, z=u,\n\nWait, going back, the variables in the substituted equations were:\n\nEquation2 became:\n\nq*( (3/2 +k)* (r + t) + (1/2 +k)*(s + u) ) ? Wait, no.\n\nWait, sorry, the variables in equations were expressed in terms of q, s, u.\n\nWait, perhaps better to backtrack.\n\nLet me consider that we have:\n\nFrom previous steps, with u =-s,\n\nAnd variables:\n\np =2q,\n\nr=(3/2)s,\n\nt= -s/2,\n\nu =-s,\n\nThus, now, let's express all variables:\n\nx=2^p3^q =2^{2q}3^q,\n\ny=2^r3^s=2^{(3/2)s}3^s,\n\nz=2^t3^u=2^{-s/2}3^{-s},\n\nNow, compute the first original equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nCompute log\u2082(yz):\n\nlog\u2082(yz)=log\u2082y + log\u2082z,\n\nlog\u2082y= r + sk= (3/2)s +s k,\n\nlog\u2082z= t + u k= (-s/2) + (-s)k,\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(yz)= [(3/2)s +s k] + [ -s/2 -s k ] = (3/2 -1/2)s + (s k -s k)= s,\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(yz)=s,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =x^s = (2^{2q}3^q)^s=2^{2q s}3^{qs},\n\nSet equal to 2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nThus,\n\n2^{2q s}3^{q s}=2^8\u00b73^4,\n\nTherefore,\n\n2q s =8,\n\nand,\n\nq s =4,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom first equation:2qs=8 => qs=4,\n\nSecond equation gives same: q s=4,\n\nThus, this holds.\n\nSecond original equation:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nCompute log\u2082(zx)=log\u2082z + log\u2082x,\n\nlog\u2082z= t +uk= -s/2 + (-s)k,\n\nlog\u2082x= p +qk=2q + qk,\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(zx)= (-s/2 -s k) + (2q + qk)=2q + qk - (s/2 +s k),\n\nThus,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)}=y^{ [2q + qk - (s/2 +s k)] }.\n\nBut y=2^{(3/2)s}3^s,\n\nThus,\n\ny^{exp}=2^{(3/2)s * exp}3^{s * exp},\n\nWhere exp=2q + qk - (s/2 +s k),\n\nThus,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)}=2^{ (3/2)s exp }3^{ s exp }=2^9\u00b73^6,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(3/2)s exp =9,\n\nand,\n\ns exp =6,\n\nThus,\n\ns exp=6,\n\nMultiply by 3/2: (3/2)s exp=9, which matches,\n\nThus, the equations are consistent.\n\nThus, we have s exp=6,\n\nBut exp=2q + qk - (s/2 +s k)=2q +qk -s/2 -s k,\n\nThus,\n\ns*(2q +qk -s/2 -s k)=6,\n\nWe also know from before that q s=4,\n\nThus, q=4/s,\n\nSubstitute q=4/s into the equation:\n\ns*( 2*(4/s) + (4/s)k -s/2 -s k )=6,\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n2*(4/s)=8/s,\n\n(4/s)k=4k/s,\n\n-s/2,\n\n-s k,\n\nThus,\n\ns*(8/s +4k/s -s/2 -s k)=6,\n\nMultiply through:\n\n8 +4k - (s\u00b2)/2 -s\u00b2k =6,\n\nThus,\n\n- (s\u00b2)/2 -s\u00b2k +8 +4k =6,\n\nBring constants to right:\n\n- s\u00b2(1/2 +k) =6 -8 -4k,\n\n=> -s\u00b2(1/2 +k)= -2 -4k,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ns\u00b2(1/2 +k)=2 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2= (2 +4k)/(1/2 +k),\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nThus,\n\ns= sqrt( (2 +4k)/(1/2 +k) ),\n\nSince s is a real exponent, it can be positive or negative, but since y=2^{(3/2)s}3^s must be positive, s can be any real number.\n\nProceeding to the third equation,\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)}=2^5\u00b73^{10},\n\nCompute log\u2082(xy)=log\u2082x + log\u2082y,\n\nlog\u2082x= p +qk=2q +qk,\n\nlog\u2082y= r +s k=(3/2)s +s k,\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(xy)=2q +qk + (3/2)s +s k,\n\nThus,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)}=z^{ [2q +qk + (3/2)s +s k] }.\n\nBut z=2^{-s/2}3^{-s},\n\nThus,\n\nz^{exp}=2^{ -s/2 * exp }3^{ -s * exp }=2^5\u00b73^{10},\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (s/2) exp =5,\n\nand,\n\n-s exp=10,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom the second equation: -s exp=10 => exp= -10/s,\n\nSubstituting into first equation:\n\n- (s/2)(-10/s)=5,\n\n=> (10/2)=5,\n\nWhich holds.\n\nThus, the third equation is consistent provided that exp= -10/s,\n\nBut we also have from the second equation's calculation:\n\nexp=2q +qk - (s/2 +s k),\n\nBut exp must also equal -10/s,\n\nThus,\n\n2q + qk - (s/2 +s k)= -10/s,\n\nSubstitute q=4/s,\n\n2*(4/s) + (4/s)k - (s/2 +s k)= -10/s,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n8/s +4k/s -s/2 -s k,\n\nThus,\n\n(8 +4k)/s -s/2 -s k =-10/s,\n\nMultiply all terms by 2s to eliminate denominators:\n\n(16 +8k) -s\u00b2 -2s\u00b2k =-20,\n\nRearrange:\n\n- s\u00b2(1 +2k) +16 +8k +20=0,\n\nWait,\n\nWait let's do step by step:\n\nMultiply all terms by 2s:\n\n2s*(8/s) =16,\n\n2s*(4k/s)=8k,\n\n2s*(-s/2)= -s\u00b2,\n\n2s*(-s k)= -2s\u00b2k,\n\n2s*(-10/s)= -20,\n\nThus,\n\n16 +8k -s\u00b2 -2s\u00b2k -20 =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n(16-20) +8k -s\u00b2(1 +2k)=0,\n\n=> -4 +8k -s\u00b2(1 +2k)=0,\n\n=> s\u00b2(1 +2k)=8k -4,\n\nBut we know from earlier that s\u00b2=(2 +4k)/(1/2 +k),\n\nLet me compute s\u00b2*(1 +2k):\n\ns\u00b2*(1 +2k)= (2 +4k)/(1/2 +k) * (1 +2k),\n\nLet me compute denominator (1/2 +k)= (1 +2k)/2,\n\nThus,\n\n(2 +4k) / [(1 +2k)/2] * (1 +2k)= (2 +4k)*2/(1 +2k) * (1 +2k)= 2*(2 +4k)=4 +8k,\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2*(1 +2k)=4 +8k,\n\nThus,\n\n4+8k=8k -4,\n\n=>4+8k=8k-4,\n\nSubtract 8k both sides:\n\n4= -4,\n\nWhich is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this is impossible.\n\nHmm, this is a contradiction.

Hence, my approach must be flawed.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me try to consider that xyz is minimal, so perhaps variables are chosen such that the equations are satisfied with the smallest S=a+b+c.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the original three equations in terms of logarithms.\n\nLet me take the logarithm of each equation.\n\nTake logarithm base 2 of the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2^8\u00b73^4),\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) \u00b7 log\u2082x =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog\u2082(zx) \u00b7 log\u2082y=9 +6 log\u20823,\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(xy) \u00b7 log\u2082z=5 +10 log\u20823,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set a=log\u2082x, b=log\u2082y, c=log\u2082z,\n\nLet k=log\u20823,\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n(b +c)a =8 +4k,\n\n(c +a)b=9 +6k,\n\n(a +b)c=5 +10k,\n\nWe need to find the minimal S=a +b +c.\n\nThis system of equations is the same as earlier.\n\nLet me consider that if I can find a, b, c in terms of S.\n\nLet me denote S=a +b +c,\n\nLet me also denote P=ab + bc + ca,\n\nQ=abc,\n\nWe already know that P=11+10k,\n\nAnd we have the three equations:\n\na(b +c)=8+4k,\n\nb(c +a)=9+6k,\n\nc(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nThese can be rewritten as:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider that each variable is a root of a quadratic equation:\n\nFor a: x\u00b2 -Sx + (8+4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThe roots are:\n\nFor a: [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe product of roots for each quadratic is the constant term,\n\nThus,\n\na*(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nSince a, b, c are roots of their respective quadratics,\n\nand S =a +b +c,\n\nWe need that the sum of the roots of the three quadratics equals S.\n\nBut each quadratic has two roots, so each variable is one root from each quadratic.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the variables are chosen such that for each quadratic, we pick one root such that their sum is S.\n\nThis is a system that may be solved by assuming that the three quadratics have a common root or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that a, b, c are the smaller roots of each quadratic:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -32 -16k)]/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -36 -24k)]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -20 -40k)]/2,\n\nThen,\n\na +b +c = S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -32 -16k)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -36 -24k)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -20 -40k))/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -32 -16k)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -36 -24k)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -20 -40k)=S,\n\nThis equation in S must be solved,\n\nBut this seems highly non-linear and difficult to solve analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the terms under the square roots are perfect squares.\n\nSuppose that S\u00b2 -32 -16k = (S - a)^2,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, pick a value for S and see if the equation holds.\n\nLet me try to suppose that S is such that the terms under the square roots are squares.\n\nLet me assume that:\n\nS\u00b2 -32 -16k = (S - m)^2,\n\n=> S\u00b2 -32 -16k = S\u00b2 -2mS +m\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n-32 -16k =-2mS +m\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly for others,\n\nBut this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choose S so that S\u00b2 -4C\u2081, S\u00b2 -4C\u2082, S\u00b2 -4C\u2083 are squares.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet m\u00b2 =S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k),\n\nn\u00b2=S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k),\n\np\u00b2=S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k),\n\nThen,\n\nm\u00b2 -n\u00b2= -4*(1 +2k),\n\nn\u00b2 -p\u00b2=4*(1 +4k),\n\nAnd,\n\nm\u00b2 -p\u00b2= -4*(3 +24k),\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for S such that the three quadratics have a common solution.\n\nSuppose that a = b,\n\nThen,\n\nFrom the first equation: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nSecond equation: a(S -a)=9+6k,\n\nWhich would require 8+4k=9+6k \u21d2-1=2k \u21d2k=-0.5,\n\nWhich contradicts k=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nThus, a\u2260b.\n\nSimilarly, other variables are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe find S such that the three equations can be satisfied.\n\nLet me consider that the three equations are:\n\na(S -a)=C\u2081,\n\nb(S -b)=C\u2082,\n\nc(S -c)=C\u2083,\n\nLet me consider that the variables a, b, c are the roots of their respective quadratics, and S is the sum.\n\nLet me consider that the three variables a, b, c are in some proportion.\n\nSuppose that a = 2q, b = 3/2 s, t =1/2 u,\n\nWait, this is similar to earlier substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to assume that the equations have a solution where the variables are proportional to the coefficients of the constants.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the three equations:\n\nLet me write them as:\n\na(S -a) =8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider these as three equations in variables a, b, c, with S as a parameter.\n\nLet me suppose that S is a constant, and try to find a solution.\n\nLet me consider the first equation:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe sum a +b +c=S,\n\nThus,\n\nsum over the roots:\n\nsum_{a,b,c} [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C)]/2 =S,\n\nThus,\n\n[S + sqrt(S\u00b2-4C\u2081)]/2 + [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2-4C\u2082)]/2 + [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2-4C\u2083)]/2 =S,\n\nBut the signs are such that the sum equals S.\n\nThis is quite complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that S is an integer and k is log\u20823, so approximate k\u22481.58496,\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\nC\u2081=8+4k\u22488+6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\nC\u2082=9+6k\u22489+9.5098\u224818.5098,\n\nC\u2083=5+10k\u22485+15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nThus,\n\nThe terms under the square roots for the

greater than sqrt(83.398)\u22489.13,\n\nLet me try S=10,\n\nThen,\n\nFor a: sqrt(100 -57.359)=sqrt(42.641\u22486.53,\n\nThus, roots: (10\u00b16.53)/2,\n\na=(10+6.53)/2\u22488.265 or

c=2.963,\n\nSum\u224813.68,\n\nStill over.\n\nTo reach 10:\n\nMaybe a=1.735, b=2.452, c=5.813,\n\nWait, but c can only be the roots of its quadratic, which are\u22487.037 or2.963,\n\nThus, impossible.\n\nThus, S=10 is too small.\n\nTry S=12,\n\nCompute:\n\nFor a: sqrt(144-57.359)=sqrt(86.641\u22489.308,\n\nRoots: (12\u00b19.308)/2\u224810.654 or1.346,\n\nFor b:

precise.\n\nPerhaps S=13,\n\nBut this is getting too trial and error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is 12,\n\nGiven the approximate values,\n\nBut this is not helpful for an exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is 12,\n\nThen xyz=2^{12}=4096,\n\nBut need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require us to treat k as a variable and find S in terms of k.\n\nFrom earlier steps,\n\nWe have three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nAnd we also have,\n\nab + bc + ca=11+10k,\n\nLet me consider these equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\na\u00b2 -Sa +8+4k=0,\n\nb\u00b2 -Sb +9+6k=0,\n\nc\u00b2 -Sc +5+10k=0,\n\nLet me consider that these three quadratics must have roots a, b, c such that their sum is S.\n\nLet me consider the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c:\n\nx\u00b3 -Sx\u00b2 + (ab+bc+ca)x -abc=0,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b3 -Sx\u00b2 + (11+10k)x -abc=0,\n\nThe three quadratics must be factors of this cubic equation.\n\nLet me see if the cubic can be expressed as:\n\n(x\u00b2 -Sx + C\u2081)(x -d)=x\u00b3 -Sx\u00b2 +C\u2081x -d x\u00b2 +Sd x -C\u2081d,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b3 - (S +d)x\u00b2 + (C\u2081 +Sd)x -C\u2081d,\n\nThis must equal x\u00b3 -Sx\u00b2 + (11+10k)x -abc,\n\nThus,\n\nEquating coefficients,\n\n- (S +d)= -S \u21d2d=0,\n\nBut then,\n\n(C\u2081 +Sd)=C\u2081 =11+10k,\n\nBut C\u2081=8+4k,\n\nThus,\n\n8+4k=11+10k \u21d2-3=6k \u21d2k= -0.5,\n\nBut k=log\u20823>0,\n\nContradiction,\n\nThus, the quadratics are not factors of the cubic.\n\nThus, this approach may not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the three quadratic equations and the sum S to find a relationship.\n\nLet me consider the three quadratic equations:\n\na\u00b2 -Sa + C\u2081=0,\n\nb\u00b2 -Sb + C\u2082=0,\n\nc\u00b2 -Sc + C\u2083=0,\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(b\u00b2 -Sb +C\u2082) - (a\u00b2 -Sa +C\u2081)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -S(b -a) + (C\u2082 -C\u2081)=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n(b -a)(b +a -S) + (C\u2082 -C\u2081)=0,\n\nBut S =a +b +c,\n\nThus,\n\nb +a -S = -c,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a)(-c) + (C\u2082 -C\u2081)=0,\n\nWhich gives,\n\n- c(b -a) + (C\u2082 -C\u2081)=0,\n\n=> c(a -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2081,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom first and third equations:\n\na\u00b2 -Sa +C\u2081 - (c\u00b2 -Sc +C\u2083)=0,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 -c\u00b2 -S(a -c) + (C\u2081 -C\u2083)=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n(a -c)(a +c -S) + (C\u2081 -C\u2083)=0,\n\nAgain, a +c -S = -b,\n\nThus,\n\n(a -c)(-b) + (C\u2081 -C\u2083)=0,\n\n=> -b(a -c) + (C\u2081 -C\u2083)=0,\n\n=> b(c -a)=C\u2081 -C\u2083,\n\nSimilarly, subtract second and third equations:\n\nb\u00b2 -Sb +C\u2082 - (c\u00b2 -Sc +C\u2083)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 -c\u00b2 -S(b -c) + (C\u2082 -C\u2083)=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n(b -c)(b +c -S) + (C\u2082 -C\u2083)=0,\n\nb +c -S = -a,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -c)(-a) + (C\u2082 -C\u2083)=0,\n\n=> -a(b -c) + (C\u2082 -C\u2083)=0,\n\n=> a(c -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2083,\n\nNow, we have three new equations:\n\n1) c(a -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2081,\n\n2) b(c -a)=C\u2081 -C\u2083,\n\n3) a(c -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2083,\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n1) c(a -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2081,\n\n2) b(c -a)=C\u2081 -C\u2083,\n\n3) a(c -b)=C\u2082 -C\u2083,\n\nLet me substitute the values of C\u2081, C\u2082, C\u2083:\n\nC\u2081=8+4k,\n\nC\u2082=9+6k,\n\nC\u2083=5+10k,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation1:\n\nc(a -b)= (9+6k)-(8+4k)=1+2k,\n\nEquation2:\n\nb(c -a)= (8+4k)-(5+10k)=3-6k,\n\nEquation3:\n\na(c -b)= (9+6k)-(5+10k)=4-4k,\n\nThese are the same equations as before (equations from differences).\n\nLet me now consider these three equations:\n\n1) c(a -b)=1+2k,\n\n2) b(c -a)=3-6k,\n\n3) a(c -b)=4-4k,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write equation1 as:\n\nc(a -b)=1+2k,\n\nEquation2 can be written as:\n\nb(c -a)=3-6k \u21d2-b(a -c)=3-6k,\n\nEquation3 is:\n\na(c -b)=4-4k,\n\nLet me consider adding equations1 and 2:\n\nc(a -b) -b(a -c)= (1+2k)+(3-6k),\n\nLeft side:\n\nc(a -b) -b a +b c =c a -c b -a b +b c =c a -a b,\n\nRight side:4-4k,\n\nThus,\n\na(c -b)=4-4k,\n\nWhich is equation3,\n\nThus, the three equations are dependent.\n\nThus, we need another equation.\n\nLet me consider equation1 and equation2:\n\nFrom equation1: c(a -b)=(1+2k),\n\nEquation2: b(c -a)=3-6k,\n\nLet me solve for c from equation1:\n\nc= (1+2k)/(a -b),\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\nb( ( (1+2k)/(a -b) ) -a )=3 -6k,\n\nLet me denote d= a -b,\n\nThus,\n\nb( (1+2k)/d -a )=3 -6k,\n\nBut d= a -b \u21d2a= b +d,\n\nSubstitute a= b +d,\n\nThus,\n\nb( (1+2k)/d - (b +d) )=3 -6k,\n\nMultiply through:\n\nb*(1+2k)/d -b(b +d)=3 -6k,\n\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that a, b, c are integers multiplied by k, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the minimal value of S=a +b +c is achieved when the variables are chosen such that the quadratics have real roots and the terms are minimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that k=log\u20823,\n\nLet me compute numerical

the above equation.\n\nBut without more equations, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the minimal S occurs when the variables a, b, c are chosen such that the product ABC is minimized or maximized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value of xyz is 2^{12} *3^{something}?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^S where S is the minimal solution to the equation derived earlier:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2081)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2082)+sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C\u2083)=S,\n\nWith C\u2081=8+4k, C\u2082=9+6k, C\u2083=5+10k,\n\nThis equation must be solved numerically for

had a contradiction when assuming variables,\n\nThus, perhaps the problem is formulated incorrectly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is when variables are chosen such that the terms are proportional,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2^{16} *3^{something} but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^{22} *3^{20} divided by something,\n\nWait, the product of the RHSs is2^{22}*3^{20},\n\nThus, if xyz is the geometric mean,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}*3^{20})^{1/3}=2^{22/3}*3^{20/3},\n\nBut this is likely not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal value is achieved when xyz=2^{12}*3^{8},\n\nBut without concrete steps, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the system of equations can be solved as follows:\n\nLet me consider the three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nAdding them:\n\naS -a\u00b2 +bS -b\u00b2 +cS -c\u00b2=22+20k,\n\nBut a+b+c=S,\n\nThus,\n\nS^2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=22+20k,\n\nAnd since (a +b +c)^2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S\u00b2 - (22+20k)) +2*(11+10k),\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -22-20k +22 +20k,\n\n0=0,\n\nConsistent.\n\nThus, we need another equation.\n\nLet me consider multiplying the three equations:\n\na(S -a)*b(S -b)*c(S -c)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nBut left side is abc*(S -a)(S -b)(S -c),\n\nNote that (S -a)=b +c,\n\n(S -b)=a +c,\n\n(S -c)=a +b,\n\nThus,\n\nabc*(b +c)(a +c)(a +b)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nFrom the earlier equation,\n\n(A + B)(B + C)(C + A)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nThus,\n\nabc*(A +B)(B +C)(C +A)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nThus,\n\nabc= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k)/( (A + B)(B + C)(C + A) ),\n\nBut this is circular since (A+B)(B +C)(C+A) is in the denominator,\n\nThus, this approach is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the steps I've tried without success, I think I need to consider that perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^8\u00b73^4 \u00b72^9\u00b73^6 \u00b72^5\u00b73^10)^{1/3} as the geometric mean,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}\u00b73^{20})^{1/3}=2^{22/3}3^{20/3},\n\nBut this is likely not the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is achieved when the variables are set such that the exponents are proportional to the exponents on the RHS,\n\nWhich would give:\n\nxyz=2^{(8+9+5)/3}3^{(4+6+10)/3}=2^{22/3}3^{20/3},\n\nBut the problem might require an integer exponent, so perhaps the minimal S is 22/3 +20/3 log\u20823,\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2^{12}*3^{8},\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let me consider the following approach:\n\nLet me assume that log\u2082xyz=S,\n\nWe need to find minimal S,\n\nFrom the equations,\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider that the minimal S occurs when the three quadratics have a common root,\n\nSuppose that a=b=c,\n\nThen,\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nBut then,\n\n3a=S,\n\nAnd,\n\na(3a -a)=8+4k \u21d22a\u00b2=8+4k \u21d2a\u00b2=4+2k,\n\nThus,\n\nS=3a=3*sqrt(4+2k),\n\nBut k=log\u20823,\n\nThus,\n\nS=3*sqrt(4+2log\u20823),\n\nBut this likely doesn't give an integer exponent,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are in AP,\n\nLet me assume a=S -2d, b=S -d, c=S,\n\nThen, but this may not work.\n\nAlternatively, this problem might require the use of AM-GM inequality,\n\nLet me consider the three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nEach expression is of the form x(S -x)=constant,\n\nThe maximum value of x(S -x) is S\u00b2/4,\n\nThus,\n\nFor each equation,\n\n8+4k \u2264S\u00b2/4,\n\n9+6k \u2264S\u00b2/4,\n\n5+10k \u2264S\u00b2/4,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2/4 \u22659+6k,\n\nThus,\n\nS \u22652*sqrt(9+6k),\n\nWith k=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u22652*sqrt(9+6*1.58496)=2*sqrt(9+9.5098)=2*sqrt(18.5098)\u22482*4.302\u22488.604,\n\nBut S must be larger than sqrt(83.398)\u22489.13,\n\nThus, the minimal S is sqrt(4C\u2083)=sqrt(4*(5+10k))=sqrt(20 +40k),\n\nWith k\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(20 +40*1.58496)=sqrt(20+63.398)=sqrt(83.398)\u22489.13,\n\nThus, the minimal S is 9.13,\n\nThus, the minimal xyz is 2^{9.13},\n\nBut the problem likely expects an exact form.\n\nAlternatively, notice that:\n\nThe three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nIf we denote:\n\nLet me

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have three equations involving x, y, and z, all positive real numbers, and we need to find the smallest possible value of xyz. The equations given are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, they all involve exponents with logarithms in the exponent. That seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can use logarithm properties or some substitution to simplify this?\n\nLet me recall some logarithmic identities. One important one is that a^{log_b(c)} = c^{log_b(a)}. Maybe that can help here. Let me check:\n\nFor example, the first equation is x^{log\u2082(yz)}. If I apply that identity, it would be (yz)^{log\u2082(x)}. Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe taking logarithms on both sides would be a good idea? Let me try that.\n\nLet's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, log_b(a^c) = c log_b(a), so the left side becomes log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082(x). The right side is log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u2082(3). Wait, but that might complicate things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let variables for the logarithms? Let me think. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set a = log\u2082(x), b = log\u2082(y), c = log\u2082(z). Since x, y, z are positive, these logarithms are defined. Then, maybe converting everything into these variables?\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let me see.\n\nFirst, note that log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(y) + log\u2082(z) = b + c.\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(zx) = log\u2082(z) + log\u2082(x) = c + a,\n\nand log\u2082(xy) = log\u2082(x) + log\u2082(y) = a + b.\n\nNow, the first equation is x^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nExpressed in terms of a, b, c:\n\nx^{b + c} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nSimilarly, since x = 2^a, so substituting x:\n\n(2^a)^{b + c} = 2^{a(b + c)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nHmm, but the right side has both 2 and 3 factors. That complicates things because the left side is a power of 2. Wait, that can't be right unless 3\u2074 is also a power of 2, which it isn't. So maybe my substitution is missing something?\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I need to think differently. Because if x, y, z are expressed as 2 and 3 to some exponents, since the right-hand sides involve both 2 and 3? Maybe I should let x, y, z be expressed in terms of 2^u * 3^v or something like that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take logarithms with a different base? Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Let me try that for the first equation:\n\nln(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = ln(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074).\n\nUsing the power rule again, log\u2082(yz) * ln(x) = 8 ln 2 + 4 ln 3.\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(yz) is (ln(yz)/ln 2) by change of base formula. So substituting that in:\n\n(ln(yz)/ln 2) * ln x = 8 ln 2 + 4 ln 3.\n\nHmm, this might get messy with all the natural logs. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose that x, y, z can be written as 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are exponents? Let me see. Let me assume that each variable is of the form 2^p * 3^q. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose x = 2^{a_x} * 3^{b_x},\n\ny = 2^{a_y} * 3^{b_y},\n\nz = 2^{a_z} * 3^{b_z}.\n\nThen, substituting into the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^{a_x} 3^{b_x}]^{log\u2082(yz)}.\n\nThe exponent log\u2082(yz) would be log\u2082( (2^{a_y}3^{b_y})(2^{a_z}3^{b_z}) ) = log\u2082(2^{a_y + a_z} 3^{b_y + b_z}) = (a_y + a_z) + log\u2082(3^{b_y + b_z}).\n\nWait, but log\u2082(3^{something}) is (b_y + b_z) log\u2082(3). Hmm, so actually:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{a_y + a_z} * 3^{b_y + b_z}) = (a_y + a_z) + (b_y + b_z) log\u20823.\n\nSo that exponent is a combination of terms with log\u20823. But then when we raise x to that exponent, which is 2^{a_x} 3^{b_x}, we get a product of terms. This might not be straightforward. Maybe this approach is too complicated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write each equation in terms of exponents with base 2 and 3. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I take the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nLet me write log\u2082(yz) as log\u2082y + log\u2082z. Let\u2019s denote A = log\u2082x, B = log\u2082y, C = log\u2082z. Wait, but then log\u2082y and log\u2082z are exponents of 2 for y and z. But the problem is that y and z also have factors of 3 in their prime factors, so maybe this substitution isn't sufficient?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to separate the exponents for 2 and 3. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose that x = 2^{m_x} * 3^{n_x},\n\ny = 2^{m_y} * 3^{n_y},\n\nz = 2^{m_z} * 3^{n_z},\n\nwhere m_x, n_x, etc., are real numbers. Then, perhaps we can write equations for the exponents of 2 and 3 separately?\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nFirst, compute log\u2082(yz). Since y = 2^{m_y}3^{n_y} and z = 2^{m_z}3^{n_z}, then yz = 2^{m_y + m_z}3^{n_y + n_z}. Therefore,\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{m_y + m_z}3^{n_y + n_z}) = (m_y + m_z) + log\u2082(3^{n_y + n_z}) = (m_y + m_z) + (n_y + n_z) log\u20823.\n\nHmm, so log\u2082(yz) is a combination of terms with log\u20823, which complicates things because when you take x^{log\u2082(yz)}, which is (2^{m_x}3^{n_x})^{...}, you might end up with cross terms between exponents of 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of separating variables into 2 and 3, we can take logarithms of the equations?\n\nLet me try taking the logarithm base 2 of all three equations. Let me see:\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074).\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x,\n\nRight side: log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) = log\u2082(2\u2079\u00b73\u2076),\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(zx) * log\u2082y,\n\nRight side: 9 + 6 log\u20823.\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)}) = log\u2082(2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070),\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(xy) * log\u2082z,\n\nRight side: 5 + 10 log\u20823.\n\nSo, if I denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet A = log\u2082x,\n\nB = log\u2082y,\n\nC = log\u2082z,\n\nand D = log\u20823. Since log\u20823 is a constant, approximately 1.58496, but we can just keep it as D for now.\n\nThen, log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z = B + C,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(zx) = C + A,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = A + B.\n\nSo substituting into the equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(B + C) * A = 8 + 4D,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(C + A) * B = 9 + 6D,\n\nThird equation:\n\n(A + B) * C = 5 + 10D.\n\nSo now we have a system of three equations with variables A, B, C, and D is a constant (D = log\u20823). Our goal is to find A, B, C such that these equations hold, and then compute xyz = 2^{A + B + C} * 3^{something}? Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, if we set A = log\u2082x, B = log\u2082y, C = log\u2082z, then log\u2082(xyz) = A + B + C, so xyz = 2^{A+B+C}. But does that account for the 3 components?\n\nWait, hold on. If x, y, z are expressed as 2^A * 3^{something else}, then actually my previous substitution was incomplete. Because the logarithm base 2 of x would only capture the exponent of 2, but not the 3 part.\n\nHmm, so my mistake here is that if x has factors of both 2 and 3, then log\u2082x would not be sufficient to capture the entire expression. So maybe this approach is missing the exponents for 3. Therefore, perhaps I need a different substitution.\n\nLet me try again. Let me think of variables in terms of both 2 and 3 exponents. Let me set:\n\nLet x = 2^{a} * 3^{d},\n\ny = 2^{b} * 3^{e},\n\nz = 2^{c} * 3^{f},\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, e, f are real numbers. Then, let me substitute into the first equation.\n\nFirst equation: x^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2^8 * 3^4.\n\nCompute log\u2082(yz). Since yz = (2^b 3^e)(2^c 3^f) = 2^{b + c} 3^{e + f}, so log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{b + c} 3^{e + f}) = (b + c) + log\u2082(3^{e + f}) = (b + c) + (e + f) * log\u20823.\n\nLet me denote L = log\u20823 again. So log\u2082(yz) = (b + c) + L*(e + f).\n\nThen, x^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^a 3^d]^{(b + c + L(e + f))} = 2^{a*(b + c + L(e + f))} * 3^{d*(b + c + L(e + f))}.\n\nThis must equal 2^8 * 3^4.\n\nTherefore, equating the exponents for 2 and 3:\n\nFor the 2 exponents: a*(b + c + L(e + f)) = 8,\n\nFor the 3 exponents: d*(b + c + L(e + f)) = 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can do the same for the second and third equations.\n\nSecond equation: y^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2^9 * 3^6.\n\nCompute log\u2082(zx):\n\nzx = (2^c 3^f)(2^a 3^d) = 2^{c + a} 3^{f + d},\n\nso log\u2082(zx) = (c + a) + L*(f + d).\n\nThus, y^{log\u2082(zx)} = [2^b 3^e]^{(c + a + L(f + d))} = 2^{b*(c + a + L(f + d))} * 3^{e*(c + a + L(f + d))}.\n\nSetting equal to 2^9 * 3^6:\n\nExponents for 2: b*(a + c + L(f + d)) = 9,\n\nExponents for 3: e*(a + c + L(f + d)) = 6.\n\nThird equation: z^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2^5 * 3^{10}.\n\nCompute log\u2082(xy):\n\nxy = (2^a 3^d)(2^b 3^e) = 2^{a + b} 3^{d + e},\n\nso log\u2082(xy) = (a + b) + L*(d + e).\n\nTherefore, z^{log\u2082(xy)} = [2^c 3^f]^{(a + b + L(d + e))} = 2^{c*(a + b + L(d + e))} * 3^{f*(a + b + L(d + e))}.\n\nSetting equal to 2^5 * 3^{10}:\n\nExponents for 2: c*(a + b + L(d + e)) = 5,\n\nExponents for 3: f*(a + b + L(d + e)) = 10.\n\nSo now, we have six equations:\n\n1. a*(b + c + L(e + f)) = 8,\n\n2. d*(b + c + L(e + f)) = 4,\n\n3. b*(a + c + L(f + d)) = 9,\n\n4. e*(a + c + L(f + d)) = 6,\n\n5. c*(a + b + L(d + e)) = 5,\n\n6. f*(a + b + L(d + e)) = 10.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of equations. It seems complicated, but maybe there is some symmetry here? Let me see.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2, they both involve the same term (b + c + L(e + f)). Let me denote that as S1. Let S1 = b + c + L(e + f).\n\nThen equations 1 and 2 become:\n\na * S1 = 8,\n\nd * S1 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, equations 3 and 4 involve (a + c + L(f + d)), let me call that S2. So S2 = a + c + L(f + d).\n\nThus,\n\nb * S2 = 9,\n\ne * S2 = 6.\n\nEquations 5 and 6 involve (a + b + L(d + e)), call that S3.\n\nSo S3 = a + b + L(d + e),\n\nthen,\n\nc * S3 = 5,\n\nf * S3 = 10.\n\nSo now, we can write the equations as:\n\n1. a * S1 = 8,\n\n2. d * S1 = 4,\n\n3. b * S2 = 9,\n\n4. e * S2 = 6,\n\n5. c * S3 = 5,\n\n6. f * S3 = 10,\n\nand also,\n\nS1 = b + c + L(e + f),\n\nS2 = a + c + L(f + d),\n\nS3 = a + b + L(d + e).\n\nHmm, this might be a better way to handle it. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of S1, S2, S3.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2: a = 8/S1, d = 4/S1.\n\nSimilarly, from equations 3 and 4: b = 9/S2, e = 6/S2.\n\nFrom equations 5 and 6: c = 5/S3, f = 10/S3.\n\nSo substituting these into the definitions of S1, S2, S3:\n\nFirst, S1 = b + c + L(e + f).\n\nSubstituting b = 9/S2, c =5/S3, e =6/S2, f=10/S3,\n\nS1 = (9/S2) + (5/S3) + L*( (6/S2) + (10/S3) )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS2 = a + c + L(f + d).\n\na = 8/S1, c =5/S3, f =10/S3, d =4/S1,\n\nSo S2 = (8/S1) + (5/S3) + L*( (10/S3) + (4/S1) )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS3 = a + b + L(d + e).\n\na=8/S1, b=9/S2, d=4/S1, e=6/S2,\n\nSo S3 = (8/S1 + 9/S2) + L*(4/S1 + 6/S2).\n\nThis seems really complex, but perhaps there is a way to find a relation between S1, S2, S3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that variables are proportional in some way? Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2: a and d are proportional (since d = (4/S1) and a = 8/S1, so d = a/2.\n\nSimilarly, equations 3 and 4: e = (6/S2), and b = 9/S2, so e = (2/3)b.\n\nSimilarly, equations 5 and 6: f = 10/S3, c = 5/S3, so f = 2c.\n\nThese relationships might help. Let me note them down:\n\nd = (a)/2,\n\ne = (2/3) b,\n\nf = 2 c.\n\nSo that's three relationships between variables. Let me see if I can substitute these into the expressions for S1, S2, S3.\n\nStarting with S1 = b + c + L(e + f).\n\nSubstitute e = (2/3)b and f = 2c:\n\nS1 = b + c + L*( (2/3)b + 2c ).\n\nSimilarly, S2 = a + c + L*(f + d).\n\nWe have f = 2c, d = a/2,\n\nso S2 = a + c + L*(2c + (a/2)).\n\nAnd S3 = a + b + L*(d + e).\n\nSubstitute d = a/2, e = (2/3)b,\n\nso S3 = a + b + L*( (a/2) + (2/3)b ).\n\nSo now, the variables are in terms of a, b, c, L. Let me try to express everything in terms of a, b, c and see if I can find equations between them.\n\nFirst, let's write S1, S2, S3 expressions again with substitutions:\n\nS1 = b + c + L*( (2/3)b + 2c )\n\nS2 = a + c + L*(2c + (a/2) )\n\nS3 = a + b + L*( (a/2) + (2/3)b )\n\nNow, since we have expressions for a, b, c in terms of S1, S2, S3, and vice versa, this is still a system of equations. Maybe I can combine them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set variables in terms of each other. Let me see.\n\nLet me see if I can express S1, S2, S3 in terms of a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can write equations in terms of a, b, c only, by substituting the relations between S1, S2, S3 and a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assign numerical values? Since L is a constant (log\u20823 \u2248 1.58496), but since we need an exact answer, perhaps L can remain as log\u20823, and we can solve symbolically?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find ratios between the variables.\n\nLooking at the first set: a and d are in 2:1 ratio. Similarly, e and b are in 2:3, and f and c are in 2:1.\n\nLet me consider that maybe these variables can be expressed in terms of other variables. Let me see.\n\nLet me see if I can express S1, S2, S3 in terms of a, b, c, then see if I can set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables as follows.\n\nLet me define variables u = a, v = b, w = c,\n\nthen d = u/2,\n\ne = (2/3)v,\n\nf = 2w,\n\nSo then S1 = v + w + L*( (2/3)v + 2w )\n\nS2 = u + w + L*(2w + u/2 )\n\nS3 = u + v + L*( u/2 + (2/3)v )\n\nWe also have from equations 1,3,5,\n\na = 8/S1 => u = 8/S1,\n\nb = 9/S2 => v = 9/S2,\n\nc =5/S3 => w =5/S3,\n\nSo substituting u, v, w into S1, S2, S3,\n\nLet me write S1 in terms of S2 and S3:\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me see:\n\nExpress S1 in terms of v and w:\n\nS1 = v + w + L*( (2/3)v + 2w ) = v(1 + (2/3)L) + w(1 + 2L).\n\nSimilarly, S2:\n\nS2 = u + w + L*(2w + (u/2) ) = u(1 + L/2) + w(1 + 2L).\n\nS3:\n\nS3 = u + v + L*( (u/2) + (2/3)v ) = u(1 + L/2) + v(1 + (2/3)L).\n\nBut since u = 8/S1, v =9/S2, w=5/S3,\n\nthis substitution might allow us to write equations in terms of S1, S2, S3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write each S in terms of S1, S2, S3, but this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume some variables to be equal or find ratios?\n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the minimal xyz, which in terms of exponents would be 2^{a + b + c} * 3^{d + e + f}.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, originally, x = 2^a * 3^d,\n\nso xyz would be (2^a * 3^d)(2^b * 3^e)(2^c *3^f) = 2^{a + b + c} * 3^{d + e + f}.\n\nTherefore, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize (a + b + c) and (d + e + f). But actually, since it's a product of two terms (2 and 3), perhaps the minimal value is achieved when both exponents are as small as possible? Not sure, but maybe the minimal value is determined by the product.\n\nAlternatively, since 2 and 3 are primes, the minimal product would need to minimize each exponent? Not sure. Maybe we need to compute a + b + c and d + e + f in terms of the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think again of the original equations.\n\nWait, going back to the first substitution where I set A = log\u2082x, B = log\u2082y, C = log\u2082z, but that might not account for the 3 components. However, the problem is that the variables x,y,z can have factors of both 2 and 3. But perhaps if I take the logarithm in base 2 and base 3? Hmm, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take the logarithm of each equation in base 3?\n\nWait, let me try taking the logarithm in base 3 of the first equation:\n\nlog\u2083(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2083(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074).\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(yz) * log\u2083x,\n\nRight side: log\u2083(2\u2078) + log\u2083(3\u2074) = 8 log\u20832 + 4.\n\nHmm, but log\u2083x can be written as (log\u2082x)/(log\u20823). Let me write that as (A)/D, where A = log\u2082x, D = log\u20823.\n\nSo, log\u2083x = A/D,\n\nSimilarly, log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z = B + C,\n\nSo left side: (B + C) * (A/D) = [A(B + C)] / D = 8 log\u20832 +4.\n\nWait, but log\u20832 is 1/(log\u20823) = 1/D,\n\nTherefore, 8 log\u20832 = 8 / D,\n\nThus, right side is (8/D) +4.\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n[A(B + C)] / D = 8/D +4,\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\nA(B + C) = 8 +4D.\n\nWait, this is exactly the same as the first equation we had earlier when we set A,B,C as log\u2082x etc. Similarly, the other equations would also reduce to those three equations in A,B,C and D. But in that case, perhaps we can ignore the 3 components and work only in log base 2?\n\nWait a second, but the problem is that the original equations have 3 exponents as well, so perhaps the 3 terms are also involved in the logarithm?\n\nWait, but when I considered A = log\u2082x, that only accounts for the 2 part of x. However, if x has a 3 component, then log\u2082x isn't sufficient. So maybe that substitution was incomplete. Therefore, perhaps the system of equations in A,B,C with the constant D is actually incomplete? Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me consider multiplying all three original equations together. Let's see:\n\nThe left-hand sides multiplied together would be:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nThe right-hand sides multiplied together are (2\u2078\u00b73\u2074)(2\u2079\u00b73\u2076)(2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070) = 2^{8+9+5} *3^{4+6+10} = 2\u00b2\u00b2 *3\u00b2\u2070.\n\nSo, let me compute the left-hand side product:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nLet me see if this can be simplified. Let me take the exponents:\n\nLet me denote each term:\n\nFirst term: x^{log\u2082(yz)} = x^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z},\n\nSecond term: y^{log\u2082(zx)} = y^{log\u2082z + log\u2082x},\n\nThird term: z^{log\u2082(xy)} = z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y},\n\nMultiplying all together:\n\nx^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z + log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y}.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y}.\n\nGroup the terms:\n\n= [x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x}] * [x^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x}] * [y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082y}].\n\nHmm, each pair like x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} can be written as (x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x}).\n\nRecall that a^{log_b c} * c^{log_b a} = c^{log_b a} * a^{log_b c} = (a^{log_b c}) * (c^{log_b a}).\n\nBut using the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}, so each pair is equal to (x^{log\u2082y}) * (y^{log\u2082x}) = (y^{log\u2082x}) * (y^{log\u2082x})? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}, so x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so each pair is y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} ?\n\nWait, no, let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst term pair: x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{log\u2082x} * x^{log\u2082y} = ?\n\nWait, using the identity, x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so the first pair is y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{2 log\u2082x}? Wait, no: Wait, x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so the first pair is y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{2 log\u2082x}? That can't be right. Wait, actually, hold on:\n\nWait, no, the first pair is x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = (y^{log\u2082x}) * (y^{log\u2082x}) ? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the first term is x^{log\u2082y} and the second term is y^{log\u2082x}. Since x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so each term is equal, so their product is (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2?\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere.\n\nLet me see:\n\nSince x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{log\u2082x} * y^{log\u2082x} = y^{2 log\u2082x}? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the first term is x^{log\u2082y}, which equals y^{log\u2082x}, so multiplying that by y^{log\u2082x} gives y^{2 log\u2082x}?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me think numerically. Let me suppose x=2, y=4. Then log\u2082y = 2, so x^{log\u2082y} = 2^2=4. log\u2082x=1, so y^{log\u2082x}=4^1=4. So their product is 16, which is 4*4 = (y^{log\u2082x})^2. So yes, in that case, it's (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2. So, in general, x^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2?\n\nWait, but that seems like not a general identity. Wait, in this case, x^{log\u2082y} = y^{log\u2082x}, so their product is (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2. So yes, so each such pair would square that term.\n\nTherefore, for each pair:\n\nx^{log\u2082y} * y^{log\u2082x} = (y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly, x^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082x} = (z^{log\u2082x})\u00b2,\n\nand y^{log\u2082z} * z^{log\u2082y} = (z^{log\u2082y})\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes:\n\n(y^{log\u2082x})\u00b2 * (z^{log\u2082x})\u00b2 * (z^{log\u2082y})\u00b2.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps there is a better way to combine all terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire product:\n\nThe left-hand side is x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nLet me take the logarithm base 2 of the entire product. Let me denote the product as P.\n\nlog\u2082P = log\u2082 [x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}]\n\n= log\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) + log\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) + log\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)})\n\n= log\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x + log\u2082(zx) * log\u2082y + log\u2082(xy) * log\u2082z.\n\nWhich is exactly the left-hand sides of the three original equations summed together. Wait, but each of the original equations had their own log\u2082(...) * log\u2082(...) equals to 8 +4 log\u20823, etc. So summing all three equations, we get:\n\nlog\u2082P = (8 +4 log\u20823) + (9 +6 log\u20823) + (5 +10 log\u20823) = (8+9+5) + (4+6+10) log\u20823 = 22 + 20 log\u20823.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082P = 22 + 20 log\u20823,\n\nSo P = 2^{22 + 20 log\u20823} = 2^{22} * (2^{log\u20823})^{20} = 2^{22} * 3^{20}.\n\nWhich matches the right-hand side product, so that checks out.\n\nHmm, but how does this help us? The product of the left sides equals the product of the right sides, which we already knew, but perhaps there's a way to get xyz from here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider taking the product of all three equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u00b2\u00b2 *3\u00b2\u2070,\n\nBut that product is equal to (xyz)^{something}?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me consider the exponent of each variable in the product.\n\nLooking at the left side:\n\nThe exponent of x is log\u2082(yz) from the first term,\n\nplus log\u2082(zx) from the second term (since y^{log\u2082(zx)} contributes log\u2082(zx) to the exponent of y, but here we are looking at the exponent of x. Wait, no, sorry, need to see each variable's total exponent.\n\nWait, actually, each term is a variable raised to the log\u2082 of the product of the other two variables. Let me see:\n\nThe entire left-hand side is:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z + log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y}.\n\nNow, the exponent of x is (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) from the first term,\n\nplus log\u2082x from the third term's exponent (since z^{log\u2082xy} has exponent log\u2082(xy) which includes log\u2082x,\n\nWait, no: Wait, the exponent of x in the entire expression comes from:\n\n- In the first term: x^{log\u2082(yz)} contributes log\u2082(yz) to the exponent of x,\n\n- In the second term: y^{log\u2082(zx)} contributes nothing to the exponent of x,\n\n- In the third term: z^{log\u2082(xy)} contributes log\u2082(xy) to the exponent of z, but the exponent of x comes from the first and third terms?\n\nWait, no, sorry, let me clarify:\n\nWait, the exponent of variable x in the entire product is the sum of exponents from each term where x is present.\n\nOnly the first term has x as the base, so exponent from first term is log\u2082(yz).\n\nThe third term has z as the base, but the exponent log\u2082(xy) includes log\u2082x, but that would contribute to the exponent of z, not x. Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, the term z^{log\u2082(xy)} is z raised to log\u2082(xy). The exponent on z is log\u2082(xy), but that doesn't affect the exponent of x. The exponent of x in the entire product is only from the first term's exponent on x, which is log\u2082(yz). Similarly, the exponent of y is log\u2082(zx) from the second term, and the exponent of z is log\u2082(xy) from the third term. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let me think:\n\nWait, in the entire product, each variable's total exponent is the exponent from their own term plus any cross terms? Wait, no, actually each term is a separate factor. The entire product is:\n\nFirst term: x^{log\u2082(yz)} contributes log\u2082(yz) to the exponent of x,\n\nSecond term: y^{log\u2082(zx)} contributes log\u2082(zx) to the exponent of y,\n\nThird term: z^{log\u2082(xy)} contributes log\u2082(xy) to the exponent of z.\n\nTherefore, the total exponent of x is log\u2082(yz),\n\ntotal exponent of y is log\u2082(zx),\n\ntotal exponent of z is log\u2082(xy).\n\nTherefore, the entire product can be written as:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)} = (x^{log\u2082y} * x^{log\u2082z}) ) * (y^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082x}) ) * ( z^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082y} )\n\nHmm, but this still isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe take the product and express in terms of xyz?\n\nWait, perhaps take the logarithm of the left-hand side:\n\nlog\u2082(Left) = log\u2082y * log\u2082x + log\u2082z * log\u2082x + log\u2082z * log\u2082y + log\u2082x * log\u2082y + log\u2082x * log\u2082z + log\u2082y * log\u2082z.\n\nWait no, that seems confused. Wait, actually, the logarithm was already computed as log\u2082P = log\u2082(yz)*log\u2082x + log\u2082(zx)*log\u2082y + log\u2082(xy)*log\u2082z.\n\nWait, but that expression is not easily factored. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of exponents. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define the variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set a = log\u2082x,\n\nb = log\u2082y,\n\nc = log\u2082z,\n\nand d = log\u20823 (since log\u20823 is a constant),\n\nand also note that log\u20832 = 1/d.\n\nThe original three equations, when we took log\u2082 of them, gave us:\n\n1. (b + c) * a = 8 +4d,\n\n2. (c + a) * b = 9 +6d,\n\n3. (a + b) * c =5 +10d.\n\nOur goal is to find xyz = 2^{a + b + c} * 3^{?} Wait, but earlier I realized that if we set a = log\u2082x, then x = 2^a, but x could also have a 3 component. However, in the equations above, the right-hand sides have terms with 4d and 6d etc., which come from log\u20823 terms. Therefore, perhaps this system of equations in a, b, c, d (with d being a constant) can be solved to find a, b, c, and then compute xyz as 2^{a + b + c}?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the original variables x, y, z must also account for the 3 components. Wait, but maybe in this approach, the exponents related to 3 are already accounted for in the equations through the constant d?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the equations above, the 4d term comes from the original equation's RHS having 3\u2074, so when we took log\u2082, that 3\u2074 term contributed 4 log\u20823, which is 4d. So these equations are capturing all the necessary information about the exponents of 2 and 3?\n\nWait, actually, maybe not. Let me recall:\n\nWhen we took log\u2082 of the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u20783\u2074),\n\nthe left side is (log\u2082(yz))*(log\u2082x),\n\nthe right side is log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074) = 8 +4 log\u20823.\n\nTherefore, this equation is combining both the 2 and 3 components into a single equation. So, in effect, by using logarithms, we are collapsing the multiplicative factors into additive terms involving log\u20823. Therefore, the variables a, b, c account for the exponents of 2 in x, y, z, but the equations also include terms related to the exponents of 3 through the constant d = log\u20823.\n\nTherefore, maybe the system of equations in a, b, c with the constant d can be solved, and then the exponents of 3 would be determined through another set of equations?\n\nWait, but in the equations above, only the 2 exponents are considered in a, b, c. The exponents for 3 would be separate variables, but perhaps in this setup, the equations already encompass both?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is sufficient, and the minimal xyz is just 2^{a + b + c} where a, b, c are found from the equations above, and the 3 components are already considered in the equations through the d terms?\n\nHmm, I need to check.\n\nLet me suppose that xyz is indeed 2^{a + b + c} * 3^{something}, but perhaps the equations already account for the 3 parts such that when we solve for a, b, c, the 3 exponents are implicitly included?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the minimal xyz is achieved when the exponents for 3 are also minimized, but since all equations already involve the constants related to log\u20823, perhaps solving for a, b, c is sufficient?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal xyz is 2^{a + b + c} * 3^{d + e + f}, and we need to find all variables a, b, c, d, e, f. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter substitution here. Let me think again.\n\nLet me go back to the three equations in a, b, c:\n\n1. a(b + c) + a*(L)(e + f) = 8 +4L,\n\nWait, no, actually in the previous substitution where I separated the exponents into 2 and 3, the variables a, b, c were exponents for 2, and d, e, f were exponents for 3. But in the equations, we have cross terms between a and e, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system of equations for a, b, c with the constants involving L can be treated as a linear system?\n\nWait, let me look again at the three equations:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) =8 +4L - a*(L terms?)\n\nWait, no, sorry, in the previous substitution where I set A = log\u2082x etc., but that was incomplete. Alternatively, the equations in terms of a, b, c with d as a constant are:\n\n1. (b + c)*a =8 +4d,\n\n2. (c + a)*b =9 +6d,\n\n3. (a + b)*c =5 +10d.\n\nThese are three equations with three variables a, b, c, and d is a known constant (d = log\u20823). So perhaps we can solve for a, b, c numerically?\n\nWait, but maybe there is a way to solve them symbolically.\n\nLet me consider adding all three equations:\n\na(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = (8 +4d) + (9 +6d) + (5 +10d).\n\nLeft side: ab + ac + bc + ab + bc + ca = 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nRight side: 22 + 20d.\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = 22 + 20d,\n\nso ab + bc + ca = 11 +10d. (Equation4)\n\nAdditionally, let me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nP = abc,\n\nand also Q = ab + bc + ca =11 +10d.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find S?\n\nLet me see if we can find expressions for S.\n\nLet me consider subtracting the equations pairwise.\n\nFor example, equation1 - equation2:\n\na(b + c) - b(c + a) = (8 +4d) - (9 +6d),\n\nLeft side: ab + ac - bc - ab = ac - bc = c(a - b),\n\nRight side: -1 -2d,\n\nTherefore,\n\nc(a - b) = -1 -2d,\n\nSimilarly, equation2 - equation3:\n\nb(c + a) - c(a + b) = (9 +6d) - (5 +10d),\n\nLeft side: bc + ab - ac - bc = ab - ac = a(b - c),\n\nRight side:4 -4d,\n\nSo,\n\na(b - c) =4 -4d,\n\nEquation1 - equation3:\n\na(b + c) - c(a + b) = (8 +4d) - (5 +10d),\n\nLeft side: ab + ac - ac - bc = ab - bc = b(a - c),\n\nRight side:3 -6d,\n\nTherefore,\n\nb(a - c) =3 -6d.\n\nHmm, this gives us three new equations:\n\n1. c(a - b) = -1 -2d,\n\n2. a(b - c) =4 -4d,\n\n3. b(a - c) =3 -6d.\n\nThis might not be helpful immediately, but perhaps express variables in terms of others?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express a - b, b - c, etc., in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of S, Q, and P. Since we have Q = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand S = a + b + c,\n\nthen,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nso a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider solving for variables step by step.\n\nLet me denote equation1: a(b + c) =8 +4d,\n\nBut since S = a + b + c, so (b + c) = S - a,\n\nTherefore equation1 becomes:\n\na(S - a) =8 +4d,\n\nSimilarly, equation2: b(S - b)=9 +6d,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10d.\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. aS -a\u00b2 =8 +4d,\n\n2. bS - b\u00b2 =9 +6d,\n\n3. cS -c\u00b2 =5 +10d.\n\nHmm, so each variable satisfies a quadratic equation of the form X*S - X\u00b2 = constant.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\na\u00b2 - S a + (8 +4d) =0,\n\nb\u00b2 - S b + (9 +6d) =0,\n\nc\u00b2 - S c + (5 +10d) =0.\n\nEach of these is a quadratic equation in a, b, c respectively. Therefore, a, b, c are roots of the equations:\n\nx\u00b2 - S x + (8 +4d) =0,\n\ny\u00b2 - S y + (9 +6d)=0,\n\nz\u00b2 - S z + (5 +10d)=0.\n\nWait, but this is interesting. Each variable a, b, c is a root of a quadratic equation with the same leading coefficient (since S is the same for all), but different constants.\n\nTherefore, each a, b, c must satisfy their respective quadratic equations. This might imply that a, b, c are different roots, but perhaps there is some relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three quadratics have some common structure?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that a, b, c are all roots of a single cubic equation, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a, b, c in terms of S and d, then use the fact that a + b + c = S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFrom equation for a:\n\na\u00b2 = S a - (8 +4d),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = S b - (9 +6d),\n\nc\u00b2 = S c - (5 +10d).\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\n= S(a + b + c) - [8 +4d +9 +6d +5 +10d]\n\n= S\u00b2 - [22 +20d].\n\nBut earlier, we know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - 2(11 +10d) = S\u00b2 -22 -20d.\n\nWhich matches, so this is consistent.\n\nHmm, but not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the sum a + b + c = S,\n\nand the products.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as functions of S and d.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equations for a, b, c as quadratics and try to find S.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are all real numbers (given that x, y, z are positive real numbers, so a, b, c must be real). Therefore, the discriminant of each quadratic must be non-negative.\n\nTherefore for the equation in a:\n\nDiscriminant: S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4d) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly for b: S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6d) \u22650,\n\nFor c: S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10d) \u22650.\n\nTherefore, S must satisfy:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(9 +6d),\n\nsince that's the largest of the three constants (since 9+6d vs 8+4d and 5+10d).\n\nWait, let me compute the constants:\n\nFor a: 8 +4d,\n\nfor b:9 +6d,\n\nfor c:5 +10d,\n\nSo the discriminant conditions are:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(8 +4d),\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(9 +6d),\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(5 +10d),\n\nThe most restrictive is the second one, since 9 +6d is larger than 8 +4d (since d=log\u20823 ~1.58, so 6d\u22489.5, so 9+9.5=18.5, whereas 8 +4*1.58\u22488+6.3=14.3, similarly 5+10d\u22485+15.8=20.8, so actually the third equation's constant is the largest: 5+10d \u224820.8, so the discriminant for c requires S\u00b2 \u22654*(5+10d)\u224883.2, which is larger than the second one (4*(9+6d)=4*(9+9.5)=4*18.5=74) and the first one (\u22484*14.3\u224857.2). So the most restrictive is the third inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(5 +10d).\n\nHmm, but perhaps we don't need to go into numbers yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 - S a + (8 +4d)=0,\n\nb\u00b2 - S b + (9 +6d)=0,\n\nc\u00b2 - S c + (5 +10d)=0.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(b\u00b2 - a\u00b2) - S(b -a) + (9 +6d -8 -4d)=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n(b - a)(b + a - S) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\nSimilarly, since b + a - S = b + a - (a + b + c)= -c,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(b - a)(-c) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\n=> -c(b -a) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\n=> c(a - b) = - (1 +2d),\n\nWhich matches one of the previous equations (equation1 - equation2 gave c(a -b)= -1 -2d). So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting other equations similarly, so this doesn't give new info.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since the equations for a, b, c are quadratics with the same S, perhaps their solutions can be related.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are three different roots of some cubic equation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since each variable satisfies its own quadratic, perhaps we can express each variable in terms of S and d, then plug into S = a + b + c.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation1:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4d))]/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6d))]/2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10d))]/2.\n\nBut since a, b, c must be positive real numbers, we have to take the positive roots?\n\nWait, but the variables a, b, c are logarithms (base 2) of x, y, z which are positive reals, so a, b, c can be any real numbers, but the problem states that x, y, z are positive, so a, b, c can be any real numbers (since log\u2082 of a positive number is real). But to have the quadratics have real solutions, discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nBut this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a, b, c are symmetric in some way? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me make an assumption that maybe S, the sum a + b + c, can be expressed as a multiple of d.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find S numerically.\n\nLet me recall that d = log\u20823 \u22481.58496,\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\nFor the third equation's RHS:5 +10d \u22485 +15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nso the discriminant for c is S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10d)\u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 \u226583.3984,\n\nso S \u2265 ~9.132.\n\nSimilarly, the other discriminants:\n\nFor a: 8 +4d\u22488+6.3398\u224814.3398 \u2192 S\u00b2\u226557.359 \u2192 S\u22657.574,\n\nFor b:9+6d\u22489+9.5098\u224818.5098 \u2192 S\u00b2\u226574.039\u2192 S\u22658.604.\n\nSo S must be at least ~9.132.\n\nLet me suppose a value for S and see if the equations can be satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an integer value for S? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an exact solution.\n\nLet me consider that maybe the three quadratics have a common S such that a, b, c can be expressed as roots and sum to S.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that:\n\nLet me denote the three quadratics as:\n\n1. a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4d)=0,\n\n2. b\u00b2 - Sb + (9 +6d)=0,\n\n3. c\u00b2 - Sc + (5 +10d)=0.\n\nLet me denote these as quadratic equations in variable X:\n\nFor a: X\u00b2 - S X + (8 +4d)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nLet me denote the solutions for a, b, c as:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4d))]/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6d))]/2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10d))]/2.\n\nBut since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative as above.\n\nAssuming we pick the '+' root for each (since we need a + b + c = S, and if we take the '+' for each, their sum would be greater than S, perhaps taking the '-' roots? Not sure).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables a, b, c are the smaller roots of their respective quadratics?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nSuppose that:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4d))]/2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6d))]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10d))]/2.\n\nThen, a + b + c would be [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4d)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6d)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10d)))] /2.\n\nBut this would need to equal S, so:\n\n[3S - (sqrt(...) + sqrt(...) + sqrt(...))] /2 = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n3S - (sqrt terms) = 2S,\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt terms,\n\nSo,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4d)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6d)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10d)).\n\nThis equation would allow solving for S, but this seems very difficult analytically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a value of S that makes each sqrt term a multiple of S, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the three quadratics have a common solution? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of this as a system where:\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me denote the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4d) =0,\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb + (9 +6d)=0,\n\nc\u00b2 - Sc + (5 +10d)=0.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(b\u00b2 -a\u00b2) - S(b -a) + (9 +6d -8 -4d)=0,\n\n(b -a)(b +a) - S(b -a) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\nFactor (b -a):\n\n(b -a)(b +a - S) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\nBut since b + a - S = -(c),\n\nbecause S = a + b + c,\n\nSo,\n\n(b -a)(-c) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\n=> c(a - b) =1 +2d,\n\nWait earlier, when we did equation1 - equation2, we arrived at c(a -b)= -1 -2d,\n\nWait there's a discrepancy here. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait in the previous steps, when subtracting equation1 from equation2,\n\nequation2 - equation1 gives:\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb +9+6d - [a\u00b2 - Sa +8+4d] =0,\n\nWhich is b\u00b2 -a\u00b2 -S(b -a) + (9+6d -8-4d)=0,\n\nWhich is (b -a)(b +a) -S(b -a) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\nFactor out (b -a):\n\n(b -a)(b +a - S) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\nBut (b +a - S)= (b +a) - (a + b + c) = -c,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a)(-c) + (1 +2d)=0,\n\n=> -c(b - a) +1 +2d =0,\n\n=> c(a - b) +1 +2d=0,\n\n=> c(a -b)= -1 -2d,\n\nWhich matches our previous result. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the equation is c(a -b)= -1 -2d,\n\nSimilarly, doing equation2 - equation3:\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb +9+6d - [c\u00b2 - Sc +5+10d] =0,\n\nWhich is b\u00b2 -c\u00b2 -S(b -c) + (9+6d -5-10d)=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n(b -c)(b +c) -S(b -c) + (4 -4d)=0,\n\nFactor (b -c):\n\n(b -c)(b +c -S) +4(1 -d)=0,\n\nBut b +c -S = -a,\n\nSo,\n\n(b -c)(-a) +4(1 -d)=0,\n\n=> -a(b -c) +4(1 -d)=0,\n\n=> a(c -b)=4(1 -d),\n\n=> a(b -c)= -4(1 -d)=4(d -1),\n\nWhich matches equation2 - equation3's result: a(b -c)=4 -4d =4(d -1) if d is log\u20823. Wait, no, 4(d -1)=4d -4, but the RHS was 4 -4d. Wait, perhaps made a sign mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe equation was:\n\n(b -c)(-a) +4(1 -d)=0,\n\n=> -a(b -c) +4(1 -d)=0,\n\n=> -a(b -c)= -4(1 -d),\n\n=> a(b -c)=4(1 -d).\n\nBut in our previous result from equation2 - equation3, we had:\n\na(b -c)=4 -4d,\n\nWhich is equal to 4(1 -d),\n\nSo that matches.\n\nOkay, so the equations are consistent.\n\nSimilarly, equation1 - equation3 would give another relation.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nPerhaps express variables in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me assume that I can express b and c in terms of a, then plug into S = a + b + c.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider introducing variables like p = a - b, q = b - c, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let me make an ansatz that a, b, c are in arithmetic progression or something, but that might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since the problem asks for the minimal xyz, which is 2^{a + b + c}*3^{d + e + f}, but perhaps in this formulation, the minimal value is when a + b + c is minimized, but with the constraints from the equations.\n\nWait, but in this current setup, we are only dealing with the a, b, c variables (log\u2082 components), but the exponents for 3 (d, e, f) are related through the equations via the constant d=log\u20823. Maybe the exponents for 3 can be derived from the equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz occurs when the exponents for 3 are also minimized, but since their equations are linked through the same variables, maybe solving for a, b, c is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that in the original equations, the exponents for 3 are tied to the variables a, b, c.\n\nWait, going back to the first substitution where I considered x =2^a*3^d etc., and the equations led to relationships between a,b,c,d,e,f. The key point is that d = (4)/S1, and S1 is expressed in terms of other variables. This seems too tangled.\n\nPerhaps going back to the equations in a,b,c with d = log\u20823.\n\nSuppose I treat d as a known constant (even though it's irrational) and try to solve for a, b, c numerically?\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote d = log\u20823 \u22481.58496.\n\nLet me set up the three equations:\n\n1. a(b + c) =8 +4d \u22488 +6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\n2. b(a + c)=9 +6d\u22489 +9.5098\u224818.5098,\n\n3. c(a + b)=5 +10d\u22485 +15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nAlso, S = a + b + c,\n\nand we have from equation4: ab + bc + ca=11 +10d\u224811+15.8496\u224826.8496.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c)=14.3398,\n\nEquation2: b(a + c)=18.5098,\n\nEquation3: c(a + b)=20.8496,\n\nAlso, ab + bc + ca\u224826.8496,\n\nand S = a + b + c.\n\nLet me see if I can find a, b, c numerically.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: a(S -a) =14.3398,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=18.5098,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=20.8496.\n\nThese are three quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively.\n\nLet me assume that a, b, c are all less than S, so taking the '+' root may not be feasible, so perhaps the '-' root?\n\nWait, solving for a:\n\nFrom equation1:\n\na\u00b2 - S a +14.3398=0,\n\nSolution: a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -57.3592)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nAssuming that a, b, c are real, so discriminant must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 \u226557.3592,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2 \u226574.0392,\n\nFor c: S\u00b2 \u226583.3984,\n\nThus, S must be at least ~9.132.\n\nLet me make an initial guess for S, say S=10,\n\nthen,\n\nFor a: a(10 -a)=14.3398,\n\n=> 10a -a\u00b2=14.3398,\n\n=>a\u00b2 -10a +14.3398=0,\n\nSolution: [10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 -57.3592)]/2 = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(42.6408)]/2 \u2248 [10 \u00b16.53]/2,\n\nTaking the smaller root: (10 -6.53)/2\u22481.735,\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nb(10 -b)=18.5098,\n\n=>b\u00b2 -10b +18.5098=0,\n\nSolutions: [10 \u00b1sqrt(100 -74.0392)]/2 = [10 \u00b1sqrt(25.9608)]/2\u2248[10 \u00b15.095]/2,\n\nTaking smaller root: (10-5.095)/2\u22482.452,\n\nFor c:\n\nc(10 -c)=20.8496,\n\n=>c\u00b2 -10c +20.8496=0,\n\nSolutions: [10 \u00b1sqrt(100 -83.3984)]/2 = [10 \u00b1sqrt(16.6016)]/2\u2248[10\u00b14.075]/2,\n\nTaking smaller root: (10 -4.075)/2\u22482.962,\n\nNow, check if a + b +c \u22481.735+2.452+2.962\u22487.15, which is less than S=10.

(X+Y)= (11+10d)-(8+4d)=3+6d,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom Equation2: X+Z=9+6d,\n\nThus, Y = (X+Y+Z) - (X+Z)= (11+10d) - (9+6d)=2+4d,\n\nFrom Equation3: Y+Z=5+10d,\n\nThus, X= (X+Y+Z) - (Y+Z)= (11+10d)-(5+10d)=6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nX=ab=6,\n\nY=ac=2+4d,\n\nZ=bc=3+6d.\n\nNow this is a breakthrough!\n\nSo now we have:\n\nab=6,\n\nac=2+4d,\n\nbc=3+6d.\n\nSo now we can solve for a,b,c.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom ab=6 => b=6/a,\n\nFrom ac=2+4d => c=(2+4d)/a,\n\nThen, substituting into bc=3+6d:\n\nb*c = (6/a)*[(2+4d)/a] =6*(2+4d)/a\u00b2 =3+6d,\n\nThus,\n\n6*(2+4d) /a\u00b2 =3+6d,\n\nMultiply both sides by a\u00b2:\n\n6*(2 +4d) = (3 +6d)a\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n2*(2 +4d)= (1 +2d)a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2= [2*(2+4d)]/(1+2d) = [4 +8d]/(1+2d),\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt( (4 +8d)/(1+2d) ),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nWe can compute b and c.\n\nCompute numerator and denominator inside sqrt:\n\n4+8d =4(1+2d),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2=4(1+2d)/(1+2d)=4,\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2=4,\n\nThus,\n\na=2 or a=-2.\n\nBut since a=log\u2082x, and x is positive, a can be any real number, but likely positive? Let me see.\n\nIf a=2,\n\nthen b=6/a=3,\n\nand c=(2+4d)/a=(2 +4d)/2=1 +2d,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCheck bc=3+6d,\n\nb*c=3*(1+2d)=3 +6d, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if a=-2,\n\nthen

b +c + L(e +f),\n\nBut with this new approach, maybe we can find the exponents for 3?\n\nWait, but in this current approach, we have solved for a,b,c as exponents of 2, and now we need to find the exponents for 3, which are d,e,f.\n\nRecall the original three equations:\n\nThe first equation's RHS is 2\u20783\u2074,\n\nso the exponents for 3 must also be considered.\n\nWait, going back to the system where we separated the exponents for 2 and 3:\n\nWe had:\n\nFor the first equation:\n\na*(b + c + L(e + f)) =8,\n\nand d*(b +c + L(e +f)) =4,\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nb*(a +c + L(f

finally compute xyz=2^{a+b+c}*3^{d+e+f}.\n\nOkay, let's proceed.\n\nGiven a=2, b=3, c=1+2d,\n\nwhere d=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nFirst compute S1, S2, S3.\n\nFirst, S1 = b +c + L(e + f).\n\nWait but we need e and f, which depend on S2 and S3,\n\nThis seems cyclic.\n\nWait, but we can compute S1, S2, S3 in terms of known variables.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nWe know the expressions for d,e,f in terms of S1,S2,S3:\n\nd=4/S1,\n\ne=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3.\n\nAlso,\n\nS1 = b +c + L*(e + f),\n\nSubstitute e and f:\n\nS1 = b +c + L*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS2 =a +c + L*(f +d)=a +c + L*(10/S3 +4/S1),\n\nS3 =a +b + L*(d +e)=a +b + L*(4/S1 +6/S2).\n\nThis is a system of three equations for S1,S2,S3.\n\nGiven that a=2, b=3, c=1+2d,\n\nso let me substitute these into the equations.\n\nFirst, compute c:\n\nc =1 +2d,\n\nwhere d=log\u20823,\n\nSo,\n\nS1 =3 + (1 +2d) + L*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\n=4 +2d + L*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS2 =2 +1 +2d + L*(10/S3 +4/S1),\n\n=3 +2d + L*(10/S3 +4/S1),\n\nS3=2 +3 + L*(4/S1 +6/S2),\n\n=5 + L*(4/S1 +6/S2).\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three unknowns S1,S2,S3.\n\nBut this requires numerical computation.\n\nLet me proceed numerically with d=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nand L=log\u20823=d,\n\nWait, actually, L was defined as log\u20823, so L=d,\n\nWait, hold on,\n\nWait in the previous substitution, L was log\u20823, and d was log\u20823,\n\nWait, but in the current approach, we have:\n\nd=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nBut in the variables for the exponents of 3:\n\nd_x =d (from previous notation),\n\nWait, no, sorry,\n\nWait, in the variables for the exponent of 3 in x: d = log\u20823 is the constant,\n\nWait, now in the current variables,\n\nthe exponents for 3 in x,y,z are d_x=d, d_y=e, d_z=f,\n\nbut in the equations above,\n\nd=4/S1,\n\nWait, yes, in the equations:\n\nd (the exponent for 3 in x) is equal to 4/S1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\ne =6/S2,\n\nf =10/S3.\n\nTherefore, in the equations for S1, S2, S3,\n\nwe have:\n\nS1 =b +c + L*(e +f),\n\nwhere L=log\u20823=d,\n\nThus,\n\nS1= b +c + d*(e +f),\n\nand e=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3,\n\nThus,\n\nS1 =b +c + d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nGiven

=e\u22480.6554,\n\nd_z =f\u22481.506.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe total exponent for 3 in xyz is d_x +d_y +d_z\u22480.3777 +0.6554 +1.506\u22482.539.\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{a+b+c}*3^{d_x+d_y+d_z},\n\nwhere a +b +c=2+3+4.1699\u22489.1699,\n\nWait, wait, earlier we had c=1 +2d\u22481+2*1.58496\u22484.1699,\n\nSo S =a+b+c=2+3+4.1699\u22489.1699,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz\u22482^{9.1699}*3^{2.539}.\n\nBut we need the exact value.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is an exact solution.\n\nWait, in the equations for X,Y,Z (the products ab, ac, bc):\n\nWe had:\n\nab=6,\n\nac=2+4d,\n\nbc=3+6d,\n\nWith d=log\u20823,\n\nThus,\n\nac=2+4d,\n\nand bc=3+6d.\n\nLet me solve for a,b,c symbolically.\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom ab=6,\n\nFrom ac=2+4d,\n\nDivide these two: (ac)/(ab)= (2+4d)/6 \u21d2 c/b=(2+4d)/6 \u21d2 c= b*(2+4d)/6,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom bc=3+6d,\n\nSubstitute c from above:\n\nb*[ b*(2+4d)/6 ] =3+6d,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2*(2+4d)/6 =3+6d,\n\nMultiply both sides by6:\n\nb\u00b2*(2+4d)=18+36d,\n\nDivide both sides by2:\n\nb\u00b2*(1+2d)=9+18d,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2= (9+18d)/(1+2d)=9(1+2d)/(1+2d)=9,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2=9 \u21d2b=3 or b=-3,\n\nTaking positive (since earlier a was positive),\n\nb=3,\n\nThus,\n\na=6/b=2,\n\nc= (2+4d)/a= (2+4d)/2=1+2d,\n\nWhich matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the values of a,b,c are exact:\n\na=2,\n\nb=3,\n\nc=1+2d,\n\nwhere d=log\u20823,\n\nThus,\n\nS=a+b+c=2+3+1+2d=6+2d,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThe exponents for 3 are:\n\nd_x=4/S1,\n\nwhere S1= b +c + L*(e +f),\n\nBut we need to compute S1,S2,S3 exactly.\n\nWait, but with the symbolic approach,\n\nWe have:\n\nWe can compute S1, S2, S3 in terms of d.\n\nRecall,\n\nS1 = b +c + L*(e +f),\n\nBut L=log\u20823 =d,\n\nAnd e=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBut we also have:\n\nS2 =a +c + L*(f +d),\n\nS3 =a +b + L*(d +e),\n\nThis is a system of equations:\n\nLet me substitute a=2,b=3,c=1+2d,\n\nThus,\n\nS1 =3 + (1+2d) + d*(e + f)=4+2d + d(e +f),\n\nS2 =2 + (1+2d) +d*(f + (4/S1)),\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, S2 =a +c + L*(f +d_x),\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, earlier equations for S2 and S3:\n\nS2 =a +c + L*(f +d),\n\nsince f is the exponent for 3 in z, and d is the exponent for 3 in x,\n\nWait, no, in the equations:\n\nThe second equation's exponent part involved f and d,\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe second equation was:\n\nb*(a +c + L*(f +d))=9 +6d,\n\nSo S2 =a +c +L*(f +d),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThird equation: c*(a +b + L*(d +e))=5 +10d,\n\nThus S3 =a +b +L*(d +e).\n\nThus,\n\nS2 =a +c + L*(f +d),\n\nS3 =a +b + L*(d +e).\n\nBut e=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3,\n\nd_x=d=4/S1,\n\nWait, d is already log\u20823, but d_x is the exponent for x's 3 part, which is 4/S1,\n\nWait, perhaps there was confusion in notation.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe exponent for 3 in x is d_x =4/S1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThe exponent for 3 in y is e=6/S2,\n\nThe exponent for 3 in z is f=10/S3.\n\nThus,\n\nS1 = b +c + L*(e +f),\n\nwhich is,\n\nS1 =3 + (1+2d) + d*(e +f),\n\n=4+2d +d(e +f),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS2 =a +c + L*(f +d_x),\n\n=a +c +d*(f + (4/S1)),\n\n=2 + (1+2d) +d*(f +4/S1),\n\n=3+2d +d*(f +4/S1),\n\nS3 =a +b + L*(d_x +e),\n\n=2+3 +d*(4/S1 +e),\n\n=5 +d*(4/S1 +e).\n\nThis is still a system with S1,S2,S3 and variables e,f related to them.\n\nBut since e=6/S2 and f=10/S3,\n\nand d_x=4/S1,\n\nwe can substitute these:\n\nThus,\n\nS1 =4+2d +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nS2 =3+2d +d*(10/S3 +4/S1),\n\nS3 =5 +d*(4/S1 +6/S2).\n\nThis is the system we need to solve.\n\nLet me attempt to find an exact solution.\n\nAssume that S1, S2, S3 are proportional to the coefficients.\n\nLet me assume that S1 =k*(something),\n\nBut maybe there is a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that S1=2*S2=3*S3,\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for a solution where S1=6,\n\nS2=6,\n\nS3=6,\n\nthen,\n\nCheck:\n\nS1=4+2d +d*(6/6 +10/6)=4+2d +d*(16/6)=4+2d + (8d/3),\n\n=4 + (6d +8d/3)=4 + (26d/3),\n\nSet to 6,\n\n4 +26d/3=6 \u21d226d/3=2 \u21d2d= (2*3)/26=3/13\u22480.2308,\n\nBut d=log\u20823\u22481.585, so this is not valid.\n\nAlternatively, look for a solution where S1=S2=S3=S,\n\nthen,\n\nS1=S,\n\nS2=S,\n\nS3=S,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation1:\n\nS=4+2d +d*(6/S +10/S)=4+2d +d*(16/S),\n\nEquation2:\n\nS=3+2d +d*(10/S +4/S)=3+2d +d*(14/S),\n\nEquation3:\n\nS=5 +d*(4/S +6/S)=5 +d*(10/S).\n\nThus,\n\nFrom Equation3:\n\nS=5 + (10d)/S \u21d2 S\u00b2=5S +10d,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom Equation1:\n\nS\u00b2= (4+2d)S +16d,\n\nFrom Equation2:\n\nS\u00b2= (3+2d)S +14d,\n\nThus,\n\nSet Equation1 and Equation3:\n\nFrom Equation3: S\u00b2 =5S +10d,\n\nFrom Equation1:S\u00b2= (4+2d)S +16d,\n\nThus,\n\n5S +10d = (4+2d)S +16d,\n\n5S +10d =4S +2dS +16d,\n\nS +10d -2dS -16d =0,\n\nS -6d -2dS=0,\n\nS(1-2d)=6d,\n\nThus,\n\nS=6d/(1-2d),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom Equation3: S\u00b2=5S +10d,\n\nSubstitute S=6d/(1-2d),\n\nThus,\n\n(36d\u00b2)/(1-2d)^2 =5*(6d)/(1-2d) +10d,\n\nMultiply both sides by (1-2d)^2,\n\n36d\u00b2 =5*6d*(1-2d) +10d*(1-2d)^2,\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n30d(1-2d) +10d(1-4d +4d\u00b2),\n\n=30d -60d\u00b2 +10d -40d\u00b2 +40d\u00b3,\n\n=40d -100d\u00b2 +40d\u00b3,\n\nThus,\n\n36d\u00b2=40d -100d\u00b2 +40d\u00b3,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-40d\u00b3 + (36d\u00b2 +100d\u00b2) -40d=0,\n\n-40d\u00b3 +136d\u00b2 -40d=0,\n\nFactor:\n\n-4d(10d\u00b2 -34d +10)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nEither d=0 (invalid, since d=log\u20823>0),\n\nor 10d\u00b2 -34d +10=0,\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nd=(34\u00b1sqrt(34\u00b2-400))/20,\n\n=(34\u00b1sqrt(1156-400))/20,\n\n=(34\u00b1sqrt(756))/20,\n\nsqrt(756)=sqrt(4*189)=2*sqrt(189)=2*sqrt(9*21)=6*sqrt(21)\u224827.495,\n\nThus,\n\nd=(34\u00b127.495)/20,\n\nTake the smaller root,\n\nd=(34-27.495)/20\u22486.505/20\u22480.325,\n\nBut d=log\u20823\u22481.585,\n\nSo this is not valid,\n\nThus no solution with S1=S2=S3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an exact solution when the expressions for S1,S2,S3 are in a particular ratio.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the exponents for 3 add up to something.\n\nWe need to compute d_x +e +f =4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nand the total exponent for 3 is this sum,\n\nand xyz=2^{S}*3^{(4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3)}.\n\nBut with the equations involving S1,S2,S3,\n\nPerhaps there's a relationship between these terms.\n\nAlternatively, note that the total exponent of 3 is:\n\nd_x + e + f =4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nAnd from the equations:\n\nS1 =4 +2d +d*(e +f),\n\n=4 +2d +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set Q =4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nThen,\n\nS1 =4 +2d +d*(Q -4/S1),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me consider the sum:\n\nS1 + S2 + S3,\n\n= (4+2d +d*(6/S2 +10/S3)) +\n\n(3+2d +d*(10/S3 +4/S1)) +\n\n(5 +d*(4/S1 +6/S2)),\n\n=4+2d+3+2d+5 +d*(6/S2 +10/S3 +10/S3 +4/S1 +4/S1 +6/S2),\n\n=12 +4d +d*( (6+6)/S2 + (10+10)/S3 + (4+4)/S1 ),\n\n=12+4d +d*(12/S2 +20/S3 +8/S1),\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, this is taking too long, and maybe the problem expects us to realize that the minimal xyz is obtained when the variables a,b,c are 2,3, and 1+2d,\n\nand then we can compute the exponents for 3 as the minimal possible,\n\nbut given the previous numerical calculation,\n\nxyz\u22482^{9.1699}*3^{2.539},\n\nbut this is approximate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an exact expression.\n\nNotice that,\n\nThe exponent for 2 is a+b+c=6+2d,\n\nand the exponent for 3 is (4/S1)+(6/S2)+(10/S3),\n\nbut from the equations,\n\nS1= b +c +d*(e +f),\n\nand e=6/S2,f=10/S3,\n\nso substituting,\n\nS1 =b +c +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThe total exponent for 3 is:\n\n4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nLet me call this T,\n\nThen,\n\nT =4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nBut,\n\nS1 =b +c +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\n= (b +c) +d*( (6/S2 +10/S3) ),\n\n= (b +c) +d*( (6/S2 +10/S3) ),\n\n= (b +c) + (d/ something),\n\nBut not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps write T as:\n\nT = (4/S1) + (6/S2) + (10/S3),\n\nLet me multiply both sides by S1*S2*S3,\n\n4S2S3 +6S1S3 +10S1S2 = T S1S2S3,\n\nBut this seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, notice that:\n\nThe product S1*S2*S3 can be expressed in terms of the variables,\n\nBut I think this problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2\u20783\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)}=2\u20793\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)}=2\u20753\u00b9\u2070.\n\nLet me take the product of all three equations:\n\nxyz^{log\u2082(yz)+log\u2082(zx)+log\u2082(xy)} =2\u00b2\u00b23\u00b2\u2070,\n\nThe exponent of xyz is log\u2082(yz)+log\u2082(zx)+log\u2082(xy),\n\nWhich is log\u2082(yz*zx*xy)=log\u2082(x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)=2(log\u2082x+log\u2082y+log\u2082z)=2S,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz^{2S}=2\u00b2\u00b23\u00b2\u2070,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz= (2\u00b2\u00b23\u00b2\u2070)^{1/(2S)}=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nWait, no,\n\nWait,\n\nxyz^{2S}=2\u00b2\u00b23\u00b2\u2070,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz= (2\u00b2\u00b23\u00b2\u2070)^{1/(2S)}=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nHmm, so,\n\nxyz= 2^{11/S} *3^{10/S},\n\nSo to minimize xyz,\n\nWe need to maximize S,\n\nbecause the exponents 11/S and 10/S decrease as S increases,\n\nsince 2 and 3 are greater than 1,\n\nThus, to minimize xyz, we need to maximize S.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nWait, since 2^{11/S} increases when S decreases,\n\nsince 11/S is larger when S is smaller,\n\nso 2^{11/S} is larger when S is smaller,\n\nSimilarly 3^{10/S} also increases as S decreases,\n\nSo to minimize xyz,\n\nwe need to maximize S,\n\nbecause then the exponents become smaller,\n\nmaking the overall product as small as possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal xyz is achieved when S is maximized,\n\nbut S is a + b + c,\n\nwhich is constrained by the equations.\n\nThus, to find the minimal xyz,\n\nwe need to find the maximal possible value of S,\n\ngiven the constraints of the equations.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but in our previous trials,\n\nwe found S\u22489.1699,\n\nwhich is equal to 6+2d,\n\nsince d=log\u20823,\n\nS=6+2d=6+2log\u20823,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{(6+2d)} *3^{T},\n\nwhere T is the exponent for 3,\n\nbut according to the product approach,\n\nxyz=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nThus,\n\nequating the two expressions:\n\n2^{6+2d}*3^{T}=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nThus,\n\nthe exponents must satisfy:\n\n6+2d=11/S,\n\nand T=10/S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS=11/(6+2d),\n\nBut S= a +b +c=6+2d,\n\nThus,\n\n6+2d=11/S=11/(6+2d),\n\nThus,\n\n(6+2d)^2=11,\n\nTherefore,\n\n6+2d=\u221a11,\n\nThus,\n\nS=\u221a11,\n\nBut this contradicts our previous result that S=6+2d,\n\nSo something is wrong here.\n\nWait, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, in the product approach:\n\nxyz^{2S}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}3^{20})^{1/(2S)}=2^{11/S}3^{10/S},\n\nBut also,\n\nxyz=2^{a+b+c}*3^{d_x +e +f},\n\nwhere d_x +e +f =4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nThus,\n\nEquating,\n\n2^{6+2d}*3^{T}=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nTherefore,\n\n6+2d=11/S,\n\nand T=10/S,\n\nThus,\n\nS=11/(6+2d),\n\nBut S= a+b+c=6+2d,\n\nThus,\n\nS=11/S \u21d2S\u00b2=11 \u21d2S=\u221a11,\n\nThus,\n\n6+2d=\u221a11,\n\nBut d=log\u20823,\n\nTherefore,\n\nd=(\u221a11 -6)/2,\n\nBut d=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nCompute (\u221a11 -6)/2\u2248(3.3166-6)/2\u2248-1.3417,\n\nWhich is negative, contradicting d>0,\n\nThus, there is a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nAh! The error is in the exponent for 3 in xyz.\n\nThe product approach assumes that the total exponent for 3 is T=10/S,\n\nbut actually, the total exponent for 3 is d_x + e + f,\n\nwhere d_x=4/S1,\n\ne=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3,\n\nThus,\n\nT=4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{S}*3^{T},\n\nand also,\n\nxyz=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nThus,\n\nS=11/S \u21d2S\u00b2=11,\n\nand T=10/S,\n\nBut,\n\nT=4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nBut we also have,\n\nFrom the equations,\n\nS1= b +c +d*(e +f)=3 + (1+2d) +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\n=4+2d +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBut I think this approach is leading to inconsistency,\n\nwhich suggests that my assumption that the minimal xyz is achieved when S is maximized might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is achieved when S is as large as possible,\n\nbut in the equations,\n\nthe variables a,b,c are fixed as 2,3,1+2d,\n\nwhich gives S=6+2d,\n\nand substituting into the product formula,\n\nxyz=2^{6+2d}*3^{(4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3)}.\n\nHowever, without exact values for S1,S2,S3, we can\u2019t simplify further.\n\nBut notice that:\n\nIf I consider the system of equations for X,Y,Z (products ab,ac,bc),\n\nwhich gave us ab=6, ac=2+4d, bc=3+6d,\n\nthis is consistent with a=2,b=3,c=1+2d,\n\nand thus,\n\nxyz=2^{a +b +c}*3^{...},\n\nbut the exponents for 3 are dependent on S1,S2,S3,\n\nwhich requires solving numerically.\n\nHowever, given that this is a competition problem,\n\nthere must be an exact solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^6 *3^5,\n\nbut I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that,\n\nFrom the earlier equations,\n\nab=6,\n\nac=2+4d,\n\nbc=3+6d,\n\nMultiply all three equations:\n\n(ab)(ac)(bc)=6*(2+4d)*(3+6d),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2=6*(2+4d)*(3+6d),\n\nTake square root,\n\nabc= sqrt[6*(2+4d)*(3+6d)}.\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{a +b +c}*3^{ (4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3)}.\n\nBut unless the exponents for 3 simplify,\n\nthis might not help.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"compute the smallest possible value of xyz\",\n\nmaybe the minimal xyz is achieved when the exponents for 3 are zero,\n\nbut then the equations' RHS have 3 exponents,\n\nso that is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal xyz is when all variables are proportional,\n\nbut given the problem's symmetry,\n\nmaybe the minimal xyz is 2^{(a+b+c)} *3^{(e_x +e_y +e_z)},\n\nwith the minimal exponents,\n\nbut I think I need to accept that the minimal xyz is computed as follows:\n\nGiven that a=2, b=3, c=1+2d,\n\nand d=log\u20823,\n\nthen,\n\nxyz=2^{6+2d}*3^{T},\n\nwhere T=4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nwhich from the product approach must equal 2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nwith S=6+2d,\n\nTherefore,\n\nxyz=2^{6+2d} *3^{T}=2^{S} *3^{T},\n\nand also,\n\nxyz=2^{11/S} *3^{10/S},\n\nThus equate:\n\n2^{S}*3^{T}=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\n\u21922^{S -11/S} *3^{T -10/S}=1,\n\nSince 2 and 3 are primes,\n\ntheir exponents must both be zero,\n\nThus,\n\nS -11/S =0 \u21d2S\u00b2=11,\n\nand T -10/S=0 \u21d2T=10/S,\n\nBut S\u00b2=11 \u21d2S=\u221a11,\n\nBut S = a +b +c =6+2d,\n\nThus,\n\n6+2d=\u221a11,\n\nBut d=log\u20823,\n\nThus,\n\nd=(\u221a11 -6)/2,\n\nBut this is impossible because d=log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nand (\u221a11 -6)/2\u2248(3.3166-6)/2\u2248-1.3417,\n\nNegative,\n\nThus contradiction,\n\nTherefore, my assumption is wrong,\n\nThus the minimal xyz is achieved when S is as large as possible,\n\nbut given the equations,\n\nthe variables a,b,c are fixed as 2,3,1+2d,\n\nso S is fixed as 6+2d,\n\nand thus xyz is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal xyz is 2^{6+2d}*3^{T},\n\nwhere T=4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nbut with the values computed numerically,\n\nwe have:\n\nS1\u224810.59,\n\nS2\u22489.16,\n\nS3\u22486.64,\n\nThus,\n\nT\u22484/10.59 +6/9.16 +10/6.64\u22480.3777 +0.655 +1.506\u22482.538,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz\u22482^{9.1699}*3^{2.538},\n\nBut to find an exact value,\n\nnotice that,\n\nWith a=2,b=3,c=1+2d,\n\nthe exponents for 3 are:\n\nd_x=4/S1,\n\ne=6/S2,\n\nf=10/S3,\n\nand,\n\nS1 =3 +c +d*(e +f),\n\nc=1+2d,\n\nThus,\n\nS1=4+2d +d*(6/S2 +10/S3),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nS2=2 +c +d*(f +d_x),\n\n=3+2d +d*(f +4/S1),\n\nS3=5 +d*(4/S1 +6/S2),\n\nThis system can be solved exactly by assuming that:\n\nLet me assume that,\n\nLet me set S1 = \u03b1,\n\nS2 = \u03b2,\n\nS3 = \u03b3,\n\nThen,\n\n\u03b1=4+2d +d*(6/\u03b2 +10/\u03b3),\n\n\u03b2=3+2d +d*(10/\u03b3 +4/\u03b1),\n\n\u03b3=5 +d*(4/\u03b1 +6/\u03b2),\n\nThis system may have a solution where \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 are proportional to the coefficients,\n\nbut I need to find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that,\n\nLet me set \u03b1 =k,\n\n\u03b2 =k,\n\n\u03b3 =k,\n\nthen,\n\nk=4+2d +d*(6/k +10/k),\n\n=k,\n\nwhich gives,\n\nk=4+2d +d*(16/k),\n\nMultiply by k,\n\nk\u00b2=4k +2dk +16d,\n\nk\u00b2 - (4+2d)k -16d=0,\n\nSolution,\n\nk=(4+2d \u00b1sqrt((4+2d)^2 +64d))/2,\n\n= (4+2d \u00b1sqrt(16+16d +4d\u00b2 +64d))/2,\n\n= (4+2d \u00b1sqrt(4d\u00b2+80d +16))/2,\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nFrom the earlier result,\n\nthe product approach gives,\n\nxyz=2^{11/S}*3^{10/S},\n\nwith S= a+b+c,\n\nwhich with S=6+2d,\n\nthen,\n\nxyz=2^{11/(6+2d)} *3^{10/(6+2d)}},\n\nThus,\n\nxyz= (2^{11} *3^{10})^{1/(6+2d)}},\n\nBut 2^{11}*3^{10}=2048*59049=2048*59049,\n\nBut this is a huge number,\n\nHowever,\n\nthe problem asks for the smallest possible xyz,\n\nso perhaps this is the minimal value,\n\nbut expressed as (2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070)^{1/(6+2log\u20823)}},\n\nwhich can be simplified as follows,\n\nLet me write 6+2log\u20823=log\u20822\u2076 +log\u20823\u00b2=log\u2082(64*9)=log\u2082576,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=(2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070)^{1/log\u2082576}= (2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070)^{log_576 2},\n\nsince 1/log\u2082576 = log_5762,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{11 * log_5762} *3^{10 * log_5762},\n\nThis is a valid expression but not in a simplified form,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nxyz= (2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070)^{1/log\u2082576} =576^{(log_576(2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070))},\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me compute 6+2log\u20823,\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s compute log\u20823\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\n6+2*1.58496\u22486+3.16992\u22489.16992,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz\u2248(2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070)^{1/9.16992},\n\nBut 2\u00b9\u00b9=2048,\n\n3\u00b9\u2070=59049,\n\nThus,\n\n2\u00b9\u00b93\u00b9\u2070\u22482048*59049\u2248120932352,\n\nThen,\n\nxyz\u2248120932352^{1/9.16992},\n\nBut this is approximately e^{(ln(120932352)/9.16992)}\u2248e^{18.608/9.16992}\u2248e^{2.03}\u22487.6,\n\nBut this is an approximate value,\n\nBut the problem likely expects an exact form,\n\nwhich would be:\n\nxyz= (2^{11}3^{10})^{1/(6+2log\u20823)}},\n\nwhich can be written as:\n\nxyz= 2^{11/(6+2log\u20823)} *3^{10/(6+2log\u20823)}},\n\nBut the problem says to put the final answer in boxed, so maybe this is the simplest form,\n\nbut likely there's a better way.\n\nWait, going back to the initial substitution where a=2, b=3, c=1+2d,\n\nthen,\n\nxyz=2^{2+3+1+2d}*3^{(4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3)}},\n\nBut since the problem states that xyz should be minimal,\n\nand since the exponents for 3 are dependent on S1,S2,S3,\n\nwhich we found numerically to be approximately 2.538,\n\nthen,\n\nxyz\u22482^{9.1699}*3^{2.538},\n\nBut converting back to the original variables,\n\nsince d=log\u20823,\n\nthen,\n\n2^{2d}=3\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n2^{6+2d}=2^6*2^{2d}=64*9=576,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{6+2d} *3^{T}=576 *3^{T},\n\nwith T\u22482.538,\n\nwhich is approximately576*3^{2.538},\n\nbut this isn't helpful,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact exponents for 3 are 5,\n\nsince 2.538 is approximately5/2,\n\nbut not exactly,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^6 *3^5,\n\nwhich is 64*243=15552,\n\nBut I need to check.\n\nWait, let me compute,\n\nIf T=5,\n\nxyz=576*3^5=576*243=139968,\n\nBut with T\u22482.538,\n\n3^{2.538}=3^{2+0.538}=9*3^{0.538},\n\n3^{0.5}=\u221a3\u22481.732,\n\n3^{0.538}=e^{0.538 ln3}\u2248e^{0.538*1.0986}\u2248e^{0.591}\u22481.806,\n\nThus,\n\n3^{2.538}\u22489*1.806\u224816.254,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz\u2248576*16.254\u22489354,\n\nBut I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2\u00b2 *3\u2075,\n\nbut that is4*243=972,\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^6 *3^5=64*243=15552,\n\nBut I need to see if this fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2^6 *3^5,\n\nwhich is 15552,\n\nor 2^5 *3^6= 32*729=23328,\n\nBut I need to see from the equations.\n\nWait, given that,\n\nxyz=2^{a +b +c}3^{T},\n\nwhere a +b +c=6+2d,\n\nand T=4/S1 +6/S2 +10/S3,\n\nand S1,S2,S3 are related to the equations,\n\nbut since the problem is likely to have a elegant solution,\n\nperhaps the minimal xyz is 2^6*3^5,\n\nso the answer is \\boxed{2^6 \\cdot 3^5},\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nWait, let me compute with the exact values:\n\nGiven a=2,b=3,c=1+2d,\n\nthen,\n\nxyz=2^{2+3+1+2d}*3^{T},\n\n=2^{6+2d}*3^{T},\n\nBut
