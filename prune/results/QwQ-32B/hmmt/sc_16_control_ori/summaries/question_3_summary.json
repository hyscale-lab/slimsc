      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have three equations involving logarithms and exponents with variables x, y, z. The goal is to find the smallest possible value of xyz. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, logarithms and exponents... Maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to simplify these equations? Since logarithms can help turn exponents into multipliers, which might make things more manageable. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each equation with a logarithm. Let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation. That might be helpful because the exponents are in terms of log base 2.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\right) \\)\n\nUsing logarithm properties, the left side becomes \\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(yz) \\). The right side is \\( \\log_2(2^8) + \\log_2(3^4) \\), which simplifies to 8 + 4 log_2(3).\n\nSimilarly, let's write that out:\n\n1. \\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(yz) = 8 + 4 \\log_2(3) \\)\n\nSame process for the second equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^9 \\cdot 3^6 \\right) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(y) \\cdot \\log_2(zx) \\)\nRight side: 9 + 6 log_2(3)\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\n2. \\( \\log_2(y) \\cdot \\log_2(zx) = 9 + 6 \\log_2(3) \\)\n\nThird equation similarly:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( z^{\\log_2(xy)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^5 \\cdot 3^{10} \\right) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(z) \\cdot \\log_2(xy) \\)\nRight side: 5 + 10 log_2(3)\n\nSo equation 3 becomes:\n\n3. \\( \\log_2(z) \\cdot \\log_2(xy) = 5 + 10 \\log_2(3) \\)\n\nHmm, now these equations look a bit complicated, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let me denote some variables to simplify the notation. Let me let:\n\nLet \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). Since x, y, z are positive real numbers, their logs are defined.\n\nAlso, let me denote \\( \\log_2 3 = k \\). Since log_2(3) is a constant, I can just call that k for simplicity. So k = log_2(3). Then, 3 can be written as 2^k, but maybe that's not necessary here. Let me see.\n\nExpressing everything in terms of a, b, c, and k.\n\nFirst, note that:\n\n- log_2(yz) = log_2 y + log_2 z = b + c\n- log_2(zx) = log_2 z + log_2 x = c + a\n- log_2(xy) = log_2 x + log_2 y = a + b\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equations:\n\n1. \\( a \\cdot (b + c) = 8 + 4k \\)\n2. \\( b \\cdot (c + a) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c \\cdot (a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nSo now we have three equations with variables a, b, c, and constants 8,9,5 and k (which is log_2 3). The goal is to find the minimal xyz. Since xyz is 2^{a + b + c}, because log_2(xyz) = a + b + c. Therefore, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize (a + b + c), since the function 2^{s} is increasing in s. Therefore, the minimal xyz corresponds to the minimal value of a + b + c.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to solving for a, b, c in these equations, and then compute a + b + c, then take 2^{that} to get xyz, and find its minimal value.\n\nWait, but since the equations are linear in terms of products, maybe we can set up variables such that we can solve for a + b + c?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can denote S = a + b + c, and then perhaps express each equation in terms of S?\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nThen, the first equation is a*(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly, second equation: b*(S - b) = 9 +6k,\n\nThird equation: c*(S - c) =5 +10k\n\nHmm, that might be a way to approach it. Let's check that:\n\nBecause if S = a + b + c, then (b + c) = S - a, so equation 1 is a*(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for the others. So, each equation can be written as variable*(S - variable) = the RHS.\n\nSo, that gives us three equations:\n\n1. a(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\n2. b(S - b) = 9 +6k,\n\n3. c(S - c) =5 +10k,\n\nNow, perhaps we can write each variable squared in terms of S and the RHS:\n\nEquation 1: aS - a\u00b2 = 8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation 2: bS - b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS -c\u00b2=5 +10k,\n\nIf we rearrange each equation:\n\na\u00b2 - aS + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nb\u00b2 -bS + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nc\u00b2 -cS + (5 +10k)=0,\n\nHmm, so each variable is a root of a quadratic equation. Since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nThe discriminant for equation 1: S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly for others:\n\nDiscriminant for equation2: S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k) \u22650,\n\nDiscriminant for equation3: S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650,\n\nHmm, but since we are to find S such that all these equations are satisfied, and the variables a,b,c are real. But perhaps instead of going that way, maybe we can find S such that the three quadratics for a, b, c have solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding all three equations together?\n\nLet me see:\n\nAdding equations 1,2,3:\n\na(S -a) + b(S - b) + c(S -c) = (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) = (8+9+5) + (4+6+10)k =22 +20k\n\nLeft side:\n\naS -a\u00b2 + bS -b\u00b2 + cS -c\u00b2 = S(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nBut S = a + b + c, so:\n\nLeft side = S^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =22 +20k,\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)\n\nHmm, but not sure how helpful that is yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables a, b, c as roots of some equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of S?\n\nSuppose we let\u2019s consider each variable a is a solution to a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nTherefore, a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. Since a, b, c are real, each discriminant must be non-negative, so S\u00b2 - 4*(8+4k) \u22650, S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k) \u22650, S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k)\u22650.\n\nThe third discriminant is the smallest: S\u00b2 \u22654*(5+10k),\n\nSo, the critical one is S\u00b2 must be at least the maximum of these terms. But perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that a, b, c satisfy those quadratic equations, so perhaps we can write that the variables a, b, c are the roots of three different quadratics with the same S. Hmm, but they are different quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the variables a, b, c are related in some way, such that if I can find expressions for a, b, c in terms of S, then maybe we can set up equations to solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider that since we have three equations, perhaps if I can write equations for (a + b + c) and also for a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, then perhaps use the relation between them?\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)\n\nAlso, we know that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S\u00b2 -22 -20k) + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nTherefore,\n\n0 = -22 -20k + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nHence,\n\nab + bc + ac = (22 +20k)/2 =11 +10k\n\nHmm, so ab + bc + ac =11 +10k.\n\nBut also, perhaps we can get expressions for ab, bc, ac from the original equations?\n\nWait, looking back at the original equations, which in terms of a,b,c are:\n\n1. a(b + c) =8 +4k,\n\nBut since b +c = S -a,\n\nSo equation1: a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nIf we expand all three equations, we can get:\n\nEquation1: aS - a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: bS - b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS - c\u00b2 =5 +10k,\n\nSo, adding them up gives the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for ab, ac, bc?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply all three original equations?\n\nWait, the original equations before taking logs were:\n\nx^{log_2(yz)} = 2^8 3^4,\n\nSimilarly for y and z. Maybe taking the product of all three equations?\n\nLet me see:\n\nMultiply left sides: x^{log_2(yz)} * y^{log_2(zx)} * z^{log_2(xy)}.\n\nMultiply right sides: (2^8 3^4)(2^9 3^6)(2^5 3^{10}) =2^{8+9+5}*3^{4+6+10}=2^{22}*3^{20}\n\nNow, the left side:\n\nWe can try to simplify the left side expression. Let me see:\n\nx^{log_2(yz)} * y^{log_2(zx)} * z^{log_2(xy)}.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the property that a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}?\n\nWait, that might be helpful. Let me recall that identity: a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a}\n\nYes, that's a logarithmic identity. Let me verify:\n\nTake log base b of both sides: log_b (a^{\\log_b c}) = log_b c * log_b a,\n\nOn the right side, log_b (c^{\\log_b a}) = log_b a * log_b c,\n\nSo they are equal. Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can use that here.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term: x^{log_2(yz)} = (yz)^{log_2 x}\n\nSecond term: y^{log_2(zx)} = (zx)^{log_2 y}\n\nThird term: z^{log_2(xy)} = (xy)^{log_2 z}\n\nTherefore, multiplying all three terms together:\n\n(yz)^{log_2 x} * (zx)^{log_2 y} * (xy)^{log_2 z}\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n= y^{log_2 x} z^{log_2 x} * z^{log_2 y} x^{log_2 y} * x^{log_2 z} y^{log_2 z}\n\nNow, grouping similar terms:\n\nFor x terms:\n\nz^{log_2 x} * x^{log_2 y} * x^{log_2 z}\n\nWait, actually, let me reorganize all the terms:\n\nLet me collect all the x terms, y terms, z terms.\n\nLooking at each variable's exponents:\n\nFirst, for x:\n\nIn the first term: y^{log2x} contributes nothing to x,\n\nSecond term: z^{log2x} contributes z^{log2x} but that's a z term,\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of exponents with base 2 and 3? Since the right-hand side is 2^{22}*3^{20}, which might hint that xyz has exponents in terms of 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider taking logarithms of the product equation?\n\nWait, let's go back to the product of the left side:\n\nLeft side after using the identity is:\n\n(yz)^{log_2 x} * (zx)^{log_2 y} * (xy)^{log_2 z}\n\nLet me write each term as:\n\n= y^{log2x} z^{log2x} * z^{log2y} x^{log2y} * x^{log2z} y^{log2z}\n\nNow, let's collect the exponents for each variable:\n\nFor x:\n\nFrom the second term: x^{log2y}\n\nFrom the third term: x^{log2z}\n\nSo total exponent for x: log2y + log2z\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\nFrom first term: log2x\n\nFrom third term: log2z\n\nTotal exponent for y: log2x + log2z\n\nFor z:\n\nFrom first term: log2x\n\nFrom second term: log2y\n\nTotal exponent for z: log2x + log2y\n\nWait, so putting it all together:\n\nLeft side = x^{(log2y + log2z)} * y^{(log2x + log2z)} * z^{(log2x + log2y)}\n\nHmm, but note that log2y + log2z = log2(yz), similarly for others. Wait, but that's exactly the original exponents. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't simplifying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take the entire left side expression and write exponents in terms of a, b, c where a=log2x, etc.\n\nLet me try that. Since a = log2x, b=log2y, c=log2z,\n\nThen log2(yz) = log2y + log2z = b + c,\n\nSimilarly, log2(zx)=c + a,\n\nlog2(xy) =a + b,\n\nTherefore, the original left side product is:\n\nx^{b + c} * y^{c + a} * z^{a + b}\n\nBut x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c,\n\nTherefore substituting:\n\n(2^a)^{b + c} * (2^b)^{c + a} * (2^c)^{a + b}\n\n= 2^{a(b + c)} * 2^{b(c + a)} * 2^{c(a + b)}\n\n= 2^{a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b)}\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\na(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = ab + ac + bc + ab + ca + cb = 2(ab + ac + bc)\n\nTherefore, the left side is 2^{2(ab + bc + ac)}.\n\nThe right side is 2^{22}*3^{20}. Wait, but this complicates things because there's a 3^{20} term. Hmm, so this approach may not align, unless there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, actually, the right side of the product of the original equations was 2^{22}*3^{20}. However, the left side after substitution is 2^{2(ab + bc + ac)}. But the right side includes 3^{20} as well. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps this approach is not directly helpful, since we have mixed bases. The left side is a power of 2, but the right side has both 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this path isn't the way to go. Maybe I need to go back to the equations in terms of a, b, c.\n\nRecall that we had earlier:\n\nab + bc + ac = 11 +10k (since S\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac) = (S\u00b2 -22 -20k) + 2(ab + bc + ac), leading to ab + bc + ac =11 +10k )\n\nWait, but how is that possible? Let me recheck that step.\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nWe had:\n\nAfter adding the three equations:\n\nLeft side: S^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 +20k,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S^2 - (22 +20k),\n\nThen, since (a + b + c)^2 = S^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac),\n\nSubstitute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\nS^2 = [S^2 -22 -20k] + 2(ab + bc + ac),\n\nSubtract S\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 = -22 -20k + 2(ab + bc + ac),\n\nThus,\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) =22 +20k,\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nab + bc + ac =11 +10k,\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo we have ab + bc + ac =11 +10k,\n\nwhere k = log23.\n\nHmm, but how does that help us?\n\nPerhaps we can also find expressions for ab, bc, and ac individually?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nWe have:\n\n1. a(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nWhich can be rewritten as,\n\naS -a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. bS - b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\n3. cS -c\u00b2 =5 +10k,\n\nIf I can express a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2 from each equation:\n\na\u00b2 = aS - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = bS - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = cS - (5 +10k),\n\nTherefore, plugging these into the expression for a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (aS -8 -4k) + (bS -9 -6k) + (cS -5 -10k)\n\n= S(a + b + c) - (8 +9 +5) - (4k +6k +10k)\n\n= S^2 -22 -20k,\n\nWhich matches the previous result, so that checks out.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that S is the variable we need to find, and the equations can be written as quadratics in a, b, c. Since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminant must be non-negative, so for each variable, the discriminant of their quadratic equation must be non-negative.\n\nTherefore, for a:\n\nThe quadratic equation is a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nDiscriminant D_a = S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFor b:\n\nD_b = S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k) \u22650,\n\nFor c:\n\nD_c = S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650,\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible S must satisfy all three discriminant conditions:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(9 +6k) (since 9+6k is larger than 8 +4k and 5+10k?)\n\nWait, let's compute 8 +4k, 9 +6k, 5 +10k numerically? Maybe approximate k?\n\nWait, since k = log23 \u22481.58496,\n\nTherefore:\n\n8+4k \u22488 +4*1.58496\u22488 +6.33984\u224814.33984,\n\n9 +6k\u22489 +6*1.58496\u22489+9.50976\u224818.50976,\n\n5 +10k\u22485 +10*1.58496\u22485 +15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nTherefore,\n\nD_a requires S\u00b2 \u22654*(14.33984)\u224857.359,\n\nD_b requires S\u00b2 \u22654*(18.50976)\u224874.039,\n\nD_c requires S\u00b2 \u22654*(20.8496)\u224883.398,\n\nTherefore, the most restrictive condition is D_c, so S\u00b2 must be at least approximately83.4, so S \u2265sqrt(83.398)\u22489.132.\n\nBut maybe we can keep things exact with k instead of approximating.\n\nTherefore, to have real solutions, S must satisfy S\u00b2 \u22654*(5 +10k).\n\nBut we need to find S such that all three quadratics have real roots, and also that a,b,c are real numbers such that their quadratics give valid a,b,c.\n\nBut how do we find S?\n\nAlternatively, since we have three equations involving a,b,c and S, perhaps we can set up equations to solve for S.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s write each variable in terms of S.\n\nFrom equation1:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nTherefore, a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut since a, b, c are positive real numbers (since x,y,z are positive reals, their logs a,b,c can be any real numbers, but the original variables x=2^a, etc., must be positive, so a,b,c can be any real numbers. Wait, but the problem states x,y,z are positive real numbers, so a,b,c can be any real numbers, but the equations require that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal S is the minimal S that allows all the quadratics to have real roots, but also such that a,b,c can be selected so that they satisfy all three equations. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that a, b, c must satisfy all three quadratics and also sum to S. So perhaps we can set up equations such that the three variables a, b,c are roots of some equation?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation t^3 - St^2 + Pt - Q =0,\n\nWhere P=ab + bc + ac=11 +10k,\n\nand Q=abc,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express abc in terms of S?\n\nHmm, but unless we have another equation involving abc, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that we can write the three equations as:\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\nb(S -b) -a(S -a) = (9 +6k) - (8 +4k),\n\nWhich becomes,\n\nbS -b\u00b2 -aS +a\u00b2 =1 +2k,\n\nFactor terms,\n\nS(b -a) + (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)=1 +2k,\n\nNote that a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 = (a -b)(a + b),\n\nThus,\n\nS(b -a) + (a - b)(a + b) =1 +2k,\n\nFactor (b -a):\n\n(b -a)[ S - (a + b) ] =1 +2k,\n\nNote that a + b = S - c,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(b -a)[ S - (S -c) ] = (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nSimilarly, perhaps subtract other equations?\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation3:\n\nc(S -c) -a(S -a)= (5 +10k)-(8 +4k)= -3 +6k,\n\nWhich is,\n\ncS -c\u00b2 -aS +a\u00b2 = -3 +6k,\n\nFactor,\n\nS(c -a) + (a\u00b2 -c\u00b2)= -3 +6k,\n\nAgain, a\u00b2 -c\u00b2 = (a -c)(a + c),\n\nSo,\n\nS(c -a) + (a -c)(a +c)= -3 +6k,\n\nFactor (c -a):\n\n(c -a)[ S - (a + c) ] = -3 +6k,\n\nNote that a + c = S - b,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(c -a)[ S - (S - b) ] = (c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nThus,\n\n(c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation2 - equation3:\n\nb(S -b) -c(S -c)= (9 +6k) - (5 +10k)=4 -4k,\n\nThus,\n\nbS -b\u00b2 -cS +c\u00b2 =4 -4k,\n\nFactor,\n\nS(b -c) + (c\u00b2 -b\u00b2)=4 -4k,\n\nc\u00b2 -b\u00b2 = (c -b)(c +b),\n\nThus,\n\nS(b -c) + (c -b)(c + b)=4 -4k,\n\nFactor (b -c):\n\n(b -c)[ S - (c + b) ] =4 -4k,\n\nAgain, c +b = S -a,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -c)[ S - (S -a) ] = (b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\n2. (c -a)b =-3 +6k,\n\n3. (b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, these equations relate the differences between a, b, c with the constants. Maybe we can solve these equations along with the previous ones?\n\nLet me note the three equations:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation A: (b - a)c = 1 + 2k,\n\nEquation B: (c - a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (b - c)a =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, perhaps express variables in terms of differences. Let me consider variables like d = b - a, e = c - a, so that b = a + d, c = a + e. Then express everything in terms of a, d, e. Maybe that could lead somewhere, but this might get too involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can solve for variables step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations A, B, C as a system of equations with variables (b -a), (c -a), (b -c), etc. Let me see if we can combine them.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom Equation A: (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)b =-3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of a, b, c, but this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can add equations A, B, C in some way?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me note that (b - a)c + (c - a)b + (b - c)a\n\n= (b -a)c + (c -a)b + (b -c)a,\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term: (b -a)c = bc -ac,\n\nSecond term: (c -a)b = bc -ab,\n\nThird term: (b -c)a =ab -ac,\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\n(bc -ac) + (bc -ab) + (ab -ac) = bc -ac + bc -ab + ab -ac = 2bc -2ac,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to solve equations A, B, C for the variables.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote equation A:\n\n(b - a)c =1 +2k --> equation A\n\nEquation B:\n\n(c - a)b = -3 +6k --> equation B\n\nEquation C:\n\n(b - c)a =4 -4k --> equation C\n\nLet me try to solve these three equations for the variables a, b, c.\n\nLet me express each equation as:\n\nFrom equation A: (b -a) = (1 +2k)/c,\n\nFrom equation B: (c -a) = (-3 +6k)/b,\n\nFrom equation C: (b -c) = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write these as:\n\nLet me define:\n\nEquation A rewritten:\n\nb = a + (1 +2k)/c,\n\nEquation B rewritten:\n\nc = a + (-3 +6k)/b,\n\nEquation C rewritten:\n\nb = c + (4 -4k)/a,\n\nHmm, so now we have expressions for b and c in terms of a and other variables. Maybe substitute these into each other?\n\nLet me substitute equation A's expression for b into equation B's equation.\n\nFrom equation B: c = a + [ -3 +6k ] / b,\n\nBut b is expressed from equation A as b = a + (1 +2k)/c,\n\nTherefore,\n\nc = a + [ -3 +6k ] / [ a + (1 +2k)/c ]\n\nThis seems complicated, but let me write it as:\n\nLet me denote D = -3 +6k,\n\nand E = 1 +2k,\n\nSo, c = a + D / (a + E/c )\n\nThis is getting a bit messy, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations A, B, C as a linear system. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me set variables u = b -a,\n\nv = c -a,\n\nthen,\n\nb = a + u,\n\nc = a + v,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation A: (b -a)c = u*(a + v) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)*b = v*(a + u) = -3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (b -c)*a = (u - v)*a =4 -4k,\n\nSo now we have three equations in terms of u, v, a.\n\nEquation1: u(a + v) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation2: v(a + u) =-3 +6k,\n\nEquation3: (u -v)a =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve this system.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom equations1 and 2, maybe we can express (a + v) and (a + u):\n\nLet me write equation1 as:\n\nu(a + v) =1 +2k --> (a + v) = (1 +2k)/u,\n\nEquation2 as:\n\nv(a + u) =-3 +6k --> (a + u) = (-3 +6k)/v,\n\nThen,\n\nFrom equation3,\n\n(u - v)a =4 -4k,\n\nLet me see if we can express a from equation3,\n\na = (4 -4k)/(u -v),\n\nAssuming u \u2260 v,\n\nTherefore, substituting a into equations for (a + v) and (a + u):\n\nFirst,\n\na + v = (4 -4k)/(u -v) + v = [4 -4k + v(u -v)]/(u -v),\n\nSet equal to (1 +2k)/u,\n\nThus,\n\n[4 -4k + v(u -v)]/(u -v) = (1 +2k)/u,\n\nCross multiply:\n\nu[4 -4k + v(u -v)] = (1 +2k)(u -v),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSecond equation:\n\na + u = (4 -4k)/(u -v) + u = [4 -4k + u(u -v)]/(u -v),\n\nSet equal to (-3 +6k)/v,\n\nThus,\n\n[4 -4k + u(u -v)]/(u -v) = (-3 +6k)/v,\n\nCross multiply:\n\nv[4 -4k + u(u -v)] = (-3 +6k)(u -v),\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved. Maybe this approach is not the best. Perhaps I need to consider trying to express variables in terms of S and see if we can find S.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have three equations involving a, b, c and S. Since S = a + b + c,\n\nPerhaps we can let\u2019s consider variables a, b, c as variables and S as a parameter, and set up the equations to solve for S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the three quadratic equations for a, b, c must have solutions such that a + b + c = S,\n\nSo perhaps for each variable, the quadratic equation has two roots, so in total there are multiple possibilities, but perhaps the minimal S is when all variables take the smaller root? Or the larger?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S corresponds to the case where all variables a, b, c take the smaller roots of their respective quadratics?\n\nWait, for each quadratic equation like a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nthe two roots are [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nThus, the smaller root is [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D)]/2, where D is discriminant,\n\nand the larger root is [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 - D)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nTo minimize S, perhaps we need to set a, b, c to the smaller roots? Because if we take smaller roots, their sum might be smaller?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a symmetric solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S as follows.\n\nLet me think, since each variable satisfies x\u00b2 - Sx + C =0, where C is a constant for each variable. The sum of roots for each equation would be S, and the product is C.\n\nWait, for each quadratic equation:\n\nFor a: the quadratic equation is a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nThus, the two roots are a1 and a2 such that a1 + a2 = S,\n\nand a1*a2 =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for b: roots are b1 + b2=S,\n\nand b1*b2=9 +6k,\n\nFor c: roots c1 +c2 =S,\n\nand c1*c2=5 +10k,\n\nThus, since a, b, c are each one of the roots of their respective quadratics, but they must also satisfy a +b +c=S,\n\nHmm, so perhaps a, b, c are selected such that each is a root from their quadratic, and their sum is S.\n\nTherefore, suppose that a is a root of the first quadratic,\n\nb of the second,\n\nc of the third,\n\nand a + b + c = S,\n\nTherefore, the possible solutions are combinations where each variable takes one root from their quadratic, and the sum is S.\n\nBut this is quite abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each variable, the two roots add to S, so if we take one root from each quadratic, their sum would be S only if each variable takes the root such that when added, the total is S.\n\nWait, for example, suppose a is the root of first quadratic: a + a' = S,\n\nSimilarly b + b' = S,\n\nc + c' = S,\n\nThen, if we take a, b, c such that a + b + c = S,\n\nthen,\n\n(S -a') + (S -b') + (S -c') = S,\n\nSo 3S - (a' + b' + c') = S,\n\nThus,\n\n2S = a' + b' + c',\n\nBut also, the products for each quadratic:\n\na*a' =8 +4k,\n\nb*b'=9 +6k,\n\nc*c'=5 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\na'*b'*c' = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k)/ (a b c),\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we set a = a1, b =b1, c =c1, the roots that sum to S,\n\nWait, but this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, since each pair of roots for each variable sums to S, then if we pick a root from each quadratic such that their sum is S,\n\nthen:\n\nSuppose a is a root of first quadratic,\n\nthen a' = S -a,\n\nSimilarly, b = S - b',\n\nc = S -c',\n\nBut then the sum a + b + c = S,\n\nSo,\n\na + b + c = S,\n\nBut also,\n\na + (S - b') + (S -c') = S,\n\nSo,\n\n2S - (b' + c') + a =S,\n\nThus,\n\na = (b' +c') -S,\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, let me think numerically. Since k is a constant (log23), perhaps I can plug in k= log23 and try to solve numerically?\n\nBut since the problem asks for an exact answer, perhaps there's a way to find S algebraically.\n\nLet me think: we have three equations for a, b, c:\n\n1. a(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(S - b)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(S - c)=5 +10k,\n\nand S =a +b +c,\n\nAlso, from previous, we have ab + bc + ac =11 +10k,\n\nLet me consider that if we can write the three equations as:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nb\u00b2 -Sb + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nc\u00b2 -Sc + (5 +10k)=0,\n\nSo, each variable satisfies its own quadratic equation with the same S.\n\nLet me consider that these three quadratics must have a common S such that their roots a, b, c add up to S, and their pairwise products add to 11 +10k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation?\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation:\n\nx\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + (11 +10k)x - Q =0,\n\nwhere Q = abc,\n\nBut since each of a, b, c also satisfies their own quadratic equations, perhaps we can find such a cubic?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substitute each equation into the cubic.\n\nAlternatively, since a\u00b2 = Sa - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 =Sb - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 =Sc - (5 +10k),\n\nSo, in the cubic equation, if we can express x\u00b3 in terms of lower degree terms.\n\nLet me see, take the cubic equation:\n\nx\u00b3 = Sx\u00b2 - (11 +10k)x + Q,\n\nBut for x =a,\n\na\u00b3 = S a\u00b2 - (11 +10k)a + Q,\n\nBut a\u00b2 = Sa - (8 +4k),\n\nSo substitute:\n\na\u00b3 = S*(Sa - (8 +4k)) - (11 +10k)a + Q,\n\n= S\u00b2 a - S(8+4k) - (11+10k)a + Q,\n\nSimilarly, rearranged:\n\na\u00b3 - [S\u00b2 - (11 +10k)]a + [ -S(8 +4k) + Q ] =0,\n\nBut since a is a root of the cubic equation, this must equal zero. Therefore, this must hold for a, b, c.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients must satisfy:\n\nThe coefficient of a must be zero, so:\n\nS\u00b2 - (11 +10k) =0,\n\nWait, but that would require S\u00b2 =11 +10k,\n\nBut that might not hold unless... Hmm, but this must hold for all variables a, b, c,\n\nTherefore, the coefficient must be zero, so:\n\nS\u00b2 - (11 +10k) =0,\n\nand\n\n- S(8 +4k) + Q =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\nQ = S(8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly, the same would apply for b and c, so that:\n\nFor variable b,\n\nb\u00b3 = S b\u00b2 - (11 +10k)b + Q,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - (9 +6k),\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b3 = S*(Sb - (9 +6k)) - (11 +10k)b + Q,\n\n= S\u00b2 b - S(9 +6k) - (11 +10k)b + Q,\n\nThen,\n\nb\u00b3 - [S\u00b2 - (11 +10k)]b + [ -S(9 +6k) + Q ] =0,\n\nAgain, coefficients must be zero,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 - (11 +10k) =0,\n\nand,\n\n- S(9 +6k) + Q =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\nQ = S(9 +6k),\n\nBut previously, Q = S(8 +4k),\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions for Q,\n\nS(8 +4k) = S(9 +6k),\n\nAssuming S \u22600,\n\n8 +4k =9 +6k,\n\nThus,\n\n-1 =2k,\n\nBut k = log23 \u22481.58496,\n\nWhich is not possible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction, meaning that the assumption that a, b, c are roots of such a cubic is invalid unless S=0, which it can't be.\n\nHmm, so that approach must be wrong. Maybe the cubic idea isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption. Maybe this suggests that there's no solution unless the equations are consistent, but since the problem states that x, y, z exist, there must be a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the equations must be consistent, so the contradictions I found imply that S must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFrom the above, in trying to form the cubic, we get that Q must be both S*(8+4k) and S*(9 +6k), leading to 8+4k=9+6k,\n\nWhich gives k= -0.5,\n\nBut k = log23 \u22481.58496,\n\nWhich is a contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that unless the problem has a specific value of S that allows the cubic to exist, but since the problem gives fixed RHS terms, perhaps this implies that the equations are consistent only when S is chosen such that the required conditions hold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find S such that the three quadratics have roots a, b, c that sum to S, and their pairwise products sum to 11+10k. This might require solving for S numerically?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up equations based on the three quadratics.\n\nLet me consider that each of a, b, c must satisfy their quadratic equations. Let me suppose that a, b, c are the roots of their respective quadratics, so:\n\na1 and a2 are roots of a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nTherefore, the possible values for a are [S \u00b1 sqrt(D_a)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nBut since a + b + c = S,\n\nSuppose we choose a = [S + sqrt(D_a)]/2,\n\nb = [S + sqrt(D_b)]/2,\n\nc = [S + sqrt(D_c)]/2,\n\nBut then their sum would be greater than S,\n\nAlternatively, if we choose the smaller roots for each,\n\na = [S - sqrt(D_a)]/2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(D_b)]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(D_c)]/2,\n\nThen,\n\na + b + c = [3S - (sqrt(D_a) + sqrt(D_b) + sqrt(D_c))]/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\n3S - (sqrt(D_a) + sqrt(D_b) + sqrt(D_c)) = 2S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = sqrt(D_a) + sqrt(D_b) + sqrt(D_c),\n\nWhere D_a = S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k),\n\nD_b = S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k),\n\nD_c = S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k),\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -32 -16k) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -36 -24k) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -20 -40k),\n\nThis equation would allow us to solve for S, but it's highly non-linear and complex. Solving this algebraically might be impossible, so perhaps we can substitute k = log23 and solve numerically?\n\nGiven that the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, perhaps there's a trick I haven't seen yet.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, maybe there's a substitution we can do earlier.\n\nLet me think again about the original equations:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 3^4,\n\nSimilarly for y and z.\n\nSuppose we take log base 2 of both sides, as we did earlier, leading to:\n\nlog2x * log2(yz) = log2(2^8 3^4) =8 +4 log23,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet m = log2x,\n\nn = log2y,\n\np = log2z,\n\nSo the first equation becomes:\n\nm*(n + p) =8 +4k,\n\nSecond equation:\n\nn*(m + p)=9 +6k,\n\nThird equation:\n\np*(m +n)=5 +10k,\n\nWhere k=log23,\n\nAnd we need to find m +n +p,\n\nsince xyz =2^{m+n+p},\n\nSo the minimal xyz is 2^{minimal(m+n+p)}.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving for m,n,p in these equations, then compute m+n+p.\n\nLet me denote S =m +n +p,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: m(S -m)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: n(S -n)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: p(S -p)=5+10k,\n\nSo, the same as before.\n\nNow, perhaps consider that these equations are symmetric in a way, and maybe assume that m, n, p are integers or multiples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that m = a, n = b, p =c,\n\nAnd we know that S =a + b + c,\n\nAnd from the earlier result,\n\nab + bc + ac=11 +10k,\n\nSo, perhaps we can write (a + b + c)^2 = S\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2*(ab + bc +ac),\n\nBut from before, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =S\u00b2 -22 -20k,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S\u00b2 -22 -20k) + 2*(ab + bc +ac),\n\nWhich gives ab + bc +ac=11 +10k,\n\nConsistent with earlier.\n\nHmm, perhaps consider that the equations for m, n, p can be considered as variables with S as a parameter,\n\nand we can think of them as three equations with three variables (m,n,p) and parameter S,\n\nso the system has solution only if the three equations are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider solving the system using substitution.\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of S,\n\nFrom equation1:\n\nm(S - m) =8 +4k,\n\nso,\n\nm\u00b2 -Sm + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSo,\n\nm = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nn = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k))]/2,\n\np = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k))]/2,\n\nNow, since m,n,p must add to S,\n\nif we take m, n,p as the roots that are the smaller ones,\n\nthen,\n\nm = [S - sqrt(D_m)]/2,\n\nn = [S - sqrt(D_n)]/2,\n\np = [S - sqrt(D_p)]/2,\n\nWhere D_m = S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k),\n\nD_n = S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k),\n\nD_p = S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k),\n\nThen,\n\nm +n +p = [3S - (sqrt(D_m) + sqrt(D_n) + sqrt(D_p))]/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\n3S - (sqrt(D_m) + sqrt(D_n) + sqrt(D_p)) = 2S,\n\nSo,\n\nS = sqrt(D_m) + sqrt(D_n) + sqrt(D_p),\n\nWhich is the same equation as before,\n\nBut with D_m = S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k),\n\nD_n = S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k),\n\nD_p = S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k),\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -32 -16k) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -36 -24k) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -20 -40k),\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but maybe we can substitute k=log23 and solve numerically?\n\nAlternatively, notice that the problem gives the RHS of the original equations as 2^something *3^something. Maybe there is a way to set variables such that log2(yz) is an integer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that log2(yz), log2(zx), log2(xy) are integers?\n\nSuppose that log2(yz)=a, log2(zx)=b, log2(xy)=c, which are integers. Then, the original equations become x^a=2^8 3^4, y^b=2^9 3^6, z^c=2^5 3^10.\n\nBut unless a, b, c are chosen such that x, y, z can be expressed as 2^{...}*3^{...}, then perhaps we can write x=2^{m}3^{n}, etc. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of exponents of 2 and 3.\n\nLet me suppose that x=2^{a}*3^{d},\n\ny=2^{b}*3^{e},\n\nz=2^{c}*3^{f},\n\nwhere a,b,c,d,e,f are real numbers.\n\nThen,\n\nlog2(yz)=log2(y)+log2(z)= (b +c) + (e +f)*log2(3)/log2(2). Wait, no, log2(yz)=log2(y) + log2(z).\n\nBut since y=2^b *3^e,\n\nlog2(y)=b + e*log2(3),\n\nSimilarly log2(z)=c + f*log2(3),\n\nThus,\n\nlog2(yz)= (b +c) + (e + f)*k, where k=log23,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = [2^a 3^d]^{ (b +c +k(e + f)) } =2^{a(b +c +k(e +f))} *3^{d(b +c +k(e +f))},\n\nThis must equal 2^8 3^4,\n\nTherefore,\n\nEquating exponents:\n\nFor 2: a*(b +c +k(e + f)) =8,\n\nFor 3: d*(b +c +k(e + f)) =4,\n\nSimilarly for the other equations:\n\nSecond equation: y^{log2(zx)} =2^9 3^6,\n\nlog2(zx)=log2(z)+log2(x)= (c +a) + (f +d)*k,\n\nTherefore,\n\ny^{log2(zx)}= [2^b 3^e]^{c +a +k(f +d)}=2^{b(a +c +k(f +d))}3^{e(a +c +k(f +d))}=2^9 3^6,\n\nThus,\n\nb*(a +c +k(f +d))=9,\n\ne*(a +c +k(f +d))=6,\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log2(xy)}=2^5 3^{10},\n\nlog2(xy)=log2(x)+log2(y)= (a +b) + (d +e)*k,\n\nThus,\n\nz^{log2(xy)}= [2^c 3^f]^{a +b +k(d +e)}=2^{c(a +b +k(d +e))}3^{f(a +b +k(d +e))}=2^5 3^{10},\n\nTherefore,\n\nc*(a +b +k(d +e))=5,\n\nf*(a +b +k(d +e))=10,\n\nHmm, this introduces more variables but perhaps allows us to separate the exponents for 2 and 3.\n\nLooking at the first equation's exponents:\n\nFor equation1:\n\n2 exponent: a*(b +c +k(e +f))=8,\n\n3 exponent: d*(b +c +k(e +f))=4,\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of the 3 exponent to the 2 exponent is (d/a)= (4/8)=0.5,\n\nThus,\n\nd/a =0.5 \u21d2 d =0.5a,\n\nSimilarly, in equation2:\n\nThe ratio e/b = (6/9)=2/3,\n\nSo e = (2/3)b,\n\nEquation3:\n\nThe ratio f/c =10/5=2 \u21d2 f=2c,\n\nTherefore,\n\nd=0.5a,\n\ne=(2/3)b,\n\nf=2c,\n\nNow, substitute these into the equations.\n\nStarting with equation1's exponent for 2:\n\na*(b +c +k(e +f)) =8,\n\nBut e= (2/3)b, f=2c,\n\nThus,\n\na*(b +c +k*( (2/3)b +2c )) =8,\n\nSimilarly for equation2:\n\nb*(a +c +k*(f +d)) =9,\n\nWith f=2c, d=0.5a,\n\nThus,\n\nb*(a +c +k*(2c +0.5a )) =9,\n\nEquation3:\n\nc*(a +b +k*(d +e)) =5,\n\nWith d=0.5a, e=(2/3)b,\n\nThus,\n\nc*(a +b +k*(0.5a + (2/3)b))=5,\n\nThis reduces the problem to variables a,b,c with these equations.\n\nLet me rewrite each equation with substitutions:\n\nEquation1:\n\na*(b +c +k*( (2/3)b +2c )) =8,\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\n= b +c + (2/3 k b + 2k c )\n\n= b*(1 + (2/3)k) + c*(1 + 2k),\n\nThus,\n\nEquation1 becomes:\n\na [ b*(1 + (2/3)k) + c*(1 + 2k) ] =8,\n\nSimilarly, Equation2:\n\nb*(a +c +k*(2c +0.5a )) =9,\n\nInside the bracket:\n\n= a +c + (2k c +0.5k a )\n\n= a*(1 +0.5k) + c*(1 +2k),\n\nThus,\n\nEquation2:\n\nb [a*(1 +0.5k) + c*(1 +2k) ] =9,\n\nEquation3:\n\nc*(a +b +k*(0.5a + (2/3)b )) =5,\n\nInside the bracket:\n\n= a +b + (0.5k a + (2/3)k b )\n\n= a*(1 +0.5k) + b*(1 + (2/3)k),\n\nThus,\n\nEquation3:\n\nc [a*(1 +0.5k) + b*(1 + (2/3)k) ] =5,\n\nHmm, now we have three equations with variables a, b, c and constants involving k=log23.\n\nLet me denote constants for simplification:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set constants:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s compute coefficients in terms of k.\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s call:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define:\n\nLet me define some coefficients:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet me compute coefficients:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the coefficients:\n\nFirst, let\u2019s compute the coefficients for Equation1:\n\nCoefficient of b: (1 + (2/3)k),\n\nCoefficient of c: (1 +2k),\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the coefficients numerically, using k=log23\u22481.58496,\n\nBut maybe we can keep it symbolic for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of a new variable.\n\nLet me consider that all three equations have terms involving a*(something) + b*(something) + c*(something). Maybe we can set up a system of linear equations if we can express variables in terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the expressions in the brackets are proportional.\n\nAlternatively, let me write all three equations as:\n\nEquation1:\n\na * [ (1 + (2/3)k) b + (1 +2k)c ] =8,\n\nEquation2:\n\nb * [ (1 +0.5k)a + (1 +2k)c ] =9,\n\nEquation3:\n\nc * [ (1 +0.5k)a + (1 + (2/3)k)b ] =5,\n\nHmm, this looks symmetric in a way.

assume some proportionality between a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that there exists a constant \u03bb such that a = \u03bb p,\n\nb = \u03bb q,\n\nc = \u03bb r,\n\nwhere p, q, r are constants to be determined, and \u03bb is a scaling factor.\n\nSubstituting into the equations,\n\nEquation1:\n\n\u03bb p * [ (1 + (2/3)k) \u03bb q + (1 +2k) \u03bb r ] = \u03bb^2 p [ (1 + (2/3)k) q + (1 +2k) r ] =8,\n\nEquation2:\n\n\u03bb q * [ (1 +0.5k) \u03bb p + (1 +2k) \u03bb r ] = \u03bb^2 q [ (1 +0.5k)p + (1 +2k)r ] =9,\n\nEquation3:\n\n\u03bb r * [ (1 +0.5k) \u03bb p + (1 + (2/3)k) \u03bb q ] =

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest possible value of xyz given these three equations involving logarithms and exponents. Let me see how to approach this. \n\nThe equations are:\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, these look a bit complicated. Maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to simplify them? Since logarithms can help turn exponents into multipliers, which might make the equations easier to handle. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each equation with a logarithm. Let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation. That might be helpful because the exponents involve log base 2.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\right) \\)\n\nUsing logarithm properties, the left side becomes \\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(y z) \\), and the right side is \\( \\log_2(2^8) + \\log_2(3^4) \\), which is \\( 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\).\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\right) \\)\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(y) \\cdot \\log_2(z x) \\)\nRight side: \\(9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nThird equation:\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\right) \\)\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(z) \\cdot \\log_2(x y) \\)\nRight side: \\(5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations:\n\n1. \\( \\log_2 x \\cdot \\log_2(yz) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n2. \\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(zx) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n3. \\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(xy) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nLet me denote some variables to simplify this. Let me let \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). Then, since \\( \\log_2(yz) = \\log_2 y + \\log_2 z = b + c \\), similarly for the others.\n\nSo substituting these into the equations:\n\n1. \\( a \\cdot (b + c) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n2. \\( b \\cdot (c + a) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n3. \\( c \\cdot (a + b) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations with variables a, b, c. The right-hand sides have terms with constants and log terms. Wait, but log_2 3 is a constant. Let me denote \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\), so that the equations become:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\)\n2. \\( b(c + a) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nNow, we have three equations with a, b, c, and k is known (since it's a constant, although its exact value isn't needed here). The problem is to find the minimal xyz. Since x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c, so xyz = 2^{a + b + c}. Therefore, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize a + b + c. So our goal is to find the minimal possible value of a + b + c given these equations.\n\nSo let me think of this as a system of equations in variables a, b, c. Let me denote S = a + b + c. Then, note that the left-hand sides can be written in terms of S. Let's see:\n\nFirst equation: a(b + c) = a(S - a) = 8 + 4k\n\nSecond equation: b(c + a) = b(S - b) = 9 + 6k\n\nThird equation: c(a + b) = c(S - c) = 5 + 10k\n\nHmm, so each equation is of the form variable*(S - variable) = some constant. Maybe if we can express all variables in terms of S? Or perhaps adding up the equations?\n\nLet me try adding all three equations:\n\nLeft side: a(S - a) + b(S - b) + c(S - c) = (a + b + c)S - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (8 + 4k) + (9 + 6k) + (5 + 10k) = (8+9+5) + (4+6+10)k = 22 + 20k\n\nSo:\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 + 20k\n\nWait, but the left side is S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Hmm, so if I can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need another relation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote the equations as:\n\nEquation 1: a(S - a) = 8 + 4k \u2192 aS - a\u00b2 = 8 +4k\n\nEquation 2: bS - b\u00b2 = 9 +6k\n\nEquation 3: cS - c\u00b2 = 5 +10k\n\nIf I add all three equations, I get:\n\n(aS + bS + cS) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 +20k\n\nWhich is S^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 +20k (since a + b + c = S, so aS + bS + cS = S^2). So that's the same as before.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can also consider individual equations. Let me think of variables a, b, c as variables in quadratic equations.\n\nLet me rearrange each equation:\n\nEquation1: a\u00b2 - aS + (8 +4k) =0 ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait equation1: aS - a\u00b2 = 8 +4k \u2192 rearranged as a\u00b2 - aS + ( -8 -4k) =0. But that's a quadratic in a. Similarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables like a, b, c in terms of S. Alternatively, perhaps we can set variables as variables and try to express in terms of S. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me consider that:\n\nLet me denote each equation as:\n\na(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nb(S - b) = 9 +6k,\n\nc(S - c) = 5 +10k.\n\nLet me denote these as quadratics:\n\nFor a: a^2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nSimilarly for b: b^2 - Sb + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nAnd for c: c^2 - Sc + (5 +10k)=0.\n\nHmm, so each variable is a root of a quadratic equation. Since a, b, c are real numbers (given that x,y,z are positive reals, so their logs exist and are real), so the discriminant must be non-negative for each quadratic.\n\nThe discriminant for the quadratic in a is S\u00b2 - 4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly for b: S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k) \u22650,\n\nAnd c: S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650.\n\nHmm, perhaps these can give some constraints on S? Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe since a, b, c are all roots of quadratics with the same S, maybe there is a relationship between them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding all three quadratics?\n\nWait, but each quadratic is separate. Alternatively, maybe suppose that a, b, c are roots of the same quadratic? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that each variable a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S via the quadratic equations. Let me see.\n\nFor a, the solution is:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut since a, b, c must be real, those discriminants must be non-negative. But since we need the minimal S, perhaps the minimal S is such that all discriminants are non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that a, b, c are variables such that each of them satisfies an equation of the form t(S - t) = K, where K is a constant specific to each variable. Let me think of t as variable. So for each variable, t^2 - St + K =0. So each variable is a solution to such a quadratic. Since the variables a, b, c are different, but each satisfies a similar equation but with different K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of S, then use the fact that a + b + c = S.\n\nLet me try that. Let me write equations for a, b, c:\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 = Sa - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly, equation2: b\u00b2 = Sb - (9 +6k),\n\nequation3: c\u00b2 = Sc - (5 +10k).\n\nThen, adding all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S(a + b + c) - [ (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) ]\n\nBut a + b + c = S,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (22 + 20k).\n\nBut earlier we had S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 22 +20k,\n\nWhich is equivalent. So that doesn't help much.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). \n\nWe can write:\n\nS\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nBut from above, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nSo substituting:\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)] + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nThus,\n\n0 = - (22 +20k) + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nSo,\n\nab + bc + ac = (22 +20k)/2 = 11 +10k.\n\nSo now we have ab + bc + ac =11 +10k.\n\nHmm, so now we can relate this with other equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for ab, bc, ac?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider multiplying all three original equations together?\n\nWait, the original equations before taking logs were:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = 2^8 3^4,\n\ny^{log2(zx)} =2^9 3^6,\n\nz^{log2(xy)}=2^5 3^{10}\n\nIf I multiply all three equations together, the left side would be x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)}.\n\nHmm, maybe we can simplify the left side.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote log2(yz) as log2 y + log2 z = b +c,\n\nSimilarly, log2(zx)= c +a,\n\nlog2(xy)=a +b,\n\nSo the left side becomes x^{b + c} * y^{c +a} * z^{a +b}\n\nHmm, let me write that as x^{b +c} y^{c +a} z^{a +b} = (x^b y^c)^{something}? Not sure, maybe factor exponents.\n\nAlternatively, notice that exponent of x is (b + c) + (a + b) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait each term:\n\nWait the exponents:\n\nx^{b + c} comes from first term,\n\ny^{c +a} comes from second,\n\nz^{a + b} comes from third.\n\nSo combining all together, the total exponent for x is (b + c),\n\nfor y is (c + a),\n\nfor z is (a + b).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor variables:\n\nLet me see, the left side is x^{b +c} y^{c +a} z^{a +b} = x^{b}x^{c} y^{c} y^{a} z^{a} z^{b}\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= (x^b y^a z^b) * (x^c y^c z^a) ?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Alternatively:\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think of the exponents:\n\nLet me note that (xyz)^{a +b +c} = x^{a +b +c} y^{a +b +c} z^{a +b +c}, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the product as:\n\n[ x^{b} y^{a} ] * [ y^{c} z^{b} ] * [ z^{a} x^{c} ]? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of multiplying the equations, take the product of the left-hand sides and the product of the right-hand sides.\n\nThe right-hand sides multiplied together are (2^8 3^4)(2^9 3^6)(2^5 3^{10}) = 2^{8+9+5} 3^{4+6+10} = 2^{22} 3^{20}.\n\nThe left-hand side is x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)}.\n\nLet me see if we can combine exponents here. Let me write the exponents in terms of logarithms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking the logarithm of the product.\n\nTaking log base 2 of the left side:\n\nlog2( left side ) = log2( x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)} )\n\n= log2(yz) * log2 x + log2(zx) * log2 y + log2(xy) * log2 z\n\nWait, but that's exactly the same as the left sides of the three original equations after taking logs. Wait, in the initial steps, when we took the log of each equation, we had:\n\nlog2(left1) = a(b +c),\n\nlog2(left2) = b(c +a),\n\nlog2(left3) = c(a +b),\n\nso the log of the product of left sides is a(b +c) + b(c +a) + c(a +b) = ab +ac + bc +ba + ca + cb = 2(ab + bc + ac).\n\nTherefore, log2( product of left sides ) = 2(ab + bc + ac).\n\nThe log of the product of right sides is log2(2^{22} 3^{20}) = 22 + 20 log2 3, since log2(3^20) is 20 log2 3.\n\nTherefore, equating:\n\n2(ab + bc + ac) = 22 + 20 log2 3,\n\nWhich gives ab + bc + ac = 11 +10 log2 3,\n\nWhich matches what we found earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so that didn't give us new information. Maybe we need another equation?\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a(b + c) = 8 +4k,\n\n2. b(a + c) =9 +6k,\n\n3. c(a + b) =5 +10k,\n\nand we have ab + bc + ac =11 +10k,\n\nand S =a +b +c,\n\nand our goal is to find S.\n\nWait, maybe we can write equations in terms of S.\n\nLet me note that a(b + c) = a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly, b(S - b)=9 +6k,\n\nand c(S -c)=5 +10k.\n\nSo perhaps if I let each variable be expressed in terms of S, maybe find expressions for a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, let me denote the equations as:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\nEquation1: aS -a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: bS -b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS -c\u00b2 =5 +10k,\n\nIf I add all three equations, I get:\n\n(a + b +c )S - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 ) = (8+9+5)+(4+6+10)k =22 +20k,\n\nWhich again gives S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) =22 +20k,\n\nSo that's consistent with earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express a, b, c in terms of S and k. Let me suppose that S is a variable, and k is known (since k = log2 3 is a constant, but maybe we can just treat k as a variable here? Wait, but it's a constant. Hmm, perhaps we can consider that all equations must be consistent for some S and k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps solve for a, b, c in terms of S and k, then use the fact that their sum is S, and their pairwise products sum to 11 +10k.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each variable a, b, c satisfies a quadratic equation in terms of S. Let me write each variable as a solution to their respective quadratic equation.\n\nSo for a:\n\na^2 - S a + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb^2 - S b + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nc^2 - S c + (5 +10k)=0.\n\nNow, if these quadratics have real roots, their discriminants must be non-negative.\n\nDiscriminant for a: D_a = S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nD_b = S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k) \u22650,\n\nD_c = S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650.\n\nSo the minimal S must satisfy these inequalities. However, since we are to find the minimal S such that all three quadratics have real roots, perhaps the minimal S is the maximum of the square roots of the required terms.\n\nWait, but maybe the minimal S is when all discriminants are zero? But that might not be possible since each quadratic might require different S to have discriminant zero. Alternatively, maybe the minimal S is when one of the discriminants is zero, but the others are still non-negative?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to set variables so that all equations are satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that all three quadratics have a common S? Let me consider that.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are the roots of the quadratic equations with the same S. Wait but each quadratic is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables a, b, c as roots of the three different quadratics. Perhaps there's a relationship between them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the variables a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S and k, so that their sum is S and their pairwise products sum to 11 +10k. Let me think of variables a, b, c with known sum S, and known sum of products 11 +10k, but we need to find S.\n\nWait, but we have three equations involving S and k. Let me see:\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(S - b)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nand also,\n\na + b + c = S,\n\nand,\n\nab + bc + ac =11 +10k.\n\nHmm. Let me think of variables a, b, c as variables whose sum is S and sum of products is 11+10k.\n\nLet me consider that each equation can be rewritten as:\n\naS - a\u00b2 =8+4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbS -b\u00b2=9+6k,\n\ncS -c\u00b2=5 +10k.\n\nLet me denote the right-hand sides as K1, K2, K3 respectively. So,\n\nK1 =8+4k,\n\nK2=9+6k,\n\nK3=5+10k,\n\nThen, adding all three equations gives S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)= K1 + K2 +K3 =22+20k,\n\nBut also (a + b +c)^2 = S\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc +ac) = S\u00b2 - 2(11 +10k),\n\nSo substituting into the previous equation,\n\nS\u00b2 - [S\u00b2 - 2(11 +10k)] =22 +20k,\n\nWhich simplifies to 2(11 +10k) =22 +20k,\n\nWhich holds true. So no new info.\n\nHmm, so perhaps another approach: Let me consider the three original equations as:\n\nEquation1: a(b +c) = K1,\n\nEquation2: b(a +c)= K2,\n\nEquation3: c(a +b)= K3,\n\nAnd we know that a +b +c = S,\n\nand ab + bc +ac =11 +10k,\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s define:\n\nLet me consider equations:\n\nEquation1: a(b +c) = K1 \u2192 a(S -a) = K1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)= K2,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c) = K3,\n\nLet me try to express a, b, c in terms of S and k.\n\nSuppose I solve each quadratic equation for a, b, c:\n\nFor a: a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1)]/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2)]/2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)]/2,\n\nBut since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative, as before.\n\nHowever, since we need to find the minimal S, perhaps the minimal S is when the discriminants are zero? But that would require S\u00b2 =4K1, S\u00b2=4K2, S\u00b2=4K3, which is only possible if K1=K2=K3, which is not the case here. So that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables a, b, c such that they are all roots of their respective quadratics, and their sum is S. Maybe express a, b, c in terms of S and substitute back into the equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract equations pairwise to find relationships between variables.\n\nLet me subtract Equation1 and Equation2:\n\na(S -a) - b(S -b) = K1 - K2,\n\nWhich is aS -a\u00b2 - bS +b\u00b2 = (8+4k) - (9 +6k),\n\nSimplify left side: (a -b)S - (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = - (1 +2k),\n\nNote that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a -b)(a + b), so:\n\n(a -b)S - (a -b)(a + b) = (a -b)(S - (a + b)) = - (1 + 2k)\n\nFactor out (a - b):\n\n(a - b)(S - (a + b)) = - (1 + 2k)\n\nBut since S = a + b + c,\n\nthen S - (a + b) = c,\n\nTherefore:\n\n(a - b)c = - (1 +2k),\n\nSimilarly, let me write this as:\n\n(a - b)c = - (1 +2k) \u2192 equation A.\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation2 - Equation3:\n\nb(S -b) - c(S -c) = K2 - K3,\n\nLeft side: bS -b\u00b2 - cS +c\u00b2 = (b -c)S - (b\u00b2 -c\u00b2) = (b -c)(S - (b + c)),\n\nRight side: (9 +6k) - (5 +10k) =4 -4k,\n\nSo,\n\n(b -c)(S - (b +c)) =4 -4k,\n\nBut S - (b +c) = a,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -c)a =4 -4k \u2192 equation B.\n\nSimilarly subtract Equation1 - Equation3:\n\na(S -a) - c(S -c) = K1 - K3,\n\nLeft side: aS -a\u00b2 -cS +c\u00b2 = (a -c)S - (a\u00b2 -c\u00b2) = (a -c)(S - (a +c)),\n\nRight side: (8+4k) - (5 +10k) =3 -6k,\n\nS - (a +c) = b,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a -c)b =3 -6k \u2192 equation C.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\nA: (a - b)c = - (1 +2k),\n\nB: (b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nC: (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nHmm, these equations might be helpful.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of each other. Let me note that equations A, B, C involve differences of variables multiplied by another variable.\n\nLet me see if I can solve for variables step by step.\n\nLet me denote equation A: (a - b)c = - (1 +2k),\n\nEquation B: (b - c)a =4 -4k,\n\nEquation C: (a - c)b =3 -6k,\n\nLet me see if I can express (a - b) from equation A:\n\n(a -b) = - (1 +2k)/c,\n\nSimilarly from equation B,\n\n(b -c) = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nFrom equation C,\n\n(a -c) = (3 -6k)/b,\n\nHmm, perhaps substituting these into each other.\n\nLet me first note that (a - b) + (b -c) = a -c,\n\nSo, substituting from above,\n\n[ - (1 +2k)/c ] + [ (4 -4k)/a ] = (3 -6k)/b,\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, let me consider solving for variables step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express all differences in terms of a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider equations A, B, C as a system.\n\nLet me try to express a - b from equation A,\n\na - b = - (1 +2k)/c,\n\nSimilarly, from equation B,\n\nb - c = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nFrom equation C,\n\na - c = (3 -6k)/b,\n\nNow, notice that (a - c) can also be written as (a - b) + (b - c). Let's see:\n\n(a - c) = (a - b) + (b - c) = [ - (1 +2k)/c ] + [ (4 -4k)/a ]\n\nTherefore,\n\n[ - (1 +2k)/c ] + [ (4 -4k)/a ] = (3 -6k)/b,\n\nThis equation can be written as:\n\n- (1 +2k)/c + (4 -4k)/a = (3 -6k)/b,\n\nHmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe I can find expressions for a, b, c in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, let me assume specific values for variables or see if there's a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let\u2019s consider that variables a, b, c are proportional to some variables, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign numerical values? Wait, but since k is log2 3, which is approximately 1.58496, but maybe keeping it as k is better.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to assume that variables a, b, c are integers? Not sure, since the problem states they are positive real numbers, so maybe not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal S is achieved when the variables a, b, c are such that all quadratics have minimal S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the equations as linear in terms of S?\n\nWait, let me think of the equations:\n\nEquation1: a(S - a) =8 +4k \u2192 aS = a\u00b2 +8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: bS = b\u00b2 +9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS = c\u00b2 +5 +10k,\n\nIf I let\u2019s denote each variable times S equals something. Maybe adding them up:\n\naS + bS +cS = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + (8+9+5) + (4+6+10)k,\n\nLeft side: S(a +b +c) = S^2,\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +22 +20k,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS^2 = (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +22 +20k,\n\nWhich is again the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables a, b, c and the equations:\n\nLet me consider equations A, B, C again:\n\nEquation A: (a - b)c = - (1 +2k),\n\nEquation B: (b -c)a =4 -4k,\n\nEquation C: (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nLet me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nLet me suppose that I can express (a - b) from equation A and (a - c) from equation C, then relate them.\n\nFrom equation A: a -b = - (1 +2k)/c,\n\nFrom equation C: a -c = (3 -6k)/b \u2192 a = c + (3 -6k)/b,\n\nSubstitute this into the expression for a -b:\n\n[ c + (3 -6k)/b - b ] = - (1 +2k)/c,\n\nHmm, this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps try expressing variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider Equation B: (b -c)a =4 -4k \u2192 b -c = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nSimilarly, equation A: a -b = - (1 +2k)/c,\n\nSo, let me write b = a + (1 +2k)/c,\n\nBut then from equation B:\n\nb -c = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nSubstituting b:\n\na + (1 +2k)/c -c = (4 -4k)/a,\n\nHmm, now we have an equation in a and c.\n\nSimilarly, from equation C: (a -c)b =3 -6k,\n\nLet me substitute b from above here as well:\n\n(a -c)[ a + (1 +2k)/c ] =3 -6k,\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Perhaps I need to make a substitution for variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = a + b + c = S,\n\nv = ab + bc + ac =11 +10k,\n\nw = abc,\n\nThen, since we have three variables, perhaps we can find a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c?\n\nThe cubic equation would be t^3 - u t^2 + v t - w =0,\n\nBut I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find abc?\n\nWait, perhaps multiplying the three original equations (before log):\n\nThe original equations were:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = 2^8 3^4,\n\ny^{log2(zx)} =2^9 3^6,\n\nz^{log2(xy)} =2^5 3^{10},\n\nMultiplying them gives:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} y^{log2(zx)} z^{log2(xy)} = 2^{22} 3^{20},\n\nAs before. The left side can be written as (xyz)^{log2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy)} / something? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of exponents:\n\nlog2(yz) is log2 y + log2 z,\n\nSimilarly, log2(zx) = log2 z + log2 x,\n\nlog2(xy) = log2 x + log2 y,\n\nTherefore,\n\nlog2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy) = 2(log2 x + log2 y + log2 z) = 2 log2(xyz),\n\nSo the exponent in the left side:\n\nThe left side is x^{log2(yz)} y^{log2(zx)} z^{log2(xy)}.\n\nLet me write each term as x^{log2 y} x^{log2 z}, similarly for others:\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side = [x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 z} * z^{log2 x}] * [x^{log2 z} * y^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y} ]\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, notice that each variable is raised to the sum of logs of the other two variables. Let me see:\n\nLet me write each term:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = x^{log2 y + log2 z} = (x^{log2 y}) (x^{log2 z}),\n\nSimilarly for others:\n\ny^{log2(zx)} = y^{log2 z + log2 x} = (y^{log2 z})(y^{log2 x}),\n\nz^{log2(xy)} = z^{log2 x + log2 y} = (z^{log2 x})(z^{log2 y}).\n\nMultiplying all three together:\n\nThe product becomes:\n\n(x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 z} * z^{log2 x}) * (x^{log2 z} * y^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y} )\n\nBut maybe group terms:\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first bracket: x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 z} * z^{log2 x},\n\nThe second bracket: x^{log2 z} * y^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y},\n\nSo multiplying them gives:\n\nx^{log2 y + log2 z} * y^{log2 z + log2 x} * z^{log2 x + log2 y},\n\nWhich is exactly the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the property that a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a} ?\n\nWait, yes, there's a logarithmic identity that a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}.\n\nSo maybe we can use that here.\n\nLet me consider x^{log2(yz)}. Let's see, log2(yz) is log2 y + log2 z, so:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = (yz)^{log2 x} ?\n\nWait, using the identity: a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a},\n\nSo here, a = x, b =2, c = yz,\n\nSo x^{log2(yz)} = (yz)^{log2 x},\n\nSimilarly for the other terms:\n\ny^{log2(zx)} = (zx)^{log2 y},\n\nz^{log2(xy)} = (xy)^{log2 z},\n\nTherefore, the left side of the product equation becomes:\n\n(yz)^{log2 x} * (zx)^{log2 y} * (xy)^{log2 z},\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ny^{log2 x * log2 z} ... Wait, no, better to multiply exponents:\n\nWait, actually, (yz)^{log2 x} is y^{log2 x} * z^{log2 x},\n\nSimilarly, (zx)^{log2 y} is z^{log2 y}*x^{log2 y},\n\nand (xy)^{log2 z} is x^{log2 z}*y^{log2 z},\n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\ny^{log2 x} * z^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y}*x^{log2 y}*x^{log2 z}*y^{log2 z},\n\nNow, grouping the terms:\n\nx^{log2 y + log2 z} * y^{log2 x + log2 z} * z^{log2 x + log2 y},\n\nWhich brings us back to where we were. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity:\n\nThe product of the three left sides equals:\n\nproduct_{cyc} (yz)^{log2 x} = (yz)^{log2 x} * (zx)^{log2 y} * (xy)^{log2 z} = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me take the logarithm of the left side:\n\nlog2(left side) = log2( (yz)^{log2 x} * ... ) = log2 x * log2(yz) + log2 y * log2(zx) + log2 z * log2(xy),\n\nWait, which is the same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't getting me anywhere. Let me think of the variables a, b, c again.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nand S =a +b +c,\n\nab + bc +ac=11 +10k,\n\nLet me consider that each of these equations can be written as:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThus, each variable is a solution to a quadratic equation with coefficients depending on S and k.\n\nLet me suppose that a, b, c are the roots of the equation t\u00b2 - St + K =0, but each with different K. Since each has a different constant term, they can\u2019t all be roots of the same quadratic. However, perhaps they are roots of different quadratics but with the same S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express a, b, c in terms of S and substitute into S =a +b +c.\n\nSuppose I let me denote:\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 = Sa - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = Sc - (5 +10k),\n\nNow, consider squaring the sum S =a +b +c,\n\nS\u00b2 = (a +b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nWe know that a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nWait, but substituting the expressions for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S(a +b +c) - [ (8 +4k)+(9 +6k)+(5 +10k) ]\n\n= S*S - (22 +20k),\n\nso,\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)] + 2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nTherefore,\n\n0 = - (22 +20k) + 2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nWhich gives ab + bc +ac = (22 +20k)/2 =11 +10k,\n\nWhich we already have. So no new info.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find abc?\n\nLet me see. Let me consider multiplying the three equations:\n\n(a(S -a))*(b(S -b))*(c(S -c)) = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nBut expanding the left side is going to be complicated, but perhaps manageable?\n\nLet me denote the left side:\n\nabc * (S -a)(S -b)(S -c),\n\nHmm, but (S -a) = b +c,\n\n(S -b)=a +c,\n\n(S -c)=a +b,\n\nSo,\n\nabc*( (b +c)(a +c)(a +b) ),\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of S, ab + bc +ac, and abc.\n\nNote that (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - abc = S*(ab + bc +ac) - abc,\n\nTherefore,\n\nLeft side becomes abc*[ S*(ab + bc +ac) - abc ].\n\nTherefore,\n\nLeft side = abc [ S*(ab + bc +ac) - abc ]\n\n= abc * S*(ab + bc +ac) - (abc)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nabc * S*(ab + bc +ac) - (abc)^2 = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nLet me denote P = abc,\n\nThen,\n\nP * S*(ab + bc +ac) - P^2 = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nWe know that ab + bc +ac =11 +10k,\n\nSo,\n\nP * S*(11 +10k) - P^2 = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nHmm, so if I can find P, then perhaps solve for S?\n\nBut this requires another equation involving P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express P in terms of S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need another relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me suppose that they are roots of t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 + (11+10k) t - P =0,\n\nThen, perhaps use Vieta's formula. But I don't know how to relate this to the previous equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe try to assign numerical values to k?\n\nWait, since k = log2 3 \u22481.58496, but since the problem requires an exact answer, perhaps we can treat k as a variable and find S in terms of k, then see if it cancels out?\n\nWait, but the problem states that x, y, z are positive reals, so the equations must hold for some real numbers, so perhaps S can be expressed independent of k?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eliminate k?\n\nLet me see the equations:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me try to express k from each equation and set them equal.\n\nFrom equation1:\n\nk = [a(S -a) -8]/4,\n\nFrom equation2:\n\nk = [b(S -b) -9]/6,\n\nFrom equation3:\n\nk = [c(S -c) -5]/10,\n\nTherefore, set equation1's k equal to equation2's k:\n\n[ a(S -a) -8 ] /4 = [ b(S -b) -9 ] /6,\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n6[a(S -a) -8] =4[ b(S -b) -9 ],\n\nExpand:\n\n6a(S -a) -48 =4b(S -b) -36,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6a(S -a) -4b(S -b) -12=0,\n\nHmm,\n\nSimilarly set equation1's k equal to equation3's k:\n\n[ a(S -a) -8 ] /4 = [ c(S -c) -5 ] /10,\n\nCross multiply:\n\n10[a(S -a) -8] =4[ c(S -c) -5 ],\n\n10a(S -a) -80 =4c(S -c) -20,\n\nBring to left:\n\n10a(S -a) -4c(S -c) -60 =0,\n\nSimilarly set equation2 and equation3's k equal:\n\n[ b(S -b) -9 ] /6 = [ c(S -c) -5 ] /10,\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n10[ b(S -b) -9 ] =6[ c(S -c) -5 ],\n\n10b(S -b) -90 =6c(S -c) -30,\n\nBring to left:\n\n10b(S -b) -6c(S -c) -60=0,\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations:\n\n1. 6a(S -a) -4b(S -b) -12=0,\n\n2. 10a(S -a) -4c(S -c) -60=0,\n\n3.10b(S -b) -6c(S -c) -60=0,\n\nThis is getting very involved. Maybe plugging in variables expressions?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that S is a constant, and a,b,c are variables dependent on S, but this might not simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, let me make a substitution for variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set u = a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nv = b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nw = c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nThen, k can be written as:\n\nk = (u -8)/4 = (v -9)/6 = (w -5)/10,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(u -8)/4 = (v -9)/6 \u2192 6(u -8)=4(v -9) \u21926u -48=4v -36 \u21926u -4v =12 \u2192 3u -2v =6,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(u -8)/4 = (w -5)/10 \u219210(u -8)=4(w -5) \u219210u -80 =4w -20 \u219210u -4w =60 \u21925u -2w =30,\n\nAnd,\n\n(v -9)/6 = (w -5)/10 \u219210(v -9)=6(w -5) \u219210v -90=6w -30 \u219210v -6w =60 \u21925v -3w =30,\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. 3u -2v =6,\n\n2.5u -2w =30,\n\n3.5v -3w=30,\n\nNow, these equations are linear in u, v, w. Let me write them as:\n\nEquation1: 3u -2v =6,\n\nEquation2:5u -2w =30,\n\nEquation3:5v -3w=30,\n\nWe can solve this system for u, v, w.\n\nLet me solve Equation1 for v:\n\n3u -6 =2v \u2192 v=(3u -6)/2,\n\nEquation2:5u -2w =30 \u21922w=5u -30 \u2192w=(5u -30)/2,\n\nSubstitute v and w into Equation3:\n\n5*( (3u -6)/2 ) -3*( (5u -30)/2 ) =30,\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5*(3u -6) -3*(5u -30) =60,\n\nExpand:\n\n15u -30 -15u +90 =60,\n\nSimplify:\n\n(15u -15u) + (-30 +90) =60,\n\n60=60,\n\nHmm, this results in an identity. So the system is dependent, meaning there are infinitely many solutions parameterized by u.\n\nHmm, so the system is underdetermined, which suggests that we need another equation to find u, v, w. However, since u, v, w are defined as:\n\nu = a(S -a),\n\nv = b(S -b),\n\nw = c(S -c),\n\nand also we know that a +b +c =S,\n\nand ab + bc +ac =11 +10k,\n\nand k = (u -8)/4,\n\nSo perhaps we can express everything in terms of u, and then find S?\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote k = (u -8)/4,\n\nSo, v = (3u -6)/2,\n\nand w = (5u -30)/2,\n\nAlso, since ab + bc +ac =11 +10k =11 +10*( (u -8)/4 ) =11 + (10/4)(u -8)=11 + (5/2)(u -8)=11 + (5u/2 -20)= (5u/2 -9),\n\nThus, ab + bc +ac = (5u/2 -9),\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\nab + bc +ac =11 +10k = (5u/2 -9),\n\nBut also, we have the expressions for u, v, w in terms of a, b, c.\n\nBut perhaps also, we can express ab + bc +ac in terms of a, b, c and S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that:\n\nThe sum a + b +c = S,\n\nand the product terms can be related through the expressions for u, v, w.\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\nu + v + w = a(S -a) + b(S -b) +c(S -c) = S(a +b +c) - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2),\n\nWhich we already know is equal to 22 +20k,\n\nBut also, since u + v + w = (8+4k)+(9+6k)+(5+10k)=22+20k,\n\nSo that holds.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I can express ab + bc +ac in terms of u, v, w?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables a, b, c as variables whose products are known.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the following:\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 = Sa - u,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sv - v,\n\nWait, no: actually, u = a(S -a) \u2192 a\u00b2 = Sa - u,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - v,\n\nc\u00b2 = Sc -w,\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2:\n\n= Sa -u + Sb -v + Sc -w,\n\n= S(a +b +c) - (u +v +w),\n\n= S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nWhich we know.\n\nBut also, from the expression for ab + bc +ac = (5u/2 -9),\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nab + bc +ac = (5u/2 -9),\n\nHmm, can I express ab + bc +ac in terms of a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider:\n\nLet me write (a +b +c)^2 = S^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nSo,\n\nab + bc +ac = (S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2))/2,\n\nBut we know a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc +ac),\n\nWait, this is circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the expressions for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2:\n\nab + bc +ac = ?\n\nLet me consider that we can write (a +b)(b +c)(c +a) = (a +b +c)(ab + bc +ac) - abc,\n\nBut I don't know abc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe proceed numerically?\n\nAlternatively, since we have u, v, w parameterized by u, perhaps we can find another relation.\n\nRecall that:\n\nab + bc +ac =5u/2 -9,\n\nAlso, the sum a +b +c =S,\n\nWe can also express abc in terms of S and k?\n\nWait, perhaps using the three equations for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2,\n\nLet me consider multiplying a, b, c:\n\nLet me compute (a +b +c)^3 = S^3 = a^3 +b^3 +c^3 +3(a +b)(b +c)(c +a),\n\nHmm, but this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use Newton's identities relating power sums to elementary symmetric sums.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define:\n\nS1 = a +b +c =S,\n\nS2 =ab + bc +ac =5u/2 -9,\n\nS3 =abc.\n\nWe need expressions for the sums of squares, etc.\n\nThe sum of squares is S1\u00b2 - 2S2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2,\n\nWhich we know equals S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nBut since S1 =S,\n\nso,\n\nS\u00b2 - 2S2 = S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nThus,\n\n-2S2 = - (22 +20k),\n\nWhich gives S2 = (22 +20k)/2 =11 +10k,\n\nWhich matches our previous result.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't help.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me consider that variables a, b, c must satisfy their quadratic equations. So for example, a is a root of a quadratic equation with S as a parameter. Similarly for b and c.\n\nTherefore, the values of a, b, c are constrained by their quadratics, and their sum is S.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that the minimal S occurs when the three quadratics are such that their roots a, b, c add up to S, and the discriminants are non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that all three quadratics have their maximum possible roots? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since we need to minimize S = a +b +c, perhaps set a, b, c to be as small as possible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of S as a variable and find for what S the system has a solution.\n\nGiven that the equations are:\n\n3u -2v =6,\n\n5u -2w =30,\n\n5v -3w=30,\n\nand u = a(S -a),\n\nv =b(S -b),\n\nw =c(S -c),\n\nand also,\n\nS =a +b +c,\n\nand,\n\nab + bc +ac =5u/2 -9,\n\nHmm, perhaps proceed as follows:\n\nSince we have u, v, w in terms of u,\n\nLet me let\u2019s set u as a parameter,\n\nThen,\n\nv = (3u -6)/2,\n\nw = (5u -30)/2,\n\nAnd,\n\nab + bc +ac =5u/2 -9,\n\nAlso,\n\nS =a +b +c,\n\nSo, we can think of a, b, c as roots of the quadratic equations:\n\nFor a: a\u00b2 -Sa +u=0,\n\nFor b: b\u00b2 -Sb +v=0,\n\nFor c: c\u00b2 -Sc +w=0,\n\nSo each variable is a root of its own quadratic equation with coefficients depending on S and u.\n\nSince a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 -4u \u22650,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2 -4v \u22650,\n\nFor c:S\u00b2 -4w \u22650,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654u,\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654v =4*(3u -6)/2= 2*(3u -6),\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654w =4*(5u -30)/2=2*(5u -30),\n\nTherefore,\n\nFirst inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654u,\n\nSecond inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22656u -12,\n\nThird inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 \u226510u -60,\n\nTherefore, the most restrictive condition is the maximum of these lower bounds.\n\nWe also have that S must be the sum a +b +c.\n\nTo find the minimal S, perhaps express S in terms of u and find the minimal S such that all inequalities hold.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that S is expressed via the quadratics.\n\nLet me consider that each of a, b, c can be expressed via their quadratics as:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4u)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nBut since we want real variables, the sqrt must be real.\n\nHowever, since we need to have a +b +c = S,\n\nPerhaps the minimal S occurs when all three variables a, b, c are chosen to be the smaller roots of their quadratics, so that their sum is minimized? Or perhaps the larger roots?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all variables take the same branch (e.g., all take the '+' sign in the quadratic solution), but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S occurs when all three discriminants are zero, but as before that requires S\u00b2 =4u =6u -12 =10u -60,\n\nSetting 4u =6u -12 \u2192 2u =12 \u2192u=6,\n\nThen 4u =24, so 10u -60=60-60=0,\n\nSo 4u=24, 6u-12=24, 10u-60=0,\n\nThus, the discriminant for c would be zero, but for a and b it would be 24 -24=0 and 24-24=0? Wait:\n\nWait if S\u00b2=4u=24 \u2192 S= sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6),\n\nBut then:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 -4u=0,\n\nFor b:S\u00b2 -4v =24 -4*( (3*6 -6)/2 )=24 -4*(12/2)=24 -24=0,\n\nFor c:S\u00b2 -4w=24 -4*( (5*6 -30)/2 )=24 -4*(0/2)=24-0=24\u22600,\n\nHmm, so only a and b would have discriminant zero, but c would have discriminant 24, so not zero. Thus, this approach doesn't yield all discriminants zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set two discriminants to zero?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proceed numerically.\n\nLet me suppose a value for u and see what happens.\n\nLet me consider that S must be larger than sqrt(10u -60),\n\nSince the third inequality S\u00b2 \u226510u -60,\n\nThus, 10u -60 must be non-negative,\n\nSo 10u -60 \u22650 \u2192u\u22656,\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality requires 6u -12 \u2264S\u00b2,\n\nSo, since S must be at least sqrt(6u -12),\n\nBut since S also must be at least sqrt(4u),\n\nThus, the minimal S for each u is the maximum between sqrt(4u), sqrt(6u -12), sqrt(10u -60).\n\nTo minimize S, we need to choose u such that the maximum of those is minimized.\n\nWe can set sqrt(4u) = sqrt(6u -12) = sqrt(10u -60),\n\nBut that might not be possible. Let me see.\n\nLet me set sqrt(4u) = sqrt(6u -12),\n\nSquaring both sides:4u =6u -12 \u21922u=12 \u2192u=6,\n\nThen sqrt(4*6)=sqrt(24)=2\u221a6\u22484.899,\n\nsqrt(6*6 -12)=sqrt(24)=same,\n\nsqrt(10*6 -60)=sqrt(0)=0,\n\nThus the maximum is sqrt(24).\n\nAlternatively, set sqrt(6u -12) = sqrt(10u -60),\n\nSquaring:6u-12=10u-60 \u2192-4u= -48 \u2192u=12,\n\nThen sqrt(6*12 -12)=sqrt(60)\u22487.746,\n\nsqrt(10*12 -60)=sqrt(60)=same,\n\nsqrt(4*12)=sqrt(48)=6.928,\n\nThus maximum is sqrt(60).\n\nAlternatively, set sqrt(4u)=sqrt(10u -60),\n\nSquaring:4u=10u-60 \u2192-6u= -60 \u2192u=10,\n\nThen sqrt(40)=6.324,\n\nsqrt(60 -12)=sqrt(48)=6.928,\n\nsqrt(40)=6.324,\n\nThus maximum is sqrt(48).\n\nHmm, so the minimal maximum occurs at u=6 where the maximum is sqrt(24)=~4.899,\n\nBut at u=6,\n\nThen v=(3u-6)/2=(18-6)/2=6,\n\nw=(5u-30)/2=(30-30)/2=0,\n\nThus, w=0,\n\nSo the equation for c is c(S -c)=w=0,\n\nThus, c=0 or c=S,\n\nBut c must be positive real number, so c=S,\n\nBut then, since a +b +c=S,\n\nIf c=S, then a +b=0,\n\nBut a and b are positive reals, so this is impossible,\n\nThus, invalid.\n\nSo u=6 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal S must be higher.\n\nNext, let me try u=10,\n\nThen v=(30-6)/2=12,\n\nw=(50-30)/2=10,\n\nThus,\n\nv=12, w=10,\n\nThus,\n\nThe discriminant for a: S\u00b2 -4*10=S\u00b2-40,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2-4*12 =S\u00b2-48,\n\nFor c: S\u00b2 -4*10=S\u00b2 -40,\n\nSo the discriminants must be non-negative,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 \u226548,\n\nThus S\u2265sqrt(48)\u22486.928,\n\nAlso, the minimal S is when S^2=48,\n\nBut let's see if S= sqrt(48)=4*sqrt(3)\u22486.928,\n\nThen,\n\nFor a: a\u00b2 - Sa +10 =0,\n\nSolutions:\n\na=(S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -40))/2,\n\nSimilarly for b,\n\nb=(S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -48))/2,\n\nc=(S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -40))/2,\n\nBut S\u00b2=48,\n\nThus, sqrt(S\u00b2 -40)=sqrt(8)=2\u221a2\u22482.828,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -48)=sqrt(0)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nFor a and c:\n\na=(4\u221a3 \u00b12\u221a2)/2=2\u221a3 \u00b1\u221a2,\n\nSimilarly c=2\u221a3 \u00b1\u221a2,\n\nFor b,\n\nb=(4\u221a3 \u00b10)/2=2\u221a3,\n\nThus, possible solutions:\n\nLet me pick the smaller roots for a and c to minimize the sum:\n\nWait, but the sum a +b +c must be S=4\u221a3,\n\nIf a takes the smaller root: a=2\u221a3 -\u221a2,\n\nc=2\u221a3 -\u221a2,\n\nThen,\n\na + c =4\u221a3 -2\u221a2,\n\nAdding b=2\u221a3,\n\nTotal sum is 6\u221a3 -2\u221a2 \u22486*1.732 -2*1.414\u224810.392 -2.828\u22487.564,\n\nBut S is supposed to be 4\u221a3\u22486.928,\n\nThis is a contradiction.

the minimal xyz, which is 2^{a+b+c}=2^S,\n\nThus, the minimal xyz corresponds to the minimal S,\n\nTherefore, if I can find S\u22489.17,\n\nThen the minimal xyz is 2^S\u22482^9.17,\n\nBut the problem requires an exact form,\n\nPerhaps the minimal S is 12,\n\nBut earlier trials didn't work,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is 12,\n\nWait let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps we can use the original equations:\n\nLet me recall that:\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a(b +c)=8 +4k,\n\n2. b(a +c)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(a +b)=5 +10k,\n\nAnd,\n\nS =a +b +c,\n\nLet me add equations 1,2,3:\n\na(b +c) +b(a +c)+c(a +b)= (8+9+5)+(4+6+10)k=22+20k,\n\nWhich is consistent,\n\nAlso, we can write these equations as:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S

+c,\n\nSimilarly for others,\n\nThus,\n\nabc*(b +c)(c +a)(a +b)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nEarlier we had:\n\n(b +c)(c +a)(a +b) = (a +b +c)(ab + bc +ac) - abc = S*(ab + bc +ac) - abc,\n\nThus,\n\nabc*(S*(ab + bc +ac) - abc) = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nWe know that ab + bc +ac =11 +10k,\n\nLet me denote P=abc,\n\nThen,\n\nP*(S*(11+10k) - P) =

S=12,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: a(12 -a)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(12 -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(12 -c)=5+10k,\n\nAdding,\n\na(12 -a)+b(12 -b)+c(12 -c)= (8+4k)+(9+6k)+(5+10k)=22+20k,\n\nWhich is consistent,\n\nAlso,\n\nab + bc +ac=11+10k,\n\nLet me compute ab + bc +ac,\n\nSuppose we solve for a,b,c,\n\nLet me assume that a,b,c are the roots of the equation,\n\nt^3 - St^2 + (11+10k)t - P

roots,\n\nBut not sure,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is 12,\n\nGiven the problem is likely to have an integer solution,\n\nPerhaps substituting S=12,\n\nBut as above it didn't work,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S=12 is the answer,\n\nWait the problem asks for the minimal xyz,\n\nWhich is 2^{S},\n\nIf the minimal S is 12,\n\nThen xyz=2^{12}=4096,\n\nBut perhaps the answer is 2^12*3^something,\n\nWait no,\n\nWait the problem requires xyz to be computed,\n\nBut in the equations,\n\nThe answers are given as 2^8 3^4 etc,\n\nPerhaps the minimal xyz is 2^{8+9+5} 3^{4+6+10}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nBut that's the product of the right sides,\n\nBut that's not xyz,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is 2^{12}*3^{something},\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an elegant solution I missed,\n\nLet me think differently,\n\nLet me take the three original equations:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} =2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\),\n\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} =2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\),\n\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} =2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\),\n\nLet me take the logarithm base 2 of each equation,\n\n1. \\( \\log_2 x \\cdot \\log_2(y z) =8 +4 \\log_23 \\),\n\n2. \\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(z x) =9 +6 \\log_23 \\),\n\n3. \\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(x y) =5 +10 \\log_23 \\),\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me let,\n\nLet me set,\n\nLet me let a= log2x,\n\nb=log2y,\n\nc=log2z,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: a(b +c)=8+4k where k=log23,\n\nEquation2: b(a +c)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nLet me add them,\n\na(b+c)+b(a+c)+c(a+b)= 2(ab+bc+ac)=22+20k,\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc +ac=11+10k,\n\nLet me compute (a +b +c)^2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab+bc+ac),\n\nAnd also,\n\nFrom the original equations,\n\na(b +c)=8+4k \u2192 a(S

-22-20k,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab+bc+ac)= (S\u00b2 -22-20k) + 2(11+10k)= S\u00b2 -22-20k +22+20k=S\u00b2,\n\nWhich holds,\n\nThus, no new info,\n\nNow, let me consider the product of the three equations:\n\n[a(b +c)] [b(a +c)] [c(a +b)] = (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nExpand the left side,\n\nabc*(b +c)(a +c)(a +b),\n\nEarlier we saw,\n\n(b +c)(a +c)(a +b)= (a +b +c)(ab + bc +ac) - abc=S*(11+10k) - abc,\n\nThus,\n\nabc*(S*(11+10k) - abc)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nLet me denote P=abc,\n\nThen,\n\nP*(S*(11+10k) - P)= (8+4k)(9+6k)(5+10k),\n\nThis is a quadratic in P,\n\nBut without knowing S or P, it's hard to solve,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express P in terms of S,\n\nBut not sure,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that,\n\nLet me assume that a,b,c are proportional to

sure,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me think that the minimal S is 12,\n\nThus, xyz=2^{12}=4096,\n\nBut I need to confirm,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal value is 2^{12} 3^{something},\n\nBut the problem says to compute the minimal xyz,\n\nGiven the problem's complexity, I think the minimal S is 12,\n\nThus, the answer is 2^{12}=4096,\n\nBut I'm not sure,\n\nAlternatively, let me compute S

12,\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem as follows,\n\nLet me consider the equations:\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me let\u2019s take the three equations:\n\n1. a(b +c) =8+4k,\n\n2. b(a +c)=9+6k,\n\n3. c(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nLet me add them,\n\na(b +c) +b(a +c)+c(a +b)=22+20k,\n\nWhich is 2(ab+bc+ac)=22+20k,\n\nThus,\n\nab+bc+ac=11+10k,\n\nLet me compute,\n\n(ab+bc+ac)=11+10k,\n\nAnd,\n\na +b +c=S,\n\nWe can also compute,\n\n(a +b +c)^2 =S\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab+bc+ac),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=S\u00b2 - 2(ab+bc+ac)=S\u00b2 -22-20k,\n\nAlso,\n\nFrom the three equations,\n\na\u00b2= aS - (8+4k),\n\nb\u00b2= bS - (9+6k),\n\nc\u00b2= cS - (5+10k),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=S(a +b +c) - (22+20k)=S\u00b2 -22-20k,\n\nWhich holds.\n\nNow, let me consider the following,\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nLet me compute,\n\n(a -b)(b -c)(c -a),\n\nBut not sure,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that,\n\nLet me think of the three equations as linear equations in variables a,b,c,\n\nLet me rewrite the equations,\n\nEquation1: a(b +c)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(a +c)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nLet me write them as,\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nThus, each variable is a root of a quadratic equation,\n\nLet me consider the quadratic equation for a,\n\na\u00b2 -Sa + (8+4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nThus,\n\nThe variables a,b,c are roots of the quadratic equations with coefficients depending on S and k,\n\nThus, the minimal S is the smallest S such that the three quadratics have real roots and their sum is S,\n\nThis is the crux,\n\nThe minimal S is the minimal value where the three quadratics have real roots and their roots sum to S,\n\nThe minimal S is thus the minimal solution to the equation,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k)),\n\nWith k=log23,\n\nThis equation must be solved numerically,\n\nEarlier approximation gave S\u22489.17,\n\nThus, the minimal xyz is approximately2^9.17,\n\nBut the problem requires an exact answer,\n\nPerhaps the answer is 2^{12}*3^{something},\n\nWait, let me think of the product xyz,\n\nIf we take the three original equations,\n\nMultiply them together,\n\nxyz^{log2(yz)} * yz^{log2(zx)} * zx^{log2(xy)}= (2^{22}3^{20}),\n\nBut earlier steps showed that the product of the left sides is equal to (xyz)^{log2(xyz)}= (xyz)^{S},\n\nThus,\n\n(xyz)^S=2^{22}*3^{20},\n\nThus,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}*3^{20})^{1/S},\n\nTo minimize xyz, we need to maximize S,\n\nWait, but earlier we were minimizing S,\n\nWait, if we want to minimize xyz= (2^{22}*3^{20})^{1/S},\n\nSince the expression decreases as S increases,\n\nThus, to minimize xyz, we must maximize S,\n\nBut that contradicts previous approach,\n\nWait, this is a critical realization,\n\nWait, the problem asks for the smallest possible value of xyz,\n\nWhich is equivalent to minimizing xyz,\n\nBut since xyz= (2^{22}3^{20})^{1/S},\n\nTo minimize xyz, we need to maximize S,\n\nThus, the minimal xyz is achieved when S is as large as possible,\n\nBut previously I was trying to find minimal S,\n\nThis is the key,\n\nThus, the correct approach is to find the maximal possible S,\n\nBecause xyz decreases as S increases,\n\nThus, the minimal xyz occurs at the maximal S,\n\nThus, I've been looking in the wrong direction,\n\nThis changes everything,\n\nThus, the problem requires to find the maximal possible S=a+b+c,\n\nWhich would minimize xyz=2^{S},\n\nThus, need to find the maximal S possible,\n\nGiven that S must satisfy,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k)),\n\nWith k=log23,\n\nThus, the equation to solve is,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 - (32+16k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 - (36+24k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 - (20+40k)),\n\nTo find the maximal S,\n\nLet me analyze,\n\nAs S approaches infinity,\n\nEach sqrt term approximates to S,\n\nThus,\n\nS \u2248 sqrt(S\u00b2 - ... ) \u2248S - (constant)/ (2S),\n\nThus,\n\nS \u2248 (S - C1/S ) + (S - C2/S ) + (S - C3/S ),\n\nThus,\n\nS \u22483S - (C1 +C2 +C3)/S,\n\nThus,\n\n-2S \u2248 - (C1 +C2 +C3)/S,\n\nThus,\n\n2S^2 \u2248 C1 +C2 +C3,\n\nWhere,\n\nC1= (32+16k)/2,\n\nC2=(36+24k)/2,\n\nC3= (20+40k)/2,\n\nWait,\n\nWait, the terms inside the sqrt are S\u00b2 - (32+16k),\n\nThe expansion for sqrt(S\u00b2 - D)=S - D/(2S),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 - (32+16k))\u2248S - (32+16k)/(2S),\n\nSimilarly for others,\n\nThus,\n\nSum\u22483S - [ (32+16k) + (36+24k) + (20+40k) ]/(2S),\n\nThus,\n\nS =3S - [88+80k]/(2S),\n\nThus,\n\n-2S = - (88+80k)/(2S),\n\nMultiply both sides by2S,\n\n-4S\u00b2 = - (88+80k),\n\nThus,\n\n4S\u00b2=88+80k,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2=(88+80k)/4=22+20k,\n\nThus,\n\nS= sqrt(22+20k),\n\nWith k=log23,\n\nThus,\n\nS= sqrt(22+20 log23),\n\nThus, the maximal S is sqrt(22+20 log23),\n\nThus, the minimal xyz=2^S=2^{sqrt(22+20 log23}),\n\nBut this is an exact form,\n\nBut the problem might expect an integer,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal S is achieved when each quadratic has its minimum possible discriminant,\n\nWait, but the equation S= sqrt(S\u00b2 -4u)+... must hold,\n\nThus, the maximal S is sqrt(22+20k),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{sqrt(22+20k)}=2^{sqrt(22+20 log23)}.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires this form,\n\nAlternatively, note that,\n\n22+20 log23 = log2(2^{22}3^{20}),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(22+20 log23)=sqrt( log2(2^{22}3^{20}) ),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{sqrt( log2(2^{22}3^{20}) )}},\n\nThis is very complex,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my reasoning,\n\nWait, in the equation,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}3^{20})^{1/S},\n\nTo minimize xyz, we need to maximize S,\n\nThus, the maximal S is sqrt(22+20k),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz= (2^{22}3^{20})^{1/sqrt(22+20k)}},\n\nBut this is complicated,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal S is when each quadratic has discriminant zero,\n\nThus,\n\nFor a,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(8+4k)=0,\n\nS=2*sqrt(8+4k),\n\nSimilarly for b,\n\nS=2*sqrt(9+6k),\n\nFor c,\n\nS=2*sqrt(5+10k),\n\nThe maximal S is the largest of these,\n\nCompute each,\n\nFor

think the minimal value of xyz is 2^{12}*3^{something} but likely the answer is 2^{12}*3^{5} or something,\n\nWait let me compute S_c=2*sqrt(5+10k),\n\nWith

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible value of \\( xyz \\) given these three equations involving logarithms and exponents. The equations are:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, all variables are positive real numbers. The question is asking for the minimal value of \\( xyz \\). Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, these equations look a bit intimidating with the logarithms in the exponents. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides to simplify them? Since logarithms can help turn exponents into multipliers, which might make things more manageable.\n\nLet me try taking the logarithm base 2 of each equation. Let me start with the first equation:\n\nTaking \\( \\log_2 \\) of both sides of the first equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\right) \\)\n\nUsing logarithm properties, the left side becomes \\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(yz) \\), and the right side is \\( 8 \\log_2(2) + 4 \\log_2(3) \\). Since \\( \\log_2(2) = 1 \\), that simplifies to \\( 8 + 4 \\log_2(3) \\).\n\nSo equation (1) becomes:\n\n\\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(yz) = 8 + 4 \\log_2(3) \\)  \u2026 (1a)\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for the second equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^9 \\cdot 3^6 \\right) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(y) \\cdot \\log_2(zx) \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 9 + 6 \\log_2(3) \\)\n\nSo equation (2a):\n\n\\( \\log_2(y) \\cdot \\log_2(zx) = 9 + 6 \\log_2(3) \\)  \u2026 (2a)\n\nThird equation similarly:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( z^{\\log_2(xy)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^5 \\cdot 3^{10} \\right) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2(z) \\cdot \\log_2(xy) \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 5 + 10 \\log_2(3) \\)\n\nThus, equation (3a):\n\n\\( \\log_2(z) \\cdot \\log_2(xy) = 5 + 10 \\log_2(3) \\)  \u2026 (3a)\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) involving logarithms of x, y, z. Maybe it would help to set variables for these logarithms. Let me denote:\n\nLet \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). Then, since \\( x = 2^a \\), \\( y = 2^b \\), \\( z = 2^c \\).\n\nAlso, \\( \\log_2(yz) = \\log_2 y + \\log_2 z = b + c \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\log_2(zx) = c + a \\), and \\( \\log_2(xy) = a + b \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting into equation (1a):\n\n\\( a \\cdot (b + c) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2026 (1b)\n\nSimilarly, equation (2a):\n\n\\( b \\cdot (c + a) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2026 (2b)\n\nEquation (3a):\n\n\\( c \\cdot (a + b) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\) \u2026 (3b)\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations with variables a, b, c, but there is a logarithm term \\( \\log_2 3 \\). Let me denote \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\). Since \\( \\log_2 3 \\) is a constant (approximately 1.58496), but maybe I can keep it as k for now. Let me write that:\n\nLet \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\). Then the equations become:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\) \u2026 (1b)\n2. \\( b(c + a) = 9 + 6k \\) \u2026 (2b)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\) \u2026 (3b)\n\nSo now we have three equations with variables a, b, c and a constant k. The goal is to find the minimal value of \\( xyz \\). Since \\( x = 2^a \\), \\( y = 2^b \\), \\( z = 2^c \\), then \\( xyz = 2^{a + b + c} \\). Therefore, the minimal value of \\( xyz \\) corresponds to the minimal value of \\( a + b + c \\), since 2 raised to a smaller exponent will give a smaller number. Wait, but actually, since 2 is a positive number greater than 1, the minimal value of \\( xyz \\) would be when \\( a + b + c \\) is minimized. So we need to find the minimal possible value of \\( a + b + c \\), given these three equations. Wait, but are there constraints? Let me think.\n\nWait, but the equations might not have multiple solutions, so perhaps there is only one solution for a, b, c, so we can just compute their sum. Alternatively, maybe there is some scaling or something, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can solve these equations for a, b, c. Let me see. Let me consider equations (1b), (2b), (3b). Let me denote S = a + b + c. Then, the left-hand sides of each equation can be written as:\n\nEquation 1: a(S - a) = 8 + 4k,\n\nEquation 2: b(S - b) = 9 + 6k,\n\nEquation 3: c(S - c) = 5 + 10k.\n\nHmm, that might be a useful substitution. Let me write each equation as:\n\na(S - a) = 8 + 4k,\n\nb(S - b) = 9 + 6k,\n\nc(S - c) = 5 + 10k.\n\nSo, these can be rewritten as quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively:\n\nFor a: -a\u00b2 + Sa - (8 + 4k) = 0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding the three equations? Let's see.\n\nLet me compute the sum of the left-hand sides of equations (1b), (2b), (3b):\n\na(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nThe right-hand side is (8 + 4k) + (9 + 6k) + (5 + 10k) = (8 + 9 + 5) + (4k + 6k + 10k) = 22 + 20k.\n\nTherefore:\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = 22 + 20k \u21d2 ab + bc + ca = 11 + 10k. \u2026 (4)\n\nSo that's one equation. Also, if we can express S = a + b + c, then perhaps we can find another relation. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider the equations again:\n\na(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb(S - b) =9 +6k,\n\nc(S - c)=5 +10k.\n\nSo, each of these can be written as:\n\nSa - a\u00b2 = 8 +4k,\n\nSb - b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nSc - c\u00b2 =5 +10k.\n\nLet me arrange them as:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) = 0,\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb + (9 +6k) = 0,\n\nc\u00b2 - Sc + (5 +10k) = 0.\n\nThese are quadratic equations in a, b, c respectively. The solutions for each variable would be:\n\na = [S \u00b1 \u221a(S\u00b2 - 4*(8 +4k))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. However, since a, b, c are real numbers (as x, y, z are positive reals), the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 - 4*(8 +4k) \u2265 0,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2 - 4*(9 +6k) \u2265 0,\n\nFor c: S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u2265 0.\n\nHmm, but this might complicate things. Maybe another approach is better. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables a, b, c and equations (1b), (2b), (3b). Let me see if there is a way to express a, b, c in terms of S and the other variables. Let me denote S = a + b + c, as before.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation (1b): a(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nEquation (2b): b(S - b) =9 +6k,\n\nEquation (3b): c(S - c) =5 +10k.\n\nIf I can solve these equations for a, b, c in terms of S, then maybe sum them up? Hmm, but not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote:\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\nEquation (1b): a(S - a) = 8 +4k,\n\nEquation (2b): b(S - b) =9 +6k,\n\nEquation (3b): c(S - c)=5 +10k.\n\nLet me denote the right-hand sides as constants:\n\nLet me call them:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nM1 = 8 +4k,\n\nM2 =9 +6k,\n\nM3 =5 +10k.\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\na(S -a) = M1,\n\nb(S -b) = M2,\n\nc(S -c) = M3.\n\nLet me consider that each variable (a, b, c) satisfies a quadratic equation. Let me write them as:\n\na\u00b2 - S a + M1 = 0,\n\nb\u00b2 - S b + M2 = 0,\n\nc\u00b2 - S c + M3 = 0.\n\nTherefore, each of a, b, c is a root of their respective quadratic equations. However, since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 -4*M1 \u22650,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut perhaps we can consider that a, b, c are all roots of a cubic equation? Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that all three variables a, b, c are roots of the same quadratic equation? But they are different variables, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding up the equations. Let me think.\n\nIf we have a\u00b2 - S a + M1 =0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. Let's add all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - S(a + b + c) + (M1 + M2 + M3) = 0.\n\nBut since S = a + b + c,\n\nThis becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - S\u00b2 + (M1 + M2 + M3) =0.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3).\n\nBut also, we know that:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation:\n\nS\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3).\n\nTherefore,\n\n-2(ab + bc + ca) = - (M1 + M2 + M3),\n\nWhich gives:\n\nab + bc + ca = (M1 + M2 + M3)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier we had equation (4): ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k,\n\nand M1 + M2 + M3 = (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) = 22 +20k,\n\nso (M1 + M2 + M3)/2 = 11 +10k,\n\nwhich matches equation (4). So that's consistent. So that's just reinforcing the previous result, nothing new.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach is needed. Let me think again.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a(b + c) = M1,\n\n2. b(c + a) = M2,\n\n3. c(a + b) = M3.\n\nLet me see if I can solve for a, b, c in terms of S and each other variables. Let me see.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nFrom equation 1: a(b + c) = M1 \u21d2 a(S - a) = M1,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of S. Let me suppose S is known. Then,\n\nFrom equation (1b):\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4M1)] / 2,\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express variables as fractions of S?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the ratios between the equations.\n\nLet me divide equation (1b) by equation (2b):\n\n[ a(b + c) ] / [ b(c + a) ] = M1 / M2,\n\nSimilarly, this gives:\n\n(a/b) * [ (b + c)/(c + a) ) ] = M1/M2,\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables:\n\nLet me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote variables as a, b, c, and equations (1b), (2b), (3b). Let's see if I can solve for a, b, c.\n\nLet me consider equations:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) = 8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(c + a) =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(a + b) =5 +10k,\n\nLet me denote the sum S =a + b + c,\n\nThen, as before, Equation1: a(S -a)=8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly, Equation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k.\n\nLet me think of each of these equations as quadratic in a, b, c respectively, with S as a parameter.\n\nSuppose that all three quadratics have real roots, so the discriminant must be non-negative. But since the problem states that x, y, z are positive real numbers, we must have valid a, b, c (which are real numbers). Therefore, the discriminants must be non-negative. So, S must be chosen such that all three discriminants are non-negative.\n\nBut perhaps there is a unique S that satisfies all three equations. Let me think of the equations as three equations in variables a, b, c and S. Since S = a + b + c, so four variables with four equations. But this might be a system that can be solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding the three equations.\n\nWait, but the equations are:\n\na(S -a) = M1,\n\nb(S -b) = M2,\n\nc(S -c) = M3,\n\nAdding them gives:\n\naS -a\u00b2 +bS -b\u00b2 +cS -c\u00b2 = M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nS(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nBut since S = a + b + c,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nWhich gives,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3),\n\nWhich we already saw before. Hmm, so that's not giving anything new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of S and substitute into each other equations. Let me try.\n\nFrom equation (1b):\n\na(S - a) = M1 \u21d2 a\u00b2 - S a + M1 =0,\n\nSo, a = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nBut this would lead to complicated expressions. Maybe instead, let's suppose that we can write each variable as a function of S and set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the product of all three equations. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if we multiply all three left-hand sides and right-hand sides:\n\nLeft: [a(b + c)] [b(c + a)] [c(a + b)] = (a b c) ( (b + c)(c + a)(a + b) )\n\nRight: M1 M2 M3,\n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc = S*(ab + bc + ca) - abc,\n\nBut combining with previous expressions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to try another approach.\n\nLet me recall that the original equations can be written in terms of logarithms, so maybe there's an exponentiation trick.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nPerhaps taking the product of all three equations? Let me see:\n\nMultiply left sides and right sides:\n\n\\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\times y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\times z^{\\log_2(xy)} = (2^8 \\cdot 3^4)(2^9 \\cdot 3^6)(2^5 \\cdot 3^{10}) \\)\n\nCompute the right side first:\n\nMultiply the exponents for 2: 8 +9 +5 =22,\n\nexponents for 3:4 +6 +10=20,\n\nThus, right side is 2^{22} *3^{20}.\n\nLeft side: Let me see if I can manipulate the product of the left sides.\n\nLet me denote each term as follows:\n\nFirst term: \\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\),\n\nSecond term: \\( y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\),\n\nThird term: \\( z^{\\log_2(xy)} \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps taking logarithm of the entire left side?\n\nLet me take the logarithm base 2 of the left side:\n\nlog2( LHS ) = log2 [ x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\times y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\times z^{\\log_2(xy)} ]\n\n= log2(x^{\\log_2(yz)}) + log2(y^{\\log_2(zx)}) + log2(z^{\\log_2(xy)} )\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the left sides of equations (1a), (2a), (3a). So sum of those:\n\n= [ log2(x) log2(yz) + log2(y) log2(zx) + log2(z) log2(xy) ]\n\nWe can compute this sum:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: log2x * log2(yz) = log2x*(log2y + log2z) = a*(b + c),\n\nSecond term: log2y * log2(zx) = log2y*(log2z + log2x) = b*(c + a),\n\nThird term: log2z * log2(xy) = log2z*(log2x + log2y) = c*(a + b),\n\nSo the total sum is a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nFrom equation (4), this sum is equal to 2*(11 +10k) = 22 +20k.\n\nTherefore, log2(LHS) = 22 +20k,\n\nThus, log2(RHS) = log2(2^{22}*3^{20}) =22 +20 log2(3)= 22 +20k,\n\nTherefore, equality holds. So this doesn't give new information, just confirms the previous equations.\n\nHmm, so taking the product of the original equations doesn't give a new equation, just confirms consistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the product of variables x, y, z. Since we need to minimize xyz, perhaps express xyz in terms of S = log2(xyz) = log2x + log2y + log2z = a + b + c.\n\nSo, if I can find S, then xyz =2^S, and we need to find the minimal S.\n\nTherefore, maybe the key is to find S = a + b + c.\n\nSo, how to find S?\n\nLet me think of the equations (1b), (2b), (3b):\n\nEquations:\n\n1. a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\n3. c(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me denote each of these as:\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\naS -a\u00b2 = M1,\n\nbS -b\u00b2 = M2,\n\ncS -c\u00b2 = M3,\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\naS + bS +cS - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)= M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nWhich is:\n\nS(a + b +c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nBut a + b + c = S,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = M1 + M2 + M3,\n\nHence,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3),\n\nWhich again gives the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each a, b, c in terms of S and substitute into the equation for ab + bc + ca.\n\nWe know that:\n\nab + bc + ca = 11 +10k,\n\nand also,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3)) + 2*(ab + bc + ca),\n\nTherefore,\n\n0 = - (M1 + M2 + M3) + 2*(ab + bc + ca),\n\nBut since ab + bc + ca = (M1 + M2 + M3)/2,\n\nWhich again is consistent with previous statements. So no new info.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider variables a, b, c individually. Let me suppose that we can write each variable in terms of S.\n\nLet me consider the first equation: a(S - a) = M1,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + M1 =0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFor b: b\u00b2 - Sb + M2 =0,\n\nFor c: c\u00b2 - Sc + M3 =0,\n\nLet me suppose that a, b, c are all real roots of their respective quadratics.\n\nLet me denote the roots of each quadratic:\n\nFor a: [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nBut since x, y, z are positive real numbers, a, b, c must be real numbers, so discriminants non-negative, and also the roots must be real. Also, since the quadratic equations must have positive roots (since logarithms are defined only for positive numbers, so x, y, z >0 implies a, b, c can be any real numbers, but the exponents in the original equations are log2(yz) etc., which are real as long as y,z etc. are positive. So the variables a, b, c can be any real numbers, but we need to ensure that the solutions a, b, c from the quadratics are real.\n\nTherefore, discriminant must be non-negative for each quadratic:\n\nSo,\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 \u2265 4*M1 = 4*(8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2 \u22654*M2 =4*(9 +6k),\n\nFor c:S\u00b2 \u22654*M3=4*(5 +10k),\n\nTherefore, S must be at least the square root of the maximum of these three:\n\nsqrt(4*(8+4k)), sqrt(4*(9+6k)), sqrt(4*(5+10k)),\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(4*(8+4k)) = 2*sqrt(8 +4k),\n\nsqrt(4*(9+6k))=2*sqrt(9+6k),\n\nsqrt(4*(5+10k))=2*sqrt(5+10k).\n\nThus S must be \u2265 2*sqrt(max{8+4k, 9+6k,5+10k}).\n\nHmm, but since we need to find the minimal S, perhaps S is exactly equal to the square root required by one of these equations? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all three quadratics have the same root S? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that a, b, c are all equal? Let me check if that is possible.\n\nSuppose a = b = c,\n\nthen,\n\nthen S =3a,\n\nand then equations (1b): a(2a)=8 +4k,\n\nso 2a\u00b2 =8 +4k \u21d2a\u00b2=4 +2k,\n\nSimilarly equation (2b): same, so 2a\u00b2=9+6k,\n\nBut this would require 4 +2k = (8 +4k)/2 =4 +2k,\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, equation (1b): a*(2a)=8 +4k \u21d22a\u00b2=8 +4k,\n\nEquation (2b): same as equation (1b) if a=b=c,\n\nso 2a\u00b2 =9+6k,\n\nBut that would require 8 +4k =9 +6k \u21d2 -1 =2k \u21d2k= -0.5,\n\nBut k=log23 which is about 1.58, so that's impossible. Thus, a,b,c can't be equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a relation between a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of S. Let me denote:\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote the equations again:\n\na(S -a)=M1,\n\nb(S -b)=M2,\n\nc(S -c)=M3,\n\nLet me rearrange each equation as:\n\na^2 = Sa - M1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb^2 = Sb - M2,\n\nc^2 = Sc - M3,\n\nSo, each squared variable is expressed in terms of S and the constants.\n\nNow, let me compute ab + bc + ca,\n\nWe know that ab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nLet me see if I can express ab + bc + ca in terms of S and these squared terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider:\n\n(ab + bc + ca)^2 = a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2abc(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute (a + b + c)^2 = S\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nWe know that a\u00b2 = Sa - M1,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S(a + b +c) - (M1 + M2 + M3),\n\nWhich is S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3),\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 - (M1 + M2 + M3)] + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nWhich again gives the same result.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to use substitution.\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFrom each equation,\n\na\u00b2 = Sa - M1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - M2,\n\nc\u00b2 = Sc - M3,\n\nSo, perhaps if I consider the product abc?\n\nLet me see, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider multiplying equations for a and b and c?\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s consider variables a, b, c, and equations:\n\n1. a(S - a) = M1,\n\n2. b(S - b) = M2,\n\n3. c(S - c)= M3,\n\nLet me consider that each of these equations can be written as:\n\n(S -a) = M1/a,\n\n(S -b)= M2/b,\n\n(S -c)= M3/c,\n\nAssuming that a, b, c \u22600,\n\nThen,\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\n(S -a) + (S -b) + (S -c) = M1/a + M2/b + M3/c,\n\nLeft side: 3S - (a + b + c) =3S - S =2S,\n\nThus,\n\n2S = M1/a + M2/b + M3/c,\n\nTherefore,\n\nM1/a + M2/b + M3/c =2S,\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving a,b,c and S.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each term as M1/a = (S -a), so:\n\nM1/a + M2/b + M3/c = (S -a) + (S -b) + (S -c) =3S - (a + b + c)=3S -S=2S,\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nHmm, perhaps another angle. Let me consider the ratios between equations.\n\nLet me divide equation (1b) by equation (2b):\n\n[ a(b + c) ] / [ b(a + c) ] = M1 / M2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(a/b) * [ (b +c)/(a +c) ) ] = M1/M2,\n\nHmm, but complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that variables a, b, c are proportional to some constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me try to assume that S is a particular value and see if equations can be satisfied. Since S is the sum we need, maybe I can set up equations to solve for S.\n\nLet me consider that each equation can be written as:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c. Since a, b, c are real numbers, the square roots must be real, so discriminants must be non-negative.\n\nBut perhaps, since we need to have a, b, c all real, so S must be at least the square roots of each discriminant as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of S as a variable and set up equations for a, b, c in terms of S, then substitute into the equation ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] / 2,\n\nWait, but which root do we take? Since a is a real number, but since x is positive, so a can be any real number (since log2x can be any real number). But to get the minimal S, perhaps we need to take the smaller root? Or the larger?\n\nWait, since a = log2x, and x is a positive real, there's no restriction on a's sign. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two possible solutions for each variable, but I need to choose the one that makes the equations consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I consider that all three quadratics have the same S, so that the variables a, b, c are all expressed in terms of S, and then their sum is S. Let me try.\n\nLet me suppose that for each variable:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2)] /2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)] /2,\n\nThen,\n\na + b + c = S,\n\nSo:\n\n[ (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)) /2 + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2))/2 + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3))/2 ] = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n[3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)) ] = 2S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3),\n\nHmm, this is a complicated equation in S. Solving this algebraically might be challenging, but perhaps we can plug in the values of M1, M2, M3.\n\nRecall that:\n\nM1 =8 +4k,\n\nM2=9 +6k,\n\nM3=5 +10k,\n\nwhere k=log23.\n\nTherefore,\n\nLet me write:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k)) = S,\n\nThis equation must be solved for S. Since k is a known constant (log23 \u22481.58496), perhaps we can substitute numerical values to approximate S?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an integer value of S that works?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter substitution. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assume that the minimal S is achieved when all three quadratics have their discriminants zero, i.e., when S is exactly sqrt(4*M1), sqrt(4*M2), sqrt(4*M3). But that would require S\u00b2 =4*M1=4*(8+4k)=32+16k,\n\nSimilarly, S\u00b2=4*M2=4*(9+6k)=36+24k,\n\nand S\u00b2=4*M3=4*(5+10k)=20+40k,\n\nWhich would require 32 +16k =36+24k \u21d2 -4=8k \u21d2k=-0.5,\n\nWhich isn't possible since k=log23>0,\n\nSo that's impossible.\n\nThus, the minimal S must be greater than the maximum of sqrt(4*M1), sqrt(4*M2), sqrt(4*M3).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to find S such that variables a,b,c are such that their expressions lead to consistent equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the equations are linear in terms of S. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me consider that each of a, b, c can be written as follows:\n\nFrom equation (1b):\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2)] /2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)] /2,\n\nBut since a + b + c = S,\n\nPerhaps choosing the minus sign in each case (since sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M) < S for positive M), so:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nThus,\n\na + b + c = [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3))]/2 = S,\n\nTherefore,\n\n3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)) = 2S,\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3),\n\nThis is an equation in S, which seems difficult to solve analytically. Maybe we can make an assumption here. Let me see if S is an integer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps plugging in the value of k = log23 and trying to solve numerically?\n\nWait, but since the problem is likely designed to have an exact answer, maybe there's a substitution or another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equations. Let me think of taking logarithms again but in natural logarithm instead of base 2? Maybe that could lead to a different perspective?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables in terms of exponents with base 2 and 3.\n\nLet me note that in the original equations, the right-hand sides are products of powers of 2 and 3. Perhaps we can write each variable x, y, z as products of powers of 2 and 3?\n\nSuppose that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set x = 2^{p} *3^{q},\n\ny =2^{r}*3^{s},\n\nz=2^{u}*3^{v},\n\nwhere p, q, r, s, u, v are real numbers.\n\nThen, we can substitute into the original equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 *3^4,\n\nLet me compute log2(yz):\n\nyz =2^{r +u}*3^{s +v},\n\nThus log2(yz)= log2(2^{r +u} *3^{s +v}) = (r +u) + log2(3^{s +v}) ) = (r +u) + (s + v) * log2(3),\n\nWait, but log2(3^{s +v}) = (s + v) * log2(3),\n\nTherefore,\n\nlog2(yz)= (r +u) + (s +v) * log2(3),\n\nSimilarly, then x^{log2(yz)} = [2^{p}*3^{q}]^{ (r +u) + (s +v) * log2(3) }.\n\nHmm, this might complicate things because of the cross terms between exponents and logarithms. Maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that log2(yz) is a linear combination of logs, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take natural logs of the original equations?\n\nLet me try:\n\nTake natural logarithm of first equation:\n\nln(x^{log2(yz)}) = ln(2^8 *3^4),\n\nLeft side: log2(yz) * ln x,\n\nRight side: 8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nSimilarly, log2(yz) = (ln(yz))/ln2,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(ln(yz)/ln2) * ln x =8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nMultiply both sides by ln2:\n\nln(yz) * ln x =8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln2 ln3,\n\nSimilarly for the other equations.\n\nHmm, this might lead to a system of equations in terms of ln x, ln y, ln z.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set A = ln x, B = ln y, C = ln z,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation 1:\n\n(ln(yz)) * A =8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln2 ln3,\n\nBut ln(yz) = ln y + ln z = B + C,\n\nThus equation1:\n\nA(B + C)=8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln2 ln3,\n\nSimilarly equation2:\n\nB(C + A)=9 (ln2)^2 +6 ln2 ln3,\n\nEquation3:\n\nC(A + B)=5 (ln2)^2 +10 ln2 ln3,\n\nHmm, now the equations are linear in terms of variables A,B,C, but multiplied by each other terms. Still nonlinear.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous system but in different variables. Maybe same approach applies.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C,\n\nThen:\n\nEquation1: A(S -A)=8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln2 ln3,\n\nEquation2: B(S -B)=9 (ln2)^2 +6 ln2 ln3,\n\nEquation3: C(S -C)=5 (ln2)^2 +10 ln2 ln3,\n\nThis is analogous to the previous system with variables A,B,C and constants involving ln2 and ln3.\n\nHmm, so the problem is symmetric in structure but with different constants.\n\nThe key point is that this system is analogous to the previous one with a substitution. It might not help to get an exact solution unless there's some symmetry or substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the constants on the RHS can be expressed in terms of ln2 and ln3, but this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider ratios between equations.\n\nLet me consider equation1 and equation2:\n\n[A(S -A)] / [B(S -B)] = [8 (ln2)^2 +4 ln2 ln3]/[9 (ln2)^2 +6 ln2 ln3 ]\n\n= [8 +4 (ln3/ln2)]/[9 +6 (ln3/ln2)]\n\nLet me denote k = log23 = ln3/ln2,\n\nTherefore,\n\n[A(S -A)]/[B(S - B)] = (8 +4k)/(9 +6k),\n\nSimilarly for other ratios.\n\nBut this again leads to non-linear equations.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me think back to the initial substitution where a=log2x, etc.\n\nLet me recall that S = a + b + c,\n\nand we need to find S.\n\nSuppose that I let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet me consider that the equations are:\n\na(S -a)=M1,\n\nb(S -b)=M2,\n\nc(S -c)=M3,\n\nSo, each variable satisfies an equation of the form t(S -t)=M.\n\nLet me think of each of these as quadratic equations in t, so their roots are t1 and t2 = S - M1/t1 or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variable a as a root of the quadratic equation t\u00b2 -St + M1=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nSo the three quadratics are:\n\nFor a: t\u00b2 - St + M1=0,\n\nFor b: t\u00b2 - St + M2=0,\n\nFor c: t\u00b2 - St + M3=0,\n\nThus, the variables a,b,c are roots of three different quadratics with the same leading coefficient and same linear term coefficient ( -S ), but different constants.\n\nTherefore, the roots of each quadratic are:\n\nFor a: [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nTherefore, the variables a,b,c are the roots of these three different quadratics. But since the quadratics have different constants, their roots are different.\n\nHowever, the sum a + b + c = S,\n\nSo, if I consider that each variable is a root of their own quadratic, and their sum is S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the three quadratics and their roots.\n\nLet me denote the roots of the first quadratic (for a):\n\nt1 and t2 = S - t1,\n\nSince the product of roots is M1,\n\nSo, t1 * t2 = M1,\n\nSimilarly for the other quadratics,\n\nFor the second quadratic (for b):\n\nroots are t3 and t4 = S - t3, product t3*t4=M2,\n\nThird quadratic (for c):\n\nroots t5 and t6 = S - t5, product t5*t6=M3.\n\nBut variables a,b,c are each one of these roots. Since the variables a,b,c must sum to S, perhaps each variable is the smaller root of its quadratic?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each variable is the root that is less than S/2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I set a, b, c to be the smaller roots of their respective quadratics, then their sum would be less than S, which contradicts the requirement that a + b + c = S. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each variable is the larger root?\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nFor the quadratic equation t\u00b2 - St + M =0,\n\nThe roots are [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M)]/2,\n\nThe larger root is [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M)]/2,\n\nThe smaller root is [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M)]/2,\n\nThus, if we take the larger roots for a, b, c, then their sum would be:\n\nsum_larger_roots = [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1)]/2 + [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2)]/2 + [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)]/2,\n\n= [3S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4M3)] /2,\n\nBut since we need a + b +c = S,\n\nThis sum equals S only if:\n\n3S + sqrt(...) terms =2S \u21d2 S + sqrt(...) terms =0,\n\nWhich is impossible since S is positive.\n\nAlternatively, if we take two larger roots and one smaller, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one variable is the larger root, another is the smaller, etc.?\n\nThis seems quite convoluted. Maybe this problem requires a different insight.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of working with logarithms, let me think of the original equations again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} =2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} =2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} =2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nLet me take the logarithm of each equation with base 2:\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog2(x^{log2(yz)}) = log2(2^8*3^4),\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nlog2(x) * log2(yz) =8 +4 log23,\n\nWhich is the same as equation (1a).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using natural logs?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in terms of exponents of 2 and 3.\n\nSuppose that x =2^{a}3^{b},\n\ny=2^{c}3^{d},\n\nz=2^{e}3^{f},\n\nThen, log2(yz)= log2(2^{c + e}3^{d + f})= (c + e) + (d + f)*log23,\n\nSimilarly, the left side of first equation:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = [2^{a}3^{b}]^{ (c + e) + (d + f)*log23 }.\n\nThis expression is equal to 2^{a[(c + e)+(d + f)k]} *3^{b[(c + e)+(d + f)k]} where k=log23.\n\nThe right side is 2^8 3^4,\n\nTherefore, equating exponents:\n\nFor base 2:\n\na[(c + e) + (d + f)k] =8,\n\nFor base3:\n\nb[(c + e)+(d +f)k] =4,\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\ny^{log2(zx)} = [2^c 3^d]^{ log2(zx) } = [2^c 3^d]^{e +a + (f + b)k }\n\nWait, log2(zx)= log2(2^{e+a}3^{f + b})= (e +a)+(f +b)k,\n\nThus exponent for base2:\n\nc[(e +a)+(f +b)k] =9,\n\nExponent for base3:\n\nd[(e +a)+(f +b)k] =6,\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{log2(xy)} = [2^e 3^f]^{ log2(xy) } = [2^e 3^f]^{ (a +c) + (b +d)k }.\n\nThus,\n\nExponent base2:\n\ne[(a +c) + (b +d)k] =5,\n\nExponent base3:\n\nf[(a +c) + (b +d)k] =10,\n\nSo now we have six equations:\n\n1. a*(c + e + (d + f)k) =8,\n\n2. b*(c + e + (d + f)k) =4,\n\n3. c*(a + e + (b + f)k) =9,\n\n4. d*(a + e + (b + f)k) =6,\n\n5. e*(a + c + (b + d)k) =5,\n\n6. f*(a + c + (b + d)k) =10,\n\nHmm, this seems even more complicated, but perhaps there is a pattern here.\n\nLet me note that equations 1 and 2 have the same term in parentheses: (c + e + (d + f)k),\n\nSimilarly equations 3 and 4 share (a + e + (b + f)k),\n\nEquations5 and6 share (a +c + (b +d)k),\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTerm1 = c + e + (d + f)k,\n\nTerm2 = a + e + (b + f)k,\n\nTerm3 = a + c + (b + d)k,\n\nSo then equations become:\n\n1. a * Term1 =8,\n\n2. b * Term1 =4,\n\n3. c * Term2 =9,\n\n4. d * Term2 =6,\n\n5. e * Term3 =5,\n\n6. f * Term3 =10.\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\nTerm1 = c + e + (d +f)k,\n\nTerm2 = a + e + (b +f)k,\n\nTerm3 = a + c + (b +d)k,\n\nSo now, we have six equations with variables a,b,c,d,e,f and terms Term1, Term2, Term3.\n\nThis is a system of equations, but perhaps we can find ratios between variables.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2:\n\nFrom 1 and 2:\n\n(a * Term1)/(b * Term1) =8/4 \u21d2 a/b =2 \u21d2 a=2b,\n\nSimilarly from equations3 and4:\n\n(c * Term2)/(d * Term2)=9/6 \u21d2 c/d= 3/2 \u21d2 c= (3/2)d,\n\nFrom equations5 and6:\n\n(e * Term3)/(f * Term3)=5/10 \u21d2e/f=1/2 \u21d2 e=(1/2)f,\n\nSo we have:\n\na =2b,\n\nc=(3/2)d,\n\ne=(1/2)f,\n\nNow, let me substitute these into the terms Term1, Term2, Term3.\n\nLet me also express variables in terms of b, d, f.\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set b as a variable, d as another, and f as another.\n\nThen,\n\na =2b,\n\nc=(3/2)d,\n\ne=(1/2)f,\n\nNow, let me substitute into Term1:\n\nTerm1 = c + e + (d + f)*k,\n\n= (3/2)d + (1/2)f + (d + f)k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nTerm2 = a + e + (b +f)*k,\n\n=2b + (1/2)f + (b +f)k,\n\nTerm3 = a + c + (b +d)*k,\n\n=2b + (3/2)d + (b +d)k,\n\nNow, let's also express equations 1,3,5 in terms of these variables.\n\nEquation1: a*Term1=8 \u21d2 2b*Term1=8 \u21d2 Term1=4/b,\n\nEquation3: c*Term2=9 \u21d2 (3/2)d *Term2=9 \u21d2 Term2= (9*2)/(3d)=6/d,\n\nEquation5: e*Term3=5 \u21d2 (1/2)f * Term3=5 \u21d2 Term3=10/f,\n\nSo now:\n\nTerm1 =4/b,\n\nTerm2=6/d,\n\nTerm3=10/f,\n\nNow, let's write the expressions for Term1, Term2, Term3 in terms of variables and set them equal to 4/b, 6/d, 10/f respectively.\n\nStarting with Term1:\n\nTerm1 = (3/2)d + (1/2)f + (d + f)k =4/b,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nTerm2 = 2b + (1/2)f + (b +f)k =6/d,\n\nTerm3 =2b + (3/2)d + (b +d)k =10/f,\n\nNow, we have three equations with variables b, d, f.\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can find relations between b, d, f.\n\nLet me see if we can express all variables in terms of one variable.\n\nLet me suppose that we can express d and f in terms of b, or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can find ratios between variables.\n\nLet me look at the three equations:\n\nEquationA (from Term1):\n\n(3/2)d + (1/2)f + (d + f)k =4/b,\n\nEquationB (from Term2):\n\n2b + (1/2)f + (b +f)k =6/d,\n\nEquationC (from Term3):\n\n2b + (3/2)d + (b +d)k =10/f,\n\nHmm, this is a system of three equations with three variables b, d, f.\n\nThis seems quite involved, but perhaps we can assume that variables are integers or simple fractions to find a solution?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there is a common factor or substitution.\n\nLet me denote k=log23, which is approximately 1.58496.\n\nBut maybe we can keep it as k for now.\n\nLet me try to rearrange EquationA:\n\n(3/2)d + (1/2)f + k(d +f)=4/b,\n\nLet me factor terms with d and f:\n\nd*(3/2 +k) + f*(1/2 +k) =4/b,\n\nSimilarly EquationB:\n\n2b + (1/2)f +k(b +f) =6/d,\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2b +k*b + (1/2 +k)f =6/d,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nb*(2 +k) + f*(1/2 +k) =6/d,\n\nSimilarly EquationC:\n\n2b + (3/2)d +k(b +d)=10/f,\n\nRearranged:\n\n2b +k b + (3/2 +k)d =10/f,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nb*(2 +k) + d*(3/2 +k)=10/f,\n\nHmm. So now, equations A,B,C can be written as:\n\nEquationA:\n\nd*(3/2 +k) + f*(1/2 +k) =4/b,\n\nEquationB:\n\nb*(2 +k) + f*(1/2 +k) =6/d,\n\nEquationC:\n\nb*(2 +k) + d*(3/2 +k)=10/f,\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write Equations B and C in terms of terms from A?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me denote some variables to simplify.\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest possible value of xyz given these three equations involving logarithms and exponents. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, all variables are positive real numbers, so logarithms are defined. The problem is asking for the minimal value of xyz. \n\nI remember that when dealing with equations involving variables raised to logarithmic expressions, sometimes taking logarithms of both sides can help simplify things. Let me try that approach. Let me denote each equation's logarithm to bring down the exponent.\n\nLet's take the logarithm base 2 of each equation. Let me start with the first equation:\n\nTaking log\u2082 of both sides of the first equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\right) = \\log_2(2^8 \\cdot 3^4) \\)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule: \\( \\log_b(a^c) = c \\log_b a \\), so the left side becomes:\n\n\\( \\log_2(x) \\cdot \\log_2(yz) \\)\n\nThe right side can be split using log properties:\n\n\\( \\log_2(2^8) + \\log_2(3^4) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSo equation 1 becomes:\n\n\\( \\log_2 x \\cdot \\log_2(y z) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for the other two equations.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nTake log\u2082 of both sides:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( y^{\\log_2(z x)} \\right) = \\log_2(2^9 \\cdot 3^6) \\)\n\nLeft side becomes \\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(z x) \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSo equation 2:\n\n\\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(z x) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nThird equation:\n\nTaking log\u2082 again:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( z^{\\log_2(x y)} \\right) = \\log_2(2^5 \\cdot 3^{10}) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(x y) \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nEquation 3:\n\n\\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(x y) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations involving the logs of x, y, z. Let me denote variables for simplicity. Let me set:\n\nLet \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). Then:\n\nAlso, \\( \\log_2(y z) = \\log_2 y + \\log_2 z = b + c \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\log_2(z x) = c + a \\), and \\( \\log_2(x y) = a + b \\)\n\nSo substituting these into the equations:\n\nEquation 1: \\( a \\cdot (b + c) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nEquation 2: \\( b \\cdot (c + a) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nEquation 3: \\( c \\cdot (a + b) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations with variables a, b, c. The problem is to find the minimal value of xyz. Since \\( x = 2^a \\), \\( y = 2^b \\), \\( z = 2^c \\), so xyz = 2^{a + b + c}. Therefore, to minimize xyz, we need to minimize \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving for a, b, c from the three equations and then find a + b + c. The minimal value would then be 2^{a + b + c}, but since we need the minimal xyz, which is directly 2^{a+b+c}, so actually, since 2 is a positive number greater than 1, the minimal value corresponds to the minimal a + b + c. Wait, but maybe there's only one solution? Hmm, perhaps the system has a unique solution, so we can just solve it.\n\nLet me write the equations again in terms of a, b, c:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nWait, but here \\( \\log_2 3 \\) is a constant. Let me denote \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\), so that the equations can be written in terms of k. Let me see, perhaps this substitution can make it easier. Let me do that.\n\nLet \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\). Therefore, equations become:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\)\n2. \\( b(a + c) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nNow, the variables are a, b, c, and k is a constant. Since k is just a constant, we can treat it as such.\n\nHmm, so I need to solve these three equations for a, b, c. Let me see. Let me note that the equations are symmetric in a way but not entirely. Maybe adding them up would help?\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c. Let me also denote the equations as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3.\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\nLeft side: a(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b) = a(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: a(b + c) = ab + ac\n\nSecond term: b(a + c) = ba + bc\n\nThird term: c(a + b) = ca + cb\n\nAdding them all together: ab + ac + ba + bc + ca + cb = 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nTherefore, the left side is 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nThe right side: (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) = (8 +9 +5) + (4k +6k +10k) = 22 + 20k\n\nTherefore, 2(ab + bc + ca) = 22 + 20k => ab + bc + ca = 11 + 10k\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have that ab + bc + ca = 11 + 10k. \n\nWe also need to find S = a + b + c. Let me see if I can find S.\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can express each equation in terms of S. Let me note that:\n\nFrom equation 1: a(b + c) = a(S - a) = 8 +4k\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: b(S - b) =9 +6k\n\nEquation3: c(S - c) =5 +10k\n\nHmm, that's an interesting way to write them. Let me write each equation as:\n\na(S - a) = 8 +4k --> equation1: -a\u00b2 + aS =8 +4k\n\nSimilarly, equation2: -b\u00b2 + bS =9 +6k\n\nEquation3: -c\u00b2 + cS =5 +10k\n\nHmm, so each is a quadratic in terms of a, b, c respectively. Maybe we can set up equations here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider variables a, b, c and set up a system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for (a + b + c) in terms of the equations. Alternatively, perhaps we can write each of a, b, c in terms of S?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if I can find a, b, c such that they satisfy the equations, then S can be found. Alternatively, perhaps let me consider variables a, b, c and see if I can find expressions for each variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract the equations pairwise? Let me see.\n\nLet me try to consider equations 1 and 2:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) = 8 +4k\n\nEquation2: b(a + c) =9 +6k\n\nLet me subtract equation1 - equation2:\n\na(b + c) - b(a + c) = (8 +4k) - (9 +6k)\n\nLeft side: ab + ac - ba - bc = ac - bc = c(a - b)\n\nRight side: -1 -2k\n\nTherefore: c(a - b) = -1 -2k --> c(b - a) =1 + 2k\n\nSimilarly, maybe equation2 - equation3?\n\nEquation2: b(a + c) =9 +6k\n\nEquation3: c(a + b) =5 +10k\n\nSubtract equation3 from equation2:\n\nb(a + c) - c(a + b) = (9 +6k) - (5 +10k)\n\nLeft side: ab + bc - ac - bc = ab - ac = a(b - c)\n\nRight side: 4 -4k\n\nThus: a(b - c) =4 -4k\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. c(b - a) =1 + 2k\n\n2. a(b - c) =4 -4k\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find another equation by subtracting equation1 and equation3?\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) =8 +4k\n\nEquation3: c(a + b)=5 +10k\n\nSubtract equation3 - equation1:\n\nc(a + b) -a(b + c) = (5 +10k) - (8 +4k)\n\nLeft side: ac + bc -ab -ac = bc -ab = b(c - a)\n\nRight side: -3 +6k\n\nThus, b(c - a) = -3 +6k --> b(a - c) = 3 -6k\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations from the differences:\n\nLet me summarize the differences:\n\nFrom Eq1 - Eq2: c(b - a) =1 +2k --> (1)\n\nFrom Eq2 - Eq3: a(b - c)=4 -4k --> (2)\n\nFrom Eq3 - Eq1: b(c -a)= -3 +6k --> (3)\n\nHmm, perhaps express variables in terms of (a - b), etc.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find a relation between a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider introducing variables for differences? Maybe not. Alternatively, let me think of equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1): c(b - a) = 1 +2k\n\nEquation (2): a(b - c) =4 -4k\n\nEquation (3): b(c -a)= -3 +6k\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write all three equations in terms of (b - a), (c - a), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me assume variables as variables and try to solve step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express variables in terms of S = a + b + c. Wait, perhaps let me denote S = a + b + c. Then, since we have ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k, and S is the sum. Then, perhaps if I can find S, then I can find a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find S in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me think of all three equations. Let me denote:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c) = 8 +4k --> a(S - a) =8 +4k\n\nSimilarly, equation2: b(S - b) =9 +6k\n\nEquation3: c(S - c) =5 +10k\n\nTherefore, each variable satisfies a quadratic equation. Let me consider that.\n\nSo, for example, equation1 can be written as:\n\n-a\u00b2 + Sa =8 +4k --> a\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k) =0\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nb\u00b2 - Sb + (9 +6k)=0\n\nAnd c:\n\nc\u00b2 - Sc + (5 +10k)=0\n\nTherefore, each of a, b, c are roots of quadratics. Since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since a, b, c are the roots of these respective quadratics, perhaps they can be considered as variables such that each is a solution to their own quadratic. Since there are three variables and three equations, but each equation is quadratic, perhaps there's a relationship here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of a, b, c as variables such that they are the roots of some cubic equation? Hmm, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since each quadratic equation gives a value for the variable, perhaps I can write expressions for a, b, c in terms of S and then plug into the sum S.\n\nLet me try that approach. For example, from equation1:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0 --> solving for a:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k))]/2\n\nSimilarly, for b:\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k))]/2\n\nAnd c = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k))]/2\n\nHmm, but since S is the sum of a, b, c, this might lead to a complicated system. Perhaps this isn't the best way. Maybe instead, let me consider that the sum S = a + b + c, and the products ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k. If I could find abc, then I could form the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. But since we have three variables and three equations, perhaps this could be a path.\n\nWait, but to form the cubic equation, we need S, ab + bc + ca, and abc. So if I can find abc, then yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply all three original equations together?\n\nWait, the original equations are:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} = 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log_2(zx)} = 2^9 \\cdot 3^6 \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log_2(xy)} = 2^5 \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nIf I multiply all three left sides and right sides together:\n\nLeft side: \\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\cdot y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\cdot z^{\\log_2(xy)} \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 2^{8+9+5} \\cdot 3^{4+6+10} = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{20} \\)\n\nHmm, so left side needs to be simplified. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider each exponent:\n\nThe left side is:\n\n\\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\times y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\times z^{\\log_2(xy)} \\)\n\nHmm, maybe take the logarithm of the left side to simplify. Let me take log base 2 again.\n\nLet me denote the product as P = left side. Taking log\u2082:\n\nlog\u2082(P) = log\u2082(x^{\\log_2(yz)}) + log\u2082(y^{\\log_2(zx)}) + log\u2082(z^{\\log_2(xy)})\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nlog\u2082(x) * log\u2082(yz) + log\u2082(y) * log\u2082(zx) + log\u2082(z) * log\u2082(xy)\n\nWait, but this is exactly the sum of the left sides of the three equations we had earlier. Let me see:\n\nFrom earlier steps, we had equations:\n\n1. log\u2082x * log\u2082(yz) = 8 +4k (where k=log\u20823)\n\n2. log\u2082y * log\u2082(zx) =9 +6k\n\n3. log\u2082z * log\u2082(xy) =5 +10k\n\nSo adding all three, we get:\n\nlog\u2082(P) = (8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) =22 +20k, which matches the right side's logarithm since log\u2082(RHS)=22 +20k. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm, but this path might not give new information. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think again about the variables a, b, c. Since S = a + b + c, and we have ab + bc + ca = 11 +10k, perhaps we can consider the variables as components of a system where we can set up equations for S. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I denote:\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me think of equations (1), (2), (3) from the differences:\n\nEquation (1): c(b - a) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): a(b - c) =4 -4k,\n\nEquation (3): b(c - a) = -3 +6k.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve these three equations for a, b, c. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me let me denote equation (1): c(b - a) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): a(b - c)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation (3): b(c -a)= -3 +6k.\n\nLet me see if I can solve these three equations step by step.\n\nLet me try to express variables step by step. Let me first try to express (b - a) from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nb - a = (1 +2k)/c\n\nSimilarly, equation (3): b(c -a)= -3 +6k. Let me express (c -a):\n\nc -a = [ -3 +6k ] / b\n\nHmm, perhaps substitute this into equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): a(b - c) =4 -4k\n\nNote that (b -c) = - (c -b) = - [ (c -a) + (a -b) ] ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express (b - c) in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that:\n\nFrom equation (1) and (3):\n\nWe have expressions involving (b -a) and (c -a). Let me see.\n\nLet me write equations (1), (2), (3) again:\n\n1. c(b - a) = D1, where D1 =1 +2k,\n\n2. a(b - c)= D2, where D2 =4 -4k,\n\n3. b(c - a)= D3, where D3 =-3 +6k.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of each other. Let me see if I can write variables in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me suppose that I can solve equation (1) for b in terms of a and c:\n\nFrom equation (1): b = a + D1/c\n\nSimilarly, equation (3): c -a = D3 / b --> c = a + D3 / b\n\nSubstituting the expression for b from equation (1) into equation (3):\n\nc = a + D3 / (a + D1/c )\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe instead, let me consider all three equations and try to find relations between them.\n\nAlternatively, multiply all three equations together:\n\nEquation1: c(b - a) = D1,\n\nEquation2: a(b - c) = D2,\n\nEquation3: b(c - a) = D3.\n\nMultiply left sides: c(b -a) * a(b -c) * b(c -a)\n\nMultiply right sides: D1*D2*D3\n\nHmm, the left side can be written as:\n\nabc * (b - a)(b - c)(c - a)\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFirst term: c*(b -a),\n\nSecond term: a*(b - c),\n\nThird term: b*(c -a)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\nc * a * b * (b -a)(b -c)(c -a)\n\nWait, actually:\n\nLet me see the terms:\n\nFirst, c times a times b is abc.\n\nThen, the other factors: (b -a)*(b -c)*(c -a)\n\nWait, note that (b -a)(b -c)(c -a) can be written as (b -a)(b -c)(c -a) = (b -a)(c -a)(b -c) = -(b -a)(c -a)(c - b)\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's messy. However, the product is symmetric in a, b, c up to sign.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is equal to (a - b)(b - c)(c - a) times some sign. Not sure, but perhaps this approach is too complex. Let me see the right side:\n\nD1 * D2 * D3 = (1 +2k)(4 -4k)(-3 +6k)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe this isn't the best path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider adding equations (1), (2), (3). Wait, but they are equations involving products and differences. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me assume that a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S, and use substitution.\n\nWait, let me consider that we have:\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. a(b + c) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(a + c)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(a + b)=5 +10k,\n\nand S = a + b + c,\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nand we need to find S.\n\nLet me see if we can write each of the equations in terms of S.\n\nEquation1: a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nSo these are three equations with variables a, b, c, S. Since S = a + b + c, perhaps we can consider each equation as a quadratic in each variable, and then find relationships between them.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each variable satisfies an equation of the form variable*(S - variable) = constant.\n\nLet me consider the first equation: a(S -a) =8 +4k --> -a\u00b2 + Sa - (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nLet me denote the constants:\n\nLet me call C1 =8 +4k,\n\nC2=9 +6k,\n\nC3=5 +10k,\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. a\u00b2 - Sa + C1=0,\n\n2. b\u00b2 - Sb + C2=0,\n\n3. c\u00b2 - Sc + C3=0.\n\nTherefore, each of a, b, c is a root of the quadratic equations:\n\nx\u00b2 - Sx + C1=0,\n\nx\u00b2 - Sx + C2=0,\n\nx\u00b2 - Sx + C3=0,\n\nrespectively.\n\nTherefore, each variable is a root of its own quadratic equation, which shares the same leading coefficient and linear term (Sx), but different constants.\n\nTherefore, for each variable, there are two possible roots. However, since a, b, c are real numbers, each quadratic must have real roots, so discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nFor equation in a: discriminant D_a = S\u00b2 -4*C1 \u22650,\n\nSimilarly, D_b = S\u00b2 -4*C2 \u22650,\n\nD_c = S\u00b2 -4*C3 \u22650.\n\nHmm, so for real solutions, S must satisfy these inequalities. But perhaps more importantly, since a, b, c are each roots of their quadratics, perhaps they can be expressed as:\n\na = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*C1) ] /2,\n\nb = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*C2) ] /2,\n\nc = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*C3) ] /2,\n\nBut the problem is that we have three variables and the sum S is a + b + c. So substituting these expressions into S = a + b + c would lead to an equation in S, but it might be very complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that each variable's quadratic equation can be written as (x - a)(x - a') =0 where a' is the other root. So for the equation for a, the other root is a', such that a + a' = S and a * a' = C1.\n\nSimilarly, for b, the other root is b', with b + b' = S and b * b' = C2,\n\nAnd for c, other root is c', with c + c' = S and c * c' = C3.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the variables a, b, c are part of pairs that add up to S and multiply to the constants. Since there are three variables, perhaps considering the sum S and products:\n\nWait, if we consider all three quadratic equations, then the sum a + b + c = S, but also, for each variable, the other root is S - variable. For example, the other root for a is a' = S - a, so that a + a' = S, and a*a' = C1, so:\n\na*(S -a) = C1,\n\nwhich is the original equation. So this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, each variable has a \"companion\" root a', b', c', such that:\n\na' = S - a,\n\nb' = S - b,\n\nc' = S - c,\n\nand,\n\na * a' = C1,\n\nb * b' = C2,\n\nc * c' = C3.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's some relationship between these companion roots? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since a' = S - a, then the sum of all companion terms would be 3S - (a + b + c) = 3S - S = 2S. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the products:\n\na*b'*c' etc., but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, since a * a' = C1,\n\nand a' = S -a,\n\nSo, a*(S -a) = C1,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut perhaps this is going in circles.\n\nWait, but since we have three quadratics, perhaps the variables a, b, c are the roots of the three different quadratics. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that S must satisfy some condition. Let me think of S as a variable and try to set up an equation for S.\n\nLet me consider that if I can express a, b, c in terms of S, then their sum must be S.\n\nSuppose I take the three quadratic equations:\n\nFor a: a\u00b2 - Sa + C1 =0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nLet me consider that each variable is a root of its equation, so:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nTherefore, the variables a, b, c are each one of the roots of their respective quadratics. Since each quadratic has two roots, perhaps each variable can be either the \"upper\" or \"lower\" root. However, the problem states that x, y, z are positive real numbers, so their logarithms a, b, c must be real numbers, but can be positive or negative? Wait, since x, y, z are positive real numbers, their log base 2 can be any real number, positive or negative, but since exponents in the original equations must be real, but the problem says they are positive real numbers, so that's okay.\n\nHowever, the variables a, b, c must be such that when combined, their sum S must be such that each quadratic has real roots, so S must satisfy S\u00b2 >=4*C1, 4*C2, 4*C3.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the variables a, b, c are each one of the roots (either the \"+\" or \"-\" version) in their respective quadratics. Since their sum is S, maybe we can write:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me suppose that each variable takes the \"+\" root:\n\na = [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nb = [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2)]/2,\n\nc = [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)]/2,\n\nThen their sum would be:\n\na + b + c = [3S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)] / 2 = S,\n\nTherefore,\n\n3S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3) = 2S,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3) = -S,\n\nBut since the square roots are non-negative (since S\u00b2 >=4C1, etc.), the left side is non-negative, but the right side is -S. Since S is the sum of a, b, c which are real numbers, but we don't know their signs. Wait, but since x, y, z are positive, their logarithms can be any real numbers, so a, b, c can be positive or negative. However, if S is the sum, but if each sqrt term is non-negative, then the left side is non-negative, which would require that -S is non-negative, so that S \u22640. But if S is negative, then some of the original variables a, b, c could be negative, but since x, y, z are positive real numbers, their logarithms can be negative or positive.\n\nHowever, maybe this assumption that each variable takes the \"+\" root is leading to a contradiction, so perhaps they take the \"-\" roots instead?\n\nLet me try that:\n\nSuppose each variable takes the \"-\" root:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1)]/2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2)]/2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)]/2,\n\nThen,\n\na + b + c = [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3))]/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\n3S - [sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3)] = 2S,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3) = S,\n\nThis is a possible equation. Since the left side is non-negative, S must be non-negative. That's better.\n\nTherefore, if we suppose that each variable takes the \"-\" root, then we can have the equation above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps different variables take different roots. For example, a takes \"-\", b takes \"+\", c takes \"-\" etc. But this complicates things. Maybe the simplest assumption is that all take the \"-\" roots. Since that gives a plausible equation.\n\nTherefore, perhaps proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the equation to solve for S is:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4C1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4C3) = S,\n\nWhere C1 =8 +4k, C2=9 +6k, C3=5 +10k, and k=log\u20823.\n\nHmm, this seems quite complicated, but perhaps we can plug in k=log\u20823 and see if we can find S numerically? However, since the problem is expecting an exact answer, perhaps there is a clever substitution or the system can be solved symbolically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me recall that we have:\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nand S = a + b + c,\n\nand we need to find S.\n\nIf I can find another relation involving S and ab + bc + ca, perhaps I can solve for S.\n\nWait, perhaps using the three original quadratic equations. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 - Sa + C1=0,\n\nSimilarly, equation2: b\u00b2 - Sb + C2=0,\n\nEquation3: c\u00b2 - Sc + C3=0.\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - S(a + b + c) + (C1 + C2 + C3) =0,\n\nBut a + b + c = S,\n\nSo,\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - S\u00b2 + (C1 + C2 + C3) =0,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (C1 + C2 + C3),\n\nBut we can also compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of S and ab + bc + ca:\n\nWe know that:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S\u00b2 - 2*(11 +10k),\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 -2*(11 +10k) = S\u00b2 - (C1 + C2 + C3),\n\nThus,\n\n-2*(11 +10k) = - (C1 + C2 + C3),\n\nThus,\n\nC1 + C2 + C3 = 2*(11 +10k).\n\nLet me check if this is true:\n\nC1 + C2 + C3 = (8 +4k)+(9 +6k)+(5 +10k)=22 +20k,\n\nand 2*(11 +10k)=22 +20k,\n\nYes, so the equality holds. So that's consistent but doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this path is not helpful.\n\nLet me think again of the differences equations:\n\nEquation (1): c(b - a) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): a(b - c)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation (3): b(c - a)= -3 +6k.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation (1): c(b - a) =1 +2k,\n\nSo, c = (1 +2k)/(b -a),\n\nBut this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps express (b -a), (c -a), etc., in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that variables a, b, c can be expressed as linear combinations. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations can be represented in matrix form, but with multiplicative terms. Hmm, perhaps not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to assign numerical values. Since k = log\u20823 is a constant, perhaps I can treat it as a variable and see if the equations can be solved symbolically.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to solve the equations step by step.\n\nLet me consider equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation1: c(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nEquation2: a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation3: b(c -a)= -3 +6k.\n\nLet me try to express variables step by step.\n\nLet me first solve equation1 for c:\n\nc = (1 +2k)/(b -a),\n\nThen plug this into equation2 and equation3.\n\nStarting with equation2:\n\na(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nSubstitute c from equation1:\n\na[ b - (1 +2k)/(b -a) ] =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me write it as:\n\na [ (b(b -a) - (1 +2k) ) / (b -a) ) ] =4 -4k,\n\nThus,\n\na [ (b\u00b2 -ab -1 -2k) ) / (b -a) ) ] =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation1: c(b -a)=D1,\n\nEquation2: a(b -c)=D2,\n\nEquation3: b(c -a)=D3,\n\nWhere D1=1+2k,\n\nD2=4-4k,\n\nD3=-3+6k.\n\nLet me multiply all three equations together:\n\nLeft side: c(b -a) * a(b -c) * b(c -a) = a b c (b -a)(b -c)(c -a),\n\nRight side: D1 D2 D3,\n\nThus,\n\na b c (b -a)(b -c)(c -a) = D1 D2 D3,\n\nHmm, but this equation may not be helpful unless we can find a b c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product (b -a)(b -c)(c -a) can be expressed in terms of S, ab + bc + ca, and abc. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetric sums.\n\nLet me think of variables a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me suppose that a, b, c are roots of:\n\nx\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + (ab + bc + ca)x - abc =0,\n\nwhere S = a + b + c,\n\nab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nand let me denote P = abc.\n\nSo the cubic equation is:\n\nx\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + (11 +10k)x - P =0.\n\nHmm, but without knowing P, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the equations to express P?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from the three original quadratic equations:\n\nEquation1: a\u00b2 - Sa + C1=0,\n\nEquation2: b\u00b2 - Sb + C2=0,\n\nEquation3: c\u00b2 - Sc + C3=0,\n\nMultiply all three equations:\n\n(a\u00b2 - Sa + C1)(b\u00b2 - Sb + C2)(c\u00b2 - Sc + C3)=0,\n\nBut this seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each variable satisfies its quadratic equation, so:\n\na\u00b3 = S a\u00b2 - C1 a,\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b3 = S b\u00b2 - C2 b,\n\nc\u00b3 = S c\u00b2 - C3 c,\n\nBut again, unless we can relate higher powers, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider adding equations after multiplying each by a, b, c respectively.\n\nWait, like this:\n\nTake equation1 multiplied by a:\n\na\u00b3 - S a\u00b2 + C1 a =0,\n\nSimilarly equation2 * b:\n\nb\u00b3 - S b\u00b2 + C2 b =0,\n\nEquation3 * c:\n\nc\u00b3 - S c\u00b2 + C3 c =0,\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\n(a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) - S(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c)=0,\n\nHmm, but I don't know if this helps. Let me see.\n\nWe can express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S, ab + bc + ca, and abc. Recall that:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc,\n\n= S\u00b3 - 3 S (ab + bc + ca) + 3P,\n\nAlso, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n[ S\u00b3 - 3 S (ab + bc + ca) + 3P ] - S [ S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) ] + (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c) =0,\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: S\u00b3 -3S*(ab + bc + ca) +3P,\n\nSecond term: -S*(S\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) = -S\u00b3 + 2S(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThird term: (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c).\n\nAdding all together:\n\n[ S\u00b3 -3S(ab + bc + ca) +3P -S\u00b3 +2S(ab + bc + ca) ] + (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c) =0,\n\nSimplify the first bracket:\n\n(S\u00b3 - S\u00b3) + (-3S(ab...) +2S(ab...)) +3P = (-S(ab + bc + ca) ) +3P,\n\nThus,\n\n- S(ab + bc + ca) +3P + (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c) =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\n3P = S(ab + bc + ca) - (C1 a + C2 b + C3 c),\n\nHmm, so if I can compute C1 a + C2 b + C3 c, then I can find P.\n\nLet me see if I can find C1 a + C2 b + C3 c.\n\nNote that C1 =8 +4k, C2=9 +6k, C3=5 +10k,\n\nTherefore,\n\nC1 a + C2 b + C3 c = (8 +4k)a + (9 +6k)b + (5 +10k)c.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can split this into terms without k and terms with k:\n\n= [8a +9b +5c] +k [4a +6b +10c].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can compute these two parts separately.\n\nLet me compute the first part: 8a +9b +5c,\n\nand the second part:4a +6b +10c,\n\nMaybe these can be expressed in terms of S and other known quantities.\n\nWait, since S = a + b + c,\n\nLet me see if I can express 8a +9b +5c as 8a +8b +8c + (b -3c),\n\nWait, 8a +9b +5c =8(a +b +c) + (b -3c),\n\nSimilarly, that's 8S + (b -3c).\n\nHmm, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of the equations.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\nEquation1: a(b + c)=8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(a + c)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(a + b)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me note that:\n\na(b +c)= a(S -a)=8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly, b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nSo:\n\n8a +9b +5c = a*8 + b*9 + c*5,\n\nHmm, perhaps express as 8a +9b +5c = ?\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\nLet me think of coefficients:\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me denote the coefficients:\n\nLet me consider that 8a +9b +5c = 8a +9b +5c,\n\nIf I can write this in terms of the equations:\n\nFor example, from equation1, a(b +c)=8 +4k,\n\nMultiply both sides by a: a\u00b2(b +c)=a*(8 +4k),\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this path is too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let me think back to the differences equations.\n\nEquations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation1: c(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nEquation2: a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation3: b(c -a)= -3 +6k,\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of a.\n\nLet me suppose that I can express b and c in terms of a.\n\nFrom equation1: c(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nEquation2: a(b -c)=4 -4k.\n\nLet me solve these two equations for b and c.\n\nLet me denote equation1 as:\n\nc(b - a) = D1,\n\nequation2 as:\n\na(b - c) = D2,\n\nWe can write this as a system of two equations with variables b and c.\n\nLet me rewrite the two equations:\n\nEquation1: c b - a c = D1,\n\nEquation2: a b - a c = D2,\n\nSubtract equation2 from equation1:\n\nc b - a c - (a b - a c) = D1 - D2,\n\nSimplify:\n\nc b -a c -a b + a c = c b -a b = b(c -a) = D1 - D2,\n\nThus,\n\nb(c -a) = D1 - D2 = (1 +2k) - (4 -4k) = -3 +6k,\n\nWait, but this is exactly equation3! So this is consistent, which is good, but doesn't help us solve it.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nLet me try to assume that k is a constant and treat it as such. Since k = log\u20823, which is approximately 1.58496, but since we need an exact answer, perhaps we can keep it as k.\n\nLet me try to assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let me set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let me denote equation1: c(b -a)=D1,\n\nequation2: a(b -c)=D2,\n\nequation3: b(c -a)=D3,\n\nWe can write this as a system of linear equations if we consider variables as (b -a), (c -a), etc. but they are multiplied by other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables u = a + b + c = S,\n\nv = ab + bc + ca =11 +10k,\n\nw = abc (unknown).\n\nWe need to find S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the three equations:\n\nLet me consider that from the original three equations:\n\n1. a(b + c) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(a + c)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(a + b)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me add these three equations as before to get 2(ab + bc + ca)=22 +20k, which gives ab + bc + ca=11+10k.\n\nNow, let me consider each equation divided by the variable:\n\nEquation1 divided by a:\n\n(b +c)= (8 +4k)/a,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2 divided by b:\n\n(a +c)= (9 +6k)/b,\n\nEquation3 divided by c:\n\n(a +b)= (5 +10k)/c,\n\nNow, adding these three equations:\n\n(b +c) + (a +c) + (a +b) = (8 +4k)/a + (9 +6k)/b + (5 +10k)/c,\n\nLeft side: 2(a + b +c) =2S,\n\nRight side: sum of those fractions.\n\nSo,\n\n2S = (8 +4k)/a + (9 +6k)/b + (5 +10k)/c,\n\nHmm, so if I can express these fractions in terms of S or other known terms, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote that:\n\nLet me note that:\n\nFrom equation1: (b +c) = (8 +4k)/a,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation2: (a + c) = (9 +6k)/b,\n\nFrom equation3: (a + b)= (5 +10k)/c,\n\nTherefore, we can solve for each pair:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me express (b +c) from equation1,\n\nand (a +c) from equation2,\n\nSubtracting these two equations:\n\n(b +c) - (a +c) = (8 +4k)/a - (9 +6k)/b,\n\nWhich gives:\n\nb -a = (8 +4k)/a - (9 +6k)/b,\n\nHmm, but this is similar to previous equations. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set up variables x = a, y = b, z = c for clarity.\n\nWait, the variables are already a,b,c. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider solving for one variable first. Let me try to solve for a from equation1 and plug into equation2.\n\nFrom equation1: c(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nLet me solve for c:\n\nc = (1 +2k)/(b -a),\n\nThen plug into equation2:\n\na(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nSubstituting c:\n\na [ b - (1 +2k)/(b -a) ] =4 -4k,\n\nLet me denote t = b -a,\n\nThen, b =a + t,\n\nThus, substituting,\n\na [ (a + t) - (1 +2k)/t ] =4 -4k,\n\nExpand:\n\na(a + t) - a*(1 +2k)/t =4 -4k,\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved. Maybe it's better to assign numerical values to k?\n\nWait, since k = log\u20823 is a constant, perhaps we can treat it as a variable and see if the equations can be solved symbolically.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem requires the minimal xyz =2^{a +b +c}, so perhaps the minimal S corresponds to the solution of the equations, and since there might be only one solution, we can proceed to solve the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe suppose that the equations are designed so that a, b, c are integers or multiples of k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of log\u20823.\n\nWait, let me think of the original equations in terms of exponents.\n\nThe original equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2^8 *3^4,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2^8 *3^4),\n\nWhich gives log\u2082x * log\u2082(yz) =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let m = log\u2082x,\n\nn = log\u2082y,\n\np = log\u2082z,\n\nThen the equations become:\n\nm(n + p)=8 +4k,\n\nn(m + p)=9 +6k,\n\np(m + n)=5 +10k,\n\nWhich is exactly the same as before with a=m, b=n, c=p.\n\nHmm, so same system. Thus, perhaps I need to consider that variables m,n,p are the variables to solve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that m, n, p are linear combinations of 1 and k.\n\nLet me suppose that m = \u03b1 + \u03b2k,\n\nn = \u03b3 + \u03b4k,\n\np = \u03b5 + \u03b6k,\n\nWhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6 are constants to be determined.\n\nSince k is log\u20823, which is irrational, the coefficients of 1 and k must be separate.\n\nTherefore, in the equations:\n\nm(n + p)=8 +4k,\n\nThe left side can be expressed as:\n\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2k)( (\u03b3 + \u03b4k) + (\u03b5 + \u03b6k) ) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2k)( (\u03b3 + \u03b5) + (\u03b4 + \u03b6)k )\n\nMultiply this out:\n\n= \u03b1(\u03b3 + \u03b5) + \u03b1(\u03b4 + \u03b6)k + \u03b2k(\u03b3 + \u03b5) + \u03b2k*(\u03b4 + \u03b6)k,\n\n= \u03b1(\u03b3 + \u03b5) + [ \u03b1(\u03b4 + \u03b6) + \u03b2(\u03b3 + \u03b5) ]k + \u03b2(\u03b4 + \u03b6)k\u00b2,\n\nBut since k = log\u20823, k\u00b2 is also a constant, but in the right-hand side of the equation, there is no k\u00b2 term. Therefore, the coefficients of k\u00b2 must be zero, and similarly for other terms.\n\nTherefore, equating coefficients:\n\nFor the constant term (without k or k\u00b2):\n\n\u03b1(\u03b3 + \u03b5) + \u03b2(\u03b4 + \u03b6)k\u00b2 =8,\n\nWait, but this approach might not be feasible because of the cross terms involving k\u00b2. The original equations have only constants and terms with k, not k squared. Therefore, perhaps this assumption is invalid unless the coefficient of k\u00b2 is zero.\n\nTherefore, to have the k\u00b2 terms vanish, we must have \u03b2(\u03b4 + \u03b6)=0,\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of k:\n\n\u03b1(\u03b4 + \u03b6) + \u03b2(\u03b3 + \u03b5) + ... Hmm, this seems getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this indicates that such an assumption may not work, unless \u03b2(\u03b4 + \u03b6)=0, but this requires more constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables m, n, p are proportional to 1 and k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables in terms of 1 and log\u20823.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think numerically.\n\nLet me try to suppose that k = log\u20823 \u22481.58496,\n\nThen let me assign numerical values to the equations and attempt to solve numerically. Although the problem probably expects an exact answer, perhaps this can lead to insight.\n\nLet me denote k \u22481.58496,\n\nThen:\n\nC1=8 +4k\u22488 +6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\nC2=9 +6k\u22489+9.5098\u224818.5098,\n\nC3=5 +10k\u22485+15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nSo the three quadratics are:\n\nFor a: a\u00b2 - Sa +14.3398=0,\n\nFor b: b\u00b2 - Sb +18.5098=0,\n\nFor c: c\u00b2 - S c +20.8496=0,\n\nAnd we also know that ab + bc + ca =11 +10k\u224811 +15.8496\u224826.8496,\n\nAnd S =a +b +c.\n\nHmm, perhaps assume that S is the sum of a, b, c, which must satisfy the quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find S numerically.\n\nLet me suppose that S is a value where the quadratics have real roots. For each quadratic equation, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\nFor a: S\u00b2 -4*14.3398 \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 \u226557.359 \u2192 S \u22657.574,\n\nFor b: S\u00b2 -4*18.5098 \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 \u226574.039 \u2192 S \u22658.604,\n\nFor c: S\u00b2 -4*20.8496 \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 \u226583.398 \u2192 S \u22659.132.\n\nTherefore, S must be at least 9.132.\n\nLet me assume S is around 10, and see what happens.\n\nSuppose S=10,\n\nThen for a's quadratic: a\u00b2 -10a +14.3398=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 100 -57.359\u224842.641,\n\nSolutions: [10 \u00b16.53]/2 \u2192 (16.53/2\u22488.265 or 3.4695),\n\nSimilarly, for b's quadratic: b\u00b2 -10b +18.5098=0,\n\nDiscriminant:100 -74.039\u224825.961,\n\nSolutions: [10 \u00b15.095]/2 \u2192 7.547 or 2.4525,\n\nFor c's quadratic: c\u00b2 -10c +20.8496=0,\n\nDiscriminant:100 -83.398\u224816.602,\n\nSolutions: [10 \u00b14.075]/2 \u21927.0375 or 2.9625.\n\nNow, need to choose roots such that a + b + c=10.\n\nSuppose we take the smaller roots for each:\n\na=3.4695, b=2.4525, c=2.9625,\n\nSum \u22483.4695+2.4525+2.9625\u22488.8845 <10, not good.\n\nTake larger roots:\n\na=8.265, b=7.547, c=7.0375,\n\nSum\u22488.265+7.547+7.0375\u224822.849>10.\n\nNot equal to 10.\n\nHmm, so need to choose a combination.\n\nSuppose take a=8.265 (larger), b=2.4525 (smaller), c=2.9625 (smaller):\n\nSum\u22488.265+2.4525+2.9625\u224813.68,\n\nStill not 10.\n\nAlternatively, take a=8.265, b=7.547 (larger), c=2.9625:\n\nSum\u224818.774,\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, two larger and one smaller:\n\na=8.265, b=7.547, c=2.9625,\n\nSum too big.\n\nHmm, so perhaps S=10 is too low.\n\nLet me try S=12,\n\nFor a's quadratic: discriminant 144 -57.359\u224886.641,\n\nRoots: (12 \u00b19.308)/2 \u2192 10.654 or 1.346,\n\nFor b's quadratic: discriminant 144 -74.039\u224870,\n\nRoots: (12\u00b18.3666)/2 \u2192 10.183 or 1.8167,\n\nFor c's quadratic: discriminant 144 -83.398\u224860.602,\n\nRoots: (12 \u00b17.785)/2 \u21929.8925 or 2.1075.\n\nNow, trying to find a combination adding to S=12.\n\nSuppose a=1.346, b=1.8167, c=2.1075,\n\nSum\u22485.27 <12,\n\nToo small.\n\nTake all large roots:\n\na=10.654, b=10.183, c=9.8925,\n\nSum\u224830.73>12,\n\nNope.\n\nTake two large and one small:\n\na=10.654, b=10.183, c=2.1075,\n\nSum\u224822.945,\n\nStill too big.\n\nHmm, this trial and error might not be the best approach.

Wait:\n\nWait, the third term has \"-ba\".\n\nSo terms with b:\n\ncb + bc - ba = b(c + c -a) = Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the left side simplifies to 0?\n\nWait, let me substitute variables:\n\nLet me let me suppose variables a, b, c are real numbers,\n\nLeft side:\n\nc(b -a) + a(b -c) + b(c -a)\n\nExpand:\n\ncb - ca + ab -ac + bc - ba,\n\nNow, group terms:\n\ncb + bc = 2bc,\n\n-ab + ba = 0,\n\n-ca -ac = -2ac,\n\nWait, but there's also the ab term:\n\nWait, the terms are:\n\ncb - ca (from first term),\n\n+ab -ac (from second term),\n\n+ bc - ba (from third term),\n\nSo:\n\ncb + ab + bc - ca - ac - ba,\n\nNow, ab - ba = 0,\n\nbc + cb = 2bc,\n\n- ca - ac = -2ac,\n\nThus, total is 2bc - 2ac = 2c(b -a),\n\nWhich is equal to 2c*(b -a).\n\nHmm, so the left side is 2c(b -a),\n\nThe right side is (1 +2k)+(4 -4k)+(-3 +6k) = (1+4-3) + (2k -4k +6k) = 2 +4k,\n\nThus,\n\n2c(b -a) =2 +4k,\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nc(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nWait, but that's exactly equation (1)! So this just confirms the consistency but doesn't help solve.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the system is symmetric in a way and set variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation (1): c(b -a)=1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2): a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation (3): b(c -a)= -3 +6k,\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of a single variable, say a.\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for c:\n\nc = (1 +2k)/(b -a),\n\nEquation (2): a(b -c)=4 -4k,\n\nSubstitute c from equation (1):\n\na[ b - (1 +2k)/(b -a) ] =4 -4k,\n\nLet me denote t = b -a,\n\nThen, b =a +t,\n\nSubstituting into the above equation:\n\na[ (a + t) - (1 +2k)/t ] =4 -4k,\n\nSo,\n\na(a +t) - a*(1 +2k)/t =4 -4k,\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\na(a +t) - (4 -4k) = a*(1 +2k)/t,\n\nHmm, not sure,\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides by t:\n\na(a +t)*t - a(1 +2k) = (4 -4k)*t,\n\nHmm, this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider ratios.\n\nSuppose I divide equation (1) by equation (2):\n\n[c(b -a)]/[a(b -c)] = (1 +2k)/(4 -4k),\n\nBut c(b -a)/[a(b -c)] = ?\n\nLet me write it as (c/a)*( (b -a)/(b -c) ) = (1 +2k)/(4 -4k),\n\nHmm, perhaps introduce ratios like r = b/a, s =c/a, then express in terms of r and s.\n\nLet me try this substitution.\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet r = b/a,\n\ns = c/a,\n\nThen, b = r a,\n\nc = s a,\n\nThen, substituting into equation (1):\n\nc(b -a) = s a (r a -a) = s a^2 (r -1) =1 +2k,\n\nEquation (2):\n\na(b -c)= a(r a - s a)= a^2 (r -s)=4 -4k,\n\nEquation (3):\n\nb(c -a)= r a (s a -a)= r a^2 (s -1)= -3 +6k,\n\nSo now, we have three equations in variables r, s, and a.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n1. s a\u00b2 (r -1) =1 +2k,\n\n2. a\u00b2 (r - s)=4 -4k,\n\n3. r a\u00b2 (s -1)= -3 +6k,\n\nLet me denote Q =a\u00b2,\n\nThen equations become:\n\n1. s Q (r -1)=1 +2k,\n\n2.

So s=1.\n\nTherefore, s=1,\n\nSo c = s a =a,\n\nBut s=1 implies c=a,\n\nWait, so c =a,\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nSo from s =1,\n\nTherefore, from substitution above, s=1,\n\nNow, let's proceed with s=1.\n\nNow, since s=1,\n\nFrom equation2 (original variables):\n\nQ = (4 -4k)/(r - s) = (4-4k)/(r -1),\n\nBut s=1,\n\nAlso, since s= c/a =1, so c =a,\n\nTherefore, c =a,\n\nNow, let's see other equations.\n\nFrom equation1:\n\ns(r -1)/D =A,\n\nWith s=1 and D =r - s = r -1,\n\nThus,\n\n1*(r -1)/(r -1) =1 = A,\n\nThus, A must equal 1.\n\nBut A is defined as (1 +2k)/(4 -4k)=A,\n\nSo set (1 +2k)/(4 -4k)=1,\n\nThus,\n\n1 +2k =4 -4k,\n\nThus,\n\n6k=3,\n\nk=0.5,\n\nBut k = log\u20823 \u22481.58496,\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that s=1 leads to a contradiction unless k=0.5, which it is not. Therefore, our assumption might be wrong, or perhaps there was an error.\n\nWait, but we arrived at s=1 by algebra, so unless there is a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again.\n\nWe had the equation after cross-multiplying:\n\n(A -1)(s - (B +1)) = B(s - A),\n\nExpanded to:\n\n(A -1)s - (A -1)(B +1) = Bs - BA,\n\nThen moving all to left:\n\n(A -1)s - (A -1)(B +1) - Bs + BA=0,\n\nThen grouping:\n\n[ (A-1) -B ]s + [ - (A-1)(B+1) + BA ] =0,\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen computed constants:\n\nCoefficient of s: (A -1 - B),\n\nConstant term:\n\n- (A -1)(B+1) + BA,\n\nExpanding:\n\n- A(B+1) + (B+1) + BA,\n\n= -AB -A + B +1 + BA,\n\n= (-AB + AB) + (-A + B +1),\n\nSo yes, constant term is (-A + B +1),\n\nThus,\n\n(A -1 - B)s + (-A + B +1) =0,\n\nThus,\n\ns = [A - B -1]/[A - B -1] which is 1,\n\nWait, numerator is (A - B -1),\n\nDenominator is (A -1 - B) = (A - B -1),\n\nThus numerator/denominator =1,\n\nThus s=1,\n\nSo that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, unless there is an error in substitution, then s must be 1,\n\nBut this leads to inconsistency with k,\n\nHence, perhaps there is a mistake in assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during substitution, I missed a negative sign.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe had:\n\nEquation1: [s(r -1)]/D =A,\n\nEquation3: [r(s -1)]/D =B,\n\nThen,\n\nr = [ -s(A -1) ] / (s -A ),\n\nWait, let me recheck this step:\n\nFrom equation1,\n\ns(r -1) =A D,\n\nBut D =r -s,\n\nTherefore,\n\ns(r-1)=A(r -s),\n\nThus,\n\ns(r -1) =A r -A s,\n\nBring all to left:\n\ns(r-1) -A r +A s =0,\n\nFactor,\n\nr(s -A) + s( -1 +A ) =0,\n\nThus,\n\nr(s -A) = -s(A -1),\n\nThus,\n\nr = [ -s(A -1) ] / (s -A )\n\nYes, which is same as [ s(A -1) ] / (A - s )\n\nSimilarly, in equation3:\n\nr(s -1)= B D,\n\nWhich is B (r -s),\n\nThus,\n\nr(s -1) =B(r -s),\n\nBring all to left:\n\nr(s-1) -B r + B s =0,\n\nFactor,\n\nr(s-1 -B) + B s =0,\n\nThus,\n\nr = - B s/(s -1 - B),\n\nWait, perhaps I did this step wrong earlier.\n\nWait:\n\nr(s -1 - B) = - B s,\n\nThus,\n\nr = [ - B s ] / (s -1 - B )\n\nWait, in previous steps I had:\n\nEquation3:\n\nr(s - (B +1)) = - B s,\n\nThus,\n\nr = [ - B s ] / (s - B -1),\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the equations for r are:\n\nr = [ s(A -1) ]/(A - s),\n\nand\n\nr = [ -B s ]/(s - B -1),\n\nSetting them equal,\n\n[ s(A -1) ]/(A - s) = [ -B s ]/(s - B -1),\n\nCancel s,\n\n(A -1)/(A - s) = -B/(s - B -1),\n\nMultiply both sides by (A - s)(s - B -1),\n\n(A -1)(s - B -1) = -B(A - s),\n\nExpand left side:\n\n(A -1)s - (A -1)(B +1),\n\nRight side:\n\n-BA + Bs,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(A -1)s - (A -1)(B +1) + BA - Bs =0,\n\nFactor terms:\n\ns terms: [ (A -1) - B ] s,\n\nConstants: - (A -1)(B +1) + BA,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (A -1 - B) ] s + [ - (A -1)(B+1) + BA ] =0,\n\nSame as before,\n\nTherefore, s=1,\n\nHence, this is consistent.\n\nThus, the only solution under these substitutions is s=1,\n\nBut that leads to a contradiction unless k=0.5,\n\nTherefore, this suggests that there is no solution under the assumption that s\u22600,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s=0?\n\nIf s=0,\n\nThen c=0,\n\nBut c=log\u2082z,\n\nSo z=2^0=1,\n\nBut then,\n\nFrom equation1: c(b -a)=0*(b -a)=0=1+2k,\n\nWhich would require 1+2k=0,\n\nBut k=log\u20823>0,\n\nThus impossible.\n\nThus, the only solution is s=1,\n\nBut that requires k=0.5,\n\nWhich is false,\n\nTherefore, this suggests that our assumption of expressing variables in terms of ratios might be invalid,\n\nOr there is no solution unless k=0.5,\n\nBut the problem states that variables are positive reals,\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the system might have no solution unless my approach is wrong.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in defining variables.\n\nWait, let me recall that A=(1 +2k)/(4 -4k),\n\nB=(-3 +6k)/(4 -4k),\n\nLet me compute A and B with k=log\u20823,\n\nLet me compute numerically with k\u22481.58496,\n\nThen,\n\nA=(1+2*1.58496)/(4 -4*1.58496)= (1 +3.16992)/(4 -6.3398)=4.16992/(-2.3398)=\u2248-1.781,\n\nSimilarly B=(-3 +6*1.58496)/(4 -6.3398)= (-3 +9.50976)/-2.3398\u22486.50976/-2.3398\u2248-2.781.\n\nThen,\n\nEquation: s = [A - B -1]/[A - B -1] =1,\n\nThus still s=1,\n\nBut then,\n\nWith s=1,\n\nThen Q=(4-4k)/(r -1),\n\nBut since s=1,\n\nAlso, from equation1:\n\nWith s=1,\n\nEquation1:\n\n1*(r-1)/D = A,\n\nBut D=r -1,\n\nThus,\n\n(r-1)/(r-1)=1 =A,\n\nBut A\u2248-1.781,\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the system has no solution?\n\nBut the problem states that x,y,z are positive reals,\n\nTherefore, there must be a solution.\n\nPerhaps my approach with substituting variables is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when I set s=1, even though it leads to a contradiction in the constants, there might be a solution at the limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in assuming that all three equations can be satisfied simultaneously.

Maybe another approach.\n\nSuppose that a=0,\n\nThen from equation1a:0=8 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus a \u22600,\n\nSimilarly, c\u22600,\n\nElse equation2a:0=9 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nSimilarly, e\u22600,\n\nElse equation3a:0=5 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus, variables a,c,e are non-zero,\n\nNow, let's consider equation1b: a(d +f)=0,\n\nSince a\u22600 \u21d2 d +f=0,\n\nThus, f= -d,\n\nSimilarly, equation4b: b(d +f)=b*0=0 \u21d2 holds,\n\nThus, d +f=0,\n\nNow, set f= -d,\n\nNow, equation2b: c(f +b)= c*( -d +b )=0,\n\nThus,\n\nEither c=0 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nOr -d +b=0 \u21d2 b=d,\n\nThus, b=d,\n\nNow, equation5b: d(f +b)=d*( -d +d )=d*0=0 \u21d2 holds,\n\nEquation6b: f(b +d)= (-d)(d +d)= (-d)(2d)= -2d\u00b2,\n\nWait, equation6b requires this to be zero,\n\nThus,\n\n-2d\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 d=0,\n\nBut then d=0 \u21d2 f=0,\n\nand b=d=0,\n\nBut then equation4a: b(c +e)=0=4 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus, this path also fails.\n\nHmm, so the only way left is that equation2b requires c(f +b)=0,\n\nIf instead, c=0,\n\nBut that would make equation2a: c(e +a)=0=9 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus, the only possibility is f +b=0 \u21d2 f= -b,\n\nBut then from equation2b: f +b=0,\n\nThus f= -b,\n\nNow, let me see:\n\nf= -b,\n\nFrom equation6b: f(b +d)= (-b)(b +d)=0,\n\nThus,\n\nEither -b=0 \u21d2 b=0 \u21d2 equation4a:0=4 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nOr b +d=0 \u21d2 d= -b,\n\nThus, d= -b,\n\nNow, with f= -b and d= -b,\n\nNow, variables:\n\nd= -b,\n\nf= -b,\n\nNow, equation1b: a(d +f)=a*(-b -b)=a*(-2b)=0,\n\nSince a\u22600 \u21d2 -2b=0 \u21d2 b=0,\n\nBut then equation4a: b*(c +e)=0=4 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus, this also fails.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the only possible way is that all terms involving k must be zero, but this leads to contradictions, so perhaps the initial assumption that the equations must have coefficients of k set to zero is incorrect?\n\nWait, but the exponents must be integers because the RHS are integers, so the terms with k must cancel out. Because otherwise, you'd have an irrational number in the exponent, making the left side not an integer power of 2 or 3.\n\nTherefore, the only way this can happen is if the coefficients multiplying k are zero, and the remaining terms give the integer exponents.\n\nHowever, all paths lead to contradictions, which suggests that my approach might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are not integers, but since the problem is asking for the minimal xyz, maybe the minimal S is obtained when the variables a,b,c are chosen such that they are the minimal possible under the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a solution where variables are fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimal xyz occurs when variables are chosen such that all three equations are satisfied with the minimal S.\n\nWait, another idea: since the problem asks for the minimal value of xyz, and since xyz =2^{a +b +c}, the minimal value occurs when a +b +c is as small as possible.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\na(b +c)=8+4k,\n\nb(a +c)=9+6k,\n\nc(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nand ab + bc + ca=11+10k,\n\nLet me consider that the minimal S=a +b +c occurs when variables a,b,c are as small as possible.\n\nLet me try to solve the system numerically with k=log\u20823\u22481.58496.\n\nLet me denote k\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\nC1=8 +4k\u224814.3398,\n\nC2=9+6k\u224818.5098,\n\nC3=5+10k\u224820.8496.\n\nThe three quadratics are:\n\na\u00b2 -

approximations are off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is approximately 9.18,\n\nBut the problem requires an exact answer.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the system has an exact solution when variables are chosen such that terms with k cancel out exactly, leading to an exact S.\n\nPerhaps the minimal xyz is achieved when the variables are set such that the terms with k are zero.\n\nLet me revisit the earlier assumption where coefficients of k are zero.\n\nIf we set equations such that terms involving k are zero,\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom equation1: a(d +f)k =0,\n\nSince a\u22600 and k\u22600,\n\nthen d +f=0,\n\nSimilarly equation2: c(f +b)k=0 \u21d2 f +b=0,\n\nThus,\n\nd +f=0,\n\nf +b=0 \u21d2 d=b,\n\nAnd from equation3: e(b +d)=0,\n\nIf d =b,\n\nthen b +d=2b,\n\nThus equation3 requires e*(2b)=0 \u21d2 e=0 or b=0,\n\nBut e\u22600,\n\nThus b=0,\n\nBut then equation4: b(c +e)=0=4 \u21d2 contradiction,\n\nThus, this path is invalid.\n\nHowever, maybe the terms with k do not have to be zero, but instead their combination results in the required exponents.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a competition, likely there's an elegant solution.\n\nLet me consider taking the product of all three original equations:\n\nxyz)^{\\log\u2082(yz) + log\u2082(zx) + log\u2082(xy)} = (2^8 3^4)(2^9 3^6)(2^5 3^{10})=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nThe exponent is log\u2082(yz) + log\u2082(zx) + log\u2082(xy)=log\u2082(yz*zx*xy)=log\u2082(x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)=2 log\u2082(xyz),\n\nThus,\n\n(xyz)^{2 log\u2082(xyz)} =2^{22}3^{20},\n\nLet me denote T= log\u2082(xyz),\n\nThen,\n\n(xyz)^{2T}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nBut T=log\u2082(xyz),\n\nThus,\n\n(2^T)^{2T}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nThus,\n\n2^{2T\u00b2}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nBut the right-hand side has a 3^{20} term, which cannot be expressed as a power of 2,\n\nThus,\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exponentiation is not straightforward.\n\nWait, the left side is:\n\n[x]^{\\log\u2082(yz)} * [y]^{\\log\u2082(zx)} * [z]^{\\log\u2082(xy)} = product,\n\nBut I previously considered taking the product and taking log\u2082, but this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the following substitution:\n\nLet me set A = log\u2082x,\n\nB = log\u2082y,\n\nC = log\u2082z,\n\nThus,\n\nThe equations are:\n\nA(B + C) =8 +4k,\n\nB(A + C)=9 +6k,\n\nC(A + B)=5 +10k,\n\nand we need to find A + B + C,\n\nwith k=log\u20823,\n\nLet me consider adding the three equations:\n\nA(B + C) + B(A + C) + C(A + B)=2(AB + BC + CA)=22 +20k,\n\nThus,\n\nAB + BC + CA=11 +10k,\n\nLet me denote S =A+B+C,\n\nLet me also denote:\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nLet me compute (A + B + C)^2 =A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 +2(AB + BC + CA),\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =S\u00b2 -2*(11 +10k),\n\nNow, consider the three original equations:\n\n1. A(B + C)=A(S - A)=8+4k,\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 -AS +8+4k=0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB\u00b2 -BS +9+6k=0,\n\nC\u00b2 -CS +5+10k=0,\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 =AS -8 -4k,\n\nB\u00b2=BS -9 -6k,\n\nC\u00b2=CS -5 -10k,\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =S(A + B +C) - (8+4k +9+6k +5+10k)=S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nWhich matches the previous expression,\n\nNow, let me compute:\n\n(A - B)^2 + (B - C)^2 + (C - A)^2,\n\n=2(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 -AB - BC - CA),\n\n=2[ (S\u00b2 -2*(11+10k)) - (11+10k) ]\n\n=2(S\u00b2 -3*(11+10k)),\n\n=2S\u00b2 -6*(11+10k),\n\nThis is non-negative,\n\nThus,\n\n2S\u00b2 -6*(11+10k) \u22650,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 \u2265 3*(11+10k)=33+30k,\n\nThus,\n\nS \u2265 sqrt(33+30k),\n\nWith k=log\u20823,\n\nCompute 30k=30*1.58496\u224847.55,\n\nThus 33+47.55\u224880.55,\n\nThus,\n\nS \u2265sqrt(80.55)\u22488.98,\n\nWhich aligns with the previous discriminant condition.\n\nThus, the minimal S is sqrt(33+30k),\n\nBut sqrt(33+30k)=sqrt(3*(11+10k)),\n\nHmm,\n\nWait, 33+30k=3*(11+10k),\n\nThus,\n\nS_min= sqrt(3*(11+10k)),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{S}=2^{sqrt(3*(11+10k))},\n\nBut this is an exact form,\n\nBut the problem says to put the answer in the most appropriate LaTeX format, possibly as a product of powers of 2 and 3,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an exact value,\n\nWait, let me compute 11+10k=11+10 log\u20823,\n\nLet me express this as log\u20822^{11} + log\u20823^{10}= log\u2082(2048*3^{10}),\n\nThus,\n\n3*(11+10k)=log\u2082(2^{33}*3^{30}),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(3*(11+10k))= (1/2) log\u2082(2^{33}*3^{30})= log\u2082( (2^{33}*3^{30})^{1/2} )= log\u2082(2^{16.5}*3^{15}),\n\nThus,\n\nS= log\u2082(2^{16.5}*3^{15}),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{S}=2^{log\u2082(2^{16.5}*3^{15})}=2^{16.5}*3^{15}=2^{16}*sqrt(2)*3^{15},\n\nBut this involves a square root, which may not be desired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is achieved when equality holds in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,\n\nThe minimal S is sqrt(3*(11+10k)), which would mean that the variables are equal in some sense,\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{sqrt(3*(11+10 log\u20823))},\n\nBut this is likely not the expected answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra and the minimal S is 16,\n\nWait, let me consider that maybe the minimal value is 2^8 *3^{4} * something,\n\nBut the problem states to compute the minimal xyz,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal xyz is the product of the three RHS terms,\n\nThe product of the three RHSs is (2^8 *3^4)(2^9 *3^6)(2^5 *3^{10})=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nBut xyz raised to the power of log2(yz)+log2(zx)+log2(xy)=2 log2(xyz),\n\nThus,\n\n(xyZ)^{2 log2(xyz)}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\nLet me set T=log2(xyz),\n\nThus,\n\nT*2^T=22 log2(2) +20 log2(3),\n\nWait, no,\n\nWait,\n\nThe left side is (2^T)^{2T}=2^{2T\u00b2},\n\nThe right side is 2^{22}3^{20}=2^{22}*(2^{log\u20823})^{20}=2^{22 +20 log\u20823},\n\nThus,\n\n2^{2T\u00b2}=2^{22 +20 log\u20823},\n\nThus,\n\n2T\u00b2=22 +20 log\u20823,\n\nThus,\n\nT\u00b2=(11 +10 log\u20823),\n\nThus,\n\nT= sqrt(11 +10 log\u20823),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{sqrt(11 +10 log\u20823)}.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest possible value of xyz,\n\nThis expression is already simplified,\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects expressing it in terms of exponents,\n\nNote that 10 log\u20823=log\u20823^{10},\n\nThus,\n\n11 + log\u20823^{10}=log\u20822^{11} + log\u20823^{10}=log\u2082(2048*3^{10}),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(log\u2082(2048*3^{10})),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{sqrt(log\u2082(2048*3^{10}))},\n\nBut this is complicated,\n\nAlternatively, the minimal value is achieved when the variables are set such that the terms with k cancel out,\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal value is 2^8 *3^4 *2^9 *3^6 *2^5 *3^{10} raised to some power,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal xyz is the geometric mean of the three RHS terms,\n\nBut that would be the cube root of (2^{22}3^{20})=2^{22/3}3^{20/3},\n\nBut this is likely incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, reconsider the initial approach with logarithms.\n\nLet me recall that,\n\nlog\u2082(xyz)=A + B + C=S,\n\nWe need to minimize S,\n\nThe problem is to find S\u6ee1\u8db3:\n\nA(B + C)=8+4k,\n\nB(A + C)=9+6k,\n\nC(A + B)=5+10k,\n\nand AB + BC +CA=11+10k,\n\nLet me consider solving this system,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second,\n\nB(A + C) -A(B + C)= (9+6k) - (8+4k),\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nBA + BC -AB -AC = (1+2k),\n\nThus,\n\nC(B -A)=1+2k,\n\nSimilarly subtract second - third:\n\nB(A + C) -C(A + B)= (9+6k) - (5+10k),\n\nSimplifies to:\n\nBA + BC -AC -BC =4-4k,\n\nThus,\n\nA(B -C)=4-4k,\n\nThis is equation (2),\n\nThird minus first:\n\nC(A + B) -A(B + C)=5+10k -8-4k,\n\nSimplifies:\n\nCA + CB -AB -AC= -3+6k,\n\nThus,\n\nB(C -A)= -3+6k,\n\nThese are the three equations I had earlier.\n\nLet me consider these three equations:\n\n1.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem with three equations involving logarithms and exponents, and I need to find the smallest possible value of xyz. Hmm, the equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, all variables are positive real numbers. Alright, so I need to find xyz. The problem mentions the \"smallest possible value,\" but maybe since the equations are given, there's only one solution? Or perhaps there's a constraint I have to minimize under these equations. Hmm, maybe I need to solve for x, y, z first, then compute xyz. Let me think.\n\nFirst, these equations have variables in both the base and the exponent. The exponents are logarithms with base 2 of products of the other variables. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides would help? Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each equation as follows:\n\nEquation 1: x^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\nEquation 2: y^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nEquation 3: z^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides might simplify things. Let's try taking log\u2082 of each equation.\n\nStarting with Equation 1:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074)\n\nUsing logarithm properties: log_b(a^c) = c log_b a, so left side becomes:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074)\n\nSimilarly, the right side can be broken down as log\u2082(2\u2078) + log\u2082(3\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u20823.\n\nSo Equation 1 after taking log\u2082:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x = 8 + 4 log\u20823.   --- (1a)\n\nSimilarly, do the same for Equation 2:\n\nlog\u2082(y^{log\u2082(zx)}) = log\u2082(2\u2079\u00b73\u2076)\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(zx) * log\u2082y,\n\nRight side: 9 + 6 log\u20823.\n\nSo,\n\nlog\u2082(zx) * log\u2082y = 9 + 6 log\u20823.   --- (2a)\n\nEquation 3:\n\nlog\u2082(z^{log\u2082(xy)}) = log\u2082(2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070)\n\nLeft side: log\u2082(xy) * log\u2082z,\n\nRight side: 5 + 10 log\u20823.\n\nThus,\n\nlog\u2082(xy) * log\u2082z = 5 + 10 log\u20823.   --- (3a)\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) involving log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z, and log\u2082 terms of pairs of variables. Let me denote variables for simplicity.\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet a = log\u2082x,\n\nb = log\u2082y,\n\nc = log\u2082z.\n\nTherefore, x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c. Wait, but that might not account for the 3 terms. Wait, no, actually, since the equations have both 2 and 3 in their factors, perhaps I need to consider a different approach. Alternatively, maybe express log\u20823 as a variable? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, since the right-hand sides have terms with log\u20823, maybe we can split variables into exponents of 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables for the exponents in terms of 2 and 3. Let me think. Let me see the right-hand sides:\n\nEquation 1 RHS: 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074. So if I take log base 2, that's log\u2082(2\u2078 *3\u2074) = 8 + 4 log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, Equation 2 RHS is 9 + 6 log\u20823,\n\nEquation 3 RHS is 5 + 10 log\u20823.\n\nHmm, so in equations (1a, 2a, 3a), they involve terms involving log\u20823. Let me see if I can rewrite equations in terms of a, b, c, where a = log\u2082x, etc., and also let me denote k = log\u20823. Since log\u20823 is a constant, but it's appearing in the equations, so maybe I can treat it as a variable? Wait, but log\u20823 is a constant, so perhaps we can set variables in terms of exponents for 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express x, y, z as products of powers of 2 and 3. Since the right-hand sides are products of 2^something and 3^something, perhaps x, y, z can be written as 2^{a}3^{b}, etc. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose that x = 2^{a}3^{b},\n\ny = 2^{c}3^{d},\n\nz = 2^{e}3^{f}.\n\nThen, we can write each variable as a product of powers of 2 and 3, with exponents a,b,c,d,e,f to be determined. Let's see if that helps.\n\nFirst, let's compute log\u2082(yz). Since y = 2^c 3^d and z = 2^e 3^f,\n\nyz = 2^{c + e} 3^{d + f},\n\nso log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{c + e} 3^{d + f}) = (c + e) + log\u2082(3^{d + f}) = (c + e) + (d + f) log\u20823.\n\nWait, but log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z, right? Since log(ab) = log a + log b. So log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z = [log\u2082(2^c 3^d)] + [log\u2082(2^e 3^f)].\n\nWhich is (c + d log\u20823) + (e + f log\u20823) = (c + e) + (d + f) log\u20823. So that's the same as above.\n\nSo log\u2082(yz) = (c + e) + (d + f) log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, then the left-hand side of Equation 1 is x^{log\u2082(yz)}.\n\nx is 2^a 3^b, so x^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^a 3^b]^{ (c + e) + (d + f) log\u20823 }.\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can write that exponent as two separate exponents for 2 and 3? Wait, perhaps using the property that (2^a 3^b)^k = 2^{a k} 3^{b k}. So, yes, if I have:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = [2^a 3^b]^{ exponent } = 2^{a * exponent} * 3^{b * exponent}.\n\nSimilarly for the other equations. So perhaps by expressing all equations in terms of exponents of 2 and 3, we can equate the exponents on both sides.\n\nLet me formalize that. Let me denote:\n\nLet me define for Equation 1:\n\nLeft side exponent on 2: a * [ log\u2082(yz) ]\n\nLeft side exponent on 3: b * [ log\u2082(yz) ]\n\nWait, but log\u2082(yz) is (c + e) + (d + f) log\u20823, which itself has a term with log\u20823. Hmm, this might complicate things because log\u20823 is a constant, but not an integer. Maybe this approach is getting too convoluted. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take natural logarithms? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since log\u2082(yz) is in the exponent, perhaps using the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}. Wait, is that true?\n\nYes, because a^{log_b c} = e^{(ln a)(log_b c)} = e^{(ln a)(ln c / ln b)} = c^{(ln a / ln b)} = c^{log_b a}. So yes, the identity holds. So a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can rewrite each equation using this identity. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Equation 1:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = (yz)^{log\u2082x} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074.\n\nSimilarly, Equation 2:\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = (zx)^{log\u2082y} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nEquation 3:\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = (xy)^{log\u2082z} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. So now, Equation 1 becomes (yz)^{log\u2082x} = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\nEquation 2: (zx)^{log\u2082y} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nEquation 3: (xy)^{log\u2082z} = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, that looks better because now each equation is a product of two variables raised to the log of the third. Let me denote variables as follows. Let me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let a = log\u2082x,\n\nb = log\u2082y,\n\nc = log\u2082z.\n\nThen, log\u2082x = a, so log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(xy) = log\u2082x + log\u2082y = a + b,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = b + c,\n\nlog\u2082(zx) = c + a.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equations:\n\nEquation 1: (yz)^a = 2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\nEquation 2: (zx)^b = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nEquation 3: (xy)^c = 2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Wait, (yz)^{log\u2082x} = (yz)^a. But yz is the product of y and z, which in terms of exponents, if y = 2^b * 3^{?}, but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, actually, y and z are variables, so (yz) is just their product. However, when we write (yz)^a, since a is log\u2082x, which is a scalar, so exponentiating the product to that power.\n\nBut perhaps I need to express y and z in terms of their prime factors. Let me try to write x, y, z as 2 and 3 to some exponents. Let me try that again, but more carefully.\n\nLet me suppose that x can be written as 2^{p} * 3^{q},\n\nSimilarly, y = 2^{r} * 3^{s},\n\nz = 2^{t} * 3^{u}.\n\nTherefore, each variable is expressed with exponents for 2 and 3. Let's define variables p, q, r, s, t, u as real numbers. Then, let's see if we can write the equations in terms of these variables.\n\nFirst, let's compute log\u2082(yz). Since y and z are products of 2 and 3, their product is:\n\nyz = (2^r * 3^s)(2^t * 3^u) = 2^{r + t} * 3^{s + u}.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082(2^{r + t} * 3^{s + u}) = (r + t) + (s + u) * log\u20823.\n\nSimilarly, x^{log\u2082(yz)} would be [2^p * 3^q]^{ (r + t) + (s + u)log\u20823 }.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps expanding it:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2^{p * [ (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ]} * 3^{q * [ (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ]}.\n\nSimilarly, the right-hand side of Equation 1 is 2\u2078 * 3\u2074, which is 2^8 * 3^4. Therefore, equating the exponents for 2 and 3:\n\nFor the exponent of 2:\n\np * [ (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ] = 8,\n\nFor the exponent of 3:\n\nq * [ (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ] = 4.\n\nHmm, that's two equations from the first equation. Similarly, doing the same for the other equations.\n\nEquation 2: (zx)^{log\u2082y} = 2\u2079\u00b73\u2076.\n\nFirst, zx = (2^t * 3^u)(2^p *3^q) = 2^{t + p} *3^{u + q},\n\nso log\u2082(zx) = (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823.\n\nTherefore, y^{log\u2082(zx)} = [2^r *3^s]^{ (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 } = 2^{r [ (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ] } * 3^{s [ (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ] }.\n\nSetting equal to RHS 2^9 3^6,\n\nSo exponents:\n\nr * [ (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ] = 9,\n\ns * [ (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ] = 6.\n\nEquation 3: (xy)^{log\u2082z} = 2^5 *3^10.\n\nSimilarly, xy = (2^p *3^q)(2^r *3^s) = 2^{p + r} 3^{q + s},\n\nlog\u2082(xy) = (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823,\n\nso z^{log\u2082(xy)} = [2^t *3^u]^{ (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 } = 2^{t [ (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ] } *3^{u [ (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ] }.\n\nEquating to RHS 2^5 3^10,\n\nExponents:\n\nt * [ (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ] = 5,\n\nu * [ (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ] = 10.\n\nSo now, in total, I have six equations:\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n1. p*( (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ) = 8,\n\n2. q*( (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823 ) = 4.\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n3. r*( (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ) = 9,\n\n4. s*( (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823 ) = 6.\n\nFrom Equation 3:\n\n5. t*( (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ) = 5,\n\n6. u*( (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823 ) = 10.\n\nHmm, this system looks quite complex with 6 variables and 6 equations. Let me see if I can find a way to simplify this. Let me denote some variables to make this easier.\n\nLet me denote for each equation the terms in the brackets.\n\nLet me define for Equation 1:\n\nLet A = (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823,\n\nSo equations 1 and 2 become:\n\np*A = 8,\n\nq*A = 4,\n\nThus, from these two equations, we can see that p/q = 8/4 = 2, so p = 2q.\n\nSimilarly, A is common here. Let me note that.\n\nSimilarly, for Equation 2, let me define B = (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823,\n\nThen equations 3 and 4 become:\n\nr*B = 9,\n\ns*B = 6,\n\nThus, r/s = 9/6 = 3/2, so r = (3/2)s.\n\nSimilarly, for Equation 3, let me define C = (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823,\n\nThen equations 5 and 6:\n\nt*C =5,\n\nu*C =10,\n\nThus, t/u =5/10 = 1/2, so t = (1/2)u.\n\nOkay, so now we have relationships between p and q, between r and s, and between t and u.\n\nSo:\n\np = 2q,\n\nr = (3/2)s,\n\nt = (1/2)u.\n\nLet me note these down:\n\nEquation 1a: p = 2q,\n\nEquation 2a: r = (3/2)s,\n\nEquation 3a: t = (1/2)u.\n\nNow, let me try to substitute these into the definitions of A, B, C.\n\nFirst, let me write expressions for A, B, C in terms of q, s, u, etc.\n\nStarting with A:\n\nA = (r + t) + (s + u) log\u20823.\n\nBut r = (3/2)s,\n\nt = (1/2)u,\n\nso substituting,\n\nA = ( (3/2)s + (1/2)u ) + (s + u) log\u20823,\n\n= ( (3/2)s + (1/2)u ) + log\u20823*(s + u).\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with s and u:\n\n= s*(3/2 + log\u20823) + u*(1/2 + log\u20823).\n\nSimilarly, B = (t + p) + (u + q) log\u20823,\n\nt = (1/2)u,\n\np = 2q,\n\nso,\n\nB = ( (1/2)u + 2q ) + (u + q) log\u20823,\n\n= 2q + (1/2)u + log\u20823*(u + q).\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= q*(2 + log\u20823) + u*( (1/2) + log\u20823 ).\n\nSimilarly, C = (p + r) + (q + s) log\u20823,\n\np =2q,\n\nr=(3/2)s,\n\nso,\n\nC = (2q + (3/2)s ) + ( q + s ) log\u20823,\n\n= 2q + (3/2)s + log\u20823*(q + s).\n\nFactor:\n\n= q*(2 + log\u20823) + s*( (3/2) + log\u20823 )\n\nHmm, okay. So now let me think of variables in terms of q, s, u. Since we have p, r, t expressed in terms of q, s, u, perhaps we can write all equations in terms of q, s, u, and log\u20823.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to relate these variables. Let me note that log\u20823 is a constant, let's denote k = log\u20823, so that k \u2248 1.58496, but we can keep it as k for now.\n\nSo let me set k = log\u20823.\n\nThen, let me rewrite A, B, C with k:\n\nA = s*(3/2 + k) + u*(1/2 + k),\n\nB = q*(2 + k) + u*(1/2 + k),\n\nC = q*(2 + k) + s*(3/2 + k).\n\nAlso, from equations:\n\nFrom Equation 1: p*A =8, but p=2q, so 2q*A=8 \u21d2 q*A =4,\n\nBut equation 2 gives q*A =4 (from equation 2: q*A=4). Wait, actually equations 1 and 2 gave p*A =8 and q*A=4, so combining gives p=2q as before.\n\nSimilarly, equations 3 and 4: r*B =9 and s*B=6, so since r=(3/2)s, substituting into r*B gives (3/2)s * B =9 \u21d2 s*B = 6, which matches equation 4. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly equations 5 and 6: t*C=5 and u*C=10 \u21d2 since t=(1/2)u, so (1/2)u * C =5 \u21d2 u*C=10, which matches equation 6.\n\nSo now, we can proceed with the variables q, s, u, and k=log\u20823.\n\nLet me see if we can write equations in terms of these variables.\n\nLet me first write down all the relationships again:\n\nEquation 1a: p =2q,\n\nEquation 2a: r = (3/2)s,\n\nEquation3a: t = (1/2)u,\n\nEquation from Equation1: q*A =4,\n\nEquation from Equation2: s*B =6,\n\nEquation from Equation3: u*C =10,\n\nwhere,\n\nA = s*(3/2 +k) + u*(1/2 +k),\n\nB = q*(2 +k) + u*(1/2 +k),\n\nC = q*(2 +k) + s*(3/2 +k).\n\nHmm, so now, three equations with variables q, s, u. Let me see if we can solve this system.\n\nLet me write the three equations:\n\n1. q*A =4,\n\n2. s*B =6,\n\n3. u*C =10,\n\nwhere A,B,C are expressed in terms of q,s,u.\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three variables. Let me see if I can substitute variables step by step.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let variables be q, s, u, and write equations 1, 2, 3 as:\n\nEquation1: q*[ s*(3/2 +k) + u*(1/2 +k) ] =4,\n\nEquation2: s*[ q*(2 +k) + u*(1/2 +k) ] =6,\n\nEquation3: u*[ q*(2 +k) + s*(3/2 +k) ] =10.\n\nHmm, this is a system of three equations. It's nonlinear because variables are multiplied together. Hmm, this might be tricky, but perhaps there is a substitution or ratio that can be exploited.\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between variables. Let me try to denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s see, maybe assume that variables are proportional? Let me see if there is a pattern. Let me think of variables q, s, u.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to denote some variables as multiples. For instance, since in equation1, equation2, equation3, each has a product of a variable with a linear combination of the others. Maybe I can let\u2019s see:\n\nLet me consider the first equation: q*(something) =4,\n\nSecond: s*(something else) =6,\n\nThird: u*(another) =10.\n\nLet me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet me denote S = s,\n\nU = u,\n\nQ = q,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: Q*( S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k) ) =4,\n\nEquation2: S*( Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k) ) =6,\n\nEquation3: U*( Q*(2 +k) + S*(3/2 +k) ) =10.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider dividing equations to eliminate variables. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote equation1 as Eq1, equation2 as Eq2, equation3 as Eq3.\n\nLet me see, perhaps divide Eq1 by Eq2:\n\n[ Q*(S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k)) ] / [ S*(Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k)) ] = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: Q*(S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k))\n\nDenominator: S*(Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k))\n\nSo,\n\n[ Q / S ] * [ (S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k)) / (Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k)) ) ] = 2/3.\n\nHmm, maybe this is too complex. Alternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of ratios.\n\nLet me suppose that there are ratios between Q, S, U. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider variables Q, S, U such that they are proportional to some constants. Let me see if I can assume some relations between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me consider introducing variables like a = Q/(something), but perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider using substitution. Let me try to express variables step by step.\n\nSuppose I consider equation1: Q*(term1) =4,\n\nterm1 = S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k).\n\nSimilarly, equation2 has term2 = Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k),\n\nequation3 has term3 = Q*(2 +k) + S*(3/2 +k).\n\nHmm, perhaps if I can express S and U in terms of Q, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to let\u2019s suppose that variables Q, S, U can be expressed as multiples of each other. Let me see:\n\nSuppose Q = m*S,\n\nand U = n*S,\n\nso expressing everything in terms of S. Let me try this substitution.\n\nLet me set Q = m*S,\n\nU = n*S,\n\nso now variables are expressed in terms of S and constants m and n. Then,\n\nEquation1: Q*(S*(3/2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k)) = m S * [ S*(3/2 +k) + n S*(1/2 +k) ] = m S\u00b2 [ (3/2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] =4,\n\nEquation2: S*( Q*(2 +k) + U*(1/2 +k) ) = S*( m S*(2 +k) + n S*(1/2 +k) ) = S\u00b2 [ m(2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] =6,\n\nEquation3: U*( Q*(2 +k) + S*(3/2 +k) ) = n S * [ m S*(2 +k) + S*(3/2 +k) ) ] = n S\u00b2 [ m(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) ] =10.\n\nTherefore, now, equations become:\n\nEquation1:\n\nm [ (3/2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] * S\u00b2 =4,\n\nEquation2:\n\n[ m(2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] * S\u00b2 =6,\n\nEquation3:\n\nn [ m(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) ] * S\u00b2 =10.\n\nHmm, so let me denote S\u00b2 as a common factor. Let me set:\n\nLet me denote T = S\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nEquation1: m [ (3/2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] * T =4,\n\nEquation2: [ m(2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ] * T =6,\n\nEquation3: n [ m(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) ] * T =10.\n\nSo now, if I can solve for m and n, then perhaps I can find T, and then get S, etc.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me call the coefficients in the brackets as follows:\n\nLet me define:\n\nIn Equation1:\n\nCoefficient1 = m*( [3/2 +k] + n*[1/2 +k] )\n\nWait, actually, better to write:\n\nEquation1 coefficient: m * [ (3/2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ]\n\nEquation2 coefficient: [ m*(2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ]\n\nEquation3 coefficient: n * [ m*(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ]\n\nHmm, so let's denote variables m and n, and try to write equations in terms of them. Let me see if I can divide equations to eliminate T.\n\nIf I divide Equation1 by Equation2:\n\n[ m * ( (3/2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) / ( m(2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ) ] = 4/6 = 2/3,\n\nSimilarly, Equation3 divided by Equation2:\n\n[ n * ( m(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) / ( m(2 +k) + n(1/2 +k) ) ) ] =10/6 = 5/3,\n\nSo now, we have two equations in variables m and n.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation A:\n\n[ m*( (3/2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ) ] / [ m*(2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ) ] = 2/3,\n\nEquation B:\n\n[ n*( m*(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) ] / [ m*(2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ) ] = 5/3.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set denominator common to both as D = m*(2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k).\n\nThen Equation A becomes:\n\nm*( (3/2 +k) + n*(1/2 +k) ) = (2/3) D,\n\nEquation B becomes:\n\nn*( m*(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) = (5/3) D.\n\nHmm, perhaps substitute D into these equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote variables to simplify expressions. Let me define:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let A1 = 3/2 +k,\n\nA2 =1/2 +k,\n\nB1 =2 +k,\n\nB2 =1/2 +k,\n\nC1 =2 +k,\n\nC2 =3/2 +k.\n\nWait, but perhaps this might not help. Alternatively, let me try to let\u2019s assign variables to the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider Equation A and Equation B as linear equations in m and n? Hmm, but they are nonlinear because m and n are multiplied.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express Equation A and B in terms of D and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiplying Equation A:\n\n3m [ A1 + n A2 ] = 2 D,\n\nBut D = m B1 + n B2,\n\nTherefore,\n\n3m(A1 + nA2) = 2(m B1 + n B2)\n\nExpand left side:\n\n3m A1 + 3 m n A2 = 2m B1 + 2n B2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3m A1 -2m B1 + 3 m n A2 -2n B2 =0,\n\nFactor terms with m and n:\n\nm(3A1 -2B1) + n(3 m A2 - 2 B2) =0.\n\nHmm, this still has an m n term, so it's nonlinear. Hmm, tricky.\n\nSimilarly, let me do the same for Equation B:\n\n3n [ m B1 + C2 ] =5 D,\n\nWait, in Equation B,\n\nEquation B numerator is n*( m*(2 +k) + (3/2 +k) ) = n*( m B1 + C2 ), because (3/2 +k) is C2,\n\nDenominator D = m B1 +n B2,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation B:\n\n3n(m B1 + C2) =5(m B1 +n B2),\n\nExpanding:\n\n3n m B1 + 3n C2 =5m B1 +5n B2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3n m B1 -5m B1 +3n C2 -5n B2 =0,\n\nFactor:\n\nm B1 (3n -5) + n(3 C2 -5 B2)=0.\n\nHmm, so now, two equations:\n\nFrom Equation A:\n\nm(3A1 -2B1) + n(3 m A2 - 2 B2) =0,\n\nFrom Equation B:\n\nm B1 (3n -5) + n(3 C2 -5 B2)=0.\n\nThis is getting very involved. Perhaps there is a smarter substitution or maybe assuming some value for k?\n\nWait, but k is log\u20823, which is a constant, but we can treat it as a variable here? Wait, no, k is fixed. Since log\u20823 is a constant (~1.58496), but in the problem, we need to keep it as log\u20823 because the answer needs to be in terms of logs or exponents? Wait, but the problem says the answer should be in the most appropriate LaTeX format, perhaps as a product of powers of 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to set variables such that the equations can be decoupled?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of expressing x,y,z in terms of 2 and 3 exponents, maybe take the product xyz and find its logarithm?\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote P = xyz.\n\nWe need to find the minimal P, given the three equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take the product of all three original equations.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} = 2^8 3^4,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} = 2^9 3^6,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} = 2^5 3^{10}.\n\nMultiply all three equations together:\n\n[x^{log\u2082(yz)}][y^{log\u2082(zx)}][z^{log\u2082(xy)}] = (2^8 3^4)(2^9 3^6)(2^5 3^{10}).\n\nLeft side: x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nRight side: 2^{8+9+5} *3^{4+6+10} = 2^{22} 3^{20}.\n\nNow, let's see the left side. Let me try to combine the exponents.\n\nFirst, note that log\u2082(yz) = log\u2082y + log\u2082z,\n\nSimilarly log\u2082(zx)=log\u2082z + log\u2082x,\n\nlog\u2082(xy)=log\u2082x + log\u2082y.\n\nTherefore, the left side exponents can be written as:\n\nx^{log\u2082y + log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z + log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x + log\u2082y}.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nx^{log\u2082y} x^{log\u2082z} * y^{log\u2082z} y^{log\u2082x} * z^{log\u2082x} z^{log\u2082y}.\n\nGrouping terms with same bases:\n\n= [x^{log\u2082y} y^{log\u2082x}] * [x^{log\u2082z} z^{log\u2082x}] * [y^{log\u2082z} z^{log\u2082y}].\n\nHmm, alternatively, notice that each term is of the form a^{log b} * b^{log a}, which can be combined.\n\nRecall that a^{log b} * b^{log a} = (a^{log b}) (b^{log a}) = (e^{(ln a)(log b)}) (e^{(ln b)(log a)}) )? Wait, but maybe using the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a} again?\n\nAlternatively, note that a^{log b} * b^{log a} = e^{(ln a)(log b)} + (ln b)(log a)}. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logs:\n\nLet me take the natural logarithm of the entire left side.\n\nLet me compute ln(Left Side):\n\n= log\u2082(yz) * ln x + log\u2082(zx) * ln y + log\u2082(xy) * ln z.\n\nWait, since Left Side = x^{log\u2082(yz)} * y^{log\u2082(zx)} * z^{log\u2082(xy)}.\n\nTaking ln:\n\nln(Left Side) = log\u2082(yz) * lnx + log\u2082(zx)*lny + log\u2082(xy)*lnz.\n\nHmm, perhaps express log\u2082 terms in terms of ln:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) = (ln(yz))/ln2,\n\nso,\n\nln(Left Side) = [ (ln(yz)/ln2) * lnx + (ln(zx)/ln2)*lny + (ln(xy)/ln2)*lnz ]\n\n= (1/ln2)[ ln(yz) lnx + ln(zx) lny + ln(xy) lnz ]\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying the terms inside:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: ln(yz)*lnx = (ln y + ln z)(lnx),\n\nSecond term: ln(zx)*lny = (ln z + lnx)(lny),\n\nThird term: ln(xy)*lnz = (lnx + lny)(lnz).\n\nAdding these together:\n\n(ln y + ln z)(lnx) + (ln z + lnx)(lny) + (lnx + lny)(lnz)\n\nLet me expand each product:\n\n= lnx ln y + lnx ln z + lny ln z + lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny ln z.\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait first term: (ln y + ln z)(lnx) = lnx ln y + lnx ln z,\n\nSecond term: (ln z + lnx)(lny) = lny ln z + lnx lny,\n\nThird term: (lnx + lny)(lnz) = lnx lnz + lny lnz.\n\nTherefore, adding all terms:\n\nFirst terms: lnx ln y + lnx ln z,\n\nSecond terms: lny ln z + lnx lny,\n\nThird terms: lnx lnz + lny lnz,\n\nSo total:\n\nlnx ln y + lnx ln z + lny ln z + lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny lnz.\n\nWait, but arranging terms:\n\nEach pair like lnx lny appears twice,\n\n similarly lnx lnz appears twice,\n\n and lny lnz appears twice?\n\nWait:\n\nLooking at terms:\n\nlnx ln y appears in first term and second term,\n\nlnx ln z appears in first term and third term,\n\nlny ln z appears in second term and third term,\n\nWait actually:\n\nFirst term has lnx ln y and lnx ln z,\n\nSecond term has lny ln z and lnx lny,\n\nThird term has lnx ln z and lny ln z,\n\nThus total:\n\nFor lnx lny: 1 (from first term) +1 (from second term) = 2 terms,\n\nSimilarly lnx ln z: 1 (first) +1 (third) = 2,\n\n lny ln z:1 (second) +1 (third) = 2,\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait first term has lnx ln y and lnx ln z,\n\nSecond term has lny ln z and lnx lny,\n\nThird term has lnx ln z and lny ln z,\n\nSo total:\n\nlnx lny: 1 (from first) +1 (from second) = 2,\n\nlnx lnz:1 (from first) +1 (from third) =2,\n\nlny lnz:1 (from second) +1 (from third) =2,\n\nTherefore total sum is 2(lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny lnz).\n\nTherefore,\n\nln(Left Side) = (1/ln2)[ 2(lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny lnz) ]\n\nSo,\n\nln(Left Side) = 2/(ln2) [ lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny lnz ]\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps, but let's see the right side:\n\nThe product of the RHS is 2^{22}*3^{20}, so its ln is ln(2^{22}*3^{20}) =22 ln2 +20 ln3.\n\nTherefore,\n\n2/(ln2) [ lnx lny + lnx lnz + lny lnz ] =22 ln2 +20 ln3,\n\nHmm, not sure if this is helpful yet. Maybe this is a detour.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let me go back to the equations with variables a, b, c where a=log\u2082x, b=log\u2082y, c=log\u2082z.\n\nRecall that earlier, when I used the identity a^{log_b c}=c^{log_b a}, the equations became:\n\n(yz)^a =2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\n(zx)^b =2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\n(xy)^c =2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nSo, writing these equations as:\n\n(y z)^a =2^8 3^4,\n\n(z x)^b =2^9 3^6,\n\n(x y)^c =2^5 3^{10}.\n\nLet me take log base 2 of each equation.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog\u2082[(y z)^a] = log\u2082(2^8 3^4),\n\na*(log\u2082y + log\u2082z) =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog\u2082[(z x)^b] = log\u2082(2^9 3^6),\n\nb*(log\u2082z + log\u2082x)=9 +6 log\u20823,\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082[(x y)^c] = log\u2082(2^5 3^{10}),\n\nc*(log\u2082x + log\u2082y)=5 +10 log\u20823.\n\nNow, let me denote variables as before:\n\nLet a=log\u2082x,\n\nb=log\u2082y,\n\nc=log\u2082z.\n\nWait, but hold on, in this notation, the variables a,b,c are already used as exponents in the equations. Wait, perhaps that's conflicting with previous notation. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in this approach, let me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set A = log\u2082x,\n\nB = log\u2082y,\n\nC = log\u2082z.\n\nSo that x=2^A, y=2^B, z=2^C.\n\nWait, but then the equations involving log\u20823 would still be a problem because the RHS has log\u20823 terms.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is manageable.\n\nWait, but in the first equation:\n\n(y z)^a =2^8 3^4,\n\nWait, but here, the exponent a would actually be A=log\u2082x? Wait, no, in the equation above, \"a\" was from the identity step.\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps better to use different notation.\n\nLet me re-define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s use a different notation. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set A = log\u2082x,\n\nB = log\u2082y,\n\nC = log\u2082z,\n\nand let\u2019s also denote K = log\u20823. Since log\u20823 is a constant, let me denote it as K for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, K is a constant approximately 1.58496, but we can treat it as a symbol.\n\nNow, the first equation after taking log\u2082:\n\nEquation1: log\u2082[(y z)^{A}] = log\u2082(2^8 3^4),\n\nLeft side: A*(log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = A*(B + C),\n\nRight side: 8 +4K,\n\nThus:\n\nEquation1: A(B + C) =8 +4K,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: log\u2082[(z x)^{B}] = log\u2082(2^9 3^6),\n\nLeft side: B*(log\u2082z + log\u2082x) = B*(C + A),\n\nRight side: 9 +6K,\n\nThus:\n\nEquation2: B(A + C) =9 +6K,\n\nEquation3: log\u2082[(x y)^{C}] = log\u2082(2^5 3^{10}),\n\nLeft side: C*(log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = C*(A + B),\n\nRight side:5 +10K,\n\nThus:\n\nEquation3: C(A + B) =5 +10K.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. A(B + C) =8 +4K,\n\n2. B(A + C) =9 +6K,\n\n3. C(A + B) =5 +10K,\n\nWhere K = log\u20823,\n\nand variables are A,B,C.\n\nThis seems more manageable. Now, we have three equations with three variables A,B,C, and K is a known constant.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for A,B,C, then compute xyz = 2^{A + B + C} (since log\u2082xyz = A+B+C).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to solving for A,B,C and then computing 2^{A+B+C}. The minimal xyz would just be this value, as variables are positive.\n\nTherefore, we can focus on solving equations 1,2,3 for A,B,C.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1. A(B + C) =8 +4K,\n\n2. B(A + C) =9 +6K,\n\n3. C(A + B) =5 +10K,\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C,\n\nThen, B + C = S - A,\n\nSimilarly, A + C = S - B,\n\nA + B = S - C.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equations:\n\n1. A(S - A) =8 +4K,\n\n2. B(S - B) =9 +6K,\n\n3. C(S - C) =5 +10K.\n\nHmm, so now, each equation is quadratic in one variable, given S.\n\nHmm, perhaps adding all three equations:\n\nA(S - A) + B(S - B) + C(S - C) = (8+4K)+(9+6K)+(5+10K),\n\nLeft side: S(A + B + C) - (A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2) = S^2 - (A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2),\n\nsince A+B+C=S, so S*(A+B+C)=S\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 - (A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2) = 22 + 20K,\n\nSo,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - (22 +20K).\n\nHmm, but not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of S.\n\nLet me note that each equation can be rewritten as:\n\nA\u00b2 - S A + (8 +4K) =0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB\u00b2 - S B + (9 +6K) =0,\n\nC\u00b2 - S C + (5 +10K) =0.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait equation1: A(S - A) =8 +4K \u21d2 SA - A\u00b2 =8+4K \u21d2 A\u00b2 -SA + (8+4K)=0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: B\u00b2 -SB + (9+6K)=0,\n\nEquation3: C\u00b2 -SC + (5+10K)=0.\n\nSo each variable A,B,C is a root of the quadratic equation:\n\nX\u00b2 - S X + (constant) =0,\n\nwhere constants are 8+4K, 9+6K, 5+10K respectively.\n\nTherefore, for each quadratic equation, the solutions are:\n\nA = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4K))]/2,\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nHowever, since A,B,C are real numbers (as x,y,z are positive reals), the discriminants must be non-negative.\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(8+4K),\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(9+6K),\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(5+10K).\n\nThese inequalities must hold.\n\nBut perhaps there is a common S that satisfies all three equations.\n\nAlternatively, since A,B,C are all roots of their respective quadratics with the same S, perhaps we can consider that A,B,C are three different roots of the same quadratic?

So, for each variable, the value must satisfy the quadratic equation. Thus, for each variable, the possible solutions are:\n\nA = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4K))]/2,\n\nB = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6K))]/2,\n\nC = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10K))]/2.\n\nSince A,B,C are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nS\u00b2 \u2265 32 + 16K,\n\nS\u00b2 \u2265 36 +24K,\n\nS\u00b2 \u226520 +40K.\n\nThus, the most restrictive is the third one: S\u00b2 \u226520 +40K.\n\nNow, perhaps we can write S in terms of these equations and set up an equation for S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write A = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1)]/2, where D1=4*(8+4K)=32+16K,\n\nSimilarly, B and C with their D's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the sum A + B + C = S.\n\nLet me write:\n\nA = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1)]/2,\n\nB = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D2)]/2,\n\nC = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D3)]/2,\n\nwhere D1=32+16K, D2=36+24K, D3=20+40K.\n\nThen,\n\nA + B + C = [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1)+sqrt(S\u00b2 - D2)+sqrt(S\u00b2 - D3))]/2 = S,\n\nThus,\n\n3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1)+sqrt(S\u00b2 - D2)+sqrt(S\u00b2 - D3)) = 2S,\n\nHence,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 - D2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 - D3).\n\nHmm, this equation must be solved for S. This looks complicated but perhaps substituting numerical values for K might help?\n\nWait, K = log\u20823 \u22481.58496,\n\nLet me compute D1, D2, D3:\n\nD1 =32 +16*1.58496\u224832 +25.3594\u224857.3594,\n\nD2=36 +24*1.58496\u224836 +38.039\u224874.039,\n\nD3=20 +40*1.58496\u224820 +63.398\u224883.398.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -57.3594) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -74.039) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -83.398).\n\nThis is a transcendental equation and may need numerical methods. But since the problem requires an exact answer, maybe there's an exact value of S that makes the terms inside the square roots perfect squares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe K is chosen such that the expressions inside the square roots are squares?\n\nWait, since K=log\u20823, perhaps the problem is designed such that when we substitute K=log\u20823, the terms can be expressed in terms of variables leading to an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a clever substitution.\n\nLet me think back to the original equations.

So, perhaps the minimal S =A+B+C corresponds to the minimal value of S, but since S is the sum, and the equations depend on S, perhaps there's a minimal S that satisfies all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an elegant substitution using the original equations.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, the three equations are:\n\nx^{log\u2082(yz)} =2\u2078\u00b73\u2074,\n\ny^{log\u2082(zx)} =2\u2079\u00b73\u2076,\n\nz^{log\u2082(xy)} =2\u2075\u00b73\u00b9\u2070.\n\nSuppose we take the logarithm of each equation with base 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider writing each equation in terms of logarithms.\n\nWait, let me consider taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x^{log\u2082(yz)}) = log\u2082(2\u2078\u00b73\u2074),\n\nWhich gives:\n\nlog\u2082(yz) * log\u2082x =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote Lx=log\u2082x, Ly=log\u2082y, Lz=log\u2082z,\n\nThen,\n\nLy + Lz)*Lx =8 +4 log\u20823,\n\n(Lz + Lx)*Ly=9 +6 log\u20823,\n\n(Lx + Ly)*Lz=5 +10 log\u20823.\n\nThese are the same equations as before with A=Lx, B=Ly, C=Lz.\n\nLet me consider adding all three equations:\n\n(Ly+Lz)Lx + (Lz+Lx)Ly + (Lx+Ly)Lz = (8+4K)+(9+6K)+(5+10K),\n\nWhere K=log\u20823,\n\nLeft side is the same as before,\n\n=2(LxLy + LxLz + LyLz),\n\nRight side is 22 +20K,\n\nThus,\n\nLxLy + LxLz + LyLz=11 +10K,\n\nNow, let me denote S =Lx + Ly + Lz,\n\nand P = LxLyLz,\n\nWe can recall that (Lx + Ly + Lz)^3 = Lx^3 + Ly^3 + Lz^3 +3(LxLy + LxLz + LyLz)(Lx + Ly + Lz) -3LxLyLz,\n\nBut not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that:\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1.

Lz(Lx+Ly)=5+10K,\n\nLet me denote S = Lx + Ly + Lz,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation1: Lx(S - Lx)=8+4K,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: Ly(S - Ly)=9+6K,\n\nEquation3:Lz(S -Lz)=5+10K,\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\nLx\u00b2 - S Lx + (8+4K) =0,\n\nLy\u00b2 -S Ly +9+6K=0,\n\nLz\u00b2 -S Lz +5+10K=0,\n\nThus, Lx, Ly, Lz are roots of the equations:\n\nX\u00b2 -S X + (8+4K)=0,\n\nX\u00b2 -S X + (9+6K)=0,\n\nX\u00b2 -S X + (5+10K)=0,\n\nThus, each variable satisfies a quadratic equation with the same S but different constants.\n\nTherefore, the three variables Lx, Ly, Lz are the roots of three different quadratics sharing the same linear coefficient.\n\nThis implies that each variable is a root of its respective quadratic, but they are all related through the same S.\n\nTo find S such that there exist real numbers Lx, Ly, Lz satisfying all three equations.\n\nTherefore, the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nFor Lx: S\u00b2 \u22654*(8+4K)=32+16K,\n\nFor Ly:S\u00b2 \u22654*(9+6K)=36+24K,\n\nFor Lz:S\u00b2 \u22654*(5+10K)=20+40K,\n\nThe most restrictive is the last one: S\u00b2 \u226520+40K.\n\nLet me think of S as a variable to be determined.\n\nLet me denote the three quadratics as:\n\nQ1(X)=X\u00b2 -S X + (8+4K),\n\nQ2(X)=X\u00b2 -S X + (9+6K),\n\nQ3(X)=X\u00b2 -S X + (5+10K).\n\nThe roots are:\n\nLx= [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4K))]/2,\n\nLy= [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6K))]/2,\n\nLz= [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10K))]/2,\n\nNow, since Lx + Ly + Lz = S,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write each root as,\n\nLx = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D1)]/2,\n\nLy = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D2)]/2,\n\nLz = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - D3)]/2,\n\nWhere D1=4*(8+4K)=32+16K,\n\nD2=4*(9+6K)=36+24K,\n\nD3=4*(5+10K)=20+40K.\n\nThen,\n\nLx + Ly + Lz = [3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2-D1)+sqrt(S\u00b2-D2)+sqrt(S\u00b2-D3))]/2 = S,\n\nTherefore,\n\n3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2-D1)+sqrt(S\u00b2-D2)+sqrt(S\u00b2-D3)) = 2S,\n\nThus,\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2-D1) + sqrt(S\u00b2-D2) + sqrt(S\u00b2-D3).\n\nThis is the key equation to solve for S.\n\nThis equation is quite complex, but perhaps there's a value of S that makes all the terms inside the square roots perfect squares?\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose that S\u00b2 - D1 = a\u00b2,\n\nS\u00b2 - D2 = b\u00b2,\n\nS\u00b2 - D3 = c\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 + D1 = S\u00b2,\n\nb\u00b2 + D2 = S\u00b2,\n\nc\u00b2 + D3 = S\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 + D1 = b\u00b2 + D2 = c\u00b2 + D3 = S\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nb\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + D1 - D2,\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + D1 - D3,\n\nSo,\n\nb = sqrt(a\u00b2 + D1 - D2),\n\nc = sqrt(a\u00b2 + D1 - D3),\n\nAlso, the equation S = a + b + c,\n\nBut S\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + D1,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + D1) = a + b + c,\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to assume that S is such that S\u00b2 - D3 is a perfect square.\n\nLet me compute D3=20+40K\u224820+40*1.58496\u224883.398,\n\nSuppose S\u00b2 -83.398 = m\u00b2,\n\nThen S\u00b2 = m\u00b2+83.398,\n\nSimilarly for others,\n\nBut this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem expects an exact solution, so maybe the equations can be solved with K=log\u20823,\n\nLet me try to work symbolically.\n\nLet\u2019s set K=log\u20823,\n\nThen, the key equation is:\n\nS = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4K)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6K)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10K)),\n\nThis equation must be solved for S.\n\nLet me denote the terms inside the square roots as:\n\nTerm1 = S\u00b2 - (32+16K),\n\nTerm2 = S\u00b2 - (36+24K),\n\nTerm3 = S\u00b2 - (20+40K),\n\nLet me see if there is a common factor,\n\n32+16K=16*(2+K),\n\n36+24K=12*(3+2K),\n\n20+40K=20*(1+2K),\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the coefficients in the original equations have the form:\n\nThe constants without K are 8,9,5,\n\nthe coefficients with K are 4,6,10,\n\nNotice that 4=8/2,\n\n6=9/1.5,\n\n10=5*2,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables A,B,C are proportional to the constants without K,\n\nLet me suppose that A =8k,\n\nB=9k,\n\nC=5k,\n\nThen,\n\nAB + AC + BC =k\u00b2(8*9 +8*5 +9*5)=k\u00b2(72+40+45)=k\u00b2*157,\n\nBut AB + AC + BC should be 11+10K,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2= (11+10K)/157,\n\nBut this is just a guess and likely not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take A:B:C =4:6:10,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations can be simplified by dividing them.\n\nLet me consider equation1 divided by equation2:\n\n[A(B+C)]/[B(A+C)] = (8+4K)/(9+6K),\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[A/B] * [ (B+C)/(A+C) ] = (8+4K)/(9+6K),\n\nLet me denote A/B = m,\n\nThen,\n\nm*( (B+C)/(A+C) ) = (8+4K)/(9+6K),\n\nBut B+C = S -A,\n\nA+C = S -

3+2log\u20823=3+log\u20829=log\u20828 +log\u20829=log\u208272,\n\nYes,\n\nSo,\n\nA=4/log\u208212 +9/log\u208272
