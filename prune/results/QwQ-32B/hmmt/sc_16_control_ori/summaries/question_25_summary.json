      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find XP in this geometry problem. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem again. We have an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 6. Point P is inside the triangle such that angle BPC is 120 degrees. There's a circle with diameter AP that intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC again at X (other than A). We're told that AX is 5, and we need to find XP. Alright.\n\nFirst, since ABC is equilateral, all sides are 6, and all angles are 60 degrees. The circumcircle of ABC would have a radius that can be calculated. Maybe that's useful later. Let me recall the formula for the circumradius of an equilateral triangle: R = (a)/\u221a3, where a is the side length. So here, R = 6/\u221a3 = 2\u221a3. So the circumradius is 2\u221a3. That might come into play.\n\nNow, point P is inside the triangle with angle BPC = 120\u00b0. Hmm, angle conditions in triangles often relate to cyclic quadrilaterals or certain circle properties. Since angle BPC is 120\u00b0, which is supplementary to 60\u00b0, maybe there's a circle involved here? Wait, but the problem mentions another circle with diameter AP. That circle would have its center at the midpoint of AP and radius half of AP. The point X is where this circle intersects the circumcircle of ABC again. Since AX is given as 5, maybe we can use some power of a point or intersecting chords theorem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system. Let me set point A at (0,0), B at (6,0), and since it's an equilateral triangle, point C would be at (3, 3\u221a3). Let me confirm that. The height of an equilateral triangle with side 6 is (6\u221a3)/2 = 3\u221a3. So yes, coordinates are A(0,0), B(6,0), C(3, 3\u221a3).\n\nNow, point P is inside the triangle with angle BPC = 120\u00b0. Hmm, how can I find coordinates for P? Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric relations or geometric properties?\n\nAlternatively, since angle BPC = 120\u00b0, perhaps point P lies on some circle? In an equilateral triangle, there are certain known points where angles subtended by sides are specific. Wait, maybe using the concept of the circumcircle of triangle BPC? If angle BPC is 120\u00b0, then the circumradius of triangle BPC can be related to the sides. Let me recall that in any triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A). For triangle BPC, angle at P is 120\u00b0, so the circumradius would be BC/(2 sin 120\u00b0). Since BC is 6, then R = 6/(2*(\u221a3/2)) = 6/\u221a3 = 2\u221a3. Wait, that's the same as the circumradius of ABC. Interesting. So the circumcircle of triangle BPC has the same radius as the circumcircle of ABC. Hmm, so maybe they are related?\n\nWait, but the circumcircle of BPC would have radius 2\u221a3, same as ABC. That suggests that points B, P, C, and maybe A lie on the same circle? Wait, but ABC is already on its own circumcircle. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe point P is located such that triangle BPC has a circumradius of 2\u221a3, but since ABC is equilateral, perhaps P is on some specific point?\n\nAlternatively, maybe inversion or some other transformation could help, but that might be too complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the circle with diameter AP. The key here is that any point on this circle will satisfy the property that the angle at that point subtended by AP is a right angle. So, for point X, since it's on the circle with diameter AP, angle AX P is 90\u00b0? Wait, no, actually, the angle subtended by the diameter is a right angle. So, if X is on the circle with diameter AP, then angle AX P is 90\u00b0, so angle AXP = 90\u00b0. Wait, actually, the angle subtended by the diameter is a right angle, so the angle at X would be a right angle. Wait, more precisely, if AP is the diameter, then any point X on that circle forms a right angle with A and P. So, angle AX P = 90\u00b0. Therefore, triangle AXP is right-angled at X. So, AX is 5, AP is the diameter, so the radius is AP/2, so the hypotenuse of the right triangle AXP would be AP. Therefore, by Pythagoras, we have AX\u00b2 + XP\u00b2 = AP\u00b2. Since AX=5, then 25 + XP\u00b2 = AP\u00b2. So XP = sqrt(AP\u00b2 -25). Hmm, so if I can find AP, then I can compute XP. So maybe if I can find AP, then that would give me the answer?\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the length of AP. So how do we find AP?\n\nWe know that X is also on the circumcircle of ABC. Since X is on both the circumcircle of ABC and the circle with diameter AP, perhaps we can use some properties here.\n\nAlternatively, since X is on the circumcircle of ABC, AX is a chord of the circumcircle. The length AX is given as 5. The side length of ABC is 6, so the circumradius is 2\u221a3, so the diameter is 4\u221a3. The maximum possible length of a chord is the diameter, so 4\u221a3 \u22486.928, so 5 is possible. Let me recall that in a circle, the length of a chord is related to the central angle. The chord length formula is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. So, if AX is 5, then 5 = 2*(2\u221a3)*sin(theta/2) => 5/(4\u221a3) = sin(theta/2). Let me compute that:\n\nsin(theta/2) = 5/(4\u221a3) \u2248 5/(6.928) \u2248 0.72. Hmm, so theta/2 \u2248 arcsin(0.72) \u2248 46 degrees, so theta \u2248 92 degrees. So the central angle between A and X is about 92 degrees. Not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's place the triangle as I mentioned earlier.\n\nLet me set coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(6,0), C(3, 3\u221a3). The circumcircle of ABC can be found. Let me compute its equation. Since it's an equilateral triangle, the circumcenter is at the centroid? Wait, no, in an equilateral triangle, centroid, circumcenter, orthocenter, etc., all coincide. The centroid is at ( (0+6+3)/3, (0 +0 +3\u221a3)/3 ) = (9/3, 3\u221a3/3 ) = (3, \u221a3). Wait, but the circumradius is 2\u221a3, so the distance from the circumcenter (3, \u221a3) to any vertex should be 2\u221a3. Let me check for point A(0,0):\n\nDistance squared: (3-0)^2 + (\u221a3 -0)^2 = 9 + 3 = 12, so sqrt(12) = 2\u221a3. Correct. So the circumcircle equation is (x -3)^2 + (y - \u221a3)^2 = (2\u221a3)^2 = 12.\n\nSo the equation of the circumcircle of ABC is (x -3)^2 + (y - \u221a3)^2 = 12.\n\nNow, the circle with diameter AP: Let me denote point P as (p_x, p_y). The midpoint of AP is (p_x/2, p_y/2), since A is (0,0). The radius is (AP)/2. The equation of this circle would be (x - p_x/2)^2 + (y - p_y/2)^2 = ( (sqrt( (p_x)^2 + (p_y)^2 )) / 2 )^2 = (p_x\u00b2 + p_y\u00b2)/4.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to (x - p_x/2)^2 + (y - p_y/2)^2 = (p_x\u00b2 + p_y\u00b2)/4. Expanding this, we get x\u00b2 - p_x x + (p_x\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 - p_y y + (p_y\u00b2)/4 = (p_x\u00b2 + p_y\u00b2)/4. Subtracting the right side from both sides gives x\u00b2 - p_x x + y\u00b2 - p_y y = 0. So the equation of the circle with diameter AP is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y = 0. Hmm, that's a nice simplification.\n\nNow, the point X lies on both this circle and the circumcircle of ABC. So, we can set up equations:\n\nFirst, the circumcircle of ABC: (x - 3)^2 + (y - \u221a3)^2 = 12.\n\nSecond, the circle with diameter AP: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y = 0.\n\nWe can try to find the intersection points of these two circles. We know that A(0,0) is a common point, so the other intersection is X. Let me subtract the two equations to find the line equation for their radical axis.\n\nFirst, expand the circumcircle equation:\n\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - \u221a3)^2 = 12\n\nExpanding:\n\nx\u00b2 -6x +9 + y\u00b2 - 2y\u221a3 + 3 = 12\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x - 2y\u221a3 +12 =12\n\nSo x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0.\n\nNow, the equation of the circle with diameter AP is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y =0.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y) =0 -0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-6x -2y\u221a3 - (-p_x x - p_y y) =0\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n(-6 + p_x)x + (-2\u221a3 + p_y)y =0\n\nThis is the equation of the radical axis, which is the line along which the two circles intersect. Since points A and X lie on both circles, they must lie on this line. Since A is (0,0), plugging in gives 0=0, which is okay. For point X, it must satisfy this equation as well.\n\nBut this might not directly help yet. Maybe we can parameterize point X?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the coordinates of X in terms of some parameter and use the given AX =5.\n\nSince X is on the circumcircle of ABC, we can parametrize it. Let me think of X as a point on the circumcircle with AX =5. Let me see if I can find coordinates for X.\n\nThe distance from A(0,0) to X(x,y) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =5, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25. But X is also on the circumcircle of ABC which has equation (x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2=12.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\n2. (x -3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2 =12.\n\nLet me expand the second equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -6x +9 + y\u00b2 - 2y\u221a3 +3 =12,\n\nso x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 +12 =12,\n\ntherefore x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0.\n\nBut from the first equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25, substitute into the second equation:\n\n25 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nso -6x -2y\u221a3 = -25,\n\ndivide both sides by -2: 3x + y\u221a3 = 25/2.\n\nSo, equation (2) gives us 3x + \u221a3 y = 12.5.\n\nSo, we can write y = (12.5 -3x)/\u221a3.\n\nNow, substitute this into the first equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (12.5 -3x)/\u221a3 ]\u00b2 =25.\n\nFirst, square the term:\n\n[ (12.5 -3x)^2 ] / 3 = ( (12.5)^2 - 6*12.5 x +9x\u00b2 ) /3.\n\nSo, entire equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + (156.25 - 75x +9x\u00b2)/3 =25.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n3x\u00b2 +156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2 =75.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2) + (-75x) +156.25 =75,\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +156.25 -75 =0,\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25 =0.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25 =0.\n\nHmm, let's see. Maybe multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n\n48x\u00b2 - 300x + 325 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying further. Let me check discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant D = (300)^2 -4*48*325.\n\nCompute 300\u00b2 = 90000,\n\n4*48*325 = 4*48*325. Let's compute 48*325 first:\n\n48*300=14400,\n\n48*25=1200,\n\nTotal 14400+1200=15600,\n\nthen 4*15600=62400,\n\nThus D=90000 -62400=27600.\n\nHmm, sqrt(27600). Let's see, 27600=100*276=100*4*69=400*69, so sqrt=20*sqrt(69). Hmm, irrational. Hmm, this might complicate things. Maybe there was a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me check the steps again. Starting from equations:\n\nEquation1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nEquation2: 3x + \u221a3 y =12.5\n\nSo solving for y gives y=(12.5 -3x)/\u221a3,\n\nThen x\u00b2 + [ (12.5 -3x)^2 / 3 ] =25,\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (12.5 -3x)^2 =75,\n\nExpand (12.5 -3x)^2:\n\n12.5\u00b2 - 2*12.5*3x + (3x)^2,\n\n12.5 squared is 156.25,\n\nMinus 75x,\n\nplus 9x\u00b2,\n\nSo total:\n\n3x\u00b2 +156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2 =75,\n\nSo 12x\u00b2 -75x +156.25 =75,\n\nSo 12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25 =0,\n\nThat's correct. Then multiplying by 4:\n\n48x\u00b2 -300x +325 =0,\n\nDiscriminant: 300\u00b2 -4*48*325,\n\n300 squared is 90000,\n\n4*48*325,\n\n48*325=15600,\n\n4*15600=62400,\n\nThus D=90000-62400=27600,\n\nsqrt(27600)=sqrt(100*276)=10*sqrt(276),\n\nBut 276=4*69, so sqrt(276)=2*sqrt(69),\n\nThus sqrt(27600)=10*2*sqrt(69)=20\u221a69 \u2248 20*8.3066 \u2248166.13,\n\nSo solutions:\n\nx=(75 \u00b1 sqrt(27600))/(2*12),\n\nWait, hold on. The quadratic equation is 12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25=0,\n\nThus a=12, b=-75, c=81.25,\n\nThus x=(75 \u00b1 sqrt(75\u00b2 -4*12*81.25))/24,\n\nCompute discriminant again:\n\n75\u00b2=5625,\n\n4*12*81.25=48*81.25,\n\n48*80=3840,\n\n48*1.25=60,\n\nTotal 3840+60=3900,\n\nThus D=5625 -3900=1725,\n\nAh! Wait, I think I made an error earlier when multiplying by 4. Let me redo the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up in the previous steps. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, original equation after multiplying by 3:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (12.5 - 3x)^2 =75.\n\nBut expanding (12.5-3x)^2:\n\n12.5^2 - 2*12.5*3x + (3x)^2 = 156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2,\n\nThus 3x\u00b2 + 156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2 =75,\n\nTotal x\u00b2 terms: 12x\u00b2,\n\nLinear term: -75x,\n\nConstants: 156.25,\n\nSo 12x\u00b2 -75x +156.25 =75,\n\nSubtract 75: 12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25=0,\n\nYes, that's correct. Then discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-75)^2 -4*12*81.25,\n\n75^2 = 5625,\n\n4*12=48,\n\n48*81.25,\n\nCompute 81.25*48:\n\nLet me do 80*48 +1.25*48,\n\n80*48=3840,\n\n1.25*48=60,\n\nTotal 3840 +60=3900,\n\nSo discriminant is 5625 - 3900= 1725,\n\nAh, so sqrt(1725). Let me see: 1725 divided by 25 is 69, so sqrt(25*69)=5\u221a69,\n\nTherefore sqrt(1725)=5\u221a69,\n\nSo x=(75 \u00b15\u221a69)/(2*12)= (75 \u00b15\u221a69)/24,\n\nFactor out 5 from numerator:\n\n5*(15 \u00b1\u221a69)/24,\n\nThus x= (15 \u00b1\u221a69)/ (24/5). Hmm, maybe simplify fractions:\n\nAlternatively, write as (75 \u00b15\u221a69)/24 = (75/24) \u00b1 (5\u221a69)/24,\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n75/24 = 25/8 \u22483.125,\n\n5/24 \u22480.208,\n\nSo, possible x coordinates are (25/8 + (5\u221a69)/24) or (25/8 - (5\u221a69)/24). Hmm, complicated.\n\nSimilarly, once x is found, y can be computed from y=(12.5 -3x)/\u221a3,\n\nBut this is getting messy. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, since AX=5, and ABC is equilateral with side length 6, perhaps there's a geometric relation here.\n\nWait, let me recall that in the circle with diameter AP, point X lies on it and on the circumcircle of ABC. Also, angle AX P is 90\u00b0, as it's inscribed in the semicircle. So triangle AX P is right-angled at X. Therefore, AX is 5, so XP = sqrt(AP\u00b2 - AX\u00b2)=sqrt(AP\u00b2 -25). So if I can find AP, then XP is straightforward.\n\nHence, the problem reduces to finding AP.\n\nSo how to find AP?\n\nWe need to use the condition that angle BPC =120\u00b0, and that point P is inside the triangle. Maybe using trigonometric Ceva's theorem or something else?\n\nAlternatively, since angle BPC =120\u00b0, and ABC is equilateral, perhaps using coordinates for point P?\n\nLet me denote P as (p, q). Then angle BPC is 120\u00b0, so using coordinates:\n\nVectors PB and PC make an angle of 120\u00b0, so the angle between vectors PB and PC is 120\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle BPC:\n\nBP\u00b2 + CP\u00b2 - 2 BP*CP cos(120\u00b0) = BC\u00b2,\n\nSince BC is 6,\n\nThus BP\u00b2 + CP\u00b2 - 2 BP*CP*(-1/2) =36,\n\nSo BP\u00b2 + CP\u00b2 + BP*CP =36.\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving BP and CP, but we have three variables (coordinates of P). Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, since we might need to relate AP with other variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. Hmm, but maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since X is a point on both circles, perhaps there is an inversion property?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Power of a Point. For point X with respect to the circle with diameter AP: since X is on that circle, its power is zero. But also, since X is on the circumcircle of ABC, maybe there's some relation?\n\nAlternatively, since AX is a chord of the circumcircle of ABC, and AP is the diameter of another circle passing through X, perhaps some relation between AX, AP, and XP?\n\nWait, going back, since angle AX P is 90\u00b0, so AX is perpendicular to XP? Wait no, angle at X is 90\u00b0, so AX is perpendicular to PX. Wait, no, if the angle at X is 90\u00b0, then sides AX and PX are the legs, with AP as the hypotenuse. So yes, AX \u22a5 PX? Wait, no, the angle at X is between AX and PX, so AX and PX are perpendicular. Therefore, AX is perpendicular to PX. Hmm, so the lines AX and PX are perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, the vectors from X to A and X to P are perpendicular. So (A - X) \u00b7 (P - X) =0.\n\nHmm, but maybe coordinates are still the way to go, despite the messy algebra.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use complex numbers?\n\nLet me consider placing the triangle in complex plane. Let me set point A at 0, B at 6, and C at 3 + 3\u221a3 i. The circumcircle is centered at 3 + \u221a3 i with radius 2\u221a3. Let me denote points as complex numbers.\n\nLet me denote P as a complex number p = x + yi. Then angle BPC =120\u00b0, which can be translated into an equation in complex numbers. The angle between vectors PB and PC is 120\u00b0, so using the argument:\n\narg( (C - P)/(B - P) ) = \u00b1120\u00b0, but since it's inside the triangle, probably 120\u00b0. Hmm, complex analysis might not be simpler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Law of Sines in triangle BPC. In triangle BPC, angle at P is 120\u00b0, so:\n\nBP / sin(angle at C) = CP / sin(angle at B) = BC / sin(120\u00b0),\n\nBut angle at B in triangle BPC would be angle PBC, and angle at C would be angle PCB. Since ABC is equilateral, original angles at B and C are 60\u00b0, but in triangle BPC, those angles are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates for point P.\n\nLet me try to proceed with coordinates. Let me denote point P as (p, q). Since angle BPC =120\u00b0, using coordinates for points B(6,0), P(p,q), C(3,3\u221a3).\n\nThe vectors PB and PC can be written as:\n\nVector PB = (6 - p, 0 - q),\n\nVector PC = (3 - p, 3\u221a3 - q).\n\nThe angle between these vectors is 120\u00b0, so the dot product formula:\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = |PB||PC| cos(120\u00b0).\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n(6 - p)(3 - p) + (0 - q)(3\u221a3 - q) = |PB| |PC| (-1/2).\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(6 - p)(3 - p) + (- q)(3\u221a3 - q)\n\n= [18 -6p -3p + p\u00b2] + [ -3\u221a3 q + q\u00b2 ]\n\n= p\u00b2 -9p +18 + q\u00b2 -3\u221a3 q.\n\nThe right side:\n\n-1/2 * sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q^2 ) * sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 )\n\nThis equation seems complicated, but perhaps we can find another relation involving AP.\n\nAlternatively, since we need AP, which is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nWait, but we also have point X on both circles, so perhaps coordinates of X can be connected with P through some relation.\n\nAlternatively, since X is on the circumcircle of ABC and on the circle with diameter AP, so if I can find coordinates of X in terms of P, then perhaps use AX =5 to set up an equation.\n\nLet me see. Let me denote point X as (x,y). Since X is on the circumcircle of ABC:\n\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - \u221a3)^2 =12,\n\nand on the circle with diameter AP:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p x - q y =0.\n\nAlso, distance from A to X is 5:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nSo, combining the equations:\n\nFrom the circle with diameter AP: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = p x + q y,\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25, so 25 = p x + q y. Thus, p x + q y =25.\n\nAlso, from the circumcircle equation:\n\n(x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2 =12,\n\nExpand to get x\u00b2 -6x +9 + y\u00b2 - 2y\u221a3 +3 =12,\n\nSo x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nAgain, since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nSubstitute: 25 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nThus, 6x + 2y\u221a3 =25,\n\nSo, 3x + y\u221a3 =12.5,\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So, that gives us a relation between x and y.\n\nSo, from the above equations, we have:\n\nEquation (1): 3x + \u221a3 y =12.5,\n\nEquation (2): p x + q y =25,\n\nAnd we also have the coordinates of X (x,y) lying on the circumcircle and satisfying AX=5.\n\nAdditionally, since angle at X is 90\u00b0, we have AX perpendicular to PX. The vector from X to A is (-x, -y), and the vector from X to P is (p - x, q - y). Their dot product should be zero:\n\n(-x)(p - x) + (-y)(q - y)=0,\n\n=> -x(p -x) -y(q - y)=0,\n\n=> -px +x\u00b2 - q y + y\u00b2 =0,\n\nBut since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nSo, -px - q y +25 =0,\n\nThus, px + q y =25,\n\nWait, that's exactly equation (2). So that doesn't give a new equation. Hmm. So that's consistent, but doesn't help.\n\nSo, equations we have are:\n\n1. 3x + \u221a3 y =12.5,\n\n2. p x + q y =25,\n\n3. (x,y) lies on circumcircle and AX=5.\n\nBut we need to relate this to point P which is inside the triangle with angle BPC=120\u00b0.\n\nHmm. Perhaps we can parametrise X in terms of x and y, then express P in terms of X?\n\nWait, from equation (2): p x + q y =25. So if we can express p and q in terms of x and y, but P is also constrained by angle BPC=120\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations (equation from angle BPC and equation from p x + q y=25) but multiple variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we might need to use the fact that AP is the diameter of the circle passing through X, so midpoint of AP is the center, so the center is at (p/2, q/2). Since X is also on this circle, so the distance from center to X is equal to radius (AP/2):\n\nsqrt( (x - p/2)^2 + (y - q/2)^2 ) = (AP)/2 = ( sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) ) /2.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(x - p/2)^2 + (y - q/2)^2 = (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4,\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 - p x + (p\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 - q y + (q\u00b2)/4 = (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4,\n\nWhich again gives x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p x - q y =0, which is the equation of the circle with diameter AP, so that's consistent. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. This seems like a system of equations but with too many variables. Maybe I need to find a relation between p and q from the angle condition, then combine with the equations involving x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing specific coordinates for P that satisfy angle BPC=120\u00b0, then see if we can compute AP and relate?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives AX=5, perhaps there is a specific location for X, so maybe there's a way to find coordinates of X first, then find P?\n\nLet me try to find coordinates of X first.\n\nEarlier, I had the equations for X:\n\n3x + \u221a3 y =12.5,\n\nand x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y.\n\nLet me write y from first equation:\n\ny = (12.5 -3x)/\u221a3,\n\nPlug into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nSo x\u00b2 + [ (12.5 -3x)^2 ] / 3 =25,\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n3x\u00b2 + (12.5 -3x)^2 =75,\n\nExpand (12.5 -3x)^2:\n\n= 12.5\u00b2 -2*12.5*3x +9x\u00b2,\n\n=156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n3x\u00b2 +156.25 -75x +9x\u00b2 =75,\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +156.25 =75,\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25 =0,\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nLet me try to solve this quadratic equation for x:\n\nx = [75 \u00b1 sqrt(75\u00b2 -4*12*81.25)] / (2*12),\n\nCompute discriminant D=5625 - 3900=1725,\n\nsqrt(1725)=sqrt(25*69)=5*sqrt(69),\n\nSo,\n\nx = [75 \u00b15\u221a69]/24,\n\nWhich simplifies to,\n\nx = [75 \u00b15\u221a69]/24 = [15 \u00b1\u221a69]/(24/5) = ... maybe leave as is.\n\nThus,\n\nx1 = [75 +5\u221a69]/24,\n\nx2 = [75 -5\u221a69]/24,\n\nTherefore, two possible x coordinates for X. Similarly, y coordinates can be found.\n\nCompute y for x1:\n\ny1 = (12.5 -3x1)/\u221a3,\n\n= (12.5 -3*(75 +5\u221a69)/24)/\u221a3,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n12.5 is 25/2,\n\n25/2 - (225 +15\u221a69)/24,\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n(25/2)*(12/12)= 300/24,\n\nThus,\n\n300/24 - (225 +15\u221a69)/24,\n\n=(300 -225 -15\u221a69)/24,\n\n=(75 -15\u221a69)/24,\n\nFactor numerator: 15(5 - \u221a69)/24,\n\nThus,\n\ny1 = [15(5 -\u221a69)/24 ] /\u221a3 = [15(5 -\u221a69)]/(24\u221a3) = [5(5 -\u221a69)]/(8\u221a3),\n\nSimilarly for x2,\n\ny2 = (12.5 -3x2)/\u221a3,\n\n= (25/2 -3*(75 -5\u221a69)/24)/\u221a3,\n\n= same steps,\n\n25/2 =300/24,\n\n300/24 - (225 -15\u221a69)/24 = (300 -225 +15\u221a69)/24 = (75 +15\u221a69)/24,\n\nSo y2= [75 +15\u221a69]/24 divided by \u221a3,\n\n= [15(5 +\u221a69)/24]/\u221a3 = [5(5 +\u221a69)]/(8\u221a3).\n\nTherefore, coordinates of X are:\n\nX1: ( [75 +5\u221a69]/24 , [5(5 -\u221a69)]/(8\u221a3) ),\n\nX2: ( [75 -5\u221a69]/24 , [5(5 +\u221a69)]/(8\u221a3) ).\n\nHmm, complicated expressions. Maybe there are two possible positions for X? Since the circle with diameter AP can intersect the circumcircle at two points, but the problem states X \u2260A, so maybe two possibilities, but given that angle BPC=120\u00b0, perhaps only one of them is compatible?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed by assuming that once we have coordinates for X, we can find P from the equation p x + q y =25, and also the angle BPC=120\u00b0 condition.\n\nLet me pick one of the solutions for X, say X1, and see if I can find P.\n\nLet me denote X's coordinates as (x,y). So, from equation p x + q y =25,\n\nThus, p = (25 - q y)/x,\n\nAssuming x \u22600.\n\nBut we also have to satisfy the angle BPC =120\u00b0 condition, which relates p and q.\n\nThis seems very involved. Maybe there's a different approach using geometric properties instead of coordinates.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since angle BPC =120\u00b0, and ABC is equilateral, perhaps point P lies on some specific circle related to ABC?\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, if a point P has angle BPC = 120\u00b0, then P lies on the circumcircle of triangle BPC, which as we saw earlier has the same radius as ABC's circumradius. Wait, but ABC's circumradius is 2\u221a3, and earlier for triangle BPC, the circumradius was 2\u221a3 as well. So perhaps points A, B, C, P lie on the same circle? But that can\u2019t be because P is inside the triangle.\n\nWait, but if the circumradius of BPC is equal to that of ABC, maybe there is some inversion symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, if P is such that angle BPC = 120\u00b0, then P lies on the circumcircle of ABC? Wait, but angle BPC would then be equal to angle BAC or something? Wait, in an equilateral triangle, all central angles are 120\u00b0, but perhaps not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following theorem: In triangle ABC, if a point P inside satisfies angle BPC = 120\u00b0, then P lies on the circumcircle of some triangle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use trigonometric Ceva's theorem. In triangle ABC, for concurrent cevians, but angle condition?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the given AX =5.\n\nWe know that AX is 5, and X is on the circumcircle. Since AX is a chord, maybe we can find the angle at the center for AX. Let me compute the central angle for chord AX.\n\nThe chord length formula: AX = 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle.\n\nGiven AX =5, R=2\u221a3,\n\nThus 5 = 2*(2\u221a3)*sin(theta/2),\n\nThus sin(theta/2)=5/(4\u221a3) \u22485/6.928\u22480.72,\n\nSo theta/2 \u2248 arcsin(0.72)\u224846.1\u00b0, so theta\u224892.2\u00b0,\n\nThus the central angle between A and X is about 92.2\u00b0, which is slightly more than 90\u00b0, so point X is somewhere near the arc BC?\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is equilateral, the circumcircle is symmetric, so maybe the position of X can be determined relative to the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in triangle APX, right-angled at X, so AP^2 =AX^2 + XP^2,\n\nSo, if I can find AP, then XP is sqrt(AP^2 -25). So the key is AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a relation between AP and the sides of the triangle given angle BPC=120\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following approach:\n\nLet me consider inversion with respect to point A, but maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, since angle BPC=120\u00b0, and ABC is equilateral, perhaps construct an equilateral triangle on one side?\n\nWait, another idea: In triangle ABC, if angle BPC=120\u00b0, then by the Law of Sines in triangle BPC,\n\nBP / sin(angle BCP) = CP / sin(angle CBP) = BC / sin(120\u00b0),\n\nSince BC=6,\n\nThus,\n\nBP / sin(angle BCP) = CP / sin(angle CBP) = 6 / (sqrt(3)/2)= 12/sqrt(3)=4\u221a3.\n\nSo,\n\nBP =4\u221a3 sin(angle BCP),\n\nCP=4\u221a3 sin(angle CBP),\n\nAlso, angle BCP + angle CBP +120\u00b0=180\u00b0,\n\nThus angle BCP + angle CBP=60\u00b0,\n\nLet me denote angle CBP = \u03b1, then angle BCP=60\u00b0-\u03b1,\n\nThus,\n\nBP=4\u221a3 sin(60\u00b0\u2212\u03b1),\n\nCP=4\u221a3 sin \u03b1,\n\nHmm, but how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates again, but with a different approach.\n\nLet me suppose that point P has coordinates (p,q). Then the vectors PB and PC make an angle of 120\u00b0, so using the dot product:\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = |PB||PC|cos(120\u00b0),\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\n(6-p)(3-p) + q(3\u221a3 - q) = - (1/2)|PB||PC|,\n\nWait, actually, wait, the dot product is:\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = |PB||PC| cos(theta),\n\ntheta=120\u00b0, so cos(theta)= -1/2,\n\nThus,\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = - (1/2)|PB||PC|,\n\nBut let me compute PB \u00b7 PC:\n\nPB = (6-p, -q),\n\nPC = (3-p, 3\u221a3 - q),\n\nDot product:\n\n(6-p)(3-p) + (-q)(3\u221a3 - q),\n\n= (6*3 -6p -3p + p\u00b2) + (-3\u221a3 q + q\u00b2),\n\n= 18 -9p + p\u00b2 -3\u221a3 q + q\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -9p -3\u221a3 q +18,\n\nAnd |PB||PC|= sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q^2 ) * sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 ),\n\nSo,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 -9p -3\u221a3 q +18 = -1/2 * sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q^2 ) * sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 ),\n\nThis is a complicated equation but perhaps we can find another equation involving p and q from the circle conditions.\n\nRecall that point X lies on the circle with diameter AP, so:\n\nX is (x,y) such that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =25,\n\nand (x - p/2)^2 + (y - q/2)^2 = (AP/2)^2,\n\nWhich expands to x\u00b2 - p x + y\u00b2 - q y + (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4 = (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4,\n\nSo, simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p x - q y =0,\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\nThus, 25 - p x - q y =0,\n\nTherefore, p x + q y =25,\n\nSo, if we can express p and q in terms of x and y, then substitute into the angle equation.\n\nBut this seems a loop. Alternatively, perhaps assign variables differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that AP can be expressed in terms of coordinates as sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, if I can express sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations involving p and q (the angle condition and the relationship from point X), but it's quite involved.\n\nWait, maybe we can consider that point X is the intersection point other than A of the two circles. Since we need to find XP, and XP = sqrt(AP\u00b2 -25), if we can find AP, then done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Power of a Point. For point P with respect to the circumcircle of ABC.\n\nThe Power of P with respect to the circumcircle of ABC is OP\u00b2 - R\u00b2, where O is the center. But since P is inside, it's negative. Alternatively, Power of a point P with respect to the circumcircle is equal to PA * PX (since APX is a secant line?), but wait, AP is a chord?\n\nWait, actually, the Power of point P with respect to the circumcircle of ABC would be PB * PC ... Wait, no, Power of a point formula states that for a point P and a circle, the power is PA * PX = PB * something? Wait, let me recall:\n\nPower of a point P with respect to a circle is equal to PA * PX where PA and PX are the lengths of the two segments from P to the points of intersection along a line through P. But here, the line AX passes through P? Not necessarily, unless P is on AX. Wait, but in our case, the circle with diameter AP intersects the circumcircle at A and X. So the line AX is the secant line for point P with respect to the circumcircle of ABC? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Power of point X with respect to the circle with diameter AP is zero since it's on the circle. The Power of X with respect to the circumcircle of ABC is also zero since it's on it. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since AX is 5, and AP is the diameter of the circle through X, so AP^2 = AX^2 + XP^2 as per Pythagoras. So XP = sqrt(AP^2 -25). So if we can find AP, then we can find XP. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding AP.\n\nNow, how to find AP. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we construct point P such that angle BPC =120\u00b0, and then find AP such that the circle with diameter AP intersects the circumcircle again at X with AX=5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a property or theorem that connects these elements.\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, if a point P has angle BPC =120\u00b0, then P lies on the circumcircle of some specific triangle? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in triangle BPC, angle at P is 120\u00b0, so the circumradius of triangle BPC is BC/(2 sin 120\u00b0) =6/(2*(\u221a3/2))=6/\u221a3=2\u221a3, which is equal to the circumradius of ABC. Therefore, the circumcircle of BPC is the same as the circumcircle of ABC? Wait, but that would mean that points B, P, C, A are concyclic, but in that case, angle BAC is 60\u00b0, which is different from angle BPC=120\u00b0, so that can't be unless P coincides with A, which it can't since it's inside.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the circumcircle of BPC is the same as that of ABC? Wait, no, because substituting P into the circumcircle equation would require it to satisfy (x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2=12.\n\nLet me check for point P: If P were on the circumcircle, then angle BPC would be equal to angle BAC or its supplement. Since in the circumcircle of ABC, angle BPC would be 60\u00b0, because angle at circumference subtended by BC. Wait, angle BAC is 60\u00b0, so angle BPC would also be 60\u00b0, but the problem states it's 120\u00b0, so P must be outside the circumcircle? But the problem says P is inside the triangle, which is inside the circumcircle. Contradiction?\n\nWait a second, this is an important point. If the circumradius of triangle BPC is equal to that of ABC, but if P is inside ABC, then the circumcircle of BPC must be the same as ABC's? But that would require angle BPC to be equal to angle BAC, which is 60\u00b0, but the problem says it's 120\u00b0, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the formula for the circumradius of triangle BPC is R = BC/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is angle at P. So here, angle at P is 120\u00b0, so R =6/(2 sin 120\u00b0)=6/(2*(\u221a3/2))=6/\u221a3=2\u221a3, which is the same as ABC's circumradius. So the two circumcircles have the same radius. However, their centers may be different. So the two circles (ABC's and BPC's) have the same radius but different centers. Their centers are separated, so they can intersect.\n\nSo, the circumcircle of BPC has the same radius as ABC's, but different center. Thus, points B and C are common to both circles, but the other points are different. So point P is on the circumcircle of BPC, which is a different circle from ABC's, but with the same radius.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a homothety or reflection that maps one to the other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps point P lies somewhere such that the two circles intersect at B, C, and two other points?\n\nAlternatively, since both circles have the same radius and contain BC, their centers are located along the perpendicular bisector of BC. Since BC is from (6,0) to (3, 3\u221a3), midpoint of BC is at (4.5, 1.5\u221a3). The perpendicular bisector would be a line perpendicular to BC. The slope of BC is (3\u221a3 -0)/(3 -6)= (3\u221a3)/(-3)= -\u221a3. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector has slope 1/\u221a3. Thus, the centers of both circumcircles (ABC and BPC) lie along this perpendicular bisector.\n\nThe center of ABC's circumcircle is at (3, \u221a3). Let me confirm it's on the perpendicular bisector:\n\nThe line through midpoint (4.5, 1.5\u221a3) with slope 1/\u221a3:\n\nEquation is y -1.5\u221a3 = (1/\u221a3)(x -4.5).\n\nCheck if (3, \u221a3) satisfies this:\n\nLeft side: \u221a3 - 1.5\u221a3 = -0.5\u221a3,\n\nRight side: (1/\u221a3)(3 -4.5)= (1/\u221a3)(-1.5)= -1.5/\u221a3 = -0.5\u221a3,\n\nYes, so it is on the line. Thus, the center of ABC is on the perpendicular bisector.\n\nThe center of the circumcircle of BPC must also be on this line, since it has the same radius and contains BC. Therefore, its center is also on the perpendicular bisector. Thus, the two centers are colinear along this perpendicular bisector, separated by some distance.\n\nGiven that both circles have the same radius, the distance between their centers must be 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between their centers? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between centers is 2*2\u221a3*sin(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is the angle between the lines from centers to BC? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since both circles have the same radius and share chord BC, the line connecting their centers is the perpendicular bisector of BC, and the two centers are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of BC. Wait, but if the radius is the same, then the centers must be equidistant from BC but on opposite sides?\n\nWait, the circumcircle of ABC has its center at (3, \u221a3), which is above BC (since the triangle is above BC). The circumcircle of BPC must also have its center on the perpendicular bisector. If P is inside ABC, then the center of BPC's circumcircle would be on the opposite side of BC from the center of ABC's circumcircle? Or same side?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider using coordinates again, but see if I can find AP through the system of equations.\n\nWe have two equations from point X:\n\n1. 3x + \u221a3 y =12.5,\n\n2. p x + q y =25,\n\nand the angle condition involving p and q.\n\nLet me suppose that we can write p and q in terms of x and y from equation 2:\n\np = (25 - q y)/x,\n\nBut this still leaves two variables. Maybe combine with the angle condition equation.\n\nThe angle condition equation was:\n\nPB \u00b7 PC = - (1/2)|PB||PC|,\n\nWhere PB = (6-p, -q),\n\nPC = (3-p, 3\u221a3 - q),\n\nDot product: (6-p)(3-p) + (-q)(3\u221a3 - q) = - (1/2)*sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q^2 )*sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 ),\n\nBut substituting p from equation 2 into this would be extremely messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that point X is such that AX=5, so perhaps there is a symmedian or reflection property?\n\nAlternatively, consider triangle APX right-angled at X. So, the triangle has sides AX=5, XP=?, AP=?\n\nIf we can find AP, then XP is sqrt(AP\u00b2 -25).\n\nPerhaps using some geometric relations in triangle ABC.\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, the distance from a vertex to any point inside can be related via certain properties. Alternatively, use coordinates for point P and try to find AP.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in the problem, the numerical values are given: side length 6, AX=5. Maybe the answer is an integer or a nice fraction, so perhaps through some calculation, AP is sqrt( something ), leading to XP as desired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in triangle APX, right-angled at X, with AX=5, and X lying on the circumcircle of ABC.\n\nThe point X is at distance 5 from A and lies on the circumcircle, so perhaps there's a relation between AP and the other sides.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates for point X and then compute AP.\n\nLet me proceed numerically with approximate values to see if it helps.\n\nSuppose I compute the approximate coordinates of X.\n\nGiven the quadratic equation for x:\n\n12x\u00b2 -75x +81.25=0,\n\nUsing the quadratic formula,\n\nx = [75 \u00b1 sqrt(75\u00b2 -4*12*81.25)]/(2*12),\n\nWe had discriminant D=1725\u224841.54^2,\n\nSo sqrt(1725)=\u224841.54,\n\nThus,\n\nx1=(75+41.54)/24\u2248116.54/24\u22484.856,\n\nx2=(75-41.54)/24\u224833.46/24\u22481.394,\n\nThus two x-values approximately 4.856 and 1.394,\n\nCorresponding y-values:\n\nFor x1\u22484.856,\n\ny1=(12.5 -3x1)/\u221a3\u2248(12.5 -14.568)/1.732\u2248(-2.068)/1.732\u2248-1.194,\n\nBut since the triangle has coordinates up to y=3\u221a3\u22485.196, a negative y would place X below the base AB, but since the circumcircle includes all points, but given that P is inside the triangle, perhaps X is the other point with positive y-coordinate.\n\nWait, for x2\u22481.394,\n\ny2=(12.5 -3*1.394)/\u221a3\u2248(12.5 -4.182)/1.732\u22488.318/1.732\u22484.804,\n\nSo coordinates of X are approximately (1.394,4.804).\n\nThat makes sense since it's inside the upper part of the circumcircle.\n\nSo, approximate coordinates of X are (1.394,4.804).\n\nNow, we need to find point P such that:\n\n1. P is inside the triangle,\n\n2. angle BPC=120\u00b0,\n\n3. the circle with diameter AP passes through X.\n\nSo, from equation p x + q y =25,\n\nWith x\u22481.394, y\u22484.804,\n\nThus, p*1.394 + q*4.804 \u224825,\n\nEquation (a): 1.394 p +4.804 q \u224825,\n\nAlso, the angle BPC=120\u00b0 condition.\n\nLet me also note that point P lies somewhere inside the triangle, so its coordinates should be between 0 and 6 in x, and between 0 and 3\u221a3\u22485.196 in y.\n\nLet me try to assume some value for P and see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that AP is the diameter, so midpoint of AP is the center of the circle. Since X is on the circle, the distance from midpoint to X equals half of AP.\n\nMidpoint M of AP is (p/2, q/2).\n\nDistance MX should be AP/2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (x - p/2)^2 + (y - q/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\n(x - p/2)^2 + (y - q/2)^2 = (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4,\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b2 - p x + (p\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 - q y + (q\u00b2)/4 = (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/4,\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p x - q y =0,\n\nWhich is the equation we had before, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since we have approximate coordinates for X, perhaps plug them into equation (a) and also the angle condition.\n\nLet me proceed numerically.\n\nLet me denote X as approximately (1.394,4.804).\n\nEquation (a): 1.394 p +4.804 q \u224825,\n\nWe also have the angle condition equation. Let me try to approximate that.\n\nLet me assume P has coordinates (p,q). Then vectors PB=(6-p, -q),\n\nPC=(3-p, 3\u221a3 - q).\n\nCompute the dot product PB \u00b7 PC \u2248 (6-p)(3-p) + (-q)(3\u221a3 - q),\n\n= (18 -9p + p\u00b2) + (-3\u221a3 q + q\u00b2),\n\nThe magnitudes |PB| and |PC| are sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q\u00b2 ) and sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 ),\n\nThe angle between them is 120\u00b0, so the dot product should equal |PB||PC|cos(120\u00b0)= -0.5 |PB||PC|,\n\nSo,\n\n(18 -9p + p\u00b2 -3\u221a3 q + q\u00b2) = -0.5 * sqrt( (6-p)^2 + q\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (3-p)^2 + (3\u221a3 - q)^2 ),\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but with approximate coordinates for X, maybe we can assume a value for p and q that satisfy equation (a) and see.\n\nLet me suppose that P is somewhere along the line from A to X. Since the circle with diameter AP passes through X, perhaps P lies along AX? Wait, but the midpoint of AP is the center, and X is on the circle, so the distance from the center to X must be equal to the radius. If P were along AX, then the center would be the midpoint, and X would be diametrically opposite A, but since AX is 5 and AP is the diameter, that would require AP=10, but then XP would be sqrt(100-25)=sqrt(75)=5\u221a3\u22488.66, but maybe possible?\n\nWait, but if P were along AX, then angle BPC might not be 120\u00b0. Let me check.\n\nSuppose P is on AX. Let me parametrize P as a point along AX. Let me compute parametric coordinates for AX.\n\nPoint A is (0,0), point X is approximately (1.394,4.804). The vector AX is (1.394,4.804). So parametric equations:\n\nP(t) = t*(1.394,4.804), where t>1 would go beyond X, but since P is inside the triangle, perhaps t between 0 and some value. Wait, but if P is between A and X, then the circle with diameter AP would have X on it only if AX is the diameter, but then P would have to be at X, which is not the case. So probably not on the segment AX.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P is such that AP is the diameter, so the circle includes X, which is not diametrically opposite but another point.\n\nAlternatively, let me make an assumption that AP is such that XP is the desired value. Suppose XP is an integer or simple fraction. Since AX=5 and in an equilateral triangle with side 6, maybe AP is sqrt(25 + XP\u00b2). If XP is sqrt(11), then AP would be sqrt(36)=6, but that might be possible. Alternatively, maybe XP= sqrt( AP^2 -25 ). If AP is  sqrt( 25 + (XP)^2 ), but without more info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives AX=5 and asks for XP, perhaps by some geometric mean theorem or something similar.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Since X is on the circumcircle of ABC and the circle with diameter AP, then AX is a chord common to both circles. The point P is related to X via the circle with diameter AP.\n\nPerhaps using the Power of a Point X with respect to the circumcircle of ABC: but X is on the circle, so its power is zero.\n\nAlternatively, the Power of point P with respect to the circumcircle of ABC is PA * PX = PB * PC - something? Wait, Power of a point P with respect to the circumcircle is PB * PC = PT^2 - R^2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the problem, angle BPC=120\u00b0, and in triangle BPC, the circumradius is 2\u221a3, so area can be computed as (BP * CP * BC)/(4R) = (BP*CP*6)/(4*2\u221a3)= (BP*CP)/( (16\u221a3)/6 )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, area of BPC can be expressed in two ways: (1/2)*BP*CP*sin(120\u00b0), and also using Heron's formula.\n\nBut without knowing BP and CP, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider coordinates again with approximate values.\n\nSuppose I take the approximate coordinates of X as (1.394,4.804). Let me plug into equation (a):\n\n1.394 p +4.804 q \u224825,\n\nAssume p and q satisfy this. Let me also use the angle condition equation.\n\nLet me make a guess for p and q.\n\nSuppose P is at centroid: (3, \u221a3\u22481.732). Let's test:\n\nPB \u00b7 PC:\n\nPB=(6-3, -\u221a3)=(3, -1.732),\n\nPC=(3-3, 3\u221a3 -\u221a3)=(0, 2\u221a3\u22483.464),\n\nDot product=3*0 + (-1.732)(3.464)=\u2248-6,\n\nThe magnitudes:\n\n|PB|=sqrt(9 + 3)=sqrt(12)=3.464,\n\n|PC|=sqrt(0 + 12)=3.464,\n\nThus, the dot product should be |PB||PC|cos(theta)=3.464\u00b2 * cos(theta)=12 cos(theta),\n\nSet equal to -6:\n\n12 cos(theta)= -6 => cos(theta)= -0.5 => theta=120\u00b0, which matches!\n\nWait a second, the centroid satisfies angle BPC=120\u00b0?\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, the centroid is also the circumcenter, but here the centroid is at (3, \u221a3). Wait, the centroid is at ( (0+6+3)/3, (0+0+3\u221a3)/3 ) = (3, \u221a3). But in this case, when P is the centroid, vectors PB and PC are as calculated above, and the angle between them is indeed 120\u00b0, so that point P is the centroid. Interesting!\n\nSo, if P is the centroid, then AP can be calculated. Let me compute AP.\n\nCoordinates of centroid P are (3, \u221a3). So AP is the distance from (0,0) to (3,\u221a3):\n\nAP = sqrt(3\u00b2 + (\u221a3)^2)=sqrt(9 +3)=sqrt(12)=2\u221a3\u22483.464.\n\nWait, but then XP would be sqrt(AP\u00b2 - AX\u00b2)=sqrt(12 -25)=sqrt(-13), which is impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, contradiction. So my assumption that P is the centroid is invalid, even though angle BPC=120\u00b0, because then the circle with diameter AP would have a diameter of 2\u221a3, so radius \u221a3, but X is at distance AX=5, which is longer than the diameter, impossible. So centroid is not the right point.\n\nWait, so even though the centroid satisfies angle BPC=120\u00b0, it doesn't satisfy the other condition with X. Thus P is a different point.\n\nHmm, so maybe the problem requires P to be another point where angle BPC=120\u00b0, but not the centroid.\n\nLet me try another point. Let me suppose that P is somewhere else.\n\nSuppose that point P is located such that AP is perpendicular to AX. Since in triangle APX, right-angled at X, so if AP is perpendicular to AX, then that would mean X is the foot of the altitude from P to AX, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to solve the equations numerically.\n\nTake approximate coordinates of X as (1.394,4.804).\n\nEquation (a): 1.394p +4.804q \u224825,\n\nLet me express p in terms of q: p=(25 -4.804q)/1.394\u2248(25 -4.804q)/1.394.\n\nNow, plug into the angle condition equation.\n\nLet me denote PB \u00b7 PC = -0.5 |PB||PC|,\n\nCompute PB \u00b7 PC = (6-p)(3-p) + (-q)(3\u221a3 - q),\n\nLet me substitute p=(25 -4.804q)/1.394,\n\nThis is going to be very messy, but let me try with approximate values.\n\nLet me assume a value for q, say q=2,\n\nThen p=(25 -4.804*2)/1.394\u2248(25-9.608)/1.394\u224815.392/1.394\u224810.99,\n\nBut this p would be outside the triangle (x-coordinate 10.99>6), so invalid.\n\nTry q=3,\n\np=(25 -4.804*3)/1.394\u2248(25-14.412)/1.394\u224810.588/1.394\u22487.59,\n\nStill x>6.\n\nTry q=4,\n\np=(25-4.804*4)/1.394\u2248(25-19.216)/1.394\u22485.784/1.394\u22484.15.\n\nThis is within the triangle (x\u22484.15 <6, y=4 is okay).\n\nSo let's take q=4, p\u22484.15.\n\nNow check angle condition.\n\nCompute PB \u00b7 PC:\n\nPB=(6-4.15, -4)=(1.85, -4),\n\nPC=(3-4.15, 3\u221a3-4)=(-1.15, 5.196-4)=(-1.15,1.196),\n\nDot product: (1.85)(-1.15) + (-4)(1.196)= -2.1275 -4.784\u2248-6.9115,\n\nCompute |PB|=sqrt(1.85\u00b2 + (-4)^2)=sqrt(3.42+16)=sqrt(19.42)\u22484.406,\n\n|PC|=sqrt((-1.15)^2 +1.196\u00b2)=sqrt(1.32+1.43)=sqrt(2.75)=1.658,\n\nThus |PB||PC|\u22484.406*1.658\u22487.3,\n\nThen -0.5*7.3\u2248-3.65,\n\nBut the dot product was \u2248-6.91, which is not equal to -3.65.

Maybe need to set up the equation properly.\n\nLet me denote p = (25 - q*y)/x, where x and y of point X are known in terms of variables.\n\nWait, but since we have two possible points for X, perhaps we can pick one and solve numerically.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that given the problem is likely to have an elegant solution, perhaps there's a property I'm missing.\n\nWait, considering that AX =5 and ABC has side length 6, perhaps using the Law of Cosines in triangle AXC or something.\n\nWait, let's consider triangle AX C.\n\nPoint X is on the circumcircle, so angle ABC=60\u00b0, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since X is on the circumcircle of ABC, then angle AXC = angle ABC =60\u00b0, because inscribed angles subtended by the same arc.\n\nWait, angle at X: angle AXC would be equal to angle ABC if they subtend the same arc AC. Since ABC is 60\u00b0, angle AXC would also be 60\u00b0.\n\nThus in triangle AXC, we have AX=5, AC=6, and angle at X is 60\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, by the Law of Cosines on triangle AXC:\n\nAC\u00b2 = AX\u00b2 + CX\u00b2 - 2*AX*CX*cos(60\u00b0),\n\nThus,\n\n6\u00b2 =5\u00b2 + CX\u00b2 - 2*5*CX*(0.5),\n\n36=25 + CX\u00b2 -5*CX,\n\nThus,\n\nCX\u00b2 -5CX +25 -36=0,\n\nCX\u00b2 -5CX -11=0,\n\nSolving quadratic:\n\nCX = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 +44)]/2 = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(69)]/2,\n\nSince CX must be positive, take the positive root:\n\nCX = [5 +\u221a69]/2 \u2248 [5+8.306]/2\u22486.653,\n\nOr the negative root would give a negative length, so reject.\n\nThus, CX is (5 +\u221a69)/2.\n\nHmm, interesting. Now, perhaps relate this to other parts.\n\nIn triangle BPC, we had BP\u00b2 + CP\u00b2 + BP*CP =36 from earlier.\n\nAlso, in triangle APC, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates of X, we can find vector relationships.\n\nAlternatively, since we found CX, perhaps in triangle CPX?\n\nAlternatively, since X is on the circumcircle, and we have CX, maybe use Stewart's theorem on triangle ACX with cevian CX?\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider triangle APX is right-angled at X, so XP = sqrt(AP\u00b2 -25).\n\nIf we can find AP using other relations, that would help.\n\nPerhaps using the British flag theorem? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since P lies inside the triangle with angle BPC=120\u00b0, and AX=5, maybe there's a relation between AP and CX.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nEarlier, in triangle AXC, we found CX=(5 +\u221a69)/2.\n\nIf I can find CP and PX, maybe via triangle CPX?\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since point P is inside the triangle, and lies on the circumcircle of BPC which has the same radius as ABC's circumradius.\n\nThe distance from P to the center of the circumcircle (which is (3,\u221a3)) must satisfy some condition.\n\nThe center of the circumcircle of BPC is also on the perpendicular bisector of BC, which we discussed earlier. Let me denote it as point O'.\n\nThe distance between the two centers (O and O') can be calculated, but perhaps this is overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since both circles (ABC and BPC) have the same radius and share chord BC, the distance between their centers is 2*sqrt(R\u00b2 - (BC/2)^2).\n\nWait, the distance between centers for two circles with equal radius R and common chord BC is 2*sqrt(R\u00b2 - (d/2)^2), where d is the length of BC.\n\nWait, BC is 6, so half of it is 3,\n\nThus, distance between centers is 2*sqrt( (2\u221a3)^2 - 3^2 )=2*sqrt(12 -9)=2*sqrt(3),\n\nThus the centers are 2\u221a3 apart.\n\nSince both centers lie on the perpendicular bisector of BC, which we had earlier as passing through (3,\u221a3) (center of ABC), then the center of BPC's circumcircle is located 2\u221a3 away from (3,\u221a3) along the perpendicular bisector.\n\nThe direction of the perpendicular bisector is along the line we had earlier: y -1.5\u221a3 = (1/\u221a3)(x -4.5).\n\nThe direction vector of this line is ( \u221a3, 1 ), since the slope is 1/\u221a3, so for a run of \u221a3, the rise is 1.\n\nThus, moving from the center of ABC (3,\u221a3) towards the direction of the perpendicular bisector, a distance of 2\u221a3.\n\nWait, the distance between centers is 2\u221a3 along the perpendicular bisector.\n\nLet me compute the coordinates of O', the center of the BPC's circumcircle.\n\nThe direction vector is (\u221a3,1), which has length sqrt( (\u221a3)^2 +1^2 )=2,\n\nThus, to move a distance of 2\u221a3 along this direction from O(3,\u221a3):\n\nUnit vector in direction is (\u221a3/2, 1/2),\n\nThus, displacement vector: 2\u221a3*(\u221a3/2,1/2)= ( (2\u221a3*(\u221a3))/2, (2\u221a3*(1))/2 ) = ( (6)/2, \u221a3 ) = (3,\u221a3).\n\nThus, the center O' is O + displacement vector or O - displacement vector?\n\nSince the two centers are separated by 2\u221a3 along the perpendicular bisector, which direction?\n\nThe original center is O(3,\u221a3). The direction towards increasing x and y would be the direction of the perpendicular bisector beyond the triangle. Alternatively, since P is inside the triangle, maybe the center O' is on the opposite side.\n\nWait, the perpendicular bisector of BC goes from the midpoint (4.5, 1.5\u221a3) upwards and downwards. The center O is at (3,\u221a3), which is below the midpoint (since 3 <4.5 in x-coordinate and \u221a3 \u22481.732 <1.5\u221a3\u22482.598 in y). So to move along the perpendicular bisector away from the triangle, we go in the direction of the vector (\u221a3,1), which would take us to the right and upwards. Alternatively, the opposite direction would be (-\u221a3,-1), but that would go left and down, possibly outside.\n\nAlternatively, the displacement could be in either direction. Let's assume we go in the direction away from the triangle:\n\nThus, O' = O + displacement vector (3,\u221a3) + (3,\u221a3) = (6, 2\u221a3). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the displacement vector is (3,\u221a3). Adding to O(3,\u221a3) gives (6, 2\u221a3). But that point is outside the triangle, but perhaps that's the center.\n\nAlternatively, subtract the displacement: O' = O - displacement vector = (0,0). That's point A, which can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the displacement vector magnitude is 2\u221a3. The direction vector is (\u221a3,1) of length 2, so unit vector is (\u221a3/2, 1/2). Thus, moving a distance of 2\u221a3 along this direction:\n\nThe displacement vector components are (\u221a3/2 * 2\u221a3, 1/2 * 2\u221a3) = ( (\u221a3 *2\u221a3)/2, (\u221a3)/1 ),\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to compute as:\n\nDisplacement vector = unit vector * distance = (\u221a3/2,1/2) *2\u221a3 = (\u221a3/2 * 2\u221a3, (1/2)*2\u221a3 ) = ( ( (\u221a3)(2\u221a3) )/2, \u221a3 )\n\n= ( (2*3)/2, \u221a3 ) = (3,\u221a3).\n\nTherefore, moving from O(3,\u221a3) in the direction of (\u221a3,1) gives O' = (3+3, \u221a3 +\u221a3)= (6, 2\u221a3).\n\nAlternatively, moving in the opposite direction gives O'= (0,0), which is point A, but that can't be.\n\nThus, O' is at (6,2\u221a3).\n\nThus, the center of the BPC circumcircle is at (6,2\u221a3).\n\nThus, point P lies on this circle centered at (6,2\u221a3) with radius 2\u221a3,\n\nSo the equation is (x-6)^2 + (y -2\u221a3)^2 = (2\u221a3)^2=12.\n\nAlso, point P is inside the original triangle ABC, so its coordinates must satisfy the triangle's boundaries.\n\nNow, we can find the intersection of the two circles: the circumcircle of BPC (center (6,2\u221a3), radius 2\u221a3) and the original circumcircle of ABC (center (3,\u221a3), radius 2\u221a3). Their intersection points are B and C, and two other points?\n\nWait, the two circles have centers 2\u221a3 apart (distance between centers is sqrt( (6-3)^2 + (2\u221a3 -\u221a3)^2 )= sqrt(9 + (\u221a3)^2)=sqrt(9+3)=sqrt(12)=2\u221a3). Thus, the distance between centers is equal to the radius, so the circles intersect at two points.\n\nThe two circles intersect where?\n\nThe line connecting their centers is from (3,\u221a3) to (6,2\u221a3), which is the vector (3,\u221a3). The points of intersection can be found by solving the equations:\n\n1. (x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2=12,\n\n2. (x-6)^2 + (y -2\u221a3)^2=12.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x-6)^2 - (x-3)^2 + (y-2\u221a3)^2 - (y -\u221a3)^2 =0,\n\nExpand each term:\n\n(x\u00b2 -12x +36) - (x\u00b2 -6x +9) + (y\u00b2 -4\u221a3 y +12) - (y\u00b2 -2\u221a3 y +3) =0,\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 -12x +36 -x\u00b2 +6x -9 + y\u00b2 -4\u221a3 y +12 -y\u00b2 +2\u221a3 y -3 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-6x +27) + (-2\u221a3 y +9) =0,\n\nThus:\n\n-6x -2\u221a3 y +36 =0,\n\nDivide by -2:\n\n3x +\u221a3 y =18,\n\nWait, but earlier when we had the radical axis for the two circles involving AP and ABC, we had 3x +\u221a3 y =12.5, but here it's 3x +\u221a3 y =18.\n\nHmm, but this equation is the radical axis of the two circumcircles (ABC and BPC), so their intersection points lie on this line. The points B and C are common to both circles, so substituting B(6,0):\n\n3*6 +\u221a3*0=18, which holds.\n\nPoint C(3,3\u221a3):\n\n3*3 +\u221a3*(3\u221a3)=9 + 3*3=9+9=18, yes. So the radical axis is the line BC itself. Which makes sense because B and C are common points.\n\nWait, but then the other intersection points would also be on BC, but BC is a chord common to both circles. Thus, the two circles intersect at B and C only. But that contradicts the earlier distance between centers being equal to the radius, which usually would imply two intersection points. Wait, but since the two circles have centers separated by 2\u221a3 and both have radius 2\u221a3, they intersect at two points along the line connecting the centers? Wait, no, the distance between centers is equal to the radius, so they intersect at two points where the angle between the centers is 60\u00b0, forming an equilateral triangle?\n\nWait, the two centers are 2\u221a3 apart, each radius 2\u221a3, so triangle formed by centers and any intersection point is equilateral, so the angle between them is 60\u00b0, so the intersection points are at 60\u00b0 from each center.\n\nThus, there are two points besides B and C where the circles intersect? Wait, but B and C are already on both circles.\n\nHmm, perhaps the only intersections are B and C. Let me check by plugging in another point.\n\nSuppose a point not on BC, say the midpoint between the centers?\n\nThe midpoint between (3,\u221a3) and (6,2\u221a3) is (4.5, 1.5\u221a3), which is the midpoint of BC. Which is on BC.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the two circles only intersect at B and C. Therefore, the only points common to both circumcircles are B and C. Thus, our earlier assumption that there's another intersection point for P is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but the point P is inside the triangle, so it must be one of the centers? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the center of the BPC circumcircle.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the center O'.\n\nThe two circles (ABC and BPC) have centers separated by distance 2\u221a3, each with radius 2\u221a3. The radical axis is the line BC, so the only intersections are B and C.\n\nTherefore, the circumcircle of BPC coincides with the circumcircle of ABC only at B and C. Thus, point P must be another point such that it's on the circumcircle of BPC (which is different from ABC's?), but earlier calculations said the radius is the same.\n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that the circumradius of BPC is 2\u221a3 is correct, but the center is different.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the circumradius of BPC.\n\nLaw of Sines: R = BC/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is angle at P (120\u00b0).\n\nSo R=6/(2 sin 120\u00b0)=6/(2*(\u221a3/2))= 6/\u221a3=2\u221a3, correct.\n\nThus the circumcircle of BPC has center O' such that:\n\nDistance from O' to B and C is 2\u221a3,\n\n and distance between O and O' is 2\u221a3.\n\nBut then the only points are B and C.\n\nThus P must be on the arc BPC of its circumcircle not overlapping with ABC's.\n\nBut since P is inside ABC, then the arc must be the one not containing A.\n\nHmm, so the point P is on the circumcircle of BPC, which passes through B and C and has radius 2\u221a3, but is centered such that P is inside ABC.\n\nWait, perhaps the center O' is located such that the circle passes through B, C, and P inside the triangle.\n\nLet me try to find coordinates for O'.\n\nThe center O' must be located such that it is equidistant (2\u221a3) from B(6,0) and C(3,3\u221a3), and also the distance between O and O' is 2\u221a3.\n\nThe set of points equidistant from B and C lie on the perpendicular bisector of BC, which we've established is the line y -1.5\u221a3 = (1/\u221a3)(x -4.5).\n\nThe center O' must be on this line and at distance 2\u221a3 from O(3,\u221a3).\n\nLet me parametrize the perpendicular bisector.\n\nLet me use a parameter t such that moving along the perpendicular bisector from midpoint M(4.5,1.5\u221a3).\n\nThe direction vector is (\u221a3,1) as before (since the slope is 1/\u221a3).\n\nThus, any point on the line can be written as:\n\nx =4.5 + t*\u221a3,\n\ny=1.5\u221a3 + t*1,\n\nThe distance from this point to O(3,\u221a3) must be 2\u221a3.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (4.5 + t\u221a3 -3)^2 + (1.5\u221a3 +t -\u221a3)^2 ) =2\u221a3,\n\nSimplify inside:\n\nx-coordinate difference: 1.5 + t\u221a3,\n\ny-coordinate difference: 0.5\u221a3 + t,\n\nSquare terms:\n\n(1.5 + t\u221a3)^2 + (0.5\u221a3 +t)^2 = (2\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nExpand:\n\n(2.25 + 3t\u221a3 + 3t\u00b2) + (0.75 + t\u221a3 + t\u00b2)=12,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2.25+0.75=3,\n\n3t\u221a3 + t\u221a3=4t\u221a3,\n\n3t\u00b2 +t\u00b2=4t\u00b2,\n\nThus:\n\n4t\u00b2 +4t\u221a3 +3=12,\n\n4t\u00b2 +4t\u221a3 -9=0,\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = [ -4\u221a3 \u00b1 sqrt( (4\u221a3)^2 -4*4*(-9) ) ]/(2*4),\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(16*3) + 144=48+144=192,\n\nsqrt(192)=8\u221a3,\n\nThus,\n\nt= [ -4\u221a3 \u00b18\u221a3 ]/8,\n\nTwo solutions:\n\nt=(4\u221a3)/8= (\u221a3)/2,\n\nt=(-12\u221a3)/8= (-3\u221a3)/2,\n\nThus, the centers are at t=\u221a3/2 and t=-3\u221a3/2.\n\nFirst solution, t=\u221a3/2,\n\nCoordinates:\n\nx=4.5 + (\u221a3/2)*\u221a3=4.5 + (3/2)=4.5+1.5=6,\n\ny=1.5\u221a3 + \u221a3/2= (3\u221a3/2 +\u221a3/2)= 4\u221a3/2=2\u221a3,\n\nWhich is the earlier O'=(6,2\u221a3).\n\nSecond solution, t= -3\u221a3/2,\n\nx=4.5 + (-3\u221a3/2)*\u221a3=4.5 - (9/2)=4.5-4.5=0,\n\ny=1.5\u221a3 + (-3\u221a3/2)= (3\u221a3/2 -3\u221a3/2)=0,\n\nThus, the other center is at (0,0), which is point A.\n\nThus, the two possible centers are O'=(6,2\u221a3) and (0,0).\n\nThe center at (0,0) would mean the circumcircle of BPC is centered at A with radius 2\u221a3, but distance from A to B is 6, which is greater than 2\u221a3\u22483.464, so that's impossible. Thus only valid center is O'=(6,2\u221a3).\n\nThus, the circumcircle of BPC is centered at (6,2\u221a3) with radius 2\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, point P must lie on this circle and inside triangle ABC.\n\nThe equation of this circle is (x-6)^2 + (y-2\u221a3)^2=12.\n\nNow, to find point P inside ABC such that it is on this circle, and also such that the circle with diameter AP passes through X (on circumcircle of ABC with AX=5).\n\nNow, we can set up the equations.\n\nWe have point X on both circumcircle of ABC and circle with diameter AP.\n\nWe also have point P on the circumcircle of BPC.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of P as (p_x,p_y), lying on (x-6)^2 + (y-2\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nAlso, the circle with diameter AP has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y=0,\n\nAnd X is a common point (other than A(0,0)) of both this circle and ABC's circumcircle.\n\nAdditionally, AX=5 implies that the coordinates of X satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\nAnd lie on ABC's circumcircle: (x-3)^2 + (y-\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nAs we had before, this gives the radical line 3x +\u221a3 y =12.5,\n\nWait, but earlier when we derived the radical axis between the two circles (AP's circle and ABC's circumcircle), we found 3x +\u221a3 y =12.5,\n\nBut the radical axis between the BPC's circle and ABC's circle was 3x +\u221a3 y=18,\n\nSo point X must lie on both the radical axis of AP's circle and ABC's circle (3x +\u221a3 y=12.5) and also on the radical axis of BPC's circle and ABC's circle (3x +\u221a3 y=18),\n\nBut this would require that the two lines intersect at X, but 12.5\u226018, so they are parallel? No, they are two different lines with the same slope?\n\nWait, the two radical axes have the same coefficients for x and y, hence they are parallel if their constants differ.\n\nIndeed, 3x +\u221a3 y =12.5 and 3x +\u221a3 y=18 are parallel lines, so they don't intersect unless they are the same line, which they are not. Therefore, there is no common point X that lies on both radical axes unless X is at infinity, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction, meaning my assumptions are incorrect.\n\nWait, but X is supposed to be on both the circumcircle of ABC and the circle with diameter AP. The radical axis for those two circles is 3x +\u221a3 y=12.5,\n\nMeanwhile, point P is on the circumcircle of BPC (centered at (6,2\u221a3)), which has radical axis with ABC's circle as 3x +\u221a3 y=18,\n\nThus, for point X to exist, it must lie on both radical axes, but they are parallel and distinct, so no solution.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency, meaning my previous steps have an error.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says such a point X exists, so my error must be in calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the radical axis between ABC's circumcircle and the circle with diameter AP.\n\nThe ABC's circle: (x-3)^2 + (y-\u221a3)^2 =12,\n\nCircle with diameter AP: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y=0,\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\nExpand ABC's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -6x +9 + y\u00b2 -2y\u221a3 +3 =12,\n\nThus, x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nSubtract the circle with diameter AP equation (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y)=0,\n\nResult: (-6x -2y\u221a3) - (-p_x x -p_y y)=0,\n\nWhich is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y =0,\n\nThus, the radical axis is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y =0,\n\nEarlier I had a different expression, but that was because I might have miscalculated.\n\nWait, previously I had:\n\nThe two equations:\n\n1. (x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2 =12,\n\n2. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x - p_y y =0,\n\nSubtract 2 from 1:\n\n(x\u00b2 -6x +9 + y\u00b2 -2y\u221a3 +3) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - p_x x -p_y y)=12 -0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-6x -2y\u221a3 +12 + p_x x + p_y y =0,\n\nThus,\n\n(p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12=0,\n\nAh, I missed the constant term earlier.\n\nSo the radical axis equation is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12 =0,\n\nThis line must pass through point X, which is also on both circles.\n\nSimilarly, the radical axis between ABC's and BPC's circumcircles is 3x +\u221a3 y=18,\n\nSo point X must lie on both radical axes:\n\n1. (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12 =0,\n\n2. 3x +\u221a3 y =18,\n\nAlso, X is on the circumcircle of ABC: (x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nAnd on the circle with diameter AP: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y=0,\n\nAdditionally, AX=5: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\nThis system of equations needs to be solved.\n\nThis is quite complex, but perhaps substituting variables.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of X as (x,y),\n\nFrom AX=5: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\nFrom circumcircle of ABC:\n\n(x-3)^2 + (y -\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nWhich expands to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 +12=12,\n\nUsing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\n25 -6x -2y\u221a3 +12=12,\n\nThus,\n\n-6x -2y\u221a3 +25=0,\n\nWhich gives,\n\n6x +2y\u221a3 =25,\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n3x +\u221a3 y =12.5,\n\nSo that's the equation we had earlier.\n\nThus, coordinates of X must satisfy 3x +\u221a3 y=12.5,\n\nAlso, they must satisfy the radical axis equation with the AP circle:\n\n(p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12 =0,\n\nBut since P is on BPC's circle: (p_x-6)^2 + (p_y-2\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nAdditionally, the circle with diameter AP must pass through X, so:\n\nX lies on it, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y=0,\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25,\n\nThus, 25 -p_x x -p_y y=0 \u21d2 p_x x +p_y y=25,\n\nSo we have:\n\nEquation (a): p_x x + p_y y =25,\n\nEquation (b): (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12 =0,\n\nLet me substitute p_x from (a) into (b):\n\nFrom (a): p_x = (25 -p_y y)/x,\n\nPlug into (b):\n\n[( (25 -p_y y)/x -6 )x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12 =0,\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: [ (25 -p_y y)/x -6 ]x =25 -p_y y -6x,\n\nSecond term: (p_y -2\u221a3)y =p_y y -2\u221a3 y,\n\nThus, total equation:\n\n25 -p_y y -6x +p_y y -2\u221a3 y +12 =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n25 -6x -2\u221a3 y +12 =0,\n\nThus,\n\n-6x -2\u221a3 y +37=0,\n\nBut from earlier, we have 3x +\u221a3 y=12.5 \u21d2 -6x -2\u221a3 y= -25.\n\nThus, substituting into the equation:\n\n-25 +37=12=0,\n\nWait, 12=0? That can't be.\n\nThis results in 12=0, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency, indicating that our assumptions have a mistake.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. It implies that with the given conditions, there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps my mistake is in the radical axis calculation.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nThe radical axis between the two circles (ABC and AP's circle):\n\nABC's equation expanded: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nAP's circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y =0,\n\nSubtracting the two equations gives:\n\n(-6x -2y\u221a3) - (-p_x x -p_y y)=0,\n\nWhich is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y -0=0?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, ABC's equation after expanding is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3 =0,\n\nAP's circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y =0,\n\nSubtracting the second from the first:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -6x -2y\u221a3) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -p_x x -p_y y)=0,\n\nThus, (-6x -2y\u221a3) - (-p_x x -p_y y)=0,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-6 + p_x)x + (-2\u221a3 + p_y)y =0,\n\nThus, radical axis is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y =0,\n\nNot (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y +12=0,\n\nAh, I must have made a mistake earlier by incorrectly expanding.\n\nThus the correct radical axis equation is (p_x -6)x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y =0,\n\nThen repeating the substitution:\n\nFrom equation (a): p_x x +p_y y=25,\n\nExpress p_x = (25 -p_y y)/x,\n\nSubstitute into radical axis equation:\n\n[(25 -p_y y)/x -6]x + (p_y -2\u221a3)y =0,\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n25 -p_y y -6x + p_y y -2\u221a3 y =0,\n\nCancel terms:\n\n25 -6x -2\u221a3 y=0,\n\nWhich is exactly the equation from the circumcircle and AX=5 radical axis: 3x +\u221a3 y=12.5 \u21d2 multiplied by 2 gives 6x +2\u221a3 y=25 \u21d2 -6x -2\u221a3 y= -25 \u21d2 25-25=0 \u21d2 0=0.\n\nWait, so it reduces to 25 - (6x +2\u221a3 y)=0,\n\nBut 6x +2\u221a3 y=25 is exactly the equation derived from AX=5 and ABC's circumcircle.\n\nThus, the radical axis equation is automatically satisfied given that X is on both circles.\n\nTherefore, the condition is consistent.\n\nThus, there's no contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the previous steps were correct, and the equations are consistent.\n\nThus, to find P, we need to solve:\n\n1.

p_y y)/x ]^2 + p_y\u00b2,\n\nThis expression must be minimized or found such that it also satisfies the circle equation.\n\nThis is too involved without further insight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that XP= sqrt(AP\u00b2-25)= sqrt( (something) ),\n\nGiven AX=5 and ABC equilateral side 6,\n\nThe distance from A to the circumcircle is 2\u221a3,\n\nAX is 5 which is less than the diameter, so valid.\n\nThe answer is likely sqrt(11) or sqrt(23),\n\nBut let me think differently.\n\nIf AX=5 and ABC has circumradius 2\u221a3\u22483.464\uff0c but AX is a chord of length5,\n\nThe central angle is 2 arcsin(5/(2*2\u221a3))=2 arcsin(5/(4\u221a3))\u22482*arcsin(0.72)=2*46\u00b0=92\u00b0,\n\nThus, the arc length is 92\u00b0,\n\nThus, the point X is located such that the angle from A is 92\u00b0,\n\nThus, the coordinates can be written in terms of cosine and sine of 46\u00b0,\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangle APX,\n\nAP/sin(90\u00b0)=AX/sin(angle APX),\n\nWait, but angle at X is 90\u00b0,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= AX/cos(angle at P),\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is sqrt( AP\u00b2 -25 ),\n\nAnd from the Power of a Point PA * PX=PB*PC,\n\nAnd from triangle BPC,\n\nPB\u00b2 + PC\u00b2 +PB*PC=36,\n\nLet me assume that PB=PC,\n\nThen,\n\n2PB\u00b2 +PB\u00b2=36 \u21d23PB\u00b2=36 \u21d2PB=2\u221a3,\n\nThus,\n\nPB*PC= (2\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nThus,\n\nPA * PX=12,\n\nAnd from triangle BPC,\n\nAP^2 = (PB)^2 + (PC)^2 - 2 PB PC cos(angle BPC),\n\nWait, angle BPC is 120\u00b0,\n\nThus,\n\nAP\u00b2 = PB\u00b2 + PC\u00b2 - 2 PB PC cos(120\u00b0),\n\nIf PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nThen,\n\nAP\u00b2= (12 +12) - 2*(12)*(-0.5)=24 +12=36,\n\nThus AP=6,\n\nThus,\n\nPA * PX=6 * PX=12 \u21d2PX=2,\n\nThus, this is a possible solution,\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.\n\nAh! This is possible.\n\nIf PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nThen angle BPC=120\u00b0,\n\nThus, triangle BPC is equilateral? No, because angle is 120\u00b0,\n\nWait, if PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nThen in triangle BPC with sides PB=PC=2\u221a3, BC=6,\n\nUsing Law of Cosines,\n\nBC\u00b2=PB\u00b2+PC\u00b2 -2 PB PC cos(120\u00b0),\n\n6\u00b2= (2\u221a3)^2 + (2\u221a3)^2 -2*(2\u221a3)^2 *(-0.5),\n\n36= 12+12 -2*(12)*(-0.5),\n\n=24 +12=36,\n\nYes! This works.\n\nThus, this is a valid case.\n\nThus, in this case, PA=6,\n\nThus, XP= sqrt(6\u00b2 -5\u00b2)=sqrt(11),\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait, AP=6,\n\nAX=5,\n\nSo XP= sqrt(AP\u00b2 -AX\u00b2)=sqrt(36-25)=sqrt(11),\n\nAh, so XP=\u221a11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{11}}.\n\nBut why did the approximate calculation give around1.3? Because in that case I assumed P was the centroid, but in this scenario P is such that PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nCoordinates of P would be the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A?\n\nWait, in an equilateral triangle, if PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nThen P is located such that it's on the perpendicular bisector of BC,\n\nCoordinates of midpoint of BC is (4.5, 1.5\u221a3),\n\nThe perpendicular bisector direction is (\u221a3,1),\n\nThus, moving from midpoint along direction ( sqrt(3),1 ) scaled to distance,\n\nPB=2\u221a3,\n\nThe distance from midpoint to P is sqrt( (PB)^2 - (BC/2)^2 )?\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, coordinates:\n\nLet me compute coordinates of P such that PB=PC=2\u221a3,\n\nLet me denote P as (x,y),\n\nThen,\n\nPB\u00b2=(x-6)^2 +y\u00b2= (2\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nPC\u00b2=(x-3)^2 + (y -3\u221a3)^2=12,\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n(x-6)^2 - (x-3)^2 + y\u00b2 - (y -3\u221a3)^2=0,\n\nExpand:\n\n(x\u00b2-12x+36) - (x\u00b2-6x+9) + y\u00b2 - (y\u00b2 -6\u221a3 y

y\u00b2=12,\n\nExpand:\n\n3y\u00b2 -12\u221a3 y +36 +y\u00b2=12,\n\n4y\u00b2 -12\u221a3 y +24=0,\n\nDivide by 4:\n\ny\u00b2 -3\u221a3 y +6=0,\n\nSolutions:\n\ny=(3\u221a3 \u00b1\u221a(27-24))/2=(3\u221a3 \u00b1\u221a3)/2,\n\nThus,\n\ny=(4\u221a3)/2=2\u221a3 or y=(2\u221a3)/2=\u221a3,\n\nThus,\n\nWhen y=2\u221a3,\n\nx=\u221a3*(2\u221a3)=6,\n\nThus, P is (6,2\u221a3), which is the center of the BPC's circumcircle, but that\u2019s outside the triangle.\n\nWhen y=\u221a3,\n\nx=\u221a3*(\u221a3)=3,\n\nThus, P is (3,\u221a3), the centroid.\n\nWait, but the centroid gives angle BPC= 120\u00b0, but as checked earlier, leads to XP imaginary.\n\nAh, the issue is that when PB=PC=2\u221a3, the point P at (3,\u221a3) (centroid) gives AP= distance from (0,0) to (3,\u221a3)=\u221a(9+3)=\u221a12=2\u221a3\u22483.464,\n\nThus,\n\nXP= sqrt(AP\u00b2 -AX\u00b2)=sqrt(12-25)=sqrt(-13), which is impossible,\n\nThus, the other solution is at (6,2\u221a3), which is outside the triangle,\n\nThus, this case is invalid.\n\nHmm, so this approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but the equations allowed PB=PC=2\u221a3, but the points are outside or give negative distances.\n\nThus, perhaps my assumption of PB=PC is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach.\n\nAssume that the Power of a Point gives PA * PX = PB * PC,\n\nAnd from the Law of

=a*b,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =36 -t,\n\nAlso,\n\n(a +b)^2 =a\u00b2 +2ab +b\u00b2=36 -t +2t=36 +t,\n\nThus,\n\na +b=\u221a(36+t),\n\nAlso, from AM \u2265 GM,\n\n(a +b)/2 \u2265\u221a(ab),\n\nThus,\n\n\u221a(36 +t)/2 \u2265\u221at,\n\nSquare both sides,\n\n(36 +t)/4 \u2265t,\n\n36 +t \u22654t,\n\n36 \u22653t,\n\nt \u226412,\n\nThus,\n\nt \u226412,\n\nAlso,\n\nt =a*b =k*sqrt(25 +k\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\nk*sqrt(25 +k\u00b2) \u226412,\n\nSquare both sides,\n\nk\u00b2(25 +k\u00b2) \u2264144,\n\nLet me let k\u00b2 =m,\n\nThus,\n\nm(25 +m) \u2264144,\n\n25m +m\u00b2 \u2264144,\n\nm\u00b2 +25m -144 \u22640,\n\nSolve m\u00b2 +25m -144=0,\n\nSolutions:\n\nm=(-25 \u00b1\u221a(625 +576))/2=(-25\u00b1\u221a1201)/2,\n\nPositive solution:\n\nm=(-25+34.66)/2\u22489.66/2\u22484.83,\n\nThus,\n\nm \u22644.83,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 \u22644.83,\n\nThus,\n\nk \u22642.2,\n\nThus, the maximum possible XP is about 2.2,\n\nThus,\n\nPA * PX= t \u226412,\n\nThus,\n\nPA= sqrt(25 +k\u00b2) \u2264sqrt(25 +4.83)=sqrt(29.83)=5.46,\n\nThus,\n\nPA * PX \u22645.46*2.2\u224812,\n\nWhich matches t\u226412,\n\nThus, to find an exact solution,\n\nLet me assume that k= sqrt(11),\n\nThen,\n\nk*sqrt(25 +11)=sqrt(11)*sqrt(36)=6\u221a11\u224819.9>12,\n\nToo big,\n\nTry k=2,\n\nk*sqrt(25+4)=2*sqrt(29)=10.78,\n\nClose to 12,\n\nThus,\n\nt=10.78,\n\nThus,\n\na*b=10.78,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2=36 -10.78=25.22,\n\nThus,\n\n(a +b)^2=25.22+21.56=46.78,\n\na +b\u22486.84,\n\nThus,\n\nPossible values,\n\nBut this is still approximate.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require recognizing that in an equilateral triangle with side 6, the length from A to X is 5,\n\nThe distance from A to the circumcircle is 2\u221a3\u22483.464,\n\nThus, point X is outside the circumradius, but AX=5,\n\nWait, no, the circumradius is 2\u221a3\u22483.464,\n\nThus, AX=5 exceeds the diameter of the circumcircle (\u22486.928),\n\nThus, AX=5 is possible,\n\nWait, the maximum distance between two points on the circumcircle is the diameter,\n\nWhich is 4\u221a3\u22486.928,\n\nThus, AX=5 is possible.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the time I've spent, I think the answer is sqrt(11).\n\nBut in the earlier case when I assumed PB=PC=2\u221a3, the calculation led to sqrt(11), even though the point was the centroid but with an imaginary XP, but perhaps there's another configuration.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the exact value using the quadratic solution.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nAP^2 = d\u00b2,\n\nPA * PX= d * sqrt(d\u00b2-25)=a*b,\n\nAnd,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +ab=36,\n\nBut using the previous approach where the Power of point gives PA * PX = PB * PC = m,\n\nAnd from the quadratic equation for P_y,\n\nWe had p_y\u22484.444,\n\nThen AP\u22485.166,\n\nThus,\n\n XP\u2248sqrt(5.166\u00b2 -25)=sqrt(26.68-25)=sqrt(1.68)=1.3,\n\nThis doesn't match sqrt(11),\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires an exact solution via trigonometric identities,\n\nGiven angle BPC=120\u00b0,\n\nUsing the Law of Sines in BPC,\n\nPB/sin(angle BCP)=PC/sin(angle CBP)=6/sin120\u00b0,\n\nLet angle CBP=\u03b8,\n\nThen angle BCP=60\u00b0-\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\nPB=6 sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8)/sin120\u00b0,\n\nPC=6 sin\u03b8/sin120\u00b0,\n\nThus,\n\nPB=6 sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8)/(\u221a3/2)= (12/\u221a3) sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPC= (12/\u221a3) sin\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\nPB*PC= (144/3) sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8) sin\u03b8=48 sin\u03b8 sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8),\n\nAnd,\n\nPA * PX=PB*PC=48 sin\u03b8 sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8),\n\nAlso,\n\nIn triangle APX,\n\nPA\u00b2=25 +PX\u00b2,\n\nPA * PX=48 sin\u03b8 sin(60\u00b0-\u03b8),\n\nLet",
