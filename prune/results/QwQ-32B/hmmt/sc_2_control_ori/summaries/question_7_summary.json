      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers that satisfies two equations. The first one is 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) = 4(c\u00b2 +1), and the second is ab + bc + ca = 1. Then I need to compute a + b + c. Hmm, seems a bit involved, but let's tackle it step by step.\n\nFirst, the first equation is saying that all three expressions are equal: 2(a\u00b2 +1), 3(b\u00b2 +1), and 4(c\u00b2 +1) are all the same number. Let me call that common value k. So, I can write:\n\n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n4(c\u00b2 +1) = k\n\nThat way, each variable can be expressed in terms of k. Let me solve each equation for the variables:\n\nStarting with the first equation:  \n2(a\u00b2 +1) = k \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (k/2) - 1 \u21d2 a = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]  \nSimilarly, for the second equation:  \n3(b\u00b2 +1) = k \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (k/3) - 1 \u21d2 b = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]  \nAnd the third equation:  \n4(c\u00b2 +1) = k \u21d2 c\u00b2 = (k/4) - 1 \u21d2 c = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]\n\nSince a, b, c are positive real numbers, the expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative. Therefore:\n\n(k/2) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 2  \n(k/3) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 3  \n(k/4) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 4\n\nSo the smallest k can be is 4, right? Because k has to satisfy all three inequalities. So k must be at least 4. Hmm, but maybe the equations will give us a specific k?\n\nNow, the second equation is ab + bc + ca = 1. Since we have a, b, c in terms of k, maybe substitute those expressions into the second equation and solve for k?\n\nLet me write down the expressions again:\n\na = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]  \nb = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]  \nc = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]\n\nSo, ab + bc + ca = 1. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, ab = \u221a[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)]  \nSimilarly, bc = \u221a[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)]  \nAnd ca = \u221a[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)]\n\nThis looks complicated because of the square roots. Maybe squaring both sides? But the equation is ab + bc + ca =1, so squaring would lead to cross terms, which might not be helpful. Hmm, perhaps another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables in terms of k and then use substitution. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2. Then, the first equations become:\n\n2(x +1) = 3(y +1) = 4(z +1) = k\n\nSo, from here, we can express x, y, z in terms of k:\n\nx = (k/2) -1  \ny = (k/3) -1  \nz = (k/4) -1\n\nNow, since a, b, c are positive, x, y, z must be non-negative, so k must be \u22654 as before.\n\nThe second equation is ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nBut since a = \u221ax, b = \u221ay, c = \u221az, so the equation becomes:\n\n\u221a(x y) + \u221a(y z) + \u221a(z x) =1\n\nHmm, so now we have this equation in terms of x, y, z which are in terms of k. Let me substitute x, y, z:\n\nFirst, let me compute each term:\n\n\u221a(x y) = \u221a[( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )]  \n\u221a(y z) = \u221a[( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )]  \n\u221a(z x) = \u221a[( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )]\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\u221a[( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )] + \u221a[( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )] + \u221a[( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )] =1\n\nThis looks quite messy. Maybe there's a better substitution here? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set all those expressions equal to each other first. Since 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k, maybe set ratios between a, b, c?\n\nWait, let me see if I can express variables in terms of each other. Let me consider ratios.\n\nLet me denote 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1). So,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 2a\u00b2 + 2 = 3b\u00b2 +3 \u21d2 2a\u00b2 -3b\u00b2 =1\n\nSimilarly, 3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 3b\u00b2 +3 =4c\u00b2 +4 \u21d2 3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 =1\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n\n2a\u00b2 -3b\u00b2 =1  \n3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 =1\n\nMaybe we can set variables here. Let me see.\n\nFrom the first equation: 2a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (3b\u00b2 +1)/2  \nFrom the second equation: 3b\u00b2 =4c\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (4c\u00b2 +1)/3\n\nSo, substitute b\u00b2 into the expression for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 = [3*( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) +1 ] /2 = [ (4c\u00b2 +1) +1 ] /2 = (4c\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2c\u00b2 +1\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 = 2c\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 a = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1)\n\nHmm, so now we can express a in terms of c, and b in terms of c as well.\n\nFrom above, b\u00b2 = (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 \u21d2 b = sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nSo, now, we can write a and b in terms of c, and then plug into the equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me write down the expressions again:\n\na = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1)  \nb = sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nc = c\n\nThen, compute ab, bc, and ca.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nab = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) = sqrt( [ (2c\u00b2 +1)(4c\u00b2 +1) ] / 3 )\n\nbc = sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) * c = c * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nca = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1) * c = c * sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1)\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( [ (2c\u00b2 +1)(4c\u00b2 +1) ] / 3 ) + c * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + c * sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1) =1\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe let\u2019s set t = c\u00b2? Let me try substituting t = c\u00b2, so c = sqrt(t). Then:\n\nLet me denote t = c\u00b2, so c = sqrt(t). Then,\n\nab term:\n\nsqrt( [ (2t +1)(4t +1) ] / 3 )\n\nbc term:\n\nsqrt(t) * sqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) = sqrt( t*(4t +1)/3 )\n\nca term:\n\nsqrt(t) * sqrt(2t +1) = sqrt( t*(2t +1) )\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (2t+1)(4t+1)/3 ) + sqrt( t(4t +1)/3 ) + sqrt( t(2t +1) ) =1\n\nHmm, this is still quite messy. Maybe another substitution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that k is an integer? Since the problem states that the triple is unique, maybe there is a nice value for k. Let's see.\n\nWe know that k must be at least 4. Let me try some integer values for k and see if the equation ab + bc + ca =1 holds.\n\nLet me try k=4 first.\n\nIf k=4,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 = (4/2) -1 = 2 -1 =1 \u21d2 a=1  \nb\u00b2 = (4/3) -1 = 1/3 \u21d2 b=1/\u221a3 \u22480.577  \nc\u00b2 = (4/4) -1 =0 \u21d2 c=0\n\nBut c must be a positive real number, so c=0 is invalid. So k=4 is too small.\n\nNext, k=5.\n\na\u00b2=(5/2)-1= 1.5 \u21d2 a\u22481.225  \nb\u00b2=(5/3)-1\u22480.666 \u21d2 b\u22480.816  \nc\u00b2=(5/4)-1=0.25 \u21d2 c=0.5\n\nThen compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab\u22481.225 *0.816\u22481.0  \nbc\u22480.816 *0.5\u22480.408  \nca\u22481.225 *0.5\u22480.6125  \nTotal\u22481.0+0.408+0.6125\u22482.02, which is way over 1.\n\nHmm, so k=5 is too big? Wait, but the total is 2.02, which is larger than 1. Hmm, maybe higher k?\n\nWait, but if k increases, then a, b, c all increase? Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, a\u00b2 = (k/2) -1, so as k increases, a increases. Similarly, b and c also increase. So perhaps when k increases, the terms ab, bc, ca would also increase, so maybe the value of ab + bc + ca would be higher. Since at k=4, c=0 and the sum would be ab +0 +0. Let me check k=4 again.\n\nWait, at k=4, c=0, so then the sum ab + bc + ca = ab +0 +0. So a=1, b= sqrt(1/3), so ab\u22481*0.577\u22480.577 which is less than 1. So maybe the correct k is between 4 and 5? Because at k=4, the sum is ~0.577, at k=5, ~2.02. Wait, but the problem says the equations have a unique solution. Maybe I need to set up an equation in terms of k and solve for k?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of k and set up the equation.\n\nLet me write the terms again:\n\nab + bc + ca =1\n\nExpressed in terms of k:\n\nab = sqrt( ( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) )\n\nSimilarly, the other terms. Let me see if I can write this equation in terms of k and solve for k.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1):\n\nMultiply them out: (k/2)(k/3) -k/2 -k/3 +1 = (k\u00b2)/(6) - (5k)/6 +1\n\nSimilarly, (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) = (k\u00b2)/(12) - (7k)/12 +1\n\nAnd (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) = (k\u00b2)/8 - (3k)/4 +1\n\nWait, perhaps instead of computing the products, maybe keep them as separate terms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define variables to simplify:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set u = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nv = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nw = sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )\n\nThen the equation is u + v + w =1\n\nBut I don\u2019t know if that helps. Maybe we can square both sides?\n\nLet me consider squaring the equation:\n\n(u + v + w)^2 = 1^2 \u21d2 u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + 2(uv + uw + vw) =1\n\nBut u\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nv\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)\n\nw\u00b2 = (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)\n\nTherefore, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) + (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) + (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLet me factor out (k/3 -1) from the first two terms:\n\n= (k/3 -1)[ (k/2 -1) + (k/4 -1) ] + (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)\n\nLet me compute the terms inside:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: (k/2 -1) + (k/4 -1) = (3k/4 -2)\n\nThus, first part: (k/3 -1)(3k/4 -2) + (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe expanding all terms:\n\nLet me expand each product term:\n\nFirst term: (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = (k\u00b2/6 - k/2 -k/3 +1) = (k\u00b2/6 - (5k)/6 +1)\n\nSecond term: (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) = (k\u00b2/12 -k/3 -k/4 +1) = (k\u00b2/12 - (7k)/12 +1)\n\nThird term: (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) = (k\u00b2/8 -k/4 -k/2 +1) = (k\u00b2/8 - (3k)/4 +1)\n\nAdding all three:\n\nFirst term: k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1  \nSecond term: k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1  \nThird term: k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1\n\nAdding together:\n\nk\u00b2 terms: 1/6 +1/12 +1/8  \nLet me compute denominators: 1/6 is 4/24, 1/12 is 2/24, 1/8 is 3/24 \u21d2 total 4+2+3=9 \u21d2 9/24 = 3/8\n\nSimilarly, the k terms:\n\n-5/6 -7/12 -3/4  \nConvert to twelfths: -10/12 -7/12 -9/12 = (-26)/12 = -13/6\n\nConstants: 1+1+1=3\n\nSo total u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 +w\u00b2= (3/8)k\u00b2 - (13/6)k +3\n\nNow, the cross terms: 2(uv + uw + vw)\n\nHmm, need to compute uv, uw, vw.\n\nCompute uv first:\n\nuv = sqrt[ (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) * (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) ]\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, u = sqrt(A), v = sqrt(B), so uv = sqrt(A*B). Let me compute each product:\n\nuv: sqrt( ( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )*( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) ) = (k/3 -1)*sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nWait, actually, maybe better to write:\n\nuv = sqrt{ [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] * [(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] }  \n= (k/3 -1) * sqrt{ (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) }\n\nSimilarly,\n\nuw = sqrt{ [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] * [(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)] }  \n= (k/2 -1)*sqrt{ (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) }\n\nAnd vw = sqrt{ [(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] * [(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)] }  \n= (k/4 -1)*sqrt{ (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) }\n\nHmm, so each cross term has a common factor. This is getting too involved. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nPerhaps another strategy: Let me assume that a, b, c are related in some proportion. Since the equations 2(a\u00b2+1)=3(b\u00b2+1)=4(c\u00b2+1)=k, maybe set variables to be proportional to 2, 3, 4? Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables substitution.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set variables such that:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) =4(c\u00b2 +1)=k. Let me set each of these equal to k as before. So, I can write:\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2) -1  \nb\u00b2 = (k/3) -1  \nc\u00b2 = (k/4) -1\n\nLet me call these equations (1), (2), (3).\n\nAlso, the second equation is ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me see if I can write everything in terms of a single variable. Let me pick one variable, say, c, and express a and b in terms of c, then plug into the equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nFrom equation (3), c\u00b2 = (k/4) -1 \u21d2 k =4(c\u00b2 +1). Then, substituting this into equations (1) and (2):\n\na\u00b2 = ( (4(c\u00b2 +1)/2 ) -1 ) = 2(c\u00b2 +1) -1 = 2c\u00b2 +2 -1 =2c\u00b2 +1  \nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = ( (4(c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) -1 ) = (4c\u00b2 +4)/3 -1 = (4c\u00b2 +4 -3)/3 = (4c\u00b2 +1)/3\n\nTherefore, a=\u221a(2c\u00b2 +1), b=\u221a( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ), as before.\n\nNow, plug into ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me write expressions again:\n\na = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1)  \nb = sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nc = c\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(2c\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 ) * c + sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1)*c =1\n\nLet me factor out terms where possible.\n\nLet me denote terms:\n\nTerm1 = sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nTerm2 = c * sqrt( (4c\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nTerm3 = c * sqrt(2c\u00b2 +1 )\n\nLet me see if I can combine these terms. Maybe factor sqrt(c\u00b2 + ... ) terms?\n\nAlternatively, let me set t = c\u00b2, so c = sqrt(t). Let me substitute t = c\u00b2, so:\n\nTerm1 = sqrt(2t +1) * sqrt( (4t +1)/3 )  \nTerm2 = sqrt(t) * sqrt( (4t +1)/3 )  \nTerm3 = sqrt(t) * sqrt(2t +1 )\n\nLet me write everything in terms of t:\n\nEquation: Term1 + Term2 + Term3 =1\n\nLet me compute each term squared? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor sqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) from Term1 and Term2:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 = sqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) [ sqrt(2t +1) + sqrt(t) ]\n\nAnd Term3 = sqrt(t) sqrt(2t +1 )\n\nHmm, so the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) [ sqrt(2t +1) + sqrt(t) ] + sqrt(t) sqrt(2t +1 ) =1\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sqrt(2t +1 ) from the first and third terms? Let me see:\n\nWait, first term: sqrt( (4t+1)/3 ) * sqrt(2t+1 )\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (4t+1)/3 ) * sqrt(t )\n\nThird term: sqrt(t) sqrt(2t+1 )\n\nHmm, maybe group terms differently. Alternatively, let me denote sqrt(2t +1) as A and sqrt(t) as B, then sqrt(4t +1) as C?\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe let's assign a substitution variable for sqrt terms.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set x = sqrt(t) = sqrt(c\u00b2) = c. Since c is positive, x = c.\n\nThen, t = x\u00b2, so:\n\nsqrt(2t +1) = sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1)  \nsqrt(4t +1)/sqrt(3) = sqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nTherefore, Term1 becomes sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nTerm2 becomes x * sqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nTerm3 becomes x * sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (2x\u00b2 +1)(4x\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + x * sqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + x * sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1 ) =1\n\nHmm, still complex. Let me see if I can combine the first two terms. Let me write them as:\n\nsqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 ) [ sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1 ) + x ] + x * sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1 ) =1\n\nLet me denote sqrt(2x\u00b2 +1 ) as A and sqrt( (4x\u00b2 +1)/3 ) as B. Then the equation becomes:\n\nB(A + x) + x A =1\n\nExpanding:\n\nBA + Bx +xA =1 \u21d2 A(B +x) + Bx =1\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe instead, let me try to factor terms involving sqrt(2x\u00b2+1):\n\nLooking back:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 + Term3 =1\n\nTerm1 = sqrt( (2x\u00b2+1)(4x\u00b2+1)/3 )  \nTerm2 = x sqrt( (4x\u00b2+1)/3 )  \nTerm3 = x sqrt(2x\u00b2+1 )\n\nLet me note that Term1 = sqrt( (2x\u00b2 +1)/3 * (4x\u00b2 +1) )\n\nHmm, perhaps let me set y = x\u00b2. Let me try that substitution again with y =x\u00b2 =c\u00b2.\n\nThen,\n\nTerm1 = sqrt( (2y +1)(4y +1)/3 )\n\nTerm2 = sqrt(y) * sqrt( (4y +1)/3 )\n\nTerm3 = sqrt(y) * sqrt(2y +1 )\n\nHmm, but that's similar to before. Maybe substitute variable z = sqrt(y) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider numerical methods. Since this is a competition problem, maybe the value of k is an integer, and c is a rational number?\n\nWait, the problem says the triple is unique. Let me see if there's a nice solution. Let me suppose that c is a simple fraction. Let me try c =1/2. Let me see:\n\nIf c = 1/2,\n\nThen c\u00b2 =1/4,\n\nFrom equation (3): c\u00b2 = (k/4) -1 \u21d2 1/4 = (k/4) -1 \u21d2 k/4 = 5/4 \u21d2 k=5\n\nWait, so k=5. Let me then compute a and b.\n\na\u00b2 =2*(1/4) +1= 0.5 +1=1.5 \u21d2a=\u221a1.5\u22481.2247  \nb\u00b2=(4*(1/4)+1)/3=(1 +1)/3=2/3 \u21d2b\u22480.8165  \nThen compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab\u22481.2247*0.8165\u22481.0  \nbc\u22480.8165*(0.5)\u22480.408  \nca\u22481.2247*0.5\u22480.612  \nTotal\u22481.0 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02, which is more than 1. Not good.\n\nHmm, but earlier when I tried k=5, I got this. So that's not the solution. Maybe c= sqrt( something else). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set c=1. Let me try c=1:\n\nThen c\u00b2=1,\n\nFrom equation (3): 1= (k/4)-1 \u21d2k/4=2 \u21d2k=8\n\nThen a\u00b2=2*(1) +1=3 \u21d2a=\u221a3\u22481.732  \nb\u00b2=(4*1 +1)/3=5/3\u22481.666 \u21d2b\u22481.291  \nab\u22481.732*1.291\u22482.236  \nbc\u22481.291*1\u22481.291  \nca\u22481.732*1\u22481.732  \nTotal\u22482.236+1.291+1.732\u22485.259, way too big.\n\nHmm. Let me try c= sqrt(1/2) \u22480.707.\n\nThen c\u00b2=0.5,\n\nk=4*(0.5+1)=4*(1.5)=6\n\nSo k=6,\n\na\u00b2=2*(0.5)+1=2 \u21d2a=\u221a2\u22481.414  \nb\u00b2=(4*(0.5)+1)/3=(2 +1)/3=1 \u21d2b=1  \nab=1.414*1\u22481.414  \nbc\u22481*0.707\u22480.707  \nca\u22481.414*0.707\u22481  \nTotal\u22481.414 +0.707 +1\u22483.121, still too big.\n\nHmm, so when k increases, the sum increases. Wait, but when k was 4, the sum was ~0.577, which was less than 1. So, the solution must be between k=4 and k=5?\n\nWait, let me check k=4.5.\n\nk=4.5,\n\nThen,\n\nc\u00b2 = (4.5/4) -1 =1.125 -1=0.125 \u21d2c=0.3535  \nb\u00b2=(4.5/3)-1=1.5 -1=0.5 \u21d2b\u22480.707  \na\u00b2=(4.5/2) -1=2.25 -1=1.25 \u21d2a\u22481.118  \n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab\u22481.118*0.707\u22480.8  (since sqrt(1.25)*sqrt(0.5) \u22481.118*0.707\u22480.8)\n\nbc\u22480.707*0.3535\u22480.25  \n\nca\u22481.118*0.3535\u22480.4  \n\nTotal\u22480.8 +0.25 +0.4\u22481.45, still over 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe even lower k?\n\nWait, but when k=4, c=0, sum\u22480.577. Let me try k=4.2.\n\nk=4.2,\n\nc\u00b2=(4.2/4)-1=1.05-1=0.05 \u21d2c\u22480.2236\n\nb\u00b2=(4.2/3)-1=1.4 -1=0.4 \u21d2b\u22480.6325\n\na\u00b2=(4.2/2)-1=2.1-1=1.1 \u21d2a\u22481.0488\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab\u22481.0488 *0.6325\u22480.663  \nbc\u22480.6325 *0.2236\u22480.141  \nca\u22481.0488 *0.2236\u22480.234  \nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038, which is close to 1.\n\nHmm, so near k\u22484.2, the sum is about 1.04, which is close. Maybe exact value is around k=4. something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe k= 16/3 \u22485.333. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps trying fractions instead of decimals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that the terms can be simplified. Let me consider that in the equation ab + bc + ca =1, maybe the variables a, b, c can be expressed as trigonometric functions or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that 2(a\u00b2+1)=3(b\u00b2+1)=4(c\u00b2+1)=k, then set variables as follows:\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2 a= sqrt( (k/2)-1 )\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThen, maybe set variables in terms of sine or cosine? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set a = tan\u03b1, b = tan\u03b2, c = tan\u03b3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equations as quadratic forms. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me set all variables in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me suppose that a = m, then express b and c in terms of m, then plug into the equation.\n\nWait, but the first equation relates a,b,c to k. Alternatively, since they are all related to k, perhaps express all variables in terms of k and then compute a + b + c?\n\nWait, but the problem requires computing a + b + c, so maybe once we find k, we can compute a,b,c and add them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since ab + bc + ca =1, so if we can find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, then we can get (a + b + c)^2.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\nFrom the equations,\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2) -1  \nb\u00b2 = (k/3) -1  \nc\u00b2 = (k/4) -1\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (k/2 -1) + (k/3 -1) + (k/4 -1) = ( (6k +4k +3k)/12 ) -3 = (13k/12) -3\n\nThus,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = (13k/12 -3) + 2*1 = (13k/12 -3) +2 =13k/12 -1\n\nTherefore, if I can find k, then (a + b + c)^2 =13k/12 -1, so a +b +c = sqrt(13k/12 -1 )\n\nBut still need to find k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the equation ab + bc + ca =1 in terms of k, then solve for k.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nWe can write ab + bc + ca in terms of k.\n\nWe have:\n\nab = sqrt( ( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) )\n\nSimilarly for the other terms. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s compute ab:\n\nab = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) = sqrt( (k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1) )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbc = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) = sqrt( (k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1) )\n\nca = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) ) = sqrt( (k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1) )\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nsqrt(k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1) + sqrt(k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1) + sqrt(k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1) =1\n\nThis is an equation in k, which we need to solve. This seems quite challenging algebraically. Perhaps I can let\u2019s set m =k, and write the equation as:\n\nsqrt( (m\u00b2/6 - (5m)/6 +1 ) ) + sqrt( m\u00b2/12 -7m/12 +1 ) + sqrt( m\u00b2/8 -3m/4 +1 ) =1\n\nThis is a transcendental equation and might not have an algebraic solution, but given that the problem states there is a unique solution, perhaps there is a clever substitution.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that m is a multiple of 12 to make terms with denominators go away. Let me set m=12t. Let me see:\n\nLet me set m=12t, so t=k/12.\n\nThen, substituting into the terms:\n\nFirst sqrt term:\n\nm\u00b2/6 -5m/6 +1 = (144 t\u00b2)/6 - (60 t)/6 +1 =24 t\u00b2 -10t +1  \nSecond sqrt term:\n\nm\u00b2/12 -7m/12 +1 = (144 t\u00b2)/12 - (84 t)/12 +1 =12 t\u00b2 -7t +1  \nThird sqrt term:\n\nm\u00b2/8 -3m/4 +1 = (144 t\u00b2)/8 - (36 t)/4 +1 =18 t\u00b2 -9t +1\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(24 t\u00b2 -10t +1) + sqrt(12 t\u00b2 -7t +1) + sqrt(18 t\u00b2 -9t +1) =1\n\nHmm, maybe this is a better form? Let me see if substituting t=1/4 or another fraction.\n\nLet me try t=1/2:\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term inside sqrt:24*(1/4) -10*(1/2)+1=6 -5+1=2 \u21d2 sqrt(2)=1.414  \nSecond term:12*(1/4) -7*(1/2)+1=3 -3.5 +1=0.5 \u21d2 sqrt(0.5)\u22480.707  \nThird term:18*(1/4) -9*(1/2)+1=4.5 -4.5 +1=1 \u21d2 sqrt(1)=1  \nTotal\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.12>1.

Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equations:\n\nLet me consider that the problem states there is a unique solution. Perhaps using Lagrange multipliers? Since we have two equations with three variables, but the problem says the solution is unique. Maybe set up the equations and find when they intersect?\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as follows. Let me write variables in terms of k, and then set the equation for ab + bc + ca =1 in terms of k, then solve for k numerically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a substitution that can be done. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2. Then from the first equations:\n\n2(x +1) =3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k. So,\n\nx=(k/2)-1,\n\ny=(k/3)-1,\n\nz=(k/4)-1.\n\nThen, the second equation is ab + bc + ca =1. Since a,b,c are positive, we can write the equation as:\n\n\u221ax\u221ay + \u221ay\u221az + \u221az\u221ax =1.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(\u221a(xy) + \u221a(yz) + \u221a(zx))\u00b2 =1\u00b2,\n\nWhich gives:\n\nxy + yz + zx + 2(\u221a(x\u00b2y z) + \u221a(xy\u00b2 z) + \u221a(x y z\u00b2)) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems even more complex. Wait, perhaps not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the square:\n\n(\u221axy + \u221ayz + \u221azx)^2 = xy + yz + zx + 2(\u221a(xy * yz) + \u221a(yz * zx) + \u221a(zx * xy))\n\n= xy + yz + zx + 2( y\u221a(xz) + z\u221a(xy) + x\u221a(yz) )\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps consider variables in terms of trigonometric functions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that a, b, c are in geometric progression?\n\nWait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote the common value as k, so:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (k/2)-1,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nLet me consider substituting variables as follows:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s set a = sqrt( (k/2)-1 )\n\nSimilarly, b = sqrt( (k/3)-1 ),\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4)-1 )\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 can be written as:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) ) =1\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set u = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nv = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nw = sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )\n\nThen the equation is u + v + w =1.\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between u, v, w.\n\nNotice that:\n\nu\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)  \nv\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)  \nw\u00b2 = (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)\n\nMultiply all three together:\n\nu\u00b2 v\u00b2 w\u00b2 = [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)]^2\n\nTherefore, (uvw)^2 = [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)]^2 \u21d2 uvw = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)\n\nSince all terms are positive (k>4), so uvw is positive.\n\nHmm, perhaps use the AM \u2265 GM inequality?\n\nWait, but not sure. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I consider that u, v, w are positive real numbers such that u + v + w =1 and their product is something. Maybe set up equations to maximize or minimize something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s define variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set p = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),  \nq = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),  \nr = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nThen, we have:\n\na = p * sqrt( (k/3 -1) / (k/2 -1) )? Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ) = p,\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), so p = a,\n\nSimilarly, b = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ) = q,\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4 -1) ) = r,\n\nTherefore, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 becomes:\n\na b + b c + c a = p q + q r + r p =1\n\nAh! This is a nice simplification.\n\nSo, with p = a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), q = b = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ), r = c = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nSo, the equation is pq + qr + rp =1.\n\nAlso, notice that:\n\np\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),  \nq\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),  \nr\u00b2 = (k/4 -1)\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nk = 2(p\u00b2 +1) = 3(q\u00b2 +1) =4(r\u00b2 +1)\n\nTherefore, we have three equations relating p, q, r:\n\n2(p\u00b2 +1)=3(q\u00b2 +1)=4(r\u00b2 +1)=k\n\nLet me see if I can relate p, q, r.\n\nFrom the first two equations:\n\n2(p\u00b2 +1)=3(q\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 2p\u00b2 +2=3q\u00b2 +3 \u21d2 2p\u00b2 -3q\u00b2 =1 \u21d2 (2p\u00b2) =3q\u00b2 +1\n\nSimilarly, from the second and third equations:\n\n3(q\u00b2 +1)=4(r\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 3q\u00b2 +3 =4r\u00b2 +4 \u21d2 3q\u00b2 -4r\u00b2 =1 \u21d2 3q\u00b2=4r\u00b2 +1\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n2p\u00b2 =3q\u00b2 +1  \n3q\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1\n\nAnd the equation pq + qr + rp =1.\n\nLet me try to express p and q in terms of r.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n3q\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 q\u00b2 = (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 \u21d2 q = sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n2p\u00b2=3q\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 substitute q\u00b2:\n\n2p\u00b2 =3*(4r\u00b2 +1)/3 +1 =4r\u00b2 +1 +1=4r\u00b2 +2 \u21d2 p\u00b2=(4r\u00b2 +2)/2 =2r\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 p=sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1)\n\nTherefore, p = sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1), q = sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ), r = r\n\nThen the equation pq + qr + rp =1 becomes:\n\nsqrt(2r\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 )*r + r*sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1 ) =1\n\nThis is the same equation as before. Hmm, so we're back to where we were earlier. So maybe we need to set t = r and solve for t numerically?\n\nAlternatively, let me set t = r\u00b2, so r = sqrt(t). Let me try substituting t for simplicity.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set t = r\u00b2. Then r = sqrt(t).\n\nThen:\n\np = sqrt(2t +1)\n\nq = sqrt( (4t +1)/3 )\n\nr = sqrt(t)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(2t +1)*sqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4t +1)/3 )*sqrt(t) + sqrt(t)*sqrt(2t +1) =1\n\nLet me factor sqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) from the first two terms:\n\nsqrt( (4t +1)/3 )[ sqrt(2t +1) + sqrt(t) ] + sqrt(t)sqrt(2t +1 ) =1\n\nLet me denote sqrt(2t +1) = A and sqrt(t) = B. Then:\n\nsqrt( (4t +1)/3 ) = sqrt( (2*(2t) +1)/3 ). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, 4t +1 = 2*2t +1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that 4t +1 = 2*(2t) +1, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, note that 4t +1 = (sqrt(2t +1))^2 + (sqrt(2t -0))^2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = sqrt(t). Let me try that.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set u = sqrt(t) \u21d2 t=u\u00b2. Then,\n\nsqrt(2t +1)=sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)  \nsqrt( (4t +1)/3 )=sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )  \nsqrt(t)=u\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )*u + u*sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1 ) =1\n\nHmm, still complex. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nSecond term: u * sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nThird term: u * sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1 )\n\nLet me denote sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) as C and sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) as D.\n\nThen the equation is:\n\nD*C + C*u + D*u =1 \u21d2 C(D + u) + D*u =1\n\nHmm, still not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps set u = tan\u03b8 or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me try to make a substitution such as letting x = sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) and y = sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1 ).\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to consider that maybe the terms can be combined as follows:\n\nLet me combine the first and third terms:\n\nsqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + u*sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1 ) = sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)[ sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + u ]\n\nSimilarly, the second term is u*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nThus:\n\nsqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)[ sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + u ] + u*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) =1\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) from the first and second terms? Let me see:\n\nWait, but the first term has sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ), and the second term has u*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a substitution that can make this equation manageable. For instance, suppose that 2u\u00b2 +1 = something squared, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that maybe the terms inside the square roots are proportional or related in some way.\n\nNotice that 4u\u00b2 +1 = 2*(2u\u00b2) +1, and 2u\u00b2 +1 is similar.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set v = 2u\u00b2. Let me see:\n\nLet me set v =2u\u00b2 \u21d2 u\u00b2 =v/2 \u21d2 u = sqrt(v/2)\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)=sqrt(v +1)  \nsqrt(4u\u00b2 +1)=sqrt(2v +1)  \nsqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )=sqrt( (2v +1)/3 )\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(v+1)*sqrt( (2v +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2v +1)/3 )*sqrt(v/2) + sqrt(v/2)*sqrt(v +1) =1\n\nHmm, maybe simplifying:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(v+1)*sqrt( (2v+1)/3 ) = sqrt( (v+1)(2v+1)/3 )\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2v+1)/3 )*sqrt(v/2 ) = sqrt( v(2v+1)/6 )\n\nThird term: sqrt(v/2)*sqrt(v+1 ) = sqrt( v(v+1)/2 )\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me set w = v + something, but I feel like this might not be the path.\n\nGiven that this is getting too involved algebraically, perhaps I can consider that this problem likely has an elegant solution through substitution or recognizing symmetry.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that a, b, c are such that:\n\nLet me assume that a = 2b/\u221a3 and c = b/(\u221a3). Maybe this can satisfy the first equations?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose that:\n\nLet me suppose that a = m b and c = n b, then maybe express everything in terms of b.\n\nLet me try this substitution.\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set a = m b and c = n b, where m and n are constants to be determined.\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) =3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)\n\nSo,\n\n2( (m\u00b2 b\u00b2 +1) ) = 3(b\u00b2 +1 )\n\nand\n\n3(b\u00b2 +1 ) =4( n\u00b2 b\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo from the first equation:\n\n2m\u00b2 b\u00b2 +2 =3b\u00b2 +3 \u21d2 (2m\u00b2 -3)b\u00b2 =1 \u21d2 b\u00b2 =1/(2m\u00b2 -3)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n3b\u00b2 +3 =4n\u00b2 b\u00b2 +4 \u21d2 (3 -4n\u00b2 )b\u00b2 =1 \u21d2 b\u00b2 =1/(3 -4n\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, equate the two expressions for b\u00b2:\n\n1/(2m\u00b2 -3) =1/(3 -4n\u00b2 ) \u21d22m\u00b2 -3 =3 -4n\u00b2 \u21d2 2m\u00b2 +4n\u00b2 =6 \u21d2m\u00b2 +2n\u00b2 =3\n\nAlso, the second equation ab + bc + ca=1.\n\nSubstituting a =m b and c =n b,\n\nab + bc + ca = m b\u00b2 + n b\u00b2 + m n b\u00b2 = (m +n + mn)b\u00b2 =1\n\nWe have b\u00b2 from above, say from first equation: b\u00b2=1/(2m\u00b2 -3)\n\nThus,\n\n(m +n + mn) * [1/(2m\u00b2 -3) ] =1 \u21d2 (m +n + mn) =2m\u00b2 -3\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. m\u00b2 +2n\u00b2 =3  \n2. m +n + mn =2m\u00b2 -3\n\nWe need to solve for m and n.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 2: m +n + mn =2m\u00b2 -3 \u21d2 Let me rearrange:\n\n2m\u00b2 - mn -m -n -3 =0\n\nHmm, this is a system of equations. Let me see if I can find integers or simple fractions that satisfy m\u00b2 +2n\u00b2=3.\n\nSuppose m and n are rational numbers.\n\nLet me try m=1:\n\nThen from equation1, 1 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d22n\u00b2=2 \u21d2n\u00b2=1 \u21d2n=1 or -1. Since variables are positive, n=1.\n\nCheck equation2: 1 +1 +1*1= 3. RHS:2(1)^2 -3=2-3=-1. 3\u2260-1. Not valid.\n\nNext, m= sqrt( something? Maybe m= sqrt(3). Let me try m= sqrt(3):\n\nThen equation1: 3 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d2n=0, but c=n b would be zero, invalid.\n\nHmm, m= sqrt(2):\n\nThen equation1: 2 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d22n\u00b2=1 \u21d2n=1/\u221a2\u22480.707\n\nThen equation2:\n\nm +n + mn =sqrt(2) +1/\u221a2 + sqrt(2)*(1/\u221a2)= sqrt(2)+1/\u221a2 +1\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121\n\nThe RHS:2*(2) -3=1. So 3.121 \u22481? Not close.\n\nHmm. Try m= sqrt(1.5)=sqrt(3/2):\n\nThen m\u00b2=1.5,\n\nEquation1:1.5 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d22n\u00b2=1.5 \u21d2n\u00b2=0.75 \u21d2n=sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866\n\nEquation2:\n\nm +n + mn =sqrt(3/2)+sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3/2)*sqrt(3)/2\n\nLet me compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(3/2)=\u22481.2247,\n\nsqrt(3)/2\u22480.866,\n\nFirst term:1.2247 +0.866\u22482.0907\n\nSecond term:1.2247*0.866\u22481.0607\n\nTotal\u22483.1514\n\nRHS:2*(1.5) -3=0. So 3.1514 vs 0. Not.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, m= sqrt(2.5)=sqrt(5/2):\n\nm\u00b2=2.5,\n\nThen equation1:2.5 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d22n\u00b2=0.5 \u21d2n\u00b2=0.25 \u21d2n=0.5\n\nThen equation2:\n\nm +n + mn =sqrt(5/2) +0.5 + sqrt(5/2)*0.5\n\nCompute sqrt(5/2)\u22481.581,\n\nThus:\n\n1.581 +0.5 +1.581*0.5\u22481.581+0.5+0.790\u22482.871\n\nRHS:2*(2.5) -3=5-3=2. So 2.871 vs 2. Not.\n\nHmm, close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, try m= sqrt(2):\n\nWait, did I do that already?\n\nYes. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try with m=3/2=1.5:\n\nThen m\u00b2=2.25,\n\nEquation1:2.25 +2n\u00b2=3 \u21d22n\u00b2=0.75 \u21d2n\u00b2=0.375 \u21d2n= sqrt(0.375)=sqrt(3/8)= (~0.612)\n\nEquation2:\n\nm +n + mn =1.5 +0.612 +1.5*0.612\u22481.5+0.612+0.918\u22483.03\n\nRHS:2*(2.25) -3=4.5-3=1.5.

Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too tedious. Perhaps this substitution path isn't the best.\n\nGiven that this problem is from a competition, there must be a smarter substitution or recognizing that the expressions can be set as variables leading to a quadratic or cubic equation.\n\nLet me think again about the first approach where I set variables in terms of k and then squared the equation.\n\nWe had:\n\nu + v + w =1,\n\nwhere:\n\nu = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ),  \nv = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ),  \nw = sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )\n\nAnd after squaring, we had:\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + 2(uv + uw + vw) =1,\n\nwhere,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = (k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1) + (k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1) + (k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1)\n\nEarlier computed that to:\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + w\u00b2 = (3k\u00b2)/8 - (13k)/6 +3.\n\nAnd the cross terms:\n\n2(uv + uw + vw). Let me see if I can compute uv + uw + vw.\n\nCompute uv:\n\nuv = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) * (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\n= (k/3 -1)*sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nSimilarly, uw = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) * (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )\n\n= (k/2 -1)*sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nAnd vw = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) * (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) )\n\n= (k/4 -1)*sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nHmm, so each cross product has a term like (something)*sqrt(other terms). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that uv + uw + vw = (k/3 -1)X + (k/2 -1)Y + (k/4 -1)Z where X,Y,Z are sqrt terms. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is too hard and I need to consider that the problem says the triple is unique, so maybe the answer is a nice number like sqrt(3) or 2?\n\nWait, the problem says to compute a + b + c. Let me assume that the answer is simple.\n\nSuppose that a + b + c = sqrt(3). Maybe?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of when k=6, then a= sqrt(2*1 +1)=sqrt(3), b= sqrt( (4*1 +1)/3 )=sqrt(5/3), c= sqrt(1).\n\nWait, k=6,\n\na\u00b2 =2*(1) +1=3 \u21d2a=sqrt(3)  \nb\u00b2=(4*1 +1)/3=5/3 \u21d2b= sqrt(5/3)  \nc\u00b2= (6/4)-1=0.5 \u21d2c=sqrt(0.5)=1/\u221a2\u22480.707  \n\nThen ab + bc + ca= sqrt(3)*sqrt(5/3) + sqrt(5/3)*1/\u221a2 + sqrt(3)*1/\u221a2.\n\nCompute ab: sqrt(3*(5/3))=sqrt(5)\u22482.236  \nbc: sqrt(5/3)*1/\u221a2= sqrt(5/6)\u22480.912  \nca: sqrt(3)*1/\u221a2\u2248sqrt(3/2)\u22481.225  \nTotal\u22482.236+0.912+1.225\u22484.373>1.

Way too big.\n\nHmm. Maybe k= (something smaller).\n\nWait, let me think back to the equation for a + b + c.\n\nEarlier, I found that (a + b + c)^2 = (13k/12 -3) + 2*1 =13k/12 -1. So if I can find k, then I can compute a + b + c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is set up so that when you add a, b, c, you get a nice value like 2 or sqrt(3), and then work backwards.\n\nSuppose that a + b + c =2. Then (a + b + c)^2 =4 =13k/12 -1 \u21d213k/12 =5 \u21d2k=(5*12)/13\u22484.615. Which is between 4 and5, which matches our earlier trials.\n\nLet me check with k=60/13\u22484.615. Let me compute:\n\nk=60/13\u22484.615,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2=(k/2 -1)= (30/13 -1)=17/13 \u21d2a=sqrt(17/13)\u22481.13,\n\nb\u00b2=(k/3 -1)= (20/13 -1)=7/13 \u21d2b\u22480.743,\n\nc\u00b2=(k/4 -1)= (15/13 -1)=2/13 \u21d2c\u22480.392.\n\nThen compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab\u22481.13*0.743\u22480.84,\n\nbc\u22480.743*0.392\u22480.291,\n\nca\u22481.13*0.392\u22480.443,\n\nTotal\u22480.84+0.291+0.443\u22481.574. Still higher than 1. So a + b +c would be sqrt(13*(60/13)/12 -1)= sqrt( (60/12) -1)=sqrt(5 -1)=sqrt(4)=2. So if a + b +c is 2, then the sum ab + bc + ca would need to be 1. But in reality, with k=60/13, the sum is ~1.574. Therefore, this is inconsistent. So maybe a + b +c is sqrt( something else.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, (a + b +c)^2 =13k/12 -1. If ab + bc + ca=1, then (a + b +c)^2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +2= (13k/12 -3)+2=13k/12 -1.\n\nSo if I can find k such that the equation with ab + bc + ca=1 is satisfied, then compute (a + b +c)^2=13k/12 -1, then take the square root.\n\nGiven that solving for k is difficult algebraically, perhaps the problem requires a substitution that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of trigonometric functions. Suppose that:\n\nLet me set a = tanA, b = tanB, c = tanC, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that a = sqrt( (k/2)-1 ), so let me set k/2 -1 = x\u00b2 \u21d2k=2(x\u00b2 +1). Similarly for others:\n\nk=3(y\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1). So,\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 +1 =k/2,\n\ny\u00b2 +1=k/3,\n\nz\u00b2 +1=k/4.\n\nThen, variables a= x, b=y, c=z. So the equation becomes ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nWait, this is the same as before.\n\nHmm, maybe set x, y, z such that they form a geometric sequence or arithmetic?\n\nSuppose that x, y, z are in geometric progression: y = xr, z=xr\u00b2. Then,\n\nab + bc + ca = x*y + y*z + z*x =x\u00b2r +x\u00b2r^3 +x\u00b2r\u00b2 =x\u00b2(r +r\u00b2 +r^3)=1.\n\nAlso:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nk=2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1)=3(x\u00b2r\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1)=4(x\u00b2r^4 +1).\n\nThis might be a path, but it's complex.\n\nAlternatively, set x = y = z. Then,\n\nIf x=y=z,\n\nThen 2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(x\u00b2 +1)=4(x\u00b2 +1), which implies all equal, so 2=3=4, which is impossible.

Maybe we need to consider that the problem requires a substitution where variables are set to trigonometric functions.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps:\n\nLet me assume that a = tanA, b = tanB, c = tanC, with A,B,C being angles in a triangle?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, maybe set k = 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) =4(c\u00b2 +1) = something related to trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set a = tan \u03b1, b = tan \u03b2, c = tan \u03b3,\n\nThen, perhaps the equations can be transformed using trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, consider hypergeometric functions?

Then, as before,\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k,\n\nand we have sqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x)=1.\n\nLet me consider adding variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set m = sqrt(x y), n = sqrt(y z), p = sqrt(z x).\n\nThen,\n\nm +n +p =1,\n\nand,\n\nm\u00b2 =x y,\n\nn\u00b2 =y z,\n\np\u00b2 =z x.\n\nAlso, from the first equations:\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set k =2(x+1)=3(y+1)=4(z+1). Thus,\n\nx = (k/2) -1,\n\ny=(k/3)-1,\n\nz=(k/4)-1.\n\nThus,\n\nm = sqrt( [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ] )\n\nn = sqrt( [(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ] )\n\np = sqrt( [(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) ] )\n\nThus, m + n + p=1.\n\nThis brings us back to the original equation.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that variables m,n,p are sides of a triangle or something similar, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that variables m,n,p are proportional to the terms in the equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think that this problem is designed so that the solution is when the terms inside the square roots are perfect squares.\n\nSuppose that (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) is a perfect square,\n\nSimilarly for the other products.\n\nPerhaps choose k such that these products are perfect squares.\n\nLet me set (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = something squared.\n\nLet me suppose that (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = t\u00b2,\n\n(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)=u\u00b2,\n\n(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)=v\u00b2,\n\nand t +u +v=1.\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that all three expressions are equal to each other's square roots, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: since the problem states that the triple is unique, maybe the equations can be manipulated into a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nLet me set the common value k=2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1).\n\nLet me write each of a,b,c in terms of k, as before:\n\na=\u221a((k/2)-1),\n\nb=\u221a((k/3)-1),\n\nc=\u221a((k/4)-1).\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 can be written in terms of k.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nab = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nSimilarly for bc and ca.\n\nLet me consider that the three terms are sqrt(A), sqrt(B), sqrt(C), where A,B,C are quadratic in k.\n\nPerhaps the sum can be represented as a quadratic in sqrt(k).\n\nAlternatively, assume that k is such that the terms inside the square roots are multiples of each other or form a geometric progression.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the three terms inside the square roots:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set A = (k/2 -1),\n\nB = (k/3 -1),\n\nC = (k/4 -1).\n\nThen, the equation is sqrt(AB) + sqrt(BC) + sqrt(CA) =1.\n\nLet me note that A, B, C are related:\n\nA = (k/2 -1),\n\nB = (k/3 -1),\n\nC = (k/4 -1).\n\nLet me express A,B,C in terms of C:\n\nSince C = (k/4 -1),\n\nthen k =4(C +1).\n\nThus,\n\nA = (4(C +1)/2 -1)=2(C+1) -1=2C +1,\n\nB = (4(C +1)/3 -1)= (4C +4)/3 -1= (4C +1)/3,\n\nC remains as is.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (2C+1)( (4C+1)/3 )) + sqrt( ( (4C+1)/3 ) C ) + sqrt( C(2C+1) )=1.\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set C = t,\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt( (2t+1)( (4t+1)/3 ) ) + sqrt( ( (4t+1)/3 ) t ) + sqrt( t(2t+1) ) =1.\n\nThis is the same equation as before, but now in terms of t=C= (k/4)-1.\n\nLet me multiply through by sqrt(3) to eliminate denominators:\n\nsqrt(3*(2t+1)(4t+1)/3 ) + sqrt(3*( (4t+1)/3 *t ))*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3*t(2t+1)) = sqrt(3)*1.\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, let me set sqrt( (2t+1)(4t+1)/3 ) = m,\n\nsqrt( (4t+1)t/3 )=n,\n\nsqrt(t(2t+1))=p,\n\nthen m +n +p =1,\n\nand,\n\nm\u00b2 = (2t+1)(4t+1)/3,\n\nn\u00b2 = (4t+1)t/3,\n\np\u00b2 =t(2t+1).\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between m, n, p.\n\nNotice that:\n\nm\u00b2 = (2t+1)(4t+1)/3,\n\nn\u00b2 = (4t+1)t/3,\n\np\u00b2 =t(2t+1),\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2 = (2t+1)(4t+1)/3 = (p\u00b2 (4t+1))/(3t),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nn\u00b2 = (4t+1)t/3 \u21d2 (4t+1)= 3n\u00b2/t,\n\nSubstitute into m\u00b2:\n\nm\u00b2 = (p\u00b2 * 3n\u00b2/t )/(3t) = (p\u00b2 n\u00b2)/t\u00b2,\n\nThus, m = (pn)/t,\n\nSimilarly, from p\u00b2 =t(2t+1),\n\nThen 2t+1 = p\u00b2/t,\n\nSo,\n\nm = (pn)/t,\n\nAnd,\n\nAlso, let me see if:\n\nm +n +p =1,\n\nand m = (pn)/t,\n\nThus,\n\n(pn)/t +n +p =1,\n\nBut I also have:\n\nFrom p\u00b2 =t(2t+1),\n\nAnd 4t+1 =3n\u00b2/t,\n\nSo,\n\nLet me try to find expressions for t in terms of n and p.\n\nFrom 4t+1 =3n\u00b2/t,\n\nMultiply both sides by t:4t\u00b2 +t =3n\u00b2 \u21d24t\u00b2 +t -3n\u00b2=0,\n\nSimilarly, from p\u00b2 =t(2t+1),\n\n2t\u00b2 +t -p\u00b2=0,\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1.4t\u00b2 +t -3n\u00b2=0,\n\n2.2t\u00b2 +t -p\u00b2=0,\n\nAnd,\n\nFrom m = (pn)/t,\n\nAnd m +n +p =1,\n\nThis is getting very involved, but perhaps substituting variables.\n\nLet me assume that p = kt,\n\nfor some constant k.

Though earlier computation with that k gave a sum of ~1.574 for ab + bc +ca. But the problem says that there is a unique solution, so perhaps the answer is sqrt(2*(something)), but I need to think differently.\n\nWait, let me consider the equations again:\n\nLet me consider that the system is symmetric in a way that variables are related by the coefficients 2,3,4.\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nLet me also set variables:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet me define variables such that,\n\nLet me set a = sqrt( (k/2)-1 ) = sqrt(x),\n\nb = sqrt( (k/3)-1 ) = sqrt(y),\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4)-1 ) = sqrt(z),\n\nWith x =k/2 -1,\n\ny=k/3 -1,\n\nz=k/4 -1,\n\nAnd the equation sqrt(x y)+sqrt(y z)+sqrt(z x)=1.\n\nNow, let me consider the variables x,y,z.\n\nWe can write:\n\nx = k/2 -1,\n\ny =k/3 -1,\n\nz =k/4 -1,\n\nSo,\n\nx = (k/2 -1),\n\ny= (k/3 -1),\n\nz=(k/4 -1).\n\nLet me express k in terms of x, y, z:\n\nk =2(x +1),\n\nk=3(y +1),\n\nk=4(z +1),\n\nThus,\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1).\n\nLet me set all equal to k, so:\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k,\n\nThus, we have three equations:\n\n2x +2 =3y +3,\n\n2x +2 =4z +4,\n\nand 3y +3=4z +4,\n\nFrom first equation:\n\n2x -3y =1,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n2x -4z =2,\n\nThird equation:\n\n3y -4z =1.\n\nLet me solve this system for x,y,z.\n\nFrom first equation:\n\n2x =3y +1 \u21d2x=(3y +1)/2,\n\nFrom third equation:\n\n3y =4z +1 \u21d2 y=(4z +1)/3,\n\nSubstitute into x:\n\nx=(3*(4z +1)/3 +1)/2 = (4z +1 +1)/2=(4z +2)/2=2z +1,\n\nFrom second equation:\n\n2x -4z =2,\n\nSubstitute x=2z +1,\n\n2*(2z+1) -4z =4z+2-4z=2=2,\n\nWhich is an identity. So, the system has infinitely many solutions parameterized by z.\n\nThus, variables are expressed in terms of z:\n\nz is a free variable,\n\ny=(4z +1)/3,\n\nx=2z +1,\n\nAnd k=4(z +1).\n\nThus, the variables x,y,z depend on z.\n\nNow, the equation to satisfy is sqrt(xy)+sqrt(yz)+sqrt(zx)=1,\n\nSubstitute x=2z+1,\n\ny=(4z +1)/3,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( (2z+1)*(4z+1)/3 ) + sqrt( ( (4z+1)/3 )*z ) + sqrt(z*(2z+1) ) =1,\n\nThis is the same equation as before.
