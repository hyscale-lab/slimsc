      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers that satisfies two equations. The first equation is 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1), and the second equation is ab + bc + ca = 1. Then I have to compute a + b + c. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that there's a unique solution, so I probably need to set up some equations and solve them systematically. Let me look at the first part: 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1). Since all three expressions are equal, I can set them equal to a common variable, say k. That way, I can express each variable in terms of k. Let me write that down:\n\nLet 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k. Then,\n\n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 1 = k/2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (k/2) - 1 \u21d2 a = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 b\u00b2 + 1 = k/3 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (k/3) - 1 \u21d2 b = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]\n\nAnd,\n\n4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 c\u00b2 + 1 = k/4 \u21d2 c\u00b2 = (k/4) - 1 \u21d2 c = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]\n\nSince a, b, c are positive real numbers, the expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative. So,\n\nFor a: (k/2) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 2\n\nFor b: (k/3) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 3\n\nFor c: (k/4) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 4\n\nSo the minimum possible k is 4? Wait, but all three conditions need to be satisfied, so the most restrictive condition is k \u2265 4. So k must be at least 4. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, the second equation is ab + bc + ca = 1. Since I have expressions for a, b, c in terms of k, maybe I can substitute them into this equation and solve for k. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote the expressions:\n\na = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]\n\nb = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]\n\nc = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]\n\nSo, substituting into ab + bc + ca = 1:\n\n\u221a[(k/2 - 1)] * \u221a[(k/3 - 1)] + \u221a[(k/3 - 1)] * \u221a[(k/4 - 1)] + \u221a[(k/2 - 1)] * \u221a[(k/4 - 1)] = 1\n\nHmm, that looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me see if there's another substitution or perhaps using symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set variables in terms of trigonometric functions? Since the equations involve squares and cross terms, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can let x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2. Then, since a, b, c are positive, x, y, z are positive real numbers as well.\n\nThen, the first equations become:\n\n2(x + 1) = 3(y + 1) = 4(z + 1) = k.\n\nSo similar to before, but maybe this substitution helps?\n\nLet me try that. Let me define variables:\n\nLet 2(x + 1) = 3(y + 1) = 4(z + 1) = k, so x = (k/2) - 1, y = (k/3) - 1, z = (k/4) -1. Then, since a = \u221ax, etc., same as before. But perhaps working with x, y, z might make the equation ab + bc + ca =1 more manageable? Let's see.\n\nWait, ab + bc + ca =1 would become:\n\n\u221ax * \u221ay + \u221ay * \u221az + \u221az * \u221ax =1\n\nHmm, still involves square roots. Maybe squaring both sides? But that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of k?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up ratios between a, b, c?\n\nLet me see, since all expressions are equal to k, so 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1), so 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1). Let me write ratios between a and b, etc.\n\nLet me denote 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1). Let me rearrange this equation:\n\n2a\u00b2 + 2 = 3b\u00b2 + 3 \u21d2 2a\u00b2 - 3b\u00b2 = 1\n\nSimilarly, 3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 3b\u00b2 + 3 = 4c\u00b2 +4 \u21d2 3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 =1\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. 2a\u00b2 - 3b\u00b2 =1\n\n2. 3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 =1\n\nMaybe I can use these two equations to eliminate variables?\n\nIf I subtract equation 2 from equation 1: (2a\u00b2 -3b\u00b2) - (3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2) =1 -1 \u21d2 2a\u00b2 -6b\u00b2 +4c\u00b2=0 \u21d2 2a\u00b2 +4c\u00b2 =6b\u00b2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 2c\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps express a\u00b2 and c\u00b2 in terms of b\u00b2?\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (3b\u00b2 +1)/2\n\nFrom equation 2: 3b\u00b2 =4c\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 c\u00b2 = (3b\u00b2 -1)/4\n\nSo, substituting these into the expression a\u00b2 + 2c\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2,\n\nWait, but that was from the previous equation. Let me check:\n\nWait, actually, perhaps better to express a and c in terms of b, then plug into the second equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven a\u00b2 = (3b\u00b2 +1)/2 \u21d2 a = sqrt[(3b\u00b2 +1)/2]\n\nSimilarly, c\u00b2 = (3b\u00b2 -1)/4 \u21d2 c = sqrt[(3b\u00b2 -1)/4] = (1/2)sqrt(3b\u00b2 -1)\n\nHmm, but then in ab + bc + ca, we can write everything in terms of b.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nLet me denote sqrt terms as variables for simplicity:\n\nLet me let\u2019s define A = sqrt[(3b\u00b2 +1)/2]\n\nand C = (1/2)sqrt(3b\u00b2 -1)\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 becomes:\n\nA*b + b*C + A*C =1\n\nHmm. Let me write that expression:\n\nb*(A + C) + A*C =1\n\nHmm, but A and C are expressed in terms of b. Let me substitute their expressions:\n\nFirst, A = sqrt[(3b\u00b2 +1)/2], and C = (1/2)sqrt(3b\u00b2 -1)\n\nSo substituting in:\n\nb * [sqrt((3b\u00b2 +1)/2) + (1/2)sqrt(3b\u00b2 -1)] + sqrt((3b\u00b2 +1)/2) * (1/2)sqrt(3b\u00b2 -1) =1\n\nThis looks really complicated. Maybe I can let\u2019s make a substitution for t = b\u00b2, so that 3b\u00b2 becomes 3t. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set t = b\u00b2. Since b is positive, t >0. Then:\n\nA = sqrt[(3t +1)/2]\n\nC = (1/2)sqrt(3t -1)\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(t) * [ sqrt((3t +1)/2) + (1/2)sqrt(3t -1) ] + sqrt((3t +1)/2) * (1/2)sqrt(3t -1) =1\n\nHmm, still looks very messy. Maybe I can square both sides? Although that might lead to a higher degree equation, but perhaps manageable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter substitution. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the first equation's common variable k. Let me get back to the first approach where 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k. So let's use that.\n\nSo if I can write a, b, c in terms of k, then plug into ab + bc + ca =1, and solve for k. Let me try that again.\n\nSo, a = sqrt( (k/2) -1 )\n\nSimilarly, b = sqrt( (k/3) -1 )\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4) -1 )\n\nSo, plugging into ab + bc + ca =1:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1) ) * sqrt( (k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1) ) * sqrt( (k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/2 -1) ) * sqrt( (k/4 -1) ) = 1\n\nHmm, perhaps I can denote each term as variables, but maybe let\u2019s let\u2019s set variables to simplify the expressions.\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set x = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), y = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ), z = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nThen, the equation becomes xy + yz + zx =1, which is the same as the given equation. But we also have relationships between x, y, z and k.\n\nWait, but since x = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), then x\u00b2 = (k/2 -1) \u21d2 k = 2x\u00b2 + 2.\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2 = (k/3 -1) \u21d2 k = 3y\u00b2 + 3.\n\nAnd z\u00b2 = (k/4 -1) \u21d2 k =4 z\u00b2 +4.\n\nTherefore, since all equal to k,\n\n2x\u00b2 + 2 = 3y\u00b2 +3 =4 z\u00b2 +4 =k\n\nTherefore, 2x\u00b2 +2 =3y\u00b2 +3 \u21d2 2x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1,\n\nSimilarly, 3y\u00b2 +3 =4 z\u00b2 +4 \u21d23y\u00b2 -4 z\u00b2 =1,\n\nSame as before. Hmm, this seems to bring me back to the previous equations. Maybe this approach is not making progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set all variables in terms of k and then plug into the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that k is a multiple of 12? Since denominators 2,3,4, so LCM is 12, maybe set k=12m, but not sure. Alternatively, trying to make the terms under the roots integers? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to assign a common variable. Let me consider that since all three expressions equal to k, so:\n\nLet me see, perhaps set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1) =3(b\u00b2 +1) =4(c\u00b2 +1)=k, then:\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2) -1,\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3)-1,\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4)-1.\n\nThen, the second equation is ab + bc + ca=1. Let me square both sides of ab + bc + ca =1 to see if that helps.\n\n(ab + bc + ca)^2 =1^2 \u21d2 a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 +c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2abc(a + b + c) =1\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express a, b, c in terms of k, then plug into ab + bc + ca=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of k and set up an equation in k. Let me try that.\n\nLet me compute ab:\n\nab = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nSimilarly, bc = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nca= sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nTherefore, adding them together:\n\nsqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] + sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] + sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)] =1\n\nThis equation in terms of k is quite complicated. Maybe we can let\u2019s set t = k, and try to find t numerically? But since the problem states that there's a unique solution, perhaps we can find k by some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps making substitution variables to simplify the radicals.\n\nLet me see, perhaps let\u2019s set u = sqrt(k/2 -1), v = sqrt(k/3 -1), w = sqrt(k/4 -1). Then, the first equation is:\n\nab + bc + ca =1 \u21d2 uv + vw + wu =1\n\nAdditionally, since:\n\nu\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nv\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nw\u00b2 = (k/4 -1).\n\nTherefore,\n\nk = 2(u\u00b2 +1),\n\nk =3(v\u00b2 +1),\n\nk =4(w\u00b2 +1).\n\nHence,\n\n2(u\u00b2 +1)=3(v\u00b2 +1)=4(w\u00b2 +1),\n\nand uv + vw + wu =1.\n\nHmm, but this seems like going in circles. Perhaps there is a relationship between u, v, w?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that u, v, w are related in some proportion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers? Since we have two equations and three variables, but the problem says there is a unique solution. Hmm, but maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to find k such that the equation involving sqrt terms equals 1. Let me think: perhaps try specific values of k starting from 4 upwards?\n\nSince k must be at least 4. Let me try k=4 first.\n\nIf k=4,\n\nThen,\n\na = sqrt( (4/2 -1) ) = sqrt(2 -1)=1,\n\nb= sqrt( (4/3 -1) )=sqrt(1/3)=1/\u221a3\u22480.577,\n\nc= sqrt( (4/4 -1)=sqrt(1-1)=0. Wait, but then c would be zero, but the problem says positive real numbers. So c has to be positive, so k must be greater than 4? Wait, when k=4, c\u00b2= (4/4)-1=0, so c=0, which is not positive, so k must be greater than 4.\n\nSo next, maybe try k=5?\n\nk=5,\n\na= sqrt(5/2 -1)=sqrt(3/2)=\u22481.2247,\n\nb= sqrt(5/3 -1)=sqrt(2/3)\u22480.816,\n\nc= sqrt(5/4 -1)=sqrt(1/4)=0.5,\n\nThen compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = 1.2247*0.816 \u22481,\n\nbc=0.816*0.5\u22480.408,\n\nca=1.2247*0.5\u22480.612,\n\nTotal \u22481 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02, which is way bigger than 1. So that's too big. Hmm, so maybe k needs to be larger?\n\nWait, but when k increases, how do the variables behave?\n\nLooking at a: as k increases, a increases, since a = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nSimilarly, b increases as k increases,\n\nBut c also increases as k increases. Wait, so all variables a, b, c increase as k increases. Then, the product terms ab, bc, ca would also increase, so their sum would be increasing as k increases. So when k=4, the sum is undefined (since c=0), but just above 4, the sum is already 2.02, which is more than 1. Wait, but we need the sum to be 1. Hmm, that's confusing. So if at k=4, the sum would be approaching sqrt( (2 -1)(1/3 -1) ) but wait, actually, when k approaches 4 from above, c approaches 0, so terms:\n\nab: as k approaches 4 from above,\n\na approaches sqrt( (4/2 -1)=1),\n\nb approaches sqrt( (4/3 -1)=1/\u221a3,\n\nc approaches 0,\n\nSo ab approaches 1*(1/\u221a3)=1/\u221a3\u22480.577,\n\nbc approaches 0,\n\nca approaches 0,\n\nThus, the sum approaches 1/\u221a3\u22480.577 <1,\n\nWait, but when k=4.0001, then c is sqrt( (4.0001/4 -1)=sqrt(0.000025)=approx 0.005,\n\nSo then:\n\na\u2248sqrt(2.00005 -1)=sqrt(1.00005)=\u22481.000025,\n\nb\u2248sqrt( (4.0001/3 -1)=sqrt(1.3333666... -1)=sqrt(0.3333666)=\u22480.57735,\n\nc\u22480.005,\n\nTherefore,\n\nab\u22481.000025 *0.57735\u22480.577,\n\nbc\u22480.57735*0.005\u22480.00288,\n\nca\u22481.000025*0.005\u22480.005,\n\nTotal\u22480.577+0.00288+0.005\u22480.584, still less than 1.\n\nWait, but when k=5 we saw it was 2.02, but that can't be. Wait, there must be some mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on, when k=4, c approaches zero, so the sum approaches ~0.577, which is less than 1, and when k increases to 5, the sum increases to ~2.02? So the function is increasing with k, so maybe there is a unique k between 4 and 5 where the sum equals 1? Wait, but when k approaches 4 from above, the sum approaches ~0.577, and when k increases, the sum increases. So if at k=5, the sum is already 2, then the desired k is between 4 and 5. Hmm, perhaps?\n\nWait, but the problem states that there is a unique triple (a,b,c), so there must be exactly one such k where the sum ab + bc + ca=1. Since the function is continuous and strictly increasing from ~0.577 to infinity as k increases beyond 4, then there must be exactly one k where the sum equals 1. So maybe we can set up an equation in k and solve it numerically?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an algebraic way. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to write the equation again:\n\nsqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] + sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] + sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)] =1\n\nLet me denote terms:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote A = sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)]\n\nB = sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)]\n\nC = sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)]\n\nSo A + B + C =1.\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's a substitution here. Let me think of variables like x = k/12, so that fractions become manageable. Let me try:\n\nLet me set t = k/12. Then, k =12t,\n\nSo,\n\n(k/2 -1)=6t -1,\n\n(k/3 -1)=4t -1,\n\n(k/4 -1)=3t -1,\n\nTherefore,\n\nA = sqrt{(6t -1)(4t -1)},\n\nB = sqrt{(4t -1)(3t -1)},\n\nC = sqrt{(6t -1)(3t -1)},\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt{(6t -1)(4t -1)} + sqrt{(4t -1)(3t -1)} + sqrt{(6t -1)(3t -1)} =1,\n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution is better? Let me see if I can factor terms or find a common variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set u = sqrt{(6t -1)}, v = sqrt{(4t -1)}, w = sqrt{(3t -1)}.\n\nThen,\n\nA = u*v,\n\nB = v*w,\n\nC = u*w,\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nu*v + v*w + u*w =1,\n\nWhich is similar to the original equation, but in terms of u, v, w. However, also we have:\n\nu\u00b2 =6t -1,\n\nv\u00b2=4t -1,\n\nw\u00b2=3t -1,\n\nTherefore,\n\nFrom u\u00b2 =6t -1 \u21d2 t=(u\u00b2 +1)/6,\n\nSimilarly, v\u00b2=4t -1 \u21d2 t=(v\u00b2 +1)/4,\n\nw\u00b2=3t -1 \u21d2 t=(w\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nThus,\n\nSetting equal:\n\n(u\u00b2 +1)/6 = (v\u00b2 +1)/4 = (w\u00b2 +1)/3 = t.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can set (u\u00b2 +1)/6 = (v\u00b2 +1)/4 = (w\u00b2 +1)/3 = t.\n\nSo, similar to the original equations. Therefore, perhaps this substitution leads us back again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation uv + vw + wu =1 and variables related via t. Maybe using substitution in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe suppose that u, v, w are in arithmetic progression or some relation? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such as letting u = v + m, w = v -n, but this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try squaring both sides of the equation. Let me attempt that.\n\nLet me denote S = A + B + C =1,\n\nSo S^2 = (A + B + C)^2 = A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 + 2(AB + BC + CA) =1.\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 + 2(AB + BC + CA) =1.\n\nBut we can compute A\u00b2, B\u00b2, C\u00b2:\n\nA\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1),\n\nB\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nC\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nSimilarly, AB = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} * sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} = (k/3 -1)*sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} = (k/3 -1)*C\n\nWait, but this might get too tangled. Alternatively, compute A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst,\n\nA\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = ( (k\u00b2)/(6) - (k/2 +k/3) +1 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) = (k\u00b2)/(12) - (k/3 +k/4) +1,\n\nC\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)= (k\u00b2)/(8) - (k/2 +k/4) +1,\n\nSo,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = [k\u00b2/6 - (5k/6) +1] + [k\u00b2/12 - (7k/12)+1] + [k\u00b2/8 - (3k/4)+1]\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: k\u00b2/6 - (5k/6) +1\n\nSecond term: k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1\n\nThird term: k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1\n\nAdding them together:\n\nk\u00b2 terms:\n\nk\u00b2/6 + k\u00b2/12 +k\u00b2/8 = let's find common denominator 24:\n\n(4k\u00b2 + 2k\u00b2 +3k\u00b2)/24 = 9k\u00b2/24 = 3k\u00b2/8\n\nk terms:\n\n-5k/6 -7k/12 -3k/4\n\nConvert to 12 denominator:\n\n-10k/12 -7k/12 -9k/12 = (-26k)/12 = -13k/6\n\nConstants:\n\n1 +1 +1 =3\n\nThus total A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 3k\u00b2/8 -13k/6 +3\n\nThen, the equation S\u00b2 = A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 +2(AB + BC + CA) =1,\n\nBut S\u00b2 is 1, so:\n\n3k\u00b2/8 -13k/6 +3 + 2(AB + BC + CA) =1,\n\nBut AB + BC + CA = ?\n\nHmm, this approach might not be helpful as we still have the AB + BC + CA term. Maybe this isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going back to the substitution with t = k/12.\n\nLet me try plugging in t such that:\n\nsqrt{(6t -1)(4t -1)} + sqrt{(4t -1)(3t -1)} + sqrt{(6t -1)(3t -1)} =1,\n\nLet me set t as variable and see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me denote x = sqrt{(6t -1)(4t -1)} + sqrt{(4t -1)(3t -1)} + sqrt{(6t -1)(3t -1)} =1,\n\nHmm, maybe let\u2019s denote each sqrt term as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set term1 = sqrt{(6t -1)(4t -1)} = sqrt{(24t\u00b2 -10t +1)}.\n\nSimilarly, term2 = sqrt{(4t -1)(3t -1)} = sqrt{(12t\u00b2 -7t +1)}.\n\nterm3 = sqrt{(6t -1)(3t -1)} = sqrt{(18t\u00b2 -9t +1)}.\n\nHmm, so the equation becomes term1 + term2 + term3 =1.\n\nThis still looks complex, but maybe squaring both sides?\n\nLet me denote S = term1 + term2 + term3 =1,\n\nThen S\u00b2 = (term1 + term2 + term3)^2 = term1\u00b2 + term2\u00b2 + term3\u00b2 + 2(term1 term2 + term1 term3 + term2 term3) =1\u00b2=1.\n\nWe can compute term1\u00b2, term2\u00b2, term3\u00b2:\n\nterm1\u00b2 = (6t -1)(4t -1) =24t\u00b2 -10t +1,\n\nterm2\u00b2 = (4t-1)(3t-1)=12t\u00b2 -7t +1,\n\nterm3\u00b2 = (6t -1)(3t -1)=18t\u00b2 -9t +1,\n\nSo,\n\nSum of squares:\n\n24t\u00b2 -10t +1 +12t\u00b2 -7t +1 +18t\u00b2 -9t +1 =\n\n(24+12+18)t\u00b2 + (-10-7-9)t + (1+1+1) =\n\n54t\u00b2 -26t +3.\n\nThen, the cross terms:\n\n2(term1 term2 + term1 term3 + term2 term3).\n\nCompute term1 term2:\n\nsqrt{(6t-1)(4t-1)} * sqrt{(4t-1)(3t-1)} = (4t-1)*sqrt{(6t-1)(3t-1)}.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nterm1 term3 = sqrt{(6t-1)(4t-1)} * sqrt{(6t-1)(3t-1)} = (6t-1)*sqrt{(4t-1)(3t-1)}.\n\nterm2 term3 = sqrt{(4t-1)(3t-1)} * sqrt{(6t-1)(3t-1)} = (3t-1)*sqrt{(4t-1)(6t-1)}.\n\nHmm, this is getting even more complicated. Maybe this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to assume that the variables a, b, c are proportional to certain numbers. Since the problem says the triple is unique, maybe there is some symmetry or the variables relate in a way that can be guessed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider substituting variables such that x = a, y = b, z = c, and use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe make the substitution that since the expressions 2(a\u00b2 +1), etc., are equal to k, so perhaps set variables such that a = tan A, b = tan B, c = tan C for some angles? Since tan^2 +1 = sec^2, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, 2(a\u00b2 +1) =k \u21d2 a\u00b2 +1 =k/2 \u21d2 if I set a = tan\u03b8, then sec\u00b2\u03b8 = k/2 \u21d2 tan\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = sec\u00b2\u03b8 =k/2 \u21d2 so sec\u03b8 = sqrt(k/2). Hmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of a, b, c as sides of a triangle or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if I set variables as follows: Let\u2019s set a = tan \u03b1, b = tan \u03b2, c = tan \u03b3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the first equations as hyperbola equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables in terms of reciprocal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem is symmetric in a, b, c in some way, but the coefficients 2,3,4 are different, so symmetry is broken.\n\nAlternatively, try to let\u2019s set variables such that u = a^2, v = b^2, w = c^2, then equations become:\n\n2(u +1) =3(v +1)=4(w +1)=k,\n\nand sqrt(uv) + sqrt(vw) + sqrt(wu)=1,\n\nHmm, but still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since 2(u +1)=3(v +1)=4(w +1)=k,\n\nWe can write u=(k/2)-1,\n\nv=(k/3)-1,\n\nw=(k/4)-1,\n\nThus, the second equation becomes sqrt[( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) ] + sqrt[ ( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) ] + sqrt[ ( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) ) ] =1,\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if we let\u2019s set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set x = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\ny = sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nz = sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nThen, the second equation is xy + yz + zx =1,\n\nAnd also,\n\nx\u00b2 = k/2 -1,\n\ny\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nz\u00b2 =k/4 -1,\n\nSo, let\u2019s solve for k in terms of x,y,z,\n\nFrom x\u00b2 =k/2 -1 \u21d2k=2x\u00b2 +2,\n\nSimilarly, k=3y\u00b2 +3,\n\nk=4z\u00b2 +4,\n\nThus,\n\n2x\u00b2 +2 =3y\u00b2 +3 \u21d22x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1,\n\n3y\u00b2 +3 =4z\u00b2 +4 \u21d23y\u00b2 -4z\u00b2 =1,\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\n2. y\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\n3. z\u00b2 = (k/4 -1),\n\nand\n\n4. 2x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1,\n\n5. 3y\u00b2 -4z\u00b2 =1,\n\n6. xy + yz + zx =1,\n\nHmm, perhaps using equations 4 and 5 to express variables in terms of y?\n\nFrom equation 4: 2x\u00b2 =3y\u00b2 +1 \u21d2x\u00b2=(3y\u00b2+1)/2,\n\nFrom equation5: 3y\u00b2 =4z\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 z\u00b2=(3y\u00b2 -1)/4,\n\nSo, substituting into equation6,\n\nxy + yz + zx =1,\n\nBut x= sqrt( (3y\u00b2 +1)/2 ), z= sqrt( (3y\u00b2 -1)/4 ) = (1/2)sqrt(3y\u00b2 -1),\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (3y\u00b2 +1)/2 ) * y + y * (1/2)sqrt(3y\u00b2 -1) + sqrt( (3y\u00b2 +1)/2 )*(1/2)sqrt(3y\u00b2 -1) =1\n\nLet me denote t = y\u00b2,\n\nThen, sqrt( (3t +1)/2 ) * sqrt(t) + sqrt(t)*(1/2)*sqrt(3t -1) + sqrt( (3t +1)/2 )* (1/2)sqrt(3t -1) =1\n\nLet me factor out terms:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(t*(3t +1)/2 )\n\nSecond term: (1/2)*sqrt(t*(3t -1))\n\nThird term: (1/2)*sqrt( (3t +1)(3t -1)/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps let me compute each term separately.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (3t\u00b2 + t)/2 )\n\nSecond term: (1/2)sqrt(3t\u00b2 -t )\n\nThird term: (1/2)sqrt( (9t\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nHmm, not sure.

Maybe I can consider the equation ab + bc + ca =1 in terms of these.\n\nLet me write ab = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)}.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set x = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} =1,\n\nLet me make substitution variables such that:\n\nLet\u2019s set p = sqrt{(k/2 -1)}, q = sqrt{(k/3 -1)}, r = sqrt{(k/4 -1)}.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\npq + qr + rp =1,\n\nAlso, note that:\n\np^2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nq^2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nr^2 = (k/4 -1),\n\nThus,\n\nFrom p^2 = (k/2 -1) \u21d2k = 2(p^2 +1),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nk =3(q^2 +1),\n\nk=4(r^2 +1),\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(p^2 +1)=3(q^2 +1)=4(r^2 +1).\n\nSo, the relationships between p, q, r are:\n\n2p\u00b2 +2 = 3q\u00b2 +3 \u21d22p\u00b2 -3q\u00b2 =1,\n\n3q\u00b2 +3 =4r\u00b2 +4 \u21d23q\u00b2 -4r\u00b2 =1,\n\nSo, this is similar to previous equations.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to solving for p, q, r such that:\n\npq + qr + rp =1,\n\n2p\u00b2 -3q\u00b2 =1,\n\n3q\u00b2 -4r\u00b2 =1,\n\nMaybe we can solve this system.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFrom the second equation: 2p\u00b2 =3q\u00b2 +1,\n\nThird equation:3q\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1,\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n2p\u00b2 = (4r\u00b2 +1) +1 =4r\u00b2 +2 \u21d2 p\u00b2=2r\u00b2 +1,\n\nThus, p= sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1),\n\nAlso from the third equation, q\u00b2=(4r\u00b2 +1)/3 \u21d2 q= sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nNow, substituting p and q in terms of r into the first equation: pq + qr + rp =1,\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\npq = sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nqr = sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ) * r,\n\nrp = r * sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1),\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (2r\u00b2 +1)(4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 )*r + r*sqrt(2r\u00b2 +1) =1,\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated, but perhaps set variable substitution s = r\u00b2,\n\nLet\u2019s let s = r\u00b2,\n\nThen, r = sqrt(s),\n\nSo,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (2s +1)(4s +1)/3 ),\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (4s +1)/3 ) * sqrt(s) = sqrt( s(4s +1)/3 ),\n\nThird term: sqrt(s)*sqrt(2s +1) = sqrt( s(2s +1) ),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( (2s +1)(4s +1)/3 ) + sqrt( s(4s +1)/3 ) + sqrt( s(2s +1) ) =1,\n\nThis equation in terms of s needs to be solved.\n\nPerhaps trying to find s numerically.\n\nLet me try s=0.25,\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (0.5 +1)(1 +1)/3 )=sqrt(1.5*2/3)=sqrt(1)=1,\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.25*(1 +1)/3)=sqrt(0.5/3)=sqrt(0.1667)=\u22480.408,\n\nThird term:sqrt(0.25*(0.5 +1))=sqrt(0.25*1.5)=sqrt(0.375)=\u22480.612,\n\nTotal\u22481 +0.408+0.612\u22482.02, too big.\n\nWait, but s=0.25 corresponds to r=0.5,\n\nThen k=4(r\u00b2 +1)=4*(0.25+1)=5, which was our previous case.\n\nHmm, trying s=0.1,\n\nr=0.316,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (0.2 +1)(0.4 +1)/3 )=sqrt(1.2*1.4/3)=sqrt(1.68/3)=sqrt(0.56)=\u22480.748,\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.1*(0.4 +1)/3)=sqrt(0.1*1.4/3)=sqrt(0.14/3)=\u22480.208,\n\nThird term:sqrt(0.1*(0.2 +1))=sqrt(0.1*1.2)=sqrt(0.12)=\u22480.346,\n\nTotal\u22480.748+0.208+0.346\u22481.302,\n\nStill too big.\n\nTry s=0.05,\n\nr\u22480.2236,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (0.1+1)(0.2 +1)/3)=sqrt(1.1*1.2/3)=sqrt(1.32/3)=sqrt(0.44)=\u22480.663,\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.05*(0.2 +1)/3)=sqrt(0.05*1.2/3)=sqrt(0.06/3)=sqrt(0.02)=\u22480.141,\n\nThird term:sqrt(0.05*(0.1 +1))=sqrt(0.05*1.1)=sqrt(0.055)=\u22480.234,\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038, same as before when s=0.05 corresponds to r\u22480.2236, which is u=1.2.\n\nHmm, so s=0.05 gives total\u22481.038.\n\nTry s=0.04,\n\nr=0.2,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (0.08+1)(0.16 +1)/3)=sqrt(1.08*1.16/3)=sqrt(1.2528/3)=sqrt(0.4176)=\u22480.646,\n\nSecond term: sqrt(0.04*(0.16+1)/3)=sqrt(0.04*1.16/3)=sqrt(0.0464/3)=\u2248sqrt(0.0155)=\u22480.124,\n\nThird term:sqrt(0.04*(0.08+1))=sqrt(0.04*1.08)=sqrt(0.0432)=\u22480.208,\n\nTotal\u22480.646+0.124+0.208\u22480.978,\n\nHmm, so between s=0.04 and s=0.05, the total crosses 1.\n\nLet me try s=0.045,\n\nr\u22480.2121,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (0.09 +1)(0.18 +1)/3 )=sqrt(1.09*1.18/3)=sqrt(1.2862/3)=sqrt\u22480.4287\u22480.655,\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt(0.045*(0.18+1)/3)=sqrt(0.045*1.18/3)=sqrt(0.0531/3)=sqrt\u22480.0177\u22480.133,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt(0.045*(0.09+1))=sqrt(0.045*1.09)=sqrt\u22480.04905\u22480.221,\n\nTotal\u22480.655+0.133+0.221\u22481.009, close to 1.\n\nTry s=0.044,\n\nr\u22480.2098,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (0.088+1)(0.176+1)/3)=sqrt(1.088*1.176/3)=sqrt\u22481.278/3\u22480.426\u22480.653,\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt(0.044*(0.176+1)/3)=sqrt(0.044*1.176/3)=sqrt(0.0517/3)=\u2248sqrt(0.0172)=\u22480.131,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt(0.044*(0.088+1))=sqrt(0.044*1.088)=sqrt(0.04787)=\u22480.219,\n\nTotal\u22480.653+0.131+0.219\u22481.003,\n\nVery close.

So m\u22480.18 \u21d2k=4.18,\n\nTherefore, the approximate value of a+b+c is sqrt{(k/2 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/4 -1)}.\n\nWith k\u22484.18,\n\na = sqrt(4.18/2 -1)=sqrt(2.09 -1)=sqrt(1.09)=\u22481.044,\n\nb = sqrt(4.18/3 -1)=sqrt(1.393 -1)=sqrt(0.393)=\u22480.627,\n\nc= sqrt(4.18/4 -1)=sqrt(1.045 -1)=sqrt(0.045)=\u22480.212,\n\nThus, sum\u22481.044+0.627+0.212\u22481.883,\n\nHmm, but the problem says to compute a+b+c and put it in a box. Since the problem states it's a unique triple, there must be an exact answer. Perhaps this is a Pythagorean triple or some rational numbers?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose that variables are fractions such that the expressions under the square roots are squares.\n\nSuppose that (k/2 -1)= (p/q)^2,\n\nSimilarly for others, but this might require k to be a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt(3) or sqrt(2) plus something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 2, but with approximate 1.88, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think that a, b, c are 1, 1/\u221a3, 0. But that gives ab + bc + ca=1*1/\u221a3 +0 +0\u22480.577 <1.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the answer is sqrt(3), but not sure.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Compute a+b+c\". Maybe the exact value can be found by noting that (a+b+c)^2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab+bc+ca). We know ab+bc+ca=1, so if we can find a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2, then we can compute (a+b+c)^2.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nThen,\n\nS\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nWe know ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2*1 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) +2,\n\nSo, if we can find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2,\n\nWe can find S.\n\nNow, from the first set of equations,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) =k \u21d2a\u00b2 = (k/2) -1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3) -1,\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4) -1,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)+(k/3 -1)+(k/4 -1)= (k/2 +k/3 +k/4) -3,\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nk/2 +k/3 +k/4 = (6k +4k +3k)/12 =13k/12,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =13k/12 -3,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (13k/12 -3) +2 =13k/12 -1,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 = (13k/12) -1,\n\nSo if I can find k, I can compute S.\n\nThus, if I can compute k, then S is known.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, the approximate value of k is around4.18,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2\u2248(13*4.18)/12 -1\u2248(54.34)/12 -1\u22484.528 -1\u22483.528,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u2248sqrt(3.528)=\u22481.879,\n\nWhich matches the approximate value.\n\nBut since the problem states it is a unique solution, perhaps there is an exact value for k.\n\nLet me consider that maybe the equation can be solved exactly.\n\nRecall the equation:\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} =1,\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set x = k/12,\n\nThen,\n\nk =12x,\n\nThus,\n\nk/2 =6x,\n\nk/3=4x,\n\nk/4=3x,\n\nThus,\n\n(k/2 -1)=6x -1,\n\n(k/3 -1)=4x -1,\n\n(k/4 -1)=3x -1,\n\nThus,\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nsqrt{(6x-1)(4x-1)} + sqrt{(4x-1)(3x-1)} + sqrt{(6x-1)(3x-1)} =1,\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\nsqrt{(6x-1)(4x-1)} + sqrt{(4x-1)(3x-1)} + sqrt{(6x-1)(3x-1)} =1.\n\nThis equation in terms of x needs to be solved.\n\nLet me suppose that x is a rational

k=  12*(sqrt(3)/something), but I can't see it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an algebraic way to find the exact value.\n\nLet me consider squaring both sides of the equation:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set S = sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) + sqrt(C) =1,\n\nWhere,\n\nA = (6x-1)(4x-1),\n\nB = (4x-1)(3x-1),\n\nC = (6x-1)(3x-1),\n\nThen, S^2 = A + B + C + 2(sqrt(AB) + sqrt(AC) + sqrt(BC)) =1,\n\nBut this will lead to a very complicated equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) + sqrt(C)=1,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(A)=p, sqrt(B)=q, sqrt(C)=r,\n\nThen p+q+r=1,\n\nAnd,\n\np\u00b2 = (6x-1)(4x-1),\n\nq\u00b2 = (4x-1)(3x-1),\n\nr\u00b2 = (6x-1)(3x-1),\n\nNotice that p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (6x-1)(4x-1)+(4x-1)(3x-1)+(6x-1)(3x-1),\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nExpand each

-26x +3,\n\nAnd,\n\nThe equation S^2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2(pq + pr + qr)=1,\n\nBut pq = sqrt{A B}= sqrt{(6x-1)^2 (4x-1)^2 (3x-1)} ?\n\nWait, pq = sqrt{A B} = sqrt{(6x-1)(4x-1)*(4x-1)(3x-1)} = (4x-1)sqrt{(6x-1)(3x-1)} = (4x-1)r,\n\nSimilarly,\n\npr = sqrt{A C}= sqrt{(6x-1)(4x-1)*(6x-1)(3x-1)} = (6x-1)sqrt{(4x-1)(3x-1)} = (6x-1)q,\n\nqr = sqrt{B C}= sqrt{(4x-1)(3x-1)*(6x-1)(3x-1)}= (3x-1)sqrt{(6x-1)(4x-1)}= (3x-1)p,\n\nThus,\n\npq + pr + qr = (4x-1)r + (6x-1)q + (3x-1)p,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 = (54x\u00b2\u221226x+3) + 2[(4x\u22121)r + (6x\u22121)q + (3x\u22121)p] =1,\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach isn't feasible. Given that the problem states the solution is unique and requires an exact answer, I might have to consider that the approximate value is actually sqrt(2) + something, but my approximate value is around 1.88, which is close to sqrt(3.54), but not a clean number.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 2, but my approximate is 1.88. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is sqrt(3)? Approximately 1.732, which is lower. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt( (13k/12) -1 ). If we can express k in terms of the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that the answer is 2, but I have to see.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following:\n\nLet me assume that a + b + c = S,\n\nWe have S\u00b2 = 13k/12 -1,\n\nFrom earlier,\n\nSo if I can find k,\n\nWe can compute S.\n\nBut since the problem says to compute a + b + c, perhaps there is a clever substitution or identity that allows us to find S directly.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equations are similar to the equations for a triangle with sides related to a, b, c, but I don't see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the system is symmetric in a way that allows substitution.\n\nLet me try to set variables such that:\n\nLet me set a = 2p,\n\nb = sqrt(3) q,\n\nc = 2r,\n\nThen, maybe the equations become manageable?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem is from a competition, so maybe the answer is a small rational number or sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+1 or something, but my approximate is around 1.88, which is roughly 1.88, which is close to sqrt(3.53), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nSuppose that the three terms in the equation:\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} =1,\n\nAre each fractions that add up to 1.\n\nFor instance, if each term is 1/3,\n\nBut then 1/3 +1/3 +1/3=1,\n\nSo set each sqrt term to 1/3,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)}=1/3,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nsqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)}=1/3,\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)}=1/3,\n\nThen,\n\n(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)=1/9,\n\n(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)=1/9,\n\n(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)=1/9,\n\nThus,\n\nFirst and second equations,\n\n(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nCancel (k/3 -1) from both sides (assuming it's non-zero),\n\nThus,\n\n(k/2 -1) = (k/4 -1),\n\nWhich implies k/2 -1 =k/4 -1 \u21d2k/2 =k/4 \u21d2k=0, which is impossible.\n\nThus, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps two terms equal and the third different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the problem requires solving numerically and the answer is approximately 1.88, but since it's a math competition problem, there must be an exact value.\n\nWait, perhaps there is an elegant substitution I haven't considered.\n\nLet me revisit the original equations:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nand ab + bc + ca=1.\n\nLet me denote the three expressions as equal to k,\n\nThus:\n\na = sqrt( (k/2) -1 ),\n\nb = sqrt( (k/3) -1 ),\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4) -1 ).\n\nThen,\n\nab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider substituting variables:\n\nLet me set x = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\ny = sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nz = sqrt(k/4 -1).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nxy + yz + zx =1,\n\nand,\n\nx\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\ny\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nz\u00b2 =k/4 -1.\n\nLet me consider that these three equations for x,y,z must be compatible.\n\nLet me add the three equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)+(k/3 -1)+(k/4 -1)= (k/2 +k/3 +k/4) -3,\n\nAs before, this is equal to 13k/12 -3,\n\nAlso, we have the equation xy + yz + zx =1,\n\nThus, (x + y + z)^2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) = (13k/12 -3) + 2*1 =13k/12 -1,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 =13k/12 -1,\n\nBut x + y + z is exactly a + b + c, which we need to find.\n\nLet me also note that,\n\nFrom the expressions for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2,\n\nWe can express k in terms of each variable:\n\nk =2(x\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=3(y\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=4(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1),\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nThus,\n\nFrom first equality,\n\n2x\u00b2 +2 =3y\u00b2 +3 \u21d22x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1,\n\nFrom second

=1,\n\nand,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 =13k/12 -1,\n\nBut since k=2(x\u00b2 +1),\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 =13*(2(x\u00b2 +1))/12 -1= (26x\u00b2 +26)/12 -1= (13x\u00b2 +13)/6 -1= (13x\u00b2 +13 -6)/6= (13x\u00b2 +7)/6,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 = (13x\u00b2 +7)/6,\n\nHmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express y and z in terms of x from the first two equations.\n\nFrom first equation:2x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1 \u21d2 y\u00b2=(2x\u00b2 -1)/3,\n\nFrom second equation:x\u00b2 -2z\u00b2=1 \u21d2 z\u00b2=(x\u00b2-1)/2,\n\nThus,\n\ny= sqrt( (2x\u00b2-1)/3 ),\n\nz= sqrt( (x\u00b2-1)/2 ),\n\nNow, the equation xy + yz + zx =1,\n\nSubstitute y and z:\n\nx * sqrt( (2x\u00b2-1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2x\u00b2-1)/3 )* sqrt( (x\u00b2-1)/2 ) + sqrt( (x\u00b2-1)/2 )*x =1,\n\nLet me denote this equation in terms of x:\n\nLet me write each term:\n\nFirst term: x * sqrt{(2x\u00b2-1)/3},\n\nSecond term: sqrt{(2x\u00b2-1)/3} * sqrt{(x\u00b2-1)/2} = sqrt{ (2x\u00b2-1)(x\u00b2-1)/6 },\n\nThird term: x * sqrt{(x\u00b2-1)/2},\n\nThus,\n\nEquation:\n\nx * sqrt{(2x\u00b2-1)/3} + sqrt{ (2x\u00b2-1)(x\u00b2-1)/6 } +x * sqrt{(x\u00b2-1)/2} =1,\n\nThis equation in x might be solvable.\n\nLet me make substitution t = x\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: sqrt(t) * sqrt{(2t-1)/3} = sqrt{ t(2t-1)/3 },\n\nSecond term: sqrt{ (2t-1)(t-1)/6 },\n\nThird term: sqrt(t) * sqrt{(t-1)/2} = sqrt{ t(t-1)/2 },\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt{ (2t\u00b2 -t)/3 } + sqrt{ (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 } + sqrt{ (t\u00b2 -t)/2 } =1,\n\nThis is still complex, but perhaps try to find a value of t that makes terms

1.88, but since the problem asks for an exact answer, perhaps there is a trick I missed.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in my initial equations.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem:\n\nThe equations are 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1),\n\nLet me denote them all equal to k,\n\nThen,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) =k \u21d2a\u00b2 = (k/2) -1,\n\n3(b\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2b\u00b2=(k/3) -1,\n\n4(c\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2c\u00b2=(k/4) -1,\n\nThus, a, b, c are positive real numbers, so each of the expressions under the roots must be positive,\n\nThus,\n\nk/2 >1 \u21d2k>2,\n\nk/3>1 \u21d2k>3,\n\nk/4>1 \u21d2k>4,\n\nThus, k must be greater than4.\n\nNow, the second equation is ab + bc + ca=1,\n\nLet me consider that a, b, c are positive, so each term is positive.\n\nLet me consider that the minimal possible value of ab + bc + ca occurs when k is minimal (approaching4 from above), where it approaches\u22480.577, and increases as k increases.\n\nThus, since it's given that there is a unique solution, there must be exactly one k where the sum equals 1, and the corresponding a + b + c is the required answer.\n\nSince the problem is likely from a competition, perhaps the answer is a rational number expressed as sqrt(3), but my approximation suggests otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact value is \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\nBut my approximate is\u22481.88, and sqrt(3)\u22481.732.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the three terms in the equation sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} =1,\n\nLet me set each term as follows:\n\nLet me set:\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} = a,\n\nsqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} = b,\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} = c,\n\nThen, a + b + c =1,\n\nAlso, note that:\n\na * b * c = sqrt{(k/2 -1)^2 (k/3 -1)^2 (k/4 -1)^2} = [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)]^(3/2),\n\nBut this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are related such that (k/2 -1)=2t,\n\n(k/3 -1)=t,\n\n(k/4 -1)=0.5t,\n\nThen,\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that (k/2 -1)=2t,\n\n(k/3 -1)=t,\n\n(k/4 -1)=0.5t,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom first and second equation,\n\n2t = (k/2 -1),\n\nt = (k/3 -1),\n\nThus,\n\n2*(k/3 -1) =k/2 -1 \u21d22k/3 -2 =k/2 -1 \u21d2Multiply by6:\n\n4k -12 =3k -6 \u21d2k=6,\n\nThen,\n\n(k/2 -1)=3-1=2,\n\n(k/3 -1)=2-1=1,\n\n(k/4 -1)=1.5-1=0.5,\n\nThus,\n\nThe terms:\n\nsqrt{2*1}=sqrt(2),\n\nsqrt{1*0.5}=sqrt(0.5),\n\nsqrt{2*0.5}=sqrt(1)=1,\n\nThus total sqrt(2)+sqrt(0.5)+1\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121\u22601,\n\nThus, this assumption doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set (k/2 -1)= (k/3 -1) + (k/4 -1),\n\nThus,\n\nk/2 -1 =k/3 -1 +k/4 -1 \u21d2k/2= k/3 +k/4 -1 \u21d2k/2 -7k/12 = -1 \u21d2(6k -7k)/12 =-1 \u21d2-k/12 =-1 \u21d2k=12,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt(6-1)=sqrt(5),\n\nb=sqrt(4-1)=sqrt(3),\n\nc=sqrt(3-1)=sqrt(2),\n\nThen,\n\nab + bc + ca= sqrt(15)+sqrt(6)+sqrt(10)=\u22483.872+2.449+3.162\u22489.483\u22601,\n\nThus, no.\n\nHmm.\n\nGiven that I cannot find an exact solution through algebraic means and the problem requires an exact answer, I suspect that the answer is indeed the square root of the expression involving k, but since we can't solve for k exactly, perhaps the problem is designed so that a + b + c is 2, but my approximate is 1.88.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an elegant solution using substitution I missed.\n\nWait, let me try to set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set a = tan \u03b1,\n\nb = tan \u03b2,\n\nc = tan \u03b3,\n\nThen, 2(a\u00b2 +1) =2(sec\u00b2 \u03b1)=k,\n\nThus, sec\u00b2 \u03b1 =k/2 \u21d2cos \u03b1= sqrt(2/k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3(sec\u00b2 \u03b2)=k \u21d2cos \u03b2=sqrt(3/k),\n\n4(sec\u00b2 \u03b3)=k \u21d2cos \u03b3=sqrt(4/k),\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nb= sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nc= sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nWhich matches previous substitutions.\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca=1,\n\nBut I don't see a trigonometric identity here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are related in a triangle,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using hyperbolic functions,\n\nBut this seems too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the variables a, b, c are the sides of a triangle,\n\nBut not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the system can be transformed into a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nLet me denote the terms:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set u = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} = ab,\n\nv = sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} = bc,\n\nw = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} = ca,\n\nThus,\n\nu + v + w =1,\n\nAlso,\n\nu\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1),\n\nv\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nw\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nAdditionally, note that,\n\nu * w = [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)]^{1/2} * [(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)]^{1/2} = (k/2 -1) sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} = (k/2 -1)*v,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nu*v = (k/3 -1)* sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} = (k/3 -1)*w,\n\nv*w = (k/4 -1)* sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} = (k/4 -1)*u,\n\nThus,\n\nThe products relate to the variables,\n\nBut it's still complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the following:\n\nLet me note that the product of all three terms (u*v*w):\n\nu*v*w = sqrt{(k/2 -1)^2 (k/3 -1)^2 (k/4 -1)^2} = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires assuming that a + b + c is the required answer, and given the options, the closest is sqrt(3),\n\nBut since my approximate is 1.88, which is close to sqrt(3.53), which is approximately 1.88,\n\nThus, maybe the answer is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), where k is the solution,\n\nBut since we can\u2019t write that, maybe the problem's exact answer is 2,\n\nBut I can't see why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2, and my approximations were wrong.\n\nWait, let me try k= 8,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt(4-1)=sqrt(3),\n\nb=sqrt(8/3 -1)=sqrt(5/3),\n\nc= sqrt(2-1)=1,\n\nab + bc + ca= sqrt(3)*sqrt(5/3) + sqrt(5/3)*1 + sqrt(3)*1,\n\n= sqrt(5) + sqrt(5/3)+sqrt(3),\n\n\u22482.236 +1.291 +1.732\u22485.259\u22601,\n\nNo.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt(2) +1\u22482.414,\n\nBut my approximation was lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt( (a + b + c)^2 )= sqrt(13k/12 -1),\n\nBut unless we can find k,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a specific competition and the answer is 2,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the use of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nConsider maximizing or minimizing a + b + c under the given constraints,\n\nBut since it's given that there's a unique solution, maybe the minimum or maximum,\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following:\n\nLet me consider that the three equations can be combined into a single equation.\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet\u2019s denote,\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nThen,\n\nLet me consider the variables:\n\nLet me set x = a,\n\ny = b,\n\nz = c,\n\nThen,\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nand xy + yz +zx=1.\n\nLet me consider expressing variables in terms of k,\n\nThen,\n\na = sqrt{(k/2 -1}),\n\nb = sqrt{(k/3 -1}),\n\nc = sqrt{(k/4 -1}),\n\nThus,\n\nThe sum a + b + c is what we need.\n\nGiven that the problem states the answer is unique, and given the approximate value around 1.88,\n\nPerhaps the exact value is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), which with k\u22484.18,\n\n13*4.18/12 -1\u22483.528,\n\nSqrt(3.528)=approx1.879,\n\nThus, the answer is approximately1.88,\n\nBut the problem requires an exact answer. Since I can't find an exact solution, maybe the problem is designed with an exact value of 2,\n\nBut my calculation shows that it's not 2,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt(3) +1 divided by something,\n\nWait,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt(3) +1,\n\nBut approximate,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3,\n\nBut no,\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Given that I can't find an exact solution and the problem states it's unique, I'll proceed with the approximate answer but in exact form.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Compute a + b + c\".
